Their impacts on nonanthropocentric aspects of the environment, such as ecosystems, biodiversity, carbon reserves, and climate, are often overlooked. Bowman et al. (p. 481 ) review what is known and what is needed to develop a holistic understanding of the role of fire in the Earth system, particularly in view of the pervasive impact of fires and the likelihood that they will become increasingly difficult to control as climate changes."

However, it is still unclear whether dopaminergic neuron activation is sufficient to elicit reward-related behavior and which type of neuronal activity pattern serves this purpose. Tsai et al. (p. 1080; published online 23 April) directly compared tonic versus phasic firing of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area, and the effects on both behavior and dopamine release. Using a transgenic system and virus injection in mice, they targeted the dopaminergic cells with rhodopsin. Light stimulation was then used to drive dopaminergic cells either with a tonic low level of pulses or bursts of high-frequency pulses, with the number of pulses being equal across conditions. Only the high-frequency phasic firing induced a conditioned place preference and dopamine release."

https://openalex.org/W2031790758,"Three signalling molecules cause increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels by triggering release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores due to their action on specific Ca2+-permeable receptors: inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate binds to and opens the sarcoplasmic reticulum InsP3 receptor; cyclic ADP ribose activates the endoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor; but the molecular identity and location of the nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) receptor is unknown. Here Calcraft et al. show that the lysosomal two-pore channel, TPC2, is the molecular target of NAADP. Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores represents an important cell signalling process that is regulated, in mammalian cells, by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), cyclic ADP ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). While the nature of the receptors for InsP3 and cyclic ADP ribose are known, here the lysosomal two-pore channel, TPC2, is shown to be the molecular target of NAADP. Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores represents an important cell signalling process1 that is regulated, in mammalian cells, by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), cyclic ADP ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). InsP3 and cyclic ADP ribose cause the release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum stores by the activation of InsP3 and ryanodine receptors (InsP3Rs and RyRs). In contrast, the nature of the intracellular stores targeted by NAADP and the molecular identity of the NAADP receptors remain controversial1,2, although evidence indicates that NAADP mobilizes Ca2+ from lysosome-related acidic compartments3,4. Here we show that two-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a family of NAADP receptors, with human TPC1 (also known as TPCN1) and chicken TPC3 (TPCN3) being expressed on endosomal membranes, and human TPC2 (TPCN2) on lysosomal membranes when expressed in HEK293 cells. Membranes enriched with TPC2 show high affinity NAADP binding, and TPC2 underpins NAADP-induced Ca2+ release from lysosome-related stores that is subsequently amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release by InsP3Rs. Responses to NAADP were abolished by disrupting the lysosomal proton gradient and by ablating TPC2 expression, but were only attenuated by depleting endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores or by blocking InsP3Rs. Thus, TPCs form NAADP receptors that release Ca2+ from acidic organelles, which can trigger further Ca2+ signals via sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum. TPCs therefore provide new insights into the regulation and organization of Ca2+ signals in animal cells, and will advance our understanding of the physiological role of NAADP."
https://openalex.org/W1905940307,"The mobility of the lithosphere over a weaker asthenosphere constitutes the essential element of plate tectonics, and thus the understanding of the processes at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is fundamental to understand how our planet works. It is especially so for oceanic plates because their relatively simple creation and evolution should enable easy elucidation of the LAB. Data from borehole broadband ocean bottom seismometers show that the LAB beneath the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates is sharp and age-dependent. The observed large shear wave velocity reduction at the LAB requires a partially molten asthenosphere consisting of horizontal melt-rich layers embedded in meltless mantle, which accounts for the large viscosity contrast at the LAB that facilitates horizontal plate motions."
https://openalex.org/W2059805184,"In nature, tiny amounts of inorganic impurities, such as metals, are incorporated in the protein structures of some biomaterials and lead to unusual mechanical properties of those materials. A desire to produce these biomimicking new materials has stimulated materials scientists, and diverse approaches have been attempted. In contrast, research to improve the mechanical properties of biomaterials themselves by direct metal incorporation into inner protein structures has rarely been tried because of the difficulty of developing a method that can infiltrate metals into biomaterials, resulting in a metal-incorporated protein matrix. We demonstrated that metals can be intentionally infiltrated into inner protein structures of biomaterials through multiple pulsed vapor-phase infiltration performed with equipment conventionally used for atomic layer deposition (ALD). We infiltrated zinc (Zn), titanium (Ti), or aluminum (Al), combined with water from corresponding ALD precursors, into spider dragline silks and observed greatly improved toughness of the resulting silks. The presence of the infiltrated metals such as Al or Ti was verified by energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra measured inside the treated silks. This result of enhanced toughness of spider silk could potentially serve as a model for a more general approach to enhance the strength and toughness of other biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W1977889596,"The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary divides the rigid lid from the weaker mantle and is fundamental in plate tectonics. However, its depth and defining mechanism are not well known. We analyzed 15 years of global seismic data using P-to-S (Ps) converted phases and imaged an interface that correlates with tectonic environment, varying from 95 +/- 4 kilometers beneath Precambrian shields and platforms to 81 +/- 2 kilometers beneath tectonically altered regions and 70 +/- 4 kilometers at oceanic island stations. High-frequency Ps observations require a sharp discontinuity; therefore, this interface likely represents a boundary in composition, melting, or anisotropy, not temperature alone. It likely represents the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary under oceans and tectonically altered regions, but it may constitute another boundary in cratonic regions where the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is thought to be much deeper."

https://openalex.org/W2115528692,"Polyphosphate (polyP) occurs ubiquitously in cells, but its functions are poorly understood and its synthesis has only been characterized in bacteria. Using x-ray crystallography, we identified a eukaryotic polyphosphate polymerase within the membrane-integral vacuolar transporter chaperone (VTC) complex. A 2.6 angstrom crystal structure of the catalytic domain grown in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reveals polyP winding through a tunnel-shaped pocket. Nucleotide- and phosphate-bound structures suggest that the enzyme functions by metal-assisted cleavage of the ATP gamma-phosphate, which is then in-line transferred to an acceptor phosphate to form polyP chains. Mutational analysis of the transmembrane domain indicates that VTC may integrate cytoplasmic polymer synthesis with polyP membrane translocation. Identification of the polyP-synthesizing enzyme opens the way to determine the functions of polyP in lower eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2079878922,"p2y5 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that is closely related to the fourth lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor, LPA4. Here we report that p2y5 is a novel LPA receptor coupling to the G13-Rho signaling pathway. ""LPA receptor-null"" RH7777 and B103 cells exogenously expressing p2y5 showed [3H]LPA binding, LPA-induced [35S]guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding, Rho-dependent alternation of cellular morphology, and Gs/13 chimeric protein-mediated cAMP accumulation. LPA-induced contraction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was suppressed by small interfering RNA knockdown of endogenously expressed p2y5. We also found that 2-acyl-LPA had higher activity to p2y5 than 1-acyl-LPA. A recent study has suggested that p2y5 is an LPA receptor essential for human hair growth. We confirmed that p2y5 is a functional LPA receptor and propose to designate this receptor LPA6."
https://openalex.org/W2022149792,"Quantum entangled states can be very delicate and easily perturbed by their external environment. This sensitivity can be harnessed in measurement technology to create a quantum sensor with a capability of outperforming conventional devices at a fundamental level. We compared the magnetic field sensitivity of a classical (unentangled) system with that of a 10-qubit entangled state, realized by nuclei in a highly symmetric molecule. We observed a 9.4-fold quantum enhancement in the sensitivity to an applied field for the entangled system and show that this spin-based approach can scale favorably as compared with approaches in which qubit loss is prevalent. This result demonstrates a method for practical quantum field sensing technology."
https://openalex.org/W2053324328,"Olfactory receptors (ORs) are expressed not only in the sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium, where they detect volatile substances, but also in various other tissues where their potential functions are largely unknown. Here, we report the physiological characterization of human OR51E2, also named prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor (PSGR) due to its reported up-regulation in prostate cancer. We identified androstenone derivatives as ligands for the recombinant receptor. PSGR can also be activated with the odorant beta-ionone. Activation of the endogenous receptor in prostate cancer cells by the identified ligands evoked an intracellular Ca2+ increase. Exposure to beta-ionone resulted in the activation of members of the MAPK family and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our data give support to the hypothesis that because PSGR signaling could reduce growth of prostate cancer cells, specific receptor ligands might therefore be potential candidates for prostate cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2073109412,"Nuclear Import/Export Receptor Nuclear transport receptors constantly shuttle cargo between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes. In the nucleus, RanGTP promotes the dissociation of cargo from importins, which import cargo into the nucleus (where RanGTP is guanosine 5′ triphosphate–bound Ran). Conversely, nuclear RanGTP promotes cargo-binding to exportins, which export cargo from the nucleus. Cargo is released from exportins in the cytoplasm upon hydrolysis of RanGTP. Cytoplasmically assembled RNA splicing components enter the nucleus together with an import adapter snurportin 1 (SPN1), but how then does the import adapter release its cargo and exit the nucleus to collect further cargo? The nuclear exportin CRM1 exports a broad range of substrates—including SPN1, ribosomes, and many regulatory proteins. Monecke et al. (p. 1087 ) describe the crystal structure of CRM1 bound to SPN1 and RanGTP. The structure shows that SPN1 cannot simultaneously bind its import cargo and the exportin CRM1, ensuring that only cargo-free SPN1 is returned to the cytoplasm. There are no direct contacts between Ran and SPN1 in the ternary complex, suggesting that RanGTP promotes cargo-binding through long-range conformational changes in CRM1."

https://openalex.org/W2088874869,"Uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway of complement is thought to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The alternative pathway is continuously activated in the fluid phase, and tissue surfaces require continuous complement inhibition to prevent spontaneous autologous tissue injury. Here, we examined the effects of oxidative stress on the ability of immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) to regulate complement activation on their cell surface. Combined treatment with H2O2 (to induce oxidative stress) and complement-sufficient serum was found to disrupt the barrier function of stable ARPE-19 monolayers as determined by transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements. Neither treatment alone had any effect. TER reduction was correlated with increased cell surface deposition of C3, and could be prevented by using C7-depleted serum, an essential component of the terminal complement pathway. Treatment with H2O2 reduced surface expression of the complement inhibitors DAF, CD55, and CD59, and impaired regulation at the cell surface by factor H present within the serum. Combined treatment of the monolayers with H2O2 and serum elicited polarized secretion of vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF). Both, secretion of VEGF and TER reduction could be attenuated using either an alternative pathway inhibitor or by blocking VEGF receptor-1/2 signaling. Regarded together, these studies demonstrate that oxidative stress reduces regulation of complement on the surface of ARPE-19 cells, increasing complement activation. This sublytic activation results in VEGF release, which mediates disruption of the cell monolayer. These findings link oxidative stress, complement activation, and apical VEGF release, which have all been associated with the pathogenesis of AMD.

Anderson D.H. Johnson L.V. Hageman G.S. Ann. Med. 2006; 38: 450-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Clinically, AMD is categorized as “dry” or “wet.” In the dry form of the disease, deposits (drusen) develop between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the underlying basement membrane (Bruch's membrane). The loss of photoreceptor function and vision observed in patients is attributed to atrophic changes in the RPE (1Gehrs K.M. Anderson D.H. Johnson L.V. Hageman G.S. Ann. Med. 2006; 38: 450-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 2Hogan M.J. Trans. Am. Acad. Ophthalmol. Otolaryngol. 1972; 76: 64-80PubMed Google Scholar). Wet AMD is characterized by choroidal neovascularization extending through Bruch's membrane and the RPE into the subretinal space. Subsequent leakage of exudative fluid and blood is thought to contribute to the eventual development of fibrosis characteristic of wet AMD. AMD is hypothesized to be a progressive disease, with the dry and wet forms likely representing different points on a spectrum of disease severity. Approximately 10–15% of patients with the less severe dry AMD go on to develop wet AMD (1Gehrs K.M. Anderson D.H. Johnson L.V. Hageman G.S. Ann.

Several observations suggest that uncontrolled activation of the complement cascade contributes to the development and progression of AMD. Polymorphisms in complement factor H, a circulating inhibitor of the alternative pathway of complement, are strongly associated with the development of AMD (3Edwards A.O. Ritter 3rd, R. Abel K.J.

Drusen-like lesions also develop in patients with dense deposit disease, a form of glomerulonephritis caused by dysregulation of the alternative pathway (7Duvall-Young J. MacDonald M.K. McKechnie N.M. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1989; 73: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Leys A. Vanrenterghem Y. Van Damme B. Snyers B. Pirson Y. Leys M. Graefes Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 1991; 229: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Analysis of the composition of drusen demonstrates that they contain important complement proteins, including C3, C5, membrane attack complex (MAC), and endogenous complement regulatory proteins (7Duvall-Young J. MacDonald M.K. McKechnie N.M. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1989; 73: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Leys A. Vanrenterghem Y. Van Damme B. Snyers B. Pirson Y. Leys M. Graefes Arch. Clin.

Mice with a genetic deletion of factor H (cfh−/− mice) accumulate C3 throughout the RPE and the outer segment layer of the neuroretina, and lose visual function faster during aging than their wild type littermates (9Coffey P.J. Gias C. McDermott C.J. Lundh P. Pickering M.C. Sethi C. Bird A. Fitzke F.W. Maass A. Chen L.L. Holder G.E. Luthert P.J. Salt T.E. Moss S.E. Greenwood J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 16651-16656Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a murine model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization, blockade of signaling by C3a and C5a reduced the production of VEGF in the eye and reduced neovascularization (10Nozaki M. Raisler B.J. Sakurai E. Sarma J.V. Barnum S.R. Lambris J.D. Chen Y. Zhang K. Ambati B.K. Baffi J.Z. Ambati J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2328-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that in AMD, inadequate control of the alternative pathway 1) contributes to the structural changes observed in RPE and Bruch's membrane, including drusen formation; and 2) is upstream of VEGF-mediated mechanisms. The alternative pathway of complement is continually activated in the fluid phase, and inadequate inhibition of this pathway on tissue surfaces may permit spontaneous complement activation with rapid amplification and generation of pro-inflammatory activation fragments (11Thurman J.M. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In late-onset diseases such as AMD, local regulation of the alternative pathway may gradually be overwhelmed by cellular injury or the accumulation of debris (12Atkinson J.P. Goodship T.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1245-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Elward K. Griffiths M. Mizuno M. Harris C.L. Neal J.W. Morgan B.P. Gasque P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36342-36354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Several environmental factors contribute to a high level of oxidative stress at the RPE layer, and oxidative injury of the RPE cells may be an important cause of AMD (14Cai J. Nelson K.C. Wu M. Sternberg Jr., P. Jones D.P. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that oxidative stress may impair the ability of the RPE to regulate complement on its surface. In the intact adult human eye, only one cell surface complement inhibitor, membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46), has been identified on RPE cells (15Vogt S.D. Barnum S.R. Curcio C.A. Read R.W. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 83: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated whether ARPE-19 cells express the three cell surface complement inhibitors, CD46, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), and CD59; and whether oxidative stress of RPE cells in culture alters surface expression of the complement inhibitory proteins or reduces inhibition of the alternative pathway on the surface of the cells by factor H. Second, we tested the hypothesis that rather than causing cell lysis, sublytic activation of complement on RPE cells induces VEGF release by these cells, which is known to compromise barrier function. The goal of these studies was to construct a model whereby oxidative stress in the eye could be linked to the inflammatory events that cause AMD, including uncontrolled activation of complement. The reagents used in these studies included pooled normal human serum (NHS (Quidel)) as a source of complement proteins. To prevent formation of the terminal complement pathway, C7-depleted serum was used (Quidel), and purified C7 (250 μg/ml; Quidel) was added to the serum in some experiments. Primary antibodies to DAF (Chemicon International), CD59 (Chemicon International), MCP (Monosan), and C3 (ICN Pharmaceuticals) were used. Species-specific secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch and MP Biomedicals, Inc. To block the alternative pathway of complement activation, a targeted inhibitory protein (CR2-fH) was produced as previously described (16Huang Y. Qiao F. Atkinson C. Holers V.M. Tomlinson S. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 8068-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This agent targets the inhibitory domain of factor H to sites of C3d deposition and effectively blocks alternative pathway activation. To block cell surface complement inhibition by factor H, we used a protein referred to as recombinant factor H domains 19–20 (rh-19–20) (17Ferreira V.P. Herbert A.P. Hocking H.G. Barlow P.N. Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6308-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This protein is a recombinant form of the 19th and 20th short consensus repeats of factor H and contains the polyanion and C3b-binding region, but not the N-terminal complement regulatory region of the full-length factor H protein. It competitively blocks interaction of native factor H with cell surfaces, thereby preventing regulation of complement activation and amplification by factor H on those surfaces. The VEGFR-1/2 inhibitor, SU5416 (Chemicon), was used to block the effects of VEGF. SU5416 (Z-3-[(2,4-dimethylpyrrol-5-yl)methylidenyl]-2-indolinone) is a lipophilic synthetic receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which inhibits VEGFR-1/2 by binding to the ATP binding pocket within the kinase domain of the receptor. SU5416 has been shown to inhibit VEGF-dependent endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and in animal models. These experiments were performed using ARPE-19 cells, a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line that displays the differentiated phenotype of RPE cells, and form a polarized monolayer on Transwell filters (Costar) (18Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 19Dunn K.C. Marmorstein A.D. Bonilha V.L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Giordano F. Hjelmeland L.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2744-2749PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F12 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. In some of the experiments the cells were grown as monolayers on Transwell filters. For those experiments, fetal bovine serum was removed completely for the final 5–7 days (2–3 media changes) prior to measurements, which we have previously shown does not alter survival or monolayer formation in these cells (20Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Transepithelial resistance (TER) of the cell monolayer on the Transwell filters was determined by measuring the resistance across the monolayer with an EVOM volt-ohmmeter (World Precision Instruments). The value for cell monolayers was determined by subtracting the TER for filters without cells and then multiplying by the surface area of the filters. Cell monolayers were considered stable when TER was repeatedly measured as ∼40–45 Ω/cm2 (20Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). TER measurements, which are proportional to membrane permeability, are an accepted readout for the barrier function of an RPE monolayer (18Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 20Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, cells were grown on plates or glass slides for ∼2 weeks after the cells reached confluence to mimic the conditions in the Transwell plates. Cells from these long-term cultures were used for flow cytometry (plates) or immunofluorescence microscopy (glass slides). As a model of oxidative stress, stable ARPE-19 cell monolayers were treated with 0.5 mm of H2O2. It has previously been reported that doses of up to 1 mm are not cytotoxic, and do not lead to disruption of barrier function in these cells (21Bailey T.A. Kanuga N. Romero I.A. Greenwood J. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). After treatment with H2O2, monolayers were exposed to 25% NHS as a source of complement proteins. In some experiments NHS was replaced with C7-deficient HS, or the complement system in NHS was inhibited by heat inactivation of NHS (30 min at 52 °C) or by treatment with CR2-fH. VEGF effects through VEGFR-1/2 activation were inhibited by treating the cells with SU5416. Surface expression of the various complement regulatory proteins was examined by flow cytometry. ARPE-19 cells were grown in long-term cultures. The cells were released from the plates by treatment with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc.), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with H2O2 or rH-19–20 as described in the specific experiments. For complement activation experiments, the cells were then incubated in 10% NHS at 37 °C for 1 h. Staining of surface proteins was performed by incubating the cells with primary antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by washing the cells in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubating them with appropriate secondary antibodies when necessary. Cells were then washed and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, run on a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences), and analyzed with CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence was expressed in relative fluorescence units. Surface expression of DAF and CD59 on ARPE-19 cells was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were plated on glass coverslips and grown for 2 weeks after reaching confluence to generate polarized monolayers. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed and permeabilized by immersion in cold acetone/methanol (1:1) for 5 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by treatment of the cells with Superblock (ScyTek Laboratories), followed by incubation with anti-DAF, anti-MCP, anti-CD59, or anti-Na+K+-ATPase antibodies (1:400 for 1 h at 4 °C). The cells were washed, and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibody. As a negative control, primary antibodies were omitted. Staining of the cells was examined using a Nikon T-2000, inverted microscope equipped for confocal microscopy and analyzed with Slidebook 4.2 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) staining of cells on Transwell filters was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) as published previously (22Kunchithapautham K. Rohrer B. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In short, monolayers were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C followed by TUNEL labeling and DNA strand-break visualization with fluorescein. To measure production of VEGF by the cells, cell culture supernatants were concentrated (Amicon Ultra-4, 3000 Da cutoff; Millipore), solubilized in CellLytic MT (mammalian tissue lysis/extraction reagent; Sigma), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Microplates were coated with the VEGF capture antibody (Antigenix America, Inc.) and 100 μl of the concentrated supernatant was added. The captured proteins were detected with the same VEGF-specific antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by development with the chromogenic substrate OPD (Sigma). Product development was assayed by measuring absorbance at 492 nm. Aliquots were assayed in duplicate, and values compared with a VEGF dose-response curve. To measure C5b-9 formed during complement activation, cell supernatants were diluted 1:10 and an ELISA for C5b-9 (Quidel) was performed according the manufacturer's instruction. Cell culture supernatants were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% BisTris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with polyclonal antibody to C3 (ICN Pharmaceuticals) and antibody binding was visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statview software was used for statistical analysis. The Fisher protected least significant difference (PLSD) was used to compare trends over time. Comparison of two conditions was performed using the Student's t test. ARPE-19 cells were grown as monolayers on Transwell filters and TER was monitored until a stable value was achieved. TER of 40–45 Ω/cm2 is the result of the establishment of an epithelial barrier function based on the formation of tight junctions. Changes in TER measurements can then be used to probe for barrier function integrity as an early marker for RPE injury. Exposure of the cells to 25% NHS (as a source of complement proteins) did not alter TER (Fig. 1A). Likewise, exposure of the cells to 0.5 mm H2O2 to induce oxidative stress did not significantly alter TER, confirming previous results by Bailey and co-workers (21Bailey T.A. Kanuga N. Romero I.A. Greenwood J. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, treatment of the cells with 0.5 mm H2O2 and 25% NHS together did cause a significant reduction in TER in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Heat inactivation of the serum to deplete complement activity significantly attenuated the drop in TER induced by exposure of oxidatively stressed cells to serum (p < 0.01). To confirm that the effect of serum was due to complement activation and not some other heat-labile component, C7-depleted serum was used in place of complement-sufficient NHS (Fig. 1B). As with heat inactivation, C7-depleted serum was found to be ineffective in reducing TER, indicating an important role for the membrane attack complex in reducing TER. Addition of purified C7 to the C7-depleted serum restored the ability of the serum to decrease TER, confirming that the lack of effect with the C7-depleted serum was due to the absence of this factor. Application of H2O2 and serum to the apical surface caused a greater change in TER than application to the basal surface (Fig. 1C; p = 0.02), indicating that the apical surface is more susceptible to complement-mediated injury after oxidative stress. Based on TUNEL staining, apoptotic cells were not observed with any of the treatment protocols, including the combined treatment of the cells with H2O2 and serum (Fig. 1D). To induce apoptosis in stable monolayers it was necessary to increase the H2O2 concentration 10-fold. Thus, exposure of oxidatively stressed cells to serum impairs the barrier function of the cellular monolayer, but in this system the drop in TER is not due to direct cytotoxicity. We next sought to determine whether oxidative stress impairs the ability of ARPE-19 cells to regulate complement activation on their surface by performing flow cytometry to measure fixation of C3 activation fragments (such as C3b and C3d) to the cell surface as a marker of complement activation. We found that treatment of ARPE-19 cells with H2O2 caused increased surface C3b/d staining even in the absence of exogenous complement proteins (Fig. 2A). The production and release of complement components by stressed or injured epithelial cells is well described (23Pratt J.R. Basheer S.A. Sacks S.H. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the effects of oxidative stress on complement regulation by cells that are exposed to NHS as a source of complement. Exposure of the cells to 10% NHS for 1 h caused fixation of C3b/d on the cells, but levels of surface C3b/d were higher in cells treated with H2O2 prior to exposure to serum (Fig. 2B). This increase in surface C3b/d was concomitant with a drop in intact C3 levels in the supernatant (Fig. 2C). Levels of intact (∼185 kDa) C3 were reduced by contact with cells previously treated with H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. In other words, oxidative stress of the cells caused increased consumption of intact C3 later added to the supernatant. An ELISA for C5b-9 in cell supernatants confirmed that detectable levels of MAC were formed when serum was exposed to oxidatively stressed cells, but not when the serum was exposed to unmanipulated cells (Fig. 2D). It has previously been shown that the expression of complement regulatory proteins may be reduced on apoptotic and necrotic cells (13Elward K. Griffiths M. Mizuno M. Harris C.L. Neal J.W. Morgan B.P. Gasque P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36342-36354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which could account for the increase in C3b/d binding seen here. C3b/d deposition was compared in viable, apoptotic and necrotic populations identified by forward-scatter and side-scatter, as well as by staining with Annexin V and propidium iodide (data not shown). Increased C3b/d deposition after combined treatment with H2O2 and serum was seen on a population of apoptotic and necrotic cells always present after release of the cells using enzymatic treatment. However, more importantly, surface C3b/d was increased on viable cells, indicating that complement deposition on oxidatively stressed ARPE-19 cells is a result of non-cytotoxic changes to the surface of the cells. The data in Fig. 2 are gated to show C3b/d deposition on viable cells. It has previously been reported, based on immunohistochemistry, that human RPE cells express MCP, whereas DAF and CD59 could not be detected (15Vogt S.D. Barnum S.R. Curcio C.A. Read R.W. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 83: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we identified the presence of all three membrane-bound inhibitors on human ARPE-19 cells, using FACS analysis (Fig. 3). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed together with three-dimensional reconstruction to identify whether surface expression of DAF and CD59 are polarized (Fig. 4). The apical side was verified by labeling with the apical marker Na+K+-ATPase. In unmanipulated, polarized monolayers, DAF and CD59 expression was concentrated on both the apical and basolateral sides; the antibody against CD46 was found to be unsuitable for immunofluorescence.FIGURE 4DAF and CD59 are expressed on the apical and basolateral surface of ARPE-19 cells. Cells were grown to confluence on coverslips. They were then permeabilized and stained for DAF (A), CD59 (B), and Na+K+-ATPase (C). Best focus views of DAF and CD59 demonstrated apical and basolateral localization in the plasma membrane, and three-dimensional reconstructions confirmed apical and basolateral concentration of DAF and CD59 compared with Na+K+-ATPase, which is known to be only apically concentrated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complement activation on oxidatively stressed ARPE-19 cells could be a result of increased local concentrations of complement proteins or activating proteases (11Thurman J.M. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Alternatively, we hypothesized that reduced surface levels of complement regulatory proteins could account for increased complement activation on the cells after treatment with H2O2. Surface levels of DAF decreased after treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 3, A and D) to ∼70% of those seen on unmanipulated cells (p < 0.001); whereas surface levels of MCP did not detectably change on the cells after treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 3B). Measurement of CD59 on unmanipulated cells revealed high and low expressing populations of cells (Fig. 3C). Treatment with H2O2 caused a downward shift in surface CD59 in the high-, but not the low-expressing population of cells. Mean CD59 expression for all cells fell to ∼60% of those on unmanipulated cells (Fig. 3D; p < 0.001). Mechanistically, DAF accelerates the decay of C3 convertases and reduces cleavage of C3 by the classical and alternative pathway of C3 convertases, so reduced levels of DAF are consistent with the observed increases in surface C3b/d deposition (Fig. 2). To further explore this relationship, cells were treated with H2O2 and exposed to serum, stained for both DAF and C3b/d, and examined by FACS analysis. The cells were gated on whether they expressed high or low levels of DAF. C3b/d deposition on the low DAF cells was ∼2.5-fold higher than that on the high DAF cells (Fig. 3E). CD59 inhibits formation of MAC on cell surfaces, but does not inhibit cleavage of C3. As shown in Fig. 1B, MAC formation is necessary for the drop in TER observed after treatment with H2O2 and serum. Hence, reduction in DAF or CD59 would make the RPE cells potentially more vulnerable to complement attack. In addition to the cell surface complement inhibitors, serum factor H may regulate the alternative pathway on ARPE-19 cells (24Pangburn M.K. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine whether factor H contributes to regulation of complement activation on the surface of ARPE-19 cells, we incubated the cells with rH-19–20, a recombinant protein that inhibits factor H activity on cell surfaces by blocking its binding. As shown in Fig. 2, exposure of cells to 10% serum alone leads to C3b/d deposition on the cell surface. The addition of 50 μg of rH-19–20 per ml of serum caused an increase in the amount of C3b/d deposited on the surface of the cells (Fig. 5A). The mean fluorescence with rH-19–20 was on average 40% higher than that in cells without rH-19–20 (n = 3, p < 0.05). These results indicate that under normal conditions, serum-derived factor H limits complement activa"
https://openalex.org/W2032879521,"In Alzheimer disease (AD) mitochondrial abnormalities occur early in the pathogenic process and likely play a significant role in disease progression. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is abnormally processed in AD, and a connection between tau pathology and mitochondrial impairment has been proposed. However, few studies have examined the relationship between pathological forms of tau and mitochondrial dysfunction. We recently demonstrated that inducible expression of tau truncated at Asp-421 to mimic caspase cleavage (T4C3) was toxic to immortalized cortical neurons compared with a full-length tau isoform (T4). In this study we investigated the effects of T4C3 on mitochondrial function. Expression of T4C3 induced mitochondrial fragmentation and elevated oxidative stress levels in comparison with T4-expressing cells. Thapsigargin treatment of T4 or T4C3 cells, which causes an increase in intracellular calcium levels, resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial potential and loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity in T4C3 cells when compared with cells expressing T4. The mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane damage were ameliorated in T4C3 cells by pretreatment with cyclosporine A or FK506, implicating the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in these pathogenic events. Increased calcineurin activity has been reported in AD brain, and thus, inhibition of this phosphatase may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD."

https://openalex.org/W2153191742,"The timing of sea-level change provides important constraints on the mechanisms driving Earth's climate between glacial and interglacial states. Fossil corals constrain the timing of past sea level by their suitability for dating and their growth position close to sea level. The coral-derived age for the last deglaciation is consistent with climate change forced by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHI), but the timing of the penultimate deglaciation is more controversial. We found, by means of uranium/thorium dating of fossil corals, that sea level during the penultimate deglaciation had risen to ~85 meters below the present sea level by 137,000 years ago, and that it fluctuated on a millennial time scale during deglaciation. This indicates that the penultimate deglaciation occurred earlier with respect to NHI than the last deglacial, beginning when NHI was at a minimum."

Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3333) Google Scholar). The mature form of NGF forms a non-covalent homodimer and binds with high affinity (kd ≈ 10−11m) to tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) and with low affinity (kd ≈ 10−9m) to the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (p75 neurotrophin receptor) (2.Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Gene Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). NGF promotes cell survival and growth in cells expressing TrkA through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (3.Grewal S.S.

Cleavage-resistant proNGFhis with apoptotic activity contains multiple amino acid substitutions at −2 and −1 (RR to AA), 118 and 119 (RR to AA), and carries a histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus. This proNGF was expressed in mammalian cells and was purified using nickel column chromatography. ProNGF123 with apoptotic activity is another cleavage-resistant proNGF containing several mutations at −73 and −72 (RR to AA), −43 and −42 (KKRR to KAAR), and −2 and −1 (KR to AA) expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system. ProNGF123 was purified using cation exchange chromatography and immunoaffinity column chromatography. Cleavage-resistant proNGF(R−1G) with neurotrophic activity contains a single amino acid substitution at −1 (Arg to Gly) and carries no tags. This proNGF was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. A fourth cleavage-resistant proNGF (proNGFE) with neurotrophic activity contains two amino acid substitutions at −1 and +1 (RS to AA) but no histidine tag and was expressed in bacteria. Each of these differences may affect the activity of the expressed proteins in such a way that one is apoptotic and the other is neurotrophic. To investigate the determinants of proNGF biological activity, these recombinant proNGFs were expressed in baculovirus, mammalian, or bacterial expression systems and were purified by nickel column, immunoaffinity chromatography, or renaturation from inclusion bodies before testing by several different bioassays.

Neurochem. 2004; 89: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and wild type (empty) baculovirus (BD Biosciences) were expressed in Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection = 0.5 in parallel with proNGFhis expression. All protein expressions were carried out in Sf-900 serum-free medium (Invitrogen) in a 27 °C shaking incubator at 120 rpm, and supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min on day 3 after infection. Prior to use, samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen). Concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (32.Fahnestock M. Yu G. Michalski B. Mathew S. Colquhoun A. Ross G.M. Coughlin M.D. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Values were determined by comparison to a standard curve of purified 2.5S NGF prepared by us from mouse salivary glands (21.Fahnestock M. Michalski B. Xu B. Coughlin M.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34.Mobley W.C. Schenker A. Shooter E.M.

For all experiments, 2.5S NGF and/or cleavable proNGF (WT-NGF) served as a positive control, and conditioned medium from insect cells infected with wild type (empty) baculovirus (WT-baculovirus) was used as a negative control. One day prior to transfection, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were plated at 90% confluence in antibiotic-free minimal essential medium/F11 (Invitrogen) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 containing proNGFhis or WT-NGFhis using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1:2.5. DNA was applied to the cells and incubated for 6 h before changing the medium. The medium was harvested after 24 h. Supernatants harvested from the protein expression systems (baculovirus or mammalian) were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8) at 4 °C overnight. Dialyzed material was bound to nickel beads (Invitrogen) with shaking for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed 4 times with 20 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer, followed by elution with 250 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer. 1.5-ml fractions were collected and fractions containing proNGFhis or WT-NGFhis were pooled. Western blotting using antibodies against both the histidine tag and NGF confirmed the correct size for purified proNGFhis (34 kDa). Samples were dialyzed against RPMI and quantified by NGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described above before use. Cleavage-resistant human recombinant proNGF (proNGFE), carrying two amino acid substitutions and no tag, was expressed in Escherichia coli. Inclusion bodies were isolated from cell pellets, solubilized, and protein was refolded as described (27.Rattenholl A. Lilie H. Grossmann A. Stern A. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33.Clewes O. Fahey M.S. Tyler S.J. Watson J.J. Seok H. Catania C. Cho K. Dawbarn D. Allen S.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 107: 1124-1135PubMed Google Scholar). Refolded protein was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography and eluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m NaCl. The concentration of purified proNGFE was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.6 absorbance units/mg/ml. Molarity was calculated using 26 kDa for the molecular mass of NGF and 49.7 kDa for the molecular mass of proNGFE. Cleavage-resistant mouse proNGF containing several mutations was constructed as previously published (31.Pagadala P.C. Dvorak L.A. Neet K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17939-17943Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and quantified by absorbance at 280 nm. Molarity was calculated using 26 kDa for the molecular mass of NGF and 68 kDa for the molecular mass of proNGF123. ProNGF is prone to cleavage in the presence of serum, and therefore bioassays were carried out using serum-free medium. Mouse superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons from 1-day-old pups were prepared as previously described (32.Fahnestock M. Yu G. Michalski B. Mathew S. Colquhoun A. Ross G.M. Coughlin M.D. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Approximately 3000 SCG cells were cultured in collagen-coated 96-well plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, 0.7% l-glutamine, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, 10−5m uridine (Sigma), and 10−5m 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (Sigma) for 2–4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Attached cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 and then incubated with proNGFhis or 2.5S NGF diluted in serum-free medium (the same medium as above but with 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen) instead of FBS and glutamine) for 36 h. For assays using proNGF123, cells were plated in the same medium with 250 ng/ml cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) instead of uridine and 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine. For unprimed rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12, ATCC), 3 × 104 cells/well were plated in Cell+ 96-well plates (Sarstedt, Montreal, Quebec) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 48 h as described by Greene (36.Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed and then incubated with proNGFhis, WT- NGF, 2.5S NGF or baculovirus-conditioned medium in RPMI, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1% BSA, 0.5% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 30 μm aprotinin (Calbiochem, CA), 100 nm MMP-II inhibitor (Calbiochem), and 30 μm furin inhibitor (decanoyl-RVKR-CMK, Calbiochem) for 48 h. PC12 cells were primed in RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, and 50 ng/ml 2.5S NGF for 11 days as described (32.Fahnestock M. Yu G. Michalski B. Mathew S. Colquhoun A. Ross G.M. Coughlin M.D. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in medium free of serum and NGF and were plated and exposed to neurotrophins as for unprimed PC12s. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice and then were rinsed with PBS and blocked with 3% goat serum in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution (in 1% BSA/PBS) of neuronal anti-βIII-tubulin (TUJ1, Covance, CA) overnight at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, incubated in a 1:100 dilution (in 1% BSA/PBS) of Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Cedarlane, Burlington, ON, Canada) for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed with PBS, and then incubated with 1 μg/ml bis-benzimide H33342 trihydrochloride (Hoechst, Sigma) in PBS for 5–15 min at room temperature. Photographs were taken using a high-resolution wide field fluorescent microscope (Leica DMI 3000B) at ×20 magnification attached to a Hamamatsu Orca ER-AG camera. The acquisition software used by this system was Volocity 4 (Improvision, Waltham, MA) and the filters were 377/50 and 628/40 for Hoechst and TUJ, respectively. TUJ+ cells exhibiting outgrowth twice the length of their cell body diameter were counted as neurite-bearing cells using a Leica DMI L fluorescent microscope (X-Cite® 120 Fluorescence illumination system) at ×10 magnification. TUJ+ cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei (stained with Hoechst) were considered as dead cells. At least 100 cells were counted per well. The assay was carried out as previously described (32.Fahnestock M. Yu G. Michalski B. Mathew S. Colquhoun A. Ross G.M. Coughlin M.D. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 PC12 cells/well were plated in Cell+ 6-well plates (Sarstedt) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse serum and 5% FBS (complete medium) for 24 h, then medium was switched to RPMI with no serum for 2–24 h. Serum-free medium was changed 2 h before stimulation. Cells were stimulated by serial dilutions of wild type (cleavable) proNGF (WT-NGF), proNGFhis (unpurified or purified), proNGF expressed in E. coli or mammalian HEK-293 cells, or mouse submandibular gland 2.5S NGF for 5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were lysed using 150 μl/well of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and chilled on ice for 15 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and total protein concentration was measured using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). 30 μg of total protein was loaded per lane on 10% SDS-PAGE gels for Western blotting. In some experiments as indicated, serum-free medium was supplemented with 50 μm furin inhibitor for 1–2 h before stimulation to prevent intracellular cleavage of proNGF by furin. Cells were stimulated with either proNGF or WT-NGF in 50 μm furin inhibitor for either 5 min or 1 h and lysed as above. For all bioassays including neurite outgrowth, apoptosis, and TrkA-MAPK activation assays, the level of proNGF cleavage in conditioned medium (and cell lysates as indicated) was monitored after each experiment by Western blotting. There was little to no detectable cleavage in all bioassays reported here, which supports the role of unprocessed proNGF in each assay. Western blotting was performed as previously described (32.Fahnestock M. Yu G. Michalski B. Mathew S. Colquhoun A. Ross G.M. Coughlin M.D. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) using affinity-purified rabbit anti-NGF IgG (MC-51), rabbit polyclonal NGF IgG (H-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-histidine tag antibody (Invitrogen), anti-proNGF (a generous gift from Dr. Xin-Fu Zhou, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia), phosphorylated p140TrkA, phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK (anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, Thr202/Tyr204), and total p44/42 MAPK (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), total TrkA and p75NTR (Chemicon, Mississauga, Canada), and neuronal βIII-tubulin (TUJ1, Covance). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for anti-NGF, anti-histidine tag, pMAPK, pTrkA, total MAPK, total TrkA, and p75NTR primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (Sigma) for antibody against proNGF. A chemiluminescence system (ECL™, Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect immunoreactive protein. In some experiments, the secondary antibody was IRDye® 680-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The membrane was scanned at the appropriate wavelength using an Odyssey™ infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). All antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's protocols. Relative levels of TrkA and p75NTR protein were determined in primary SCG neurons cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS for 4 h, in unprimed PC12 cells cultured in RPMI, 10% horse serum, and 5% FBS, and in primed PC12 cells cultured in serum plus 50 ng/ml NGF for 11 days. Cells were harvested in 40 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) for primary SCG neurons, or in the same lysis buffer used in TrkA-MAPK activation assays for PC12 cells, and analyzed by Western blotting using the TrkA and p75NTR antibodies described above (Chemicon). The pixel values of immunoreactive bands in chemiluminescent Western blots were determined by densitometry of films using a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet scanner and Scion Image β4.01 software with local background subtracted. Integrated intensities of infrared bands were determined using Odyssey software version 1.2 (LI-COR) with median background subtraction. Samples were analyzed 3 times in independent experiments. Prism 3 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) was applied to create dose-response curves for neurite outgrowth and TrkA-MAPK activation assays. Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey's test was applied as indicated to determine differences among experimental groups (SPSS 16.0.1 software). Previously, cleavage-resistant proNGF with a single amino acid substitution and neurotrophic activity was expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system and used without further purification (32.Fahnestock M. Yu G. Michalski B. Mathew S. Colquhoun A. Ross G.M. Coughlin M.D. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas proNGFhis with multiple substitutions, a histidine tag, and apoptotic activity was expressed in mammalian cells and purified over a nickel column prior to use (30.Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). To determine whether these structural or procedural differences could account for the reported differences in activity, we expressed proNGFhis in a baculovirus system and tested its activity before and after purification over a nickel column. We also tested proNGF123, an apoptotic proNGF expressed in baculovirus (31.Pagadala P.C. Dvorak L.A. Neet K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17939-17943Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Western blotting of cleavage-resistant proNGFhis expressed in an insect cell/baculovirus expression system using an anti-NGF antibody demonstrated intact material at the expected molecular mass for proNGFhis (34 kDa, Fig. 1E). Western blotting using an antibody against proNGF or the histidine tag confirmed the correct size band for proNGFhis and verified that the expressed protein was proNGF carrying a histidine tag. There was negligible cleavage of proNGFhis. No band was detected for either 2.5S NGF using proNGF antibody or WT-NGF (no histidine tag) using the histidine tag antibody, which confirmed the specificity of the antibodies for proNGFhis. No immunoreactivity was detectable for wild type baculovirus-infected insect cell-conditioned medium using any of the antibodies mentioned above; therefore there is no proNGF production in baculovirus/insect cells, and the antibodies do not cross-react with any protein produced by the baculovirus/insect cell system alone (data not shown). Western blotting using NGF and histidine tag antibodies showed that proNGFhis remained intact after nickel column chromatography, and proNGF123 was intact after immunoaffinity chromatography (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2030237065,"Activation of the NADPH oxidase homolog dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) within the airway epithelium represents a key mechanism of innate airway host defense, through enhanced production of H2O2, which mediates cellular signaling pathways that regulate the production of various inflammatory mediators. Production of the CXC chemokine interleukin (IL)-8/CXCL8 forms a common epithelial response to many diverse stimuli, including bacterial and viral triggers, environmental oxidants, and other biological mediators, suggesting the potential involvement of a common signaling pathway that may involve DUOX1-dependent H2O2 production. Following previous reports showing that DUOX1 is activated by extracellular ATP and purinergic receptor stimulation, this study demonstrates that airway epithelial IL-8 production in response to several bacterial stimuli involves ATP release and DUOX1 activation. ATP-mediated DUOX1 activation resulted in the activation of ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB pathways, which was associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand shedding by ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17). Although ATP-mediated ADAM17 activation and IL-8 release were not prevented by extracellular H2O2 scavenging by catalase, these responses were attenuated by intracellular scavengers of H2O2 or related oxidants, suggesting an intracellular redox signaling mechanism. Both ADAM17 activation and IL-8 release were suppressed by inhibitors of EGFR/ERK1/2 signaling, which can regulate ADAM17 activity by serine/threonine phosphorylation. Collectively, our results indicate that ATP-mediated DUOX1 activation represents a common response mechanism to several environmental stimuli, involving H2O2-dependent EGFR/ERK activation, ADAM17 activation, and EGFR ligand shedding, leading to amplified epithelial EGFR activation and IL-8 production."
https://openalex.org/W1975350793,"Interleukin (IL)-32 is a recently described proinflammatory cytokine characterized by the induction of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. We studied IL-32 expression in human pancreatic tissue and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Tissue samples were obtained surgically. IL-32 expression was evaluated by standard immunohistochemical procedures. IL-32 mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting and real time PCR analyses. IL-32 was weakly immunoexpressed by pancreatic duct cells. In the inflamed lesions of chronic pancreas, the ductal expression of IL-32 was markedly increased. A strong expression of IL-32alpha was detected in the pancreatic cancer cells. In pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3 cells), the expression of IL-32 mRNA and protein was enhanced by IL-1beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. An inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002) significantly suppressed the IL-1beta-, IFN-gamma- and TNF-alpha-induced IL-32 mRNA expression. The blockade of NF-kappaB and activated protein-1 activation markedly suppressed the IL-1beta-, IFN-gamma-, and/or TNF-alpha-induced IL-32 mRNA expression. Furthermore, IL-32-specific small interfering RNA significantly decreased the uptake of [3H]thymidine and increased the annexin V-positive population (apoptotic cells) in PANC-1 cells. IL-32 knockdown also suppressed the mRNA expression of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1). Pancreatic duct cells are the local source of IL-32, and IL-32 may play an important role in inflammatory responses and pancreatic cancer growth."
https://openalex.org/W1998399279,"The eukaryotic cell cycle comprises an ordered series of events orchestrated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), with unidirectional cell-cycle transitions being required for its successful completion. Proteolytic degradation of cyclins has been assumed to be responsible for the irreversible transitions. Here, the contribution of cyclin proteolysis to the irreversibility of mitotic exit has been examined with a combination of experiments in budding yeast and mathematical modelling. Although forced cyclin degradation can drive mitotic exit, it is not sufficient for irreversibility, due to the re-synthesis of cyclin. Mitotic exit becomes irreversible only after longer periods of cyclin degradation and activation of a double negative feedback loop involving the Cdk inhibitor Sic1. The eukaryotic cell cycle comprises an ordered series of events orchestrated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), with unidirectional cell-cycle transitions being required for its successful completion. Proteolytic degradation of cyclins has been assumed to be responsible for the irreversible transitions, but here it is shown that, although forced cyclin degradation can drive mitotic exit, the re-synthesis of cyclin means that this is not sufficient for irreversibility. Rather, mitotic exit only become irreversible after activation of a double-negative feedback loop. The eukaryotic cell cycle comprises an ordered series of events, orchestrated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), leading from chromosome replication during S phase to their segregation in mitosis. The unidirectionality of cell-cycle transitions is fundamental for the successful completion of this cycle. It is thought that irrevocable proteolytic degradation of key cell-cycle regulators makes cell-cycle transitions irreversible, thereby enforcing directionality1,2,3. Here we have experimentally examined the contribution of cyclin proteolysis to the irreversibility of mitotic exit, the transition from high mitotic Cdk activity back to low activity in G1. We show that forced cyclin destruction in mitotic budding yeast cells efficiently drives mitotic exit events. However, these remain reversible after termination of cyclin proteolysis, with recovery of the mitotic state and cyclin levels. Mitotic exit becomes irreversible only after longer periods of cyclin degradation, owing to activation of a double-negative feedback loop involving the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (refs 4, 5). Quantitative modelling suggests that feedback is required to maintain low Cdk activity and to prevent cyclin resynthesis. Our findings demonstrate that the unidirectionality of mitotic exit is not the consequence of proteolysis but of systems-level feedback required to maintain the cell cycle in a new stable state."
https://openalex.org/W2137784544,"The cause of a large increase of atmospheric methane concentration during the Younger Dryas-Preboreal abrupt climatic transition (approximately 11,600 years ago) has been the subject of much debate. The carbon-14 (14C) content of methane (14CH4) should distinguish between wetland and clathrate contributions to this increase. We present measurements of 14CH4 in glacial ice, targeting this transition, performed by using ice samples obtained from an ablation site in west Greenland. Measured 14CH4 values were higher than predicted under any scenario. Sample 14CH4 appears to be elevated by direct cosmogenic 14C production in ice. 14C of CO was measured to better understand this process and correct the sample 14CH4. Corrected results suggest that wetland sources were likely responsible for the majority of the Younger Dryas-Preboreal CH4 rise."
https://openalex.org/W2083368620,"Reduced lipolysis in hormone-sensitive lipase-deficient mice is associated with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), suggesting that endogenous beta-cell lipid stores provide signaling molecules for insulin release. Measurements of lipolysis and triglyceride (TG) lipase activity in islets from HSL(-/-) mice indicated the presence of other TG lipase(s) in the beta-cell. Using real time-quantitative PCR, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was found to be the most abundant TG lipase in rat islets and INS832/13 cells. To assess its role in insulin secretion, ATGL expression was decreased in INS832/13 cells (ATGL-knockdown (KD)) by small hairpin RNA. ATGL-KD increased the esterification of free fatty acid (FFA) into TG. ATGL-KD cells showed decreased glucose- or Gln + Leu-induced insulin release, as well as reduced response to KCl or palmitate at high, but not low, glucose. The K(ATP)-independent/amplification pathway of GSIS was considerably reduced in ATGL-KD cells. ATGL(-/-) mice were hypoinsulinemic and hypoglycemic and showed decreased plasma TG and FFAs. A hyperglycemic clamp revealed increased insulin sensitivity and decreased GSIS and arginine-induced insulin secretion in ATGL(-/-) mice. Accordingly, isolated islets from ATGL(-/-) mice showed reduced insulin secretion in response to glucose, glucose + palmitate, and KCl. Islet TG content and FFA esterification into TG were increased by 2-fold in ATGL(-/-) islets, but glucose usage and oxidation were unaltered. The results demonstrate the importance of ATGL and intracellular lipid signaling for fuel- and non-fuel-induced insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2060225027,"Yeast vacuole fusion requires soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), the Rab GTPase Ypt7p, vacuolar lipids, Sec17p and Sec18p, and the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex (HOPS). HOPS is a multisubunit protein with direct affinities for SNAREs, vacuolar lipids, and the GTP-bound form of Ypt7p; each of these affinities contributes to HOPS association with the organelle. Using all-purified components, we have reconstituted fusion, but the Rab Ypt7p was not required. We now report that phosphorylation of HOPS by the vacuolar kinase Yck3p blocks HOPS binding to vacuolar lipids, making HOPS membrane association and the ensuing fusion depend on the presence of Ypt7p. In accord with this finding in the reconstituted fusion reaction, the inactivation of Ypt7p by the GTPase-activating protein Gyp1-46p only blocks the fusion of purified vacuoles when Yck3p is present and active. Thus, although Ypt7p may contribute to other fusion functions, its central role is to bind HOPS to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2049846041,"Melanins are synthesized in melanocytes within specialized organelles called melanosomes. Numerous studies have shown that the pH of melanosome plays a key role in the regulation of melanin synthesis. However, until now, acute regulation of melanosome pH by a physiological stimulus has never been demonstrated. In the present study, we show that the activation of the cAMP pathway by αMSH or forskolin leads to an alkalinization of melanosomes and a concomitant regulation of vacuolar ATPases and ion transporters of the solute carrier family. The solute carrier family members include SLC45A2, which is mutated in oculocutaneous albinism type IV, SLC24A4 and SLC24A5, proteins implicated in the control of eye, hair, and skin pigmentation, and the P protein, encoded by the oculocutaneous albinism type II locus. Interestingly, H89, a pharmacological inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), prevents the cAMP-induced pigmentation and induces acidification of melanosomes. The drastic depigmenting effect of H89 is not due to an inhibition of tyrosinase expression. Indeed, H89 blocks the induction of melanogenesis induced by LY294002, a potent inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase pathway, without any effect on tyrosinase expression. Furthermore, PKA is not involved in the inhibition of pigmentation promoted by H89 because LY294002 induces pigmentation independently of PKA. Also, other PKA inhibitors do not affect pigmentation. Taken together, our results strengthen the support for a key role of melanosome pH in the regulation of melanin synthesis and, for the first time, demonstrate that melanosome pH is regulated by cAMP and αMSH.

Notably, these are both mediators of the response to solar UV radiation, the main physiological stimulus of skin pigmentation. Melanins, the pigments responsible for skin and hair pigmentation in mammals, are synthesized through an enzymatic process, catalyzed by tyrosinase, Tyrp1 (tyrosinase-related protein 1), and dopachrome tautomerase, which converts tyrosine to melanin pigments (1.Hearing V.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1999; 4: 24-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This process takes place in lysosome-related vesicles called melanosomes within melanocytes. These vesicles are transported to the dendrite tips and are transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes to ensure hair and skin pigmentation (2.Hearing V.J. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2005; 37: 3-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).

Numerous clinical observations, animal models, and experimental data clearly demonstrate that αMSH and the cAMP pathway are key physiologic regulators of skin and hair pigmentation in mammals, including humans (4.Buscà R.

In addition to the control of melanin synthesis, cAMP controls other fundamental parameters of pigment production and processing by melanocytes. Indeed, cAMP favors melanosome maturation by controlling the expression of Silver (10.Du J. Miller A.J. Widlund H.R. Horstmann M.A. Ramaswamy S. Fisher D.E. Am. J.

Numerous studies have shown that melanosomes, which are lysosome-related organelles, have an acidic pH (15.Bhatnagar V. Anjaiah S. Puri N. Darshanam B.N. Ramaiah A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, although some studies claim that this acidic pH is required for melanin synthesis (16.Puri N. Gardner J.M. Brilliant M.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 607-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), several other studies have demonstrated that vacuolar ATPase inhibitors, which increase melanosome pH, are able to stimulate melanin synthesis (17.Ancans J. Tobin D.J. Hoogduijn M.J. Smit N.P. Wakamatsu K. Thody A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, taking into account the importance of pH, we sought to investigate the effect of αMSH and cAMP on the regulation of melanosome pH. In the present study, we show that cAMP increases the pH of melanosomes and regulates the expression of several vacuolar ATPases and ion transporters, which might be important for the control of melanosome pH. N-[2-[[3-(4-bromophenyl)-2-propenyl]amino]ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89), prevents the alkalinization of melanosomes induced by cAMP-elevating agents and completely blocks melanin synthesis independent of PKA inhibition and regulation of tyrosinase expression. Taken together, our results further support the role of melanosome pH in the regulation of melanin synthesis. Additionally, these findings show, for the first time, that melanosome pH is regulated by αMSH and cAMP, which are induced as the consequence of physiological stimuli evoked by solar UV radiation. The monoclonal antibody to Tyrp1 (B8G3) was a gift from Dr. Parson (Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia), anti-Silver (HMB45) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Dakopatts and anti-MITF (C5) was obtained from Abcam. The anti-ERK2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DAMP- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-2,4-dinitrophenol were purchased from Invitrogen. The polyclonal anti-phospho-CREB was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The mouse melanoma cell line B16F10 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml, 50 μg/ml of penicillin-streptomycin and maintained in 5% of CO2 at 37 °C. B16 cells (150 × 103 cells/35-mm well) were cultured for 36 h in the presence of different effectors. Cells were centrifuged, and pellets were photographed and then solubilized in 100 μl of 1 m NaOH in 70 °C for over 2 h to dissolve melanins. The relative quantity of melanin was estimated by the absorbance at 405 nm and correlated to the quantity of proteins. The results are expressed as -fold of stimulation compared with the control conditions. B16 melanoma cells (200 × 103 cells/35-mm well) were stimulated by different effectors during the indicated time. Cells were then solubilized for 10 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), 100 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Then, 30 μg of protein was separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). The membrane was saturated for 1 h at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 5% gelatin. The primary antibody was incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. After three washes of 10 min in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dakopatts) was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After three additional washes, proteins of interest were revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). B16 melanoma cells (20 × 103 cells by 16-mm well) were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For each time point, 0.3 μg of the reporter plasmid pTyro or pMITF, as well as 0.05 μg of pCMVβgal, were incubated with 2 μl of Lipofectamine in 25 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 25 °C. The mixture was added to the B16 cells over a 6-h period and then replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 7% fetal calf serum, in the presence of 20 μm forskolin and/or 5 μm H89. 36 h later, cells were solubilized and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All transfections were repeated several times using different plasmid preparations. B16 cells (200 × 103 cells/35-mm well) were cultured in the absence or presence of 20 μm forskolin and/or 5 μm H89. Proteins were solubilized for 3 min at 4 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 1% Triton X-100, and then 60 μg of protein was incubated with 200 μg of l-DOPA at 37 °C. The kinetics of the reaction were followed by measuring absorbance of the product formed (dopaquinone) at 570 nm. B16 cells were cultured on glass slides in 24-mm wells at 15 × 103 cells/slide and treated, or not treated, for 36 h by 1 μm αMSH or 20 μm forskolin and/or 5 μm H89. Cells were washed with serum-free culture medium and incubated for 20 min in the presence of 30 μm DAMP. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C. Slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated 10 min in NH4Cl, and permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton for 2 min. Slides were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody (1/50 in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin). Melanosome labeling with primary monoclonal antibody (B8G3 anti-TYRP-1, 1/10; HMB45 anti-Pmel-17, 1/20) was performed in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with PBS, slides were incubated with Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse antibody (1/500). Cell labeling was observed using a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss). B16 cells cultured with or without 20 μm forskolin and/or 5 μm H89 for 36 h were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by a post-fixation in 2% osmic acid for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were subjected to successive dehydrations in alcohol baths, 30, 50, 75, and 95 °C for 15 min each; 100 °C, overnight. Following dehydration, samples were exposed to increasing amounts of Epon, specifically, Epon/alcohol (50/50) over 3 h, and then in Epon/alcohol (75/25), and finally in 100% Epon for 18 h. Cells were then embedded in 10% gelatin for 2 days in 60 °C. Sections of 700 Å were labeled with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The oligonucleotide microarrays contained ∼25,000 distinct oligonucleotide probes, covering most of the known human transcripts. The list of the probes is available on-line. RNAs were labeled using an amplification protocol, as described previously (18.Le Brigand K. Barbry P. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19.Le Brigand K.

Freeman T.C. Barbry P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was amplified with the Amino Allyl MessageAmp amplified RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled amplified RNA were fragmented with Ambion amplified RNA fragmentation reagents, purified, and then made up in Agilent hybridization buffer. Labeled cRNAs were then hybridized to human pan-genomic microarrays at 62 °C for 16 h. Microarrays were washed and scanned with a GenePix scanner (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices Corporation, Union City, CA). TIF images containing the data from each fluorescence channel were quantified with the GenePix Pro 6.0 program (Axon Instruments). Normalization and statistical analysis were performed using the limma package available from Bioconductor. First, using DAMP, a weak base that accumulates in acidic compartments, we evaluated the effect of αMSH on the pH of melanosomes. Melanosomes were labeled with an antibody against Tyrp1, which is found in mature melanosomes. Under control conditions, there was significant DAMP labeling (green). Most of the Tyrp1-positive melanosomes, labeled in red, were also positive for DAMP and appeared yellow on the merged images. These observations indicate that, under control conditions, melanosomes are acidic. In cells treated with αMSH, DAMP expression decreased, and in merged images, melanosomes appeared red (or orange), indicating a change of melanosome pH (Fig. 1A). At higher magnification, identical results were seen following forskolin treatment, which increases cAMP content (Fig. 1B). Using antibodies to Silver, to visualize early melanosomes, or to Tyrp1, to label mature melanosomes, we observed that both early and mature melanosomes appeared yellow under control conditions. Treatment with forskolin decreased DAMP labeling, and melanosomes appeared red (or orange), confirming that αMSH and cAMP induces an alkalinization of the melanosome milieu. It is well known that melanosomes contain vacuolar ATPases and that inhibition of these ATPases leads to alkalinization of the melanosome, favoring melanin synthesis. Thus, we asked whether cAMP might modulate the expression of ATPases, in particular, vacuolar ATPases. Analysis of a DNA microarray showed that, among the 87 ATPases present in the array, 76 were significantly expressed in B16 melanoma cells. Eleven ATPases, including seven vacuolar ATPases (ATP6V0-B, -C and -D1; ATP6V1-A, -B2, -C1, and -G1), were significantly up-regulated by cAMP. Another ATPase, ATP6AP2, which is associated with lysosomes and possibly with melanosomes, was also up-regulated by cAMP (Fig. 2A). None of these ATPases were inhibited by cAMP. As it has been reported that ATPase inhibitors induced alkalinization of the melanosome (20.Tabata H. Kawamura N. Sun-Wada G.H. Wada Y. Cell Tissue Res. 2008; 332: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the augmentation of ATPases should result in a decrease in melanosome pH. Thus, we examined the effect of cAMP on the expression of the membrane transporters of the SLC family that participate in the regulation of the electric and ionic equilibrium. Among the 335 SLC genes on our array, 199 were significantly expressed. Thirteen were up-regulated by cAMP, including SLC24A4, SLC24A5, and SLC45A2, all of which are involved in pigmentation. SLC6A6 and SLC9A3R1 were down-regulated by more than 50% (data not shown). Additionally, cAMP regulated the expression of OCA2, a transporter that plays a key role in pigmentation, but its function is not clearly identified (Fig. 2B). The localization of these ATPases and solute carriers to the melanosomes as well as the mechanisms by which this modulates melanosome pH remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, the data presented above indicates that cAMP may greatly influence ionic equilibrium in melanocytes and in melanosomes. Next, we investigated how cAMP regulates melanosome pH and the possible involvement of PKA. To do so, we examined the effect of H89, a PKA inhibitor, on the regulation of melanosome pH. We found that H89 prevented the cAMP-induced decrease in DAMP labeling compared with control conditions. When the cells were exposed to H89, the melanosomes, identified by Tyrp1 labeling, appeared yellow and thus acidic (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, H89 completely blocked melanin synthesis, as shown by the picture of the cell pellets and by the quantification of melanin content (Fig. 3B). Because PKA, through the control of MITF expression, regulates the transcription of the tyrosinase gene, the inhibition of melanin synthesis might be the result of the inhibition of tyrosinase expression. Therefore, we studied the effect of H89 on tyrosinase, Tyrp1, Silver, and MITF expression. H89 affected neither basal nor cAMP-induced expression of Tyrp1 or Silver. On the other hand, H89 clearly reduced the cAMP-induced up-regulation of tyrosinase and MITF expression (60% decrease). Additionally, H89 completely blocked the effect of cAMP on CREB phosphorylation (Ser-133), demonstrating that H89 had, indeed, inhibited PKA (Fig. 4A). Then, regulation of Tyr or Mitf transcription by H89 was evaluated by a luciferase assay. Although H89 reduced the effect of cAMP on the tyrosinase and MITF promoter, it did not completely prevent the activation of these promoters by cAMP (Fig. 4B). Finally, treatment of the cells with H89 led to a 40% decrease in the DOPA oxidase activity of tyrosinase (Fig. 4C). The addition of H89 in vitro, directly into the enzymatic assay, did not affect tyrosinase activity. This indicated that H89 is not a direct inhibitor of the DOPA oxidase activity of tyrosinase. Taken together, these observations indicate that H89 partially prevents the up-regulation of tyrosinase transcription and expression elicited by cAMP. However, it remained to understand why H89 led to the complete inhibition of melanin synthesis, while the level of tyrosinase in cells treated by H89 stayed clearly above the level of tyrosinase in basal cells.FIGURE 4Effect of H89 on tyrosinase expression and activity. A, B16 mouse melanoma cells were incubated with or without 20 μm forskolin (Fsk or control, respectively), in presence or absence of 5 μm H89 for 36 h. Cells were solubilized, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against tyrosinase (Tyr), Tyrp1, Silver, Mitf, and Phospho-CREB (P-Creb) and, as loading control, Erk2. B, B16 mouse melanoma cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid, encoding luciferase under the control of either the tyrosinase promoter (P TYRO) or MITF promoter (P MITF). Cells were either mock-treated (control) or treated with 20 μm forskolin, in the presence or absence of 5 μm H89 for 36 h, and then solubilized and assayed for luciferase activity. C, B16 mouse melanoma cells were incubated with or without 20 μm forskolin (Fsk or control) in the presence or absence of 5 μm H89 for 36 h. Solubilized proteins were incubated with l-DOPA and assayed for DOPA oxidase activity by measuring the OD at 570 nm. To evaluate the direct effect of H89 on the DOPA oxidase activity of tyrosinase, H89 was added with l-DOPA from forskolin-treated cells (In vitro). Cont, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we evaluated the effect of H89 on melanosome structure by electron microscopy. Under control conditions, we mainly observed the presence of round and slightly striated melanosomes, corresponding to type II melanosomes. After treatment with forskolin, elliptical black vesicles appeared, in which longitudinal striations were barely visible due to melanin accumulation. These vesicles resembled type III and IV melanosomes. In both control and forskolin-treated cells, H89 treatment resulted in the appearance of large round and vacuolized melanosomes resembling late endosomes (Fig. 5). One might find intriguing that the inhibition of PKA does not lead to a more dramatic effect on tyrosinase expression. However, we have shown previously that, in addition to PKA, cAMP regulated other signaling pathways in melanocytes. Specifically, cAMP inhibited the PI 3-kinase pathway; the inhibition of this pathway by LY294002 resulted in a significant increase in tyrosinase expression and a stimulation of melanogenesis (21.Buscà R. Bertolotto C. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31824-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the consequence of H89 treatment on the effects of LY294002 on tyrosinase and MITF expression as well as on melanin synthesis. As shown in Fig. 4, H89 clearly inhibited the expression of tyrosinase and, to a lesser extent, MITF in cAMP-treated cells. Inhibition of the PI 3-kinase by LY294002 increased the expression of tyrosinase and MITF as efficiently as cAMP. In contrast, treatment with H89 did not affect MITF expression and only slightly reduced the tyrosinase level (Fig. 6A). Remarkably, the strong stimulation of melanin synthesis induced by LY294002 was completely inhibited by H89 (Fig. 6B). This observation emphasizes the lack of correlation between the tyrosinase level and melanin synthesis in H89-treated cells, suggesting that the H89-induced loss of melanogenesis is not the direct consequence of a reduction of tyrosinase expression or of PKA inhibition. To further investigate the role of PKA inhibition in the effect of H89, we examined several other pharmacological inhibitors of PKA including H7, H8, H9, and HA1077. In preliminary studies, we have shown that the maximal inhibition of melanin synthesis with less than 5% decrease in cell viability was obtained using 5 μm of H89 (data not shown). Therefore, we compared the effect of 5 μm H89 to the other PKA inhibitors (Fig. 7A). H89 dramatically reduced melanin synthesis (95% inhibition). However, H7, H8, H9, and HA1077 failed to inhibit melanogenesis. Notably, H7, H8, and H9 were used at 50 μm; higher concentrations of H7 and H9 led to a 95% and 80% decrease in cell viability, respectively. H8 is not soluble at concentrations above 50 μm. HA1077 slightly inhibited (20%) melanin synthesis at 10 μm; at a higher concentration (50 μm), melanin synthesis decreased by 40%, but there was a 25% decrease in cell viability. H7, H8, H9, and HA1077 have been used at concentration markedly above the IC50 for PKA (0.5, 2, 1.3, and 1 μm, respectively) (22.Asano T. Suzuki T. Tsuchiya M. Satoh S. Ikegaki I. Shibuya M.

Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 16: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar), and they indeed inhibited CREB phosphorylation (data not shown). However, they did not affect melanin synthesis. This indicates that PKA inhibition is not sufficient for the inhibition of melanogenesis by H89. H89 is the most specific inhibitor of PKA, but it is also able to inhibit other kinases (24.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar) (Table 1) including S6 kinase, AKT, MSK1, ROCK-II, and MAPKAPK1. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of these kinases on melanin synthesis (Fig. 7B). These inhibitors did not affect the melanogenic effect induced by forskolin. As reported previously, the inhibition of MEK, which is required for MAPKAPK1 activation, AKT, S6 kinase, and ROCK-II by PD98059 (25.Englaro W. Bertolotto C. Buscà R. Brunet A. Pagès G. Ortonne J.P.

Inhibition of MSK1 activation by the p38 inhibitor SB202190 did not affect melanogenesis (data not shown). Taken together, these observations indicate that none of these kinases is involved in the H89-mediated inhibition of melanogenesis.TABLE 1IC50 of H89 for different kinasesKinaseIC50S6K180 nmMSK1120 nmPKA135 nmROCK-II270 nmAKT2.6 μmMAPKAPK12.8 μm Open table in a new tab In the present study, we demonstrated that the activation of the cAMP pathway by αMSH or forskolin led to alkalinization of melanosomes. Our results are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that melanin synthesis was stimulated by agents that increase melanosome pH. This is true for the lysosomotropic compound, ammonium chloride, ionophores such as nigericin and monensin, and inhibitors of the vacuolar ATPases such as bafilomycin (26.Ancans J. Thody A.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27.Saeki H. Oikawa A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1985; 85: 423-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fuller et al. (28.Fuller B.B. Spaulding D.T. Smith D.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported that the melanosomes of melanocytes from Caucasian skin displayed low tyrosinase activity and were more acidic than the melanosomes of melanocytes from black skin, which had high tyrosinase activity. Our observation provides a physiological link between melanosome pH and extracellular signals that trigger melanocyte differentiation. These findings indicate that melanosome pH is not only dictated by genetic determinants but that it can also be subjected to physiological environmental regulation, such as UV exposure that regulates αMSH production by keratinocytes. These observations can be extended to human melanocytes because we observed that (i) the amount of visible melanin was markedly increased when melanocytes from Caucasians were cultured in medium favoring melanosome alkalinization, and (ii) H89 decreased melanin content in melanocytes from black skin (data not shown). The mechanisms and molecular players involved in the regulation of melanosome pH remain to be elucidated. Of course, the main player in this process is vacuolar (V)-ATPase itself; its presence in melanosomes has been demonstrated by proteomic ana"

This phenotype modulation plays a critical role in the development of most vascular disease states. In these studies, stimulation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells with platelet-derived growth factor resulted in marked induction of c-jun expression, which was attenuated by protein kinase Cδ and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase inhibition. Given that these signaling pathways have been shown to relieve the repressive effects of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) on myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) 2 proteins, we ectopically expressed HDAC4 and observed repression of c-jun expression. Congruently, suppression of HDAC4 by RNA interference resulted in enhanced c-jun expression. Consistent with these findings, mutation of the MEF2 cis-element in the c-jun promoter resulted in promoter activation during quiescent conditions, suggesting that the MEF2 cis-element functions as a repressor in this context. Furthermore, we demonstrate that protein kinase A attenuates c-Jun expression by promoting the formation of a MEF2·HDAC4 repressor complex by inhibiting salt-inducible kinase 1. Finally, we document a physical interaction between c-Jun and myocardin, and we document that forced expression of c-Jun represses the ability of myocardin to activate smooth muscle gene expression. Thus, MEF2 and HDAC4 act to repress c-Jun expression in quiescent VSMCs, protein kinase A enhances this repression, and platelet-derived growth factor derepresses c-Jun expression through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and novel protein kinase Cs. Regulation of this molecular “switch” on the c-jun promoter may thus prove critical for toggling between the activated and quiescent VSMC phenotypes.

Thus, MEF2 and HDAC4 act to repress c-Jun expression in quiescent VSMCs, protein kinase A enhances this repression, and platelet-derived growth factor derepresses c-Jun expression through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and novel protein kinase Cs. Regulation of this molecular “switch” on the c-jun promoter may thus prove critical for toggling between the activated and quiescent VSMC phenotypes.

Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar). Differentiated smooth muscle cells express high levels of contractile proteins and other muscle-specific genes, a phenotype that has been termed “quiescent” or “contractile.” However, in response to vascular injury, VSMCs down-regulate muscle-specific genes, increase their proliferation rate and migration capacity, and actively secrete matrix proteins. This proliferative phenotype has been called the “activated” or “synthetic” phenotype (1.Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar). Although proliferative VSMCs are undoubtedly required for vascular development and during vascular repair, this activated phenotype also plays a role in multiple smooth muscle diseases, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty (1.Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms whereby VSMCs modulate their phenotype between the quiescent and activated states is of particular interest for our understanding of smooth muscle cell biology under physiological and pathological conditions. vascular smooth muscle cell myocyte enhancer factor 2 histone deacetylase protein kinase A platelet-derived growth factor protein kinase C calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase salt-inducible kinase serum response factor histidine-rich calcium-binding protein protein kinase D fetal bovine serum tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate small interfering RNA 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside phosphate-buffered saline smooth muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphodiesterase insulin-like growth factor smooth muscle α-actin matrix metalloprotease mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAP kinase/ERK kinase monocyte chemoattractant protein. The MADS box transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF), plays a critical role in smooth muscle phenotype modulation. SRF binds to a cognate cis-element termed the CArG box, which can be found in multiple copies in many smooth muscle structural genes (2.Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Conversely, SRF is also involved in smooth muscle proliferation by binding to a single CArG box in the proximal promoter of c-fos, a growth-responsive immediate-early gene (2.Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). This dual role for SRF is largely regulated by recruiting co-activators, such as myocardin (3.Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), to activate smooth muscle genes, or ternary complex factors, such as Elk-1, to activate immediate-early genes (4.Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2004; 428: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Another mammalian MADS box transcription factor, known as myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) 2 is functionally important in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. Recent studies have identified two smooth muscle marker genes that require a consensus MEF2-binding site in their respective promoter regions for expression in VSMCs in vivo. These genes encode myocardin, a master regulator of smooth muscle differentiation (5.Creemers E.E. Sutherland L.B. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 2006; 133: 4245-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRC), a sarcoplasmic reticulum protein expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle (6.Anderson J.P. Dodou E. Heidt A.B. De Val S.J. Jaehnig E.J. Greene S.B. Olson E.N. Black B.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3757-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, gene targeting studies have revealed that MEF2C is required for proper vascular patterning and vascular smooth muscle differentiation (7.Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R. Lyons G.E. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite this emerging evidence supporting the role of MEF2 proteins in vascular smooth differentiation, MEF2 has also been associated with the activated, proliferative smooth muscle phenotype (8.Firulli A.B. Miano J.M. Bi W. Johnson A.D. Casscells W. Olson E.N. Schwarz J.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Analogous to SRF activation of the c-fos gene, MEF2 can increase the expression of the immediate-early gene, c-jun, which is known to act as a downstream target of the smooth muscle mitogen, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (9.Zhan Y. Kim S. Yasumoto H. Namba M. Miyazaki H. Iwao H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10.Ioroi T. Yamamori M. Yagi K. Hirai M. Zhan Y. Kim S. Iwao H. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 91: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is currently not known whether PDGF induction of c-jun is mediated through MEF2; however, evidence from other cell lines suggests the involvement of MEF2 in the serum induction of c-jun (11.Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To date, very little is known regarding the role of MEF2 in smooth muscle phenotype modulation, but it appears that both SRF and MEF2 proteins have a regulatory role in smooth muscle proliferation and differentiation. The transcriptional activity of MEF2 proteins is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and sumoylation, and a number of interacting protein co-factors. The cellular consequences of the interaction between MEF2 and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), and its regulation by calcium/calmodulin kinases (CaMK) and PKCδ/PKD signaling, have not thus far been elucidated in VSMCs. Interestingly, PDGF signaling is known to activate CaMKs and PKCδ/PKD during VSMC migration (12.Bilato C. Pauly R.R. Melillo G. Monticone R. Gorelick-Feldman D. Gluzband Y.A. Sollott S.J. Ziman B.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8321-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that the novel PKC isoforms, PKCδ and PKCϵ, can activate MEF2 proteins in HeLa and COS cells (15.Ornatsky O.I. Cox D.M. Tangirala P. Andreucci J.J. Quinn Z.A. Wrana J.L. Prywes R. Yu Y.T. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that PDGF induction of c-jun in VSMCs might be mediated by PKCδ- and CaMK-mediated derepression of MEF2. Protein kinase A (PKA), the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, potently inhibits vascular smooth muscle proliferation and may protect against vascular disease (16.Bornfeldt K.E. Krebs E.G. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In VSMCs, PKA is activated by prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin) and β-adrenergic agonists. Interestingly, in humans, reduced production of prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin) by cyclooxygenase II inhibition is associated with increased cardiovascular risk (17.Grosser T. Fries S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which PKA has been shown to inhibit smooth muscle proliferation is to inhibit the expression of c-jun (18.Rao G.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20805-20810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence from our laboratory and from others suggests that PKA can promote HDAC4 repression of MEF2-dependent transcriptional activation in other cell types (19.Bolger T.A. Yao T.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9544-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20.Berdeaux R. Goebel N. Banaszynski L. Takemori H. Wandless T. Shelton G.D. Montminy M. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 21.Du M. Perry R.L. Nowacki N.B. Gordon J.W. Salma J. Zhao J. Aziz A. Chan J. Siu K.W. McDermott J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2952-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the role of PKA signaling on MEF2-dependent c-jun expression in VSMCs. In this report, we demonstrate that a MEF2 cis-element in the c-jun promoter serves as a repressor element in quiescent VSMCs and that this repression is largely abolished during conditions of cell growth. Consistent with this finding, HDAC4 is exported from the nuclear compartment during growth conditions or by exogenous expression of CaMK or PKD, whereas PDGF induction of c-jun is prevented by CaMK and PKCδ inhibition. In addition, gain and loss of function manipulation of HDAC4 levels reveal its involvement in regulation of c-jun expression in VSMCs, making this the first report to document that class II HDACs regulate immediate-early gene expression in connection with a proliferative phenotype in VSMCs. Furthermore, PKA promotes MEF2·HDAC4 repression of c-jun expression by inhibiting the activity of salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1). Finally, forced expression of c-Jun inhibits the ability of myocardin to activate smooth muscle gene expression, illustrating the fundamental importance of c-Jun regulation by MEF2 and HDAC4 during smooth muscle phenotype modulation. MEF2 and c-Jun reporter constructs (pJC6, pJSX, and pJTX) in pGL3 and expression vectors for MEF2A, MEF2C, MEF2D, the MEF2A-VP16 fusion, the Gal4-MEF2A and Gal4-MEF2D fusions, and c-Jun have been described previously (15.Ornatsky O.I.

The resulting DNA fragment was ligated with the c-fos minimal promoter (BglII-NcoI), described previously (22.Andreucci J.J. Grant D. Cox D.M. Tomc L.K. Prywes R. Goldhamer D.J. Rodrigues N.

The MCP-1 luciferase construct was kindly provided by A. Garzino Demo. An expression vector containing the catalytic subunit of PKA (pFC-PKA) was purchased from Stratagene. Rat A10 myoblasts (ATCC; CRL-1476) were maintained in growth medium consisting of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Quiescence was obtained by refeeding the cells with either 1% or 0% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. C3H10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (ATCC; CCL-226) and COS7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and re-fed in 5% horse serum to achieve quiescence. For conversion assays, C3H10T1/2 were grown to confluence and made quiescent for 4 days prior to harvesting. Transient transfections of A10 and C3H10T1/2 cells were performed by a modified calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation with pCVM-β-galactosidase serving as an internal control for transfection efficiency (23.Perry R.L. Parker M.H. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 291-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (24.Kollias H.D. Perry R.L. Miyake T. Aziz A. McDermott J.C. Mol.

Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay, and 15 μg were resolved using SDS-PAGE and transfed to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Inc.). Immunoblotting was carried out using appropriate primary antibody in 5% powdered milk in PBS.

Human abdominal aortic aneurysm segments were obtained from patients undergoing elective repair (n = 4, all men). The average age was 70.4 years. The average size of the aneurismal lesions estimated by CT scan and/or angiography was 6.95 cm. During graft replacement for abdominal aortic aneurysm, macroscopically normal adjacent normal aortic segments were carefully excised from four patients and used as controls. Immediately after procurement, segments were placed in sterile normal saline and transported to the laboratory. The protocol of this study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee at the St. Michael's Hospital and University of Toronto. Written informed consent was given by all patients. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for RNA analysis or were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cryostat sections (∼8 μm) were mounted on membrane-based microdissection slides (Acutrus Engineering, Mountain View, CA) and fixed for 2 min with cold acetone. After washing twice 5 s each with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated PBS, pH 7.6, the sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-human smooth muscle (SM) α-actin antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA; 1:20) for 5–8 min at room temperature. The sections were washed rapidly three times for 1 min each with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated PBS followed by dehydration in graded ethanol solutions (70% one time for 1 min, 95% one time for 1 min, and 100% two times for 1 min each) and cleaned in xylene (two times for 5 min each). After air-drying for 5 min, laser capture microdissection was performed under direct microscopic visualization on the SM α-actin-positive stained areas. The Leica laser capture microdissection system (Leica Microsystem; Wetzlar GmbH) was set to the following parameters: laser diameter, 15 μm; speed, 1.5 ms; and amplitudes, 40 milliwatt. A total of 500–3000 target cells were captured for each sample. Total RNA from laser capture microdissection-captured cells was isolated by using the RNeasy micro RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). T7-based RNA amplification was performed by using the RiboAmp kit (Arcturus Engineering) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA extracted either from laser-captured SMC or from alternating whole sections was reverse transcribed using Omniscript first-stand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) under conditions described by the supplier. cDNA was amplified by quantitative real time PCR (ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system; Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent (Qiagen). The primer pair sequences for each reaction was performed in duplicate by using equal amount of cDNA from each sample as template. The primer sequences of genes used in this study were: HDAC-4: forward, 5′-GGTTTGAGAGCAGGCAGAAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGAGAATGAGGCCAAGGAG-3′; and GAPDH: forward, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′. Thermal activation was initiated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (melting for 15 s at 95 °C and annealing/extension for 1 min at 60 °C). Relative quantitations of gene expression were calculated using standard curves and normalized to GAPDH in each sample. Frozen segments from abdominal aortic aneurysm and adjacent NA tissues were sectioned in 10-μm-thick sections, briefly dried, and fixed in acetone. The sections were incubated in normal horse serum (Sigma) for 1 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with the primary antibody rabbit anti-human HDAC4 (1:200, Sigma). With intervening washes in PBS, the sections were then incubated for 30 min with biotin-conjugated horse anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by a 1-h incubation with Alexa fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:200; Sigma). The sections were washed, mounted, and analyzed with confocal microscope (Leica Microsystem Inc, Exton, PA). Previous studies have implicated MEF2 proteins in the activated smooth muscle response (8.Firulli A.B. Miano J.M. Bi W. Johnson A.D. Casscells W. Olson E.N. Schwarz J.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although MEF2 transcriptional activation following vascular injury has not, as yet, been reported, to this end, we utilized the MEF2 sensor mouse that we and others have previously used to evaluate MEF2 transcriptional activation during development (27.de Angelis L. Zhao J. Andreucci J.J. Olson E.N. Cossu G. McDermott J.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 283: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28.Naya F.J. Wu C. Richardson J.A. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 2045-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, carotid injury elicited a widespread increase in MEF2A expression, consistent with previous reports (8.Firulli A.B. Miano J.M. Bi W. Johnson A.D. Casscells W. Olson E.N. Schwarz J.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MEF2 transcriptional activation, as indicated by X-gal staining of the MEF2 Lac Z-derived arteries, was observed at the site of injury (Fig. 1A). In addition, we observed an increased expression of the MEF2 target gene, c-jun, at the site of injury (Fig. 1A). Because the induction of MEF2A expression was not accompanied by a widespread increase in MEF2 transcriptional activation, we further studied the role of MEF2 proteins in the regulation of smooth phenotype. In particular, we analyzed the regulation of the c-jun promoter, a previously characterized MEF2 target gene that has been implicated as a key regulator of VSMC proliferation control. In the context of quiescent cultured smooth muscle cells, we found that the c-jun promoter, as predicted, was induced by serum stimulation, oxidative stress, depolarization, and PDGF treatment (Fig. 1B). These treatments resulted in corresponding increases in c-Jun protein expression, whereas treatment with transforming growth factor β1 had no effect (supplemental Fig. S1). To evaluate the role of MEF2 in c-jun expression, we first ectopically expressed MEF2 proteins with the c-jun reporter gene. Interestingly, and in contrast to other cell types, we found that MEF2 proteins were unable to activate c-jun expression in A10 smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1). However, MEF2 proteins were able to activate an artificial MEF2 reporter gene (MEF2-luc), a myocardin enhancer-based reporter gene, and the HRC promoter (HRC-luc) in this context (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, a fusion protein consisting of the MEF2A DNA-binding domain fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain was able to activate the c-jun promoter (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these data suggest that MEF2 is capable of binding to both the c-jun and muscle-specific reporter regions in cultured smooth muscle cells, but the transcriptional responses of these target genes is divergent. To examine the potential signaling pathways that regulate c-jun expression by PDGF, we utilized common pharmacological inhibitors in our culture model. As shown in Fig. 2A, inhibition of PKCδ by rottlerin, inhibition of CaMKII and IV by KN-62, or inhibition of MEK1 by PD98059 all resulted in a modest reduction in c-Jun protein, whereas inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by LY294002 had no effect. However, combination of rottlerin and KN-62 resulted in marked reduction in c-Jun, below levels observed in quiescent cells. In addition, the activation of CaMK or PKC signaling by A23187 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, respectively, also increased c-Jun protein expression (not shown). Given that previous studies have implicated the CaMKs and the novel PKCs in the regulation of class II HDACs, we next evaluated the role of KN-62 and rottlerin on the subcellular localization of HDAC4 (29.McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 30.Vega R.B. Harrison B.C. Meadows E. Roberts C.R. Papst P.J. Olson E.N. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that HDAC4 is distributed throughout the cell during growth conditions, as determined by immunofluorescence. However, combined treatment with KN-62 and rottlerin resulted in nuclear accumulation of HDAC4. Furthermore, we utilized an HDAC4-GFP fusion protein and observed that it was primarily localized in the nucleus during serum-free quiescent conditions but was exported to the cytosol during low density growth conditions. This result was confirmed by nuclear and cytosolic fractionation studies demonstrating that PDGF treatment promotes nuclear export of HDAC4 (Fig. 2, D and E). Interestingly, when smooth muscle cultures were allowed to reach confluence, the HDAC4-GFP fusion protein was again primarily nuclear (Fig. 2D). Lastly, ectopic expression of activated CaMKs and activated PKD, a downstream HDAC kinase of PKCδ, resulted in a distribution of HDAC4-GFP to the cytosol (Fig. 2C). Together, these results indicate a growth-responsive role for HDAC4 that is regulated by PDGF activat"
https://openalex.org/W1985055612,"The annexins are a family of Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding proteins, which interact with membranes upon increase of [Ca2+]i or during cytoplasmic acidification. The transient nature of the membrane binding of annexins complicates the study of their influence on intracellular processes. To address the function of annexins at the plasma membrane (PM), we fused fluorescent protein-tagged annexins A6, A1, and A2 with H- and K-Ras membrane anchors. Stable PM localization of membrane-anchored annexin A6 significantly decreased the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), but did not influence the rates of Ca2+ extrusion. This attenuation was specific for annexin A6 because PM-anchored annexins A1 and A2 did not alter SOCE. Membrane association of annexin A6 was necessary for a measurable decrease of SOCE, because cytoplasmic annexin A6 had no effect on Ca2+ entry as long as [Ca2+]i was below the threshold of annexin A6-membrane translocation. However, when [Ca2+]i reached the levels necessary for the Ca2+-dependent PM association of ectopically expressed wild-type annexin A6, SOCE was also inhibited. Conversely, knockdown of the endogenous annexin A6 in HEK293 cells resulted in an elevated Ca2+ entry. Constitutive PM localization of annexin A6 caused a rearrangement and accumulation of F-actin at the PM, indicating a stabilized cortical cytoskeleton. Consistent with these findings, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton using latrunculin A abolished the inhibitory effect of PM-anchored annexin A6 on SOCE. In agreement with the inhibitory effect of annexin A6 on SOCE, constitutive PM localization of annexin A6 inhibited cell proliferation. Taken together, our results implicate annexin A6 in the actin-dependent regulation of Ca2+ entry, with consequences for the rates of cell proliferation. The annexins are a family of Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding proteins, which interact with membranes upon increase of [Ca2+]i or during cytoplasmic acidification. The transient nature of the membrane binding of annexins complicates the study of their influence on intracellular processes. To address the function of annexins at the plasma membrane (PM), we fused fluorescent protein-tagged annexins A6, A1, and A2 with H- and K-Ras membrane anchors. Stable PM localization of membrane-anchored annexin A6 significantly decreased the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), but did not influence the rates of Ca2+ extrusion. This attenuation was specific for annexin A6 because PM-anchored annexins A1 and A2 did not alter SOCE. Membrane association of annexin A6 was necessary for a measurable decrease of SOCE, because cytoplasmic annexin A6 had no effect on Ca2+ entry as long as [Ca2+]i was below the threshold of annexin A6-membrane translocation. However, when [Ca2+]i reached the levels necessary for the Ca2+-dependent PM association of ectopically expressed wild-type annexin A6, SOCE was also inhibited. Conversely, knockdown of the endogenous annexin A6 in HEK293 cells resulted in an elevated Ca2+ entry. Constitutive PM localization of annexin A6 caused a rearrangement and accumulation of F-actin at the PM, indicating a stabilized cortical cytoskeleton. Consistent with these findings, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton using latrunculin A abolished the inhibitory effect of PM-anchored annexin A6 on SOCE. In agreement with the inhibitory effect of annexin A6 on SOCE, constitutive PM localization of annexin A6 inhibited cell proliferation. Taken together, our results implicate annexin A6 in the actin-dependent regulation of Ca2+ entry, with consequences for the rates of cell proliferation. Calcium entry into cells either through voltage- or receptor-operated channels, or following the depletion of intracellular stores is a major factor in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Resting [Ca2+]i is low (∼100 nm compared with extracellular [Ca2+]ex of 1.2 mm) and can be rapidly increased by inositol triphosphate-mediated release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores (mostly endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPMplasma membraneSOCEstore-operated Ca2+ entryGFPgreen fluorescent proteintHC terminus of H-RastKlipid anchor of K-RasYFPyellow fluorescent proteinshRNAshort hairpin RNAPMCAplasma membrane Ca2+-ATPaseSERCAsarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPaseCCHcarbacholTGthapsigarginEGFepidermal growth factorLat Alatrunculin A. 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPMplasma membraneSOCEstore-operated Ca2+ entryGFPgreen fluorescent proteintHC terminus of H-RastKlipid anchor of K-RasYFPyellow fluorescent proteinshRNAshort hairpin RNAPMCAplasma membrane Ca2+-ATPaseSERCAsarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPaseCCHcarbacholTGthapsigarginEGFepidermal growth factorLat Alatrunculin A.), or by channel-mediated influx across the plasma membrane (PM). Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) has been proposed as the main process controlling Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells (1Parekh A.B. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 453: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the recent discovery of Orai1 and STIM provided the missing link between the Ca2+-release activated current (ICRAC) and the ER Ca2+ sensor (2Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P.

Translocation of STIM within the ER, accumulation in punctae at the sites of contact with PM and activation of Ca2+ channels have been proposed as a model of its regulation of Orai1 activity (5Dziadek M.A. Johnstone L.S.

However, many details of the functional STIM-Orai1 protein complex and its regulation remain to be elucidated. The actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in the regulation of SOCE, possibly by influencing the function of ion channels or by interfering with the interaction between STIM and Orai1 (7Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

However, the proteins connecting the actin cytoskeleton and SOCE activity at the PM have yet to be identified. endoplasmic reticulum plasma membrane store-operated Ca2+ entry green fluorescent protein C terminus of H-Ras lipid anchor of K-Ras yellow fluorescent protein short hairpin RNA plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase carbachol thapsigargin epidermal growth factor latrunculin A. endoplasmic reticulum plasma membrane store-operated Ca2+ entry green fluorescent protein C terminus of H-Ras lipid anchor of K-Ras yellow fluorescent protein short hairpin RNA plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase carbachol thapsigargin epidermal growth factor latrunculin A. The annexins are a multigene family of Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding proteins, which have been implicated in many Ca2+-regulated processes. Their C-terminal core is evolutionarily conserved and contains Ca2+-binding sites, their N-terminal tails are unique and enable the protein to interact with distinct cytoplasmic partners. At low [Ca2+]i, annexins are diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol, however, after stimulation resulting in the increase of [Ca2+]i, annexins are targeted to distinct subcellular membrane locations, such as the PM, endosomes, or secretory vesicles (10Draeger A. Wray S. Babiychuk E.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Annexins are involved in the processes of vesicle trafficking, cell division, apoptosis, calcium signaling, and growth regulation (11Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar), and frequent changes in expression levels of annexins are observed in disease (12Hayes M.J. Moss S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Grewal T. Enrich C. Bioessays. 2006; 28: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previously, using biochemical methods and imaging of fluorescent protein-tagged annexins in live cells, we demonstrated that annexins A1, A2, A4, and A6 interacted with the PM as well as with internal membrane systems in a highly coordinated manner (10Draeger A. Wray S. Babiychuk E.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Monastyrskaya K. Babiychuk E.B. Hostettler A. Rescher U. Draeger A. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence of Ca2+-independent membrane association of several annexins, including annexin A6 (15Köhler G. Hering U. Zschörnig O. Arnold K.

Given the fact that several annexins are present within any one cell, it is likely that they form a [Ca2+] and pH sensing system, with a regulatory influence on other signaling pathways. The role of annexins as regulators of ion channel activity has been addressed previously (23Hawkins T.E. Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Kaetzel M.A. Chan H.C. Dubinsky W.P. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15894-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, annexin A6 has been implicated in regulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel (25Díaz-Muñoz M. Hamilton S.L. Kaetzel M.A. Hazarika P. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15894-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the neuronal K+ and Ca2+ channels (26Naciff J.M. Behbehani M.M. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2004-C2015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (27Camors E. Charue D. Trouvé P. Monceau V. Loyer X. Russo-Marie F. Charlemagne D. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 40: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cardiac-specific overexpression of annexin A6 resulted in lower basal [Ca2+], a depression of [Ca2+]i transients and impaired cardiomyocyte contractility (28Gunteski Hamblin A.M. Song G. Walsh R.A. Frenzke M. Boivin G.P. Dorn G.W. Kaetzel M.A. Horseman N.D. Dedman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1091-H1100PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the cardiomyocytes from the annexin A6 null-mutant mice showed increased contractility and accelerated Ca2+ clearance (29Song G. Harding S.E. Duchen M.R. Tunwell R. O'Gara P. Hawkins T.E. Moss S.E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in mediating the intracellular Ca2+ signals, especially Ca2+ influx, ectopic overexpression of annexin A6 in A431 cells, which lack endogenous annexin A6, resulted in inhibition of EGF-dependent Ca2+ entry (30Fleet A. Ashworth R. Kubista H. Edwards H. Bolsover S. Mobbs P. Moss S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The difficulty of investigating the influence of annexins on signaling events occurring at the PM lies in the transient and reversible nature of their Ca2+ and pH-dependent lipid binding. Although the intracellular Ca2+ increase following receptor activation or Ca2+ influx promotes the association of the Ca2+-sensitive annexins A2 and A6 with the PM, the proteins quickly resume their cytoplasmic localization upon restoration of the basal [Ca2+]i (14Monastyrskaya K. Babiychuk E.B. Hostettler A. Rescher U. Draeger A. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the effects of membrane-associated annexins on Ca2+ homeostasis and the cell signaling machinery, we aimed to develop a model system allowing for a constitutive membrane association of annexins. Here we used the PM-anchoring sequences of the H- and K-Ras proteins to target annexins A6 and A1 to the PM independently of [Ca2+]. The Ras GTPases are resident at the inner leaflet of the PM and function as molecular switches (31Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 9 amino acids of H- and N-Ras and the C-terminal 14 amino acids of K-Ras comprise the signal sequences for membrane anchoring of Ras isoforms (32Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the palmitoylation and farnesylation of the C terminus of H-Ras (tH) serves as a targeting signal for predominantly cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains at the PM (lipid rafts/caveolae) (33Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), the polybasic group and the lipid anchor of K-Ras (tK) ensures the association of K-Ras with cholesterol-poor PM membrane domains. Importantly, these minimal C-terminal amino acid sequences are sufficient to target heterologous proteins, for example GFP, to different microdomains at the PM and influence their trafficking (34Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the present study we fused annexins A6, A2, and A1 with fluorescent proteins and introduced the PM-anchoring sequences of either H-Ras (annexin-tH) or K-Ras (annexin-tK) at the C termini of the fusion constructs. We demonstrate that the constitutive PM localization of annexin A6 results in down-regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. Expression of membrane-anchored annexin A6 causes an accumulation of the cortical F-actin, and cytoskeletal destabilization with latrunculin A abolishes the inhibitory effect of PM-anchored annexin A6 on SOCE. Taken together, our results implicate annexin A6 in the maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis via actin-dependent regulation of Ca2+ entry. Monoclonal antibodies against annexins were purchased from BD Transduction (Lexington, KY) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (JL-8) was from Clontech. Chemicals and purified bovine calmodulin were from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases, Taq polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Fluo-3/AM and jasplakinolide were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Latrunculin A was from Calbiochem. The pC1-based GFP-tH and GFP-tK plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. J. Hancock (IMB, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). These vectors were modified to replace GFP with the fluorescent proteins of choice (YFP or mCherry) and allow insertion of annexin sequences upstream of the fluorescent proteins' coding sequences. For this purpose, the coding sequences of YFP and mCherry proteins were amplified by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-ATAAAGCTAGCAAGCTTCTCGAGCGAGATCTCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′, corresponding to the fluorescent protein cDNA and containing NheI, HindIII, XhoI, and BglII cloning sites (underlined); the reverse primer, 5′-ATAAAGAATTCGACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG-3′, containing the EcoRI cloning site. The PCR products were ligated with a larger fragment of the NheI-EcoRI-digested GFP-tH or GFP-tH vectors, resulting in the replacement of the GFP coding sequence and introduction of unique cloning sites for insertion of annexins. Annexins A1 and A6 were cloned into pYFP-tH, -tK, pmCherry-tH and-tK, and pN1-mCherry (Clontech) as described previously (20Monastyrskaya K. Tschumi F. Babiychuk E.B. Stroka D. Draeger A. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Annexin A6-GFP-tK protein was created by cloning annexin A6 coding sequence into the NheI site located upstream of the GFP sequence of the original pC1-GFP-tK vector. The pEYFP-β-actin expression vector was from Clontech. HEK293 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids using electroporation (Bio-Rad) and analyzed after incubating at 37 °C for 48 h. Stable HEK293 cell lines expressing annexins A6YFP-tH, A6YFP-tH, and mCherry-tH were established using G-418 selection following the standard procedures. For cell proliferation analysis, cells were plated at equal density, harvested by trypsinization at selected time points, and counted following trypan blue extraction. Annexin A6 knockdown experiments in HEK293 cells were performed with shRNA targeting human annexin A6 (clone 1 (Pos. 322–372): 5′-GCAAGGACCTCATT GCTGATT-3′ and clone 2 (Pos. 2010–2030): 5′-ATGGTATCCC GCAGTGAGATT-3′) cloned into SureSilencing shRNA plasmids (SABiosciences). Cells were transfected with shRNA using electroporation and examined 48 h post-transfection. Levels of annexin A6 were assessed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Live cell imaging and calcium imaging recordings were performed as described (14Monastyrskaya K. Babiychuk E.B. Hostettler A. Rescher U. Draeger A. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were observed under an Axiovert 200M microscope with laser scanning module LSM 510 META (Zeiss) using a ×63 or a ×100 oil immersion lens. Images were acquired at a scanning speed of 2 s, with 1-s intervals between frames. Images of the Fluo-3/AM-loaded cells were recorded and analyzed using the “Physiology Evaluation” software package (Zeiss). Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Membrane preparation from HEK293 cells was performed using a detergent-free protocol (35Babiychuk E.B. Draeger A. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and Triton X-100 extraction of post-nuclear cell lysates followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation was done as described (36Monastyrskaya K. Hostettler A. Buergi S. Draeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7135-7146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound annexins were separated from the unbound proteins by low speed centrifugation (20 min, 12,000 rpm at 4 °C). The membrane-bound proteins in the pellet and the soluble proteins in the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-annexin antibodies. Image analysis to estimate the protein content of the individual bands following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed using PowerLook 1120 scanner and ImageQuant TL (v2003) software from Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH. The enzymatic activity of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) was determined essentially as described (37Zaidi A. Gao J. Squier T.C. Michaelis M.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 1998; 19: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, gradient-purified membranes (10 μg of protein) were incubated in an assay system containing, in a final volume of 200 μl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 200 μm EGTA, and CaCl2 to give 10 μm free Ca2+, determined using MaxChelator software. The reaction mixture was supplemented with 100 nm thapsigargin to inhibit sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Where specified, 2 μg (80 units) of purified bovine calmodulin were added. After 5-min preincubation at 37 °C, reaction was started by addition of 1 mm ATP, continued for 30 min, and stopped by addition of 500 μl of staining solution containing 14 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 0.3% ammonium molybdate, and 0.35 n H2SO4. After 20 min at room temperature, A820 was determined by spectrophotometry (DU 530, Beckman Coulter). The data were expressed as arbitrary units (optical density per μg of protein × 10). Statistically significant differences were determined with a Mann-Whitney U test with an α set to 0.05 for values not displaying a normal distribution, and with a two-tailed Student t test, preceded by a Levene test, with an α set to 0.05 for values with a normal distribution. Normality studies were done with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests (p < 0.05). All the studies were carried out with the SPSS program (version 15.0). We fused the coding sequences of annexin A6 to the fluorescent proteins (GFP or YFP) and the minimal PM targeting sequences of H- and K-Ras, and expressed the resulting proteins following transient transfection of HEK293 cells. The chimeric proteins had an approximate molecular mass of 95 kDa, and were detected by Western blotting with both anti-GFP and anti-annexin A6 antibodies (Fig. 1A). The proteins constitutively localized to the PM of transfected cells under resting conditions (basal [Ca2+]i, Fig. 1B for A6GFP-tK), with some additional Golgi labeling of A6YFP-tH (not shown). We then studied the effects of [Ca2+] on the PM association of A6YFP-tK and -tH proteins. Membrane association of the tK- and tH-tagged annexin A6 was compared with that of endogenous annexin A6 following low speed centrifugation in presence of either 0.2 mm Ca2+, or 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 1C). Endogenous annexin A6 detached from the membranes in the presence of EGTA and was detected in the soluble fraction, whereas both tK- and tH-tagged annexin A6 fusion proteins remained PM-associated, indicating that the Ras membrane anchors were sufficient for Ca2+-independent binding. We then analyzed whether the annexin A6 fusion proteins retained the properties of endogenous annexin A6 by disrupting the Ras tag-mediated membrane anchoring using 0.5% Triton X-100 extraction (33Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Membranes prepared from a mixture of A6YFP-tH- and GFP-tH-expressing HEK293 cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+, and the distributions of A6YFP-tH, GFP-tH, endogenous annexin A6, and RhoA in sucrose gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Under these conditions, endogenous H- and K-Ras are found in soluble fractions (33Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and consistent with these findings, most of the GFP-tH was extracted with Triton X-100 and found in high density gradient fractions (fractions 5–8), similar to RhoA (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Endogenous annexin A6 was associated predominantly with low density fractions (fractions 3 and 4) in the presence of Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S1B). Importantly, Ras-tagged A6YFP-tH displayed the same distribution as endogenous annexin A6 within the gradient and was found almost exclusively in fractions 3–5 in the presence of Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Similar results were obtained when using a mixture of A6YFP-tK and GFP-tK membranes (supplemental Fig. S1C). These data strongly suggest that Triton X-100 extraction disrupts the membrane association of Ras-anchored annexin A6 and annexin A6 fusion proteins then behave like endogenous annexin A6 in their ability to interact with membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Earlier observations implicated annexin A6 in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (28Gunteski Hamblin A.M. Song G. Walsh R.A. Frenzke M. Boivin G.P. Dorn G.W. Kaetzel M.A. Horseman N.D. Dedman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1091-H1100PubMed Google Scholar, 29Song G. Harding S.E. Duchen M.R. Tunwell R. O'Gara P. Hawkins T.E. Moss S.E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Fleet A. Ashworth R. Kubista H. Edwards H. Bolsover S. Mobbs P. Moss S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), therefore we examined whether its constitutive association with the PM had an effect on Ca2+ transients or Ca2+ entry into the cells. In all experiments, cells expressing mCherry protein, tagged to the PM with tH or tK membrane anchors served as a control for the nonspecific effects of transfection on cellular Ca2+ responses. Both mCherry-tK and A6GFP-tK-expressing cells were co-cultured on the same coverslip and loaded with Fluo-3/AM, and Ca2+ responses were recorded simultaneously (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows the result from a representative experiment. The intracellular Ca2+ release was examined by applying 10 μm CCh in Ca2+-free Na+-Tyrode buffer. Both A6GFP-tK and mCherry-tK cells produced a similar Ca2+ transient, indicating no differences in the filling of intracellular Ca2+ stores. When the SOCE was stimulated by addition of 1 μm thapsigargin (TG) followed by 2 mm or 5 mm [Ca2+]ex, an attenuation of Ca2+ entry was observed in the cells expressing A6GFP-tK (Fig. 2B). Statistical evaluation of data from five independent experiments (n = 22 recordings), showed that the SOCE in A6GFP-tK-expressing cells was on average 60% of the control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2D). Given the different subcellular microlocalization of the tH- and tK membrane anchors (32Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next analyzed the effects of annexin A6, tagged with tH, on SOCE, using the same experimental set-up as described above for A6GFP-tK, with mCherry-tH serving as a control (Fig. 2C). The average of five experiments and a comparison of the effects of A6GFP-tK and A6YFP-tH on SOCE (Fig. 2D) demonstrates that, in addition to the attenuation of SOCE, observed both in A6GFP-tK- and A6YFP-tH-expressing cells (60% of control), there was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction of basal [Ca2+]i, and the amplitude of CCh-mediated transient in A6YFP-tH cells, compared with cells expressing tK-tagged A6 (Fig. 2D). Previously annexin A6 has been implicated in the regulation of EGF-stimulated Ca2+ entry into A431 cells (30Fleet A. Ashworth R. Kubista H. Edwards H. Bolsover S. Mobbs P. Moss S.E. Biochem. Biophys.

We performed similar experiments using A6YFP-tH- and mCherry-tH-transfected A431 cells and identified a down-regulation of EGF-stimulated Ca2+ entry (supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, these results indicate that the constitutive PM association of annexin A6 caused a decrease of Ca2+ entry. To asses the effects of cytoplasmic versus PM-targeted annexin A6 on SOCE, we co-cultured HEK293 cells, expressing cytoplasmic annexin A6 fused with mCherry (A6-mCherry), A6YFP-tH, and mCherry-tH (Fig. 3A), and treated them with CCh, followed by SOCE stimulation at 2 and 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). In the control experiment, at these [Ca2+]ex levels untagged A6-mCherry remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). There was no significant difference in basal [Ca2+]i, the amplitude of CCh-induced intracellular Ca2+ release, or SOCE between the cells expressing mCherry-tH (control) and cytoplasmic A6-mCherry, whereas both the store contents and SOCE were decreased in A6YFP-tH-expressing cells (Fig. 3B for a representative recording, Fig. 3C for the average of n = 9 recordings). These results indicate that a PM association of annexin A6 was required to elicit a distinct effect on the amplitude of SOCE. Previously we showed that ectopically expressed annexin A6 translocated to the PM in live cells treated with ionomycin or TG upon elevation of [Ca2+]i (14Monastyrskaya K. Babiychuk E.B. Hostettler A. Rescher U. Draeger A. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the set of experiments described above (Fig. 3, A–C), by choosing the appropriate [Ca2+]ex., we kept [Ca2+]i below the threshold levels required for annexin A6 PM translocation. However, when HEK293 cells were treated with TG, followed by addition of 7 mm or 10 mm [Ca2+]ex, large amounts of annexin A6-mCherry associated with the PM (Fig. 3D). Similarly, endogenous annexin A6 associated with the PM of Ca2+-ionomicin or TG-tr"
https://openalex.org/W2017489850,"Prey DNA from diet samples can be used as a dietary marker; yet current methods for prey detection require a priori diet knowledge and/or are designed ad hoc, limiting their scope. I present a general approach to detect diverse prey in the feces or gut contents of predators.In the example outlined, I take advantage of the restriction site for the endonuclease Pac I which is present in 16S mtDNA of most Odontoceti mammals, but absent from most other relevant non-mammalian chordates and invertebrates. Thus in DNA extracted from feces of these mammalian predators Pac I will cleave and exclude predator DNA from a small region targeted by novel universal primers, while most prey DNA remain intact allowing prey selective PCR. The method was optimized using scat samples from captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) fed a diet of 6-10 prey species from three phlya. Up to five prey from two phyla were detected in a single scat and all but one minor prey item (2% of the overall diet) were detected across all samples. The same method was applied to scat samples from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins; up to seven prey taxa were detected in a single scat and 13 prey taxa from eight teleost families were identified in total.Data and further examples are provided to facilitate rapid transfer of this approach to any predator. This methodology should prove useful to zoologists using DNA-based diet techniques in a wide variety of study systems."
https://openalex.org/W1997831277,"This report addresses the functional role of His residues in the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT; SLC46A1), which mediates intestinal folate absorption. Of ten His residues, only H247A and H281A mutations altered function. The folic acid influx Kt at pH 5.5 for H247A was ↓8.4-fold. Although wild type (WT)-PCFT Ki values varied among the folates, Ki values were much lower and comparable for H247-A, -R, -Q, or -E mutants. Homology modeling localized His247 to the large loop separating transmembrane domains 6 and 7 at the cytoplasmic entrance of the translocation pathway in hydrogen-bond distance to Ser172. The folic acid influx Kt for S172A-PCFT was decreased similar to H247A. His281 faces the extracellular region in the seventh transmembrane domain. H281A-PCFT results in loss-of-function due to ∼12-fold↑ in the folic acid influx Kt. When the pH was decreased from 5.5 to 4.5, the WT-PCFT folic acid influx Kt was unchanged, but the Kt decreased 4-fold for H281A. In electrophysiological studies in Xenopus oocytes, both WT-PCFT- and H281A-PCFT-mediated folic acid uptake produced current and acidification, and both exhibited a low level of folate-independent proton transport (slippage). Slippage was markedly increased for the H247A-PCFT mutant. The data suggest that disruption of the His247 to Ser172 interaction results in a PCFT conformational alteration causing a loss of selectivity, increased substrate access to a high affinity binding pocket, and proton transport in the absence of a folate gradient. The His281 residue is not essential for proton coupling but plays an important role in PCFT protonation, which, in turn, augments folate binding to the carrier.

This laboratory recently identified SLC46A1 as a proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) 2The abbreviations used are: PCFTproton-coupled folate transporter (SLC46A1, SLC is the Human Genome Organization nomenclature for solute carrier genes, all capital names represent human genes, whereas lowercase designations represent orthologs from other species)5-formyl-THF5-formyltetrahydrofolate5-methylTHF5-methyltetrahydrofolateMTXmethotrexateGlpTglycerol-3-phosphate transporter. that mediates transport of folates across the apical (brush border) membrane of enterocytes within the acidic microclimate at the absorptive surface of the proximal jejunum (1Qiu A.

The critical role that PCFT plays at this epithelium was confirmed with the demonstration by this laboratory that there are loss-of-function mutations in this gene in patients with the autosomal recessive disorder, hereditary folate malabsorption (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, 229050) (1Qiu A.

Hereditary folate malabsorption is characterized by impaired intestinal folate absorption and impaired transport of folates into the central nervous system (3Geller J. Kronn D. Jayabose S. Sandoval C. Medicine (Baltimore). 2002; 81: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the latter likely due to a defect in transport across the blood-choroid plexus-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. While operating most efficiently at low pH, PCFT contributes to the transport of folates and the pharmacological activity of the new generation antifolate, pemetrexed, even at neutral pH (4Zhao R. Qiu A. Tsai E. Jansen M. Akabas M.H. Goldman I.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PCFT may be even more important to the delivery of this, and possibly other antifolates, within the acidic interstitium of solid tumors (5Helmlinger G. Yuan F. Dellian M. Jain R.K. Nat.

Although facilitative carriers in lower organisms commonly use a proton gradient to drive uphill transport of substrates (10Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there are only eight proton-coupled solute carrier families in humans; pcft is the latest to be identified (1Qiu A. Jansen M. Sakaris A. Min S.H.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Prior to the identification of PCFT, proton-coupled uphill folate transport was demonstrated in membrane vesicles derived from rat hepatocytes (15Horne D.W. Reed K.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in rabbit jejunal brush border membrane vesicles (16Schron C.M. J. Membr.

In the latter case, His residues were implicated, because this process was blocked by diethyl pyrocarbonate (18Said H.M. Mohammadkhani R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, diethyl pyrocarbonate effects are nonspecific; this reagent can also react with tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine residues (19Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 20Cohen L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1968; 37: 695-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The current study was designed to assess directly, by site-directed mutagenesis, the potential role that His residues might play in folate transport mediated by the human PCFT. This study also addresses, for the first time, the direct assessment of cellular acidification, and the relationship between folate and proton transport in wild-type and His mutants, which accompanies PCFT-mediated transport in Xenopus oocytes. Tritiated folic acid (diammonium salt, 3′,5′,7,9-[3H], cat. no. MT-783) and methotrexate (MTX-disodium salt, 3′,5′,7-[3H](N), cat. no. MT701) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA), purified by liquid chromatography, and maintained as previously described (21Fry D.W. Yalowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled folic acid and tunicamycin (T7765) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MTX, (6S)5-formylTHF, and (6S)5-methylTHF were obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Protease inhibitor mixture (cat. no. 11836170001) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were of the highest purity available from commercial sources. HeLa cells, originally obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA), have been maintained in this laboratory in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HeLa R1-11 cells (4Zhao R. Qiu A. Tsai E. Jansen M. Akabas M.H. Goldman I.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) is a more stable subclone of the HeLa R1 cell line (22Zhao R. Chattopadhyay S. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8735-8742Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that lacks both PCFT and reduced folate carrier expression, the later due to a genomic deletion. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for transient transfection of plasmid DNAs into these cells. R1-11 or HeLa cells were transfected with empty pcDNA3.1(+) vector (mock), or the same vector containing wild-type (WT), or mutant pcft cDNAs. Tunicamycin was dissolved in DMSO and added to growth medium to achieve a concentration of 1 μg/ml, a level previously shown to block the N-linked glycosylation of PCFT with minimal loss of cell viability (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to tunicamycin in growth medium for 48 h following which they were prepared for Western blot analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the QuikChange II XL protocol from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). WT-pcft cDNA, cloned into the BamHI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+), was used as the template (1Qiu A. Jansen M. Sakaris A. Min S.H. Chattopadhyay S. Tsai E. Sandoval C. Zhao R. Akabas M.H. Goldman I.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 917-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Briefly, complementary forward and reverse primers, which carry the targeted nucleotide changes in the middle region, were designed individually for introducing Ala into human pcft primary sequence at positions indicated in supplemental Table S1. Initial DNA denaturation, number of plasmid amplification cycles, and annealing and extension conditions were the same as previously defined (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DpnI (10 units/μl) restriction enzyme was used to digest the parental double strand DNA. The mixture (3 μl) was transformed into DH5α-competent cells (Invitrogen). Plasmids carrying the desired mutations were identified by DNA-automated sequencing in the Albert Einstein Cancer Center Genomics Shared Resource. The entire coding region of pcft was sequenced to confirm the mutation and the fidelity of DNA. A hemagglutinin (HA) peptide epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was fused to the C terminus of WT and the various pcft constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The C-HA-pcft vector was used as a template for the amino acid substitutions at His247, His281, and Ser172. The forward primers used to introduce these mutations are shown in supplemental Table S1. To express WT and mutant transporters in Xenopus oocytes, WT-pcft was initially cloned into the pGEMHE vector at the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites (24Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The pGEMHE vector carrying WT-pcft was employed as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to create the H281A construct using the same primers as described above (supplemental Table S1). Influx measurements were performed by rapid determination of membrane transport parameters as previously described (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). R1-11 cells were seeded in 17-mm glass scintillation vials at 4 × 105 cells/ml density. Influx was assessed at mid-log phase growth ∼72 h after transfection. Most transport studies were performed in MES-buffered saline (20 mm MES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dextrose), at pH 5.5. This buffer was titrated to achieve pH levels of 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, and 6.5. For pH levels ≥ 7.0, MES-buffered saline was replaced with HBS and titrated to the appropriate pH. Cells were incubated in HEPES buffer (HBS) (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dextrose, at pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min before transfer into the prewarmed uptake buffer containing tritiated folate/antifolate substrate. Uptake was halted after 1 min by the injection of 8 ml of HBS (pH 7.4) at 0 °C, an interval over which the relationship between cell folate and time was linear and the ordinate intercept at zero time was near the point of origin. Cells were washed twice in the 0 °C HBS buffer after which radioactivity and protein levels were determined as reported previously (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Influx is expressed as picomoles of [3H]MTX or [3H]folic acid/mg of protein/min. [3H]Folic acid and [3H]MTX influx kinetic parameters (Kt and Vmax) were obtained from a non-linear regression of influx as a function of extracellular folate/antifolate concentration according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Influx Ki values for (6S)5-formylTHF, (6S)5-methylTHF, and folic acid were based upon inhibition of [3H]MTX influx according to the formula: Vinhibited = VmaxS/(1 + i/Ki)Kt + S, where i and S are the inhibitor and substrate concentrations, respectively, and Kt and Vmax are the parameters determined for WT-PCFT. The [3H]MTX concentrations used were comparable to the Kt for each PCFT construct, and the concentrations of inhibitors were adjusted so that the level of inhibition achieved was in the 35–65% range. As reported previously (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), a rabbit anti-HA antibody (#H6908) obtained from Sigma was used to detect HA-tagged proteins in cell plasma membrane protein fractions prepared from HeLa cells transiently transfected with empty vector (mock), WT-pcft, or mutant constructs at equal amounts. Briefly, to obtain membrane fractions, 200 μl (106 cells) were incubated on ice for 30 min in hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA at pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, the pellet was dissolved in 20 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA buffer. Proteins were dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.225 m Tris.Cl (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue) with 0.25 m dithiothreitol). A 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was used to resolve the proteins, which were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Transfer Membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After antibody treatment, membranes were processed by the ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit β-actin antibody (#4967L, Cell Signaling Technology) was used to determine the loading amounts. Xenopus oocytes were employed to assess the functional roles of the WT and mutant pcfts based upon currents generated and intracellular acidification. cRNA (23 ng in 50 nl) or water (50 nl) were injected into stage V/VI oocytes, and electrophysiological measurements were made 3–7 days later. Voltage electrodes were made from fiber-capillary borosilicate and filled with 3 m KCl; pH electrodes were pulled similarly, silanized, filled with hydrogen ionophore 1 mixture B (Fluka), and back-filled with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). These procedures and the electrical configuration were the same as described previously (25Chang M.H. DiPiero J. Sönnichsen F.D. Romero M.F. J. Biol.

Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar). For these experiments, as with the divalent metal transporter, DMT1, oocytes were voltage clamped to −90 mV to maximize folate-induced currents (26Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y.

ND90 solution (96 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) was pH-adjusted using Tris (for pH 7.4) or MES (for pH 4.5–5.5). During these experiments, oocytes were continuously superfused with ND90 solutions (with and without folates as indicated) at 5 ml/min. Related, experimentally solved three-dimensional structures were identified based upon the sequence of human PCFT with the PSIPRED fold recognition program (28McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The most suitable template was that of glycerol-3-phosphate (GlpT) transporter from Escherichia coli (Protein Data Bank code 1pw4) sharing 14% sequence identity to PCFT (29Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional comparative protein structure model for PCFT was built using the Multiple Mapping Method (30Rai B.K. Madrid-Aliste C.J. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2691-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Rai B.K. Fiser A. Proteins. 2006; 63: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This method employs an alignment optimization algorithm to produce accurate input alignment between the target and template for the MODELLER program (32Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

The quality of the resulting model was checked with PROSA energy function (34Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). Electrostatic potential around the molecule was calculated with the DelPhi macromolecular electrostatics modeling package (35Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar) and visualized in GRASP2 (36Petrey D. Honig B. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 492-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). pKa values for charged residues were obtained from multiconformation continuum electrostatics calculations (37Alexov E.G.

Multiconformation continuum electrostatics combines continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics force fields in Monte Carlo sampling to simultaneously calculate side-chain ionization and conformation. Data presented are the means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed by the two-tailed Student's paired t test. All statistical analyses utilized GraphPad Prism (version 3.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software). The human PCFT protein (SLC46A1, NP_542400) consists of 459 amino acids with 10 His residues in the primary sequence. Transmembrane topology prediction programs identified 12 integral transmembrane helices with N and C termini located within the cytoplasm (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Accordingly, His140 is located in the second extracellular loop, His247 and His248 in the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains (TMDs) VI and VII, His281 in TMD VII, and His312 in TMD VIII. Five His residues (His49, His84, His201, His266, and His449) are at membrane-aqueous interfaces (Fig. 1). Although all His residues are partially conserved, His84, His247, and His281 are identical in all species (supplemental Table S2). All ten His residues were individually replaced with Ala. The mutant pcft cDNA constructs, along with WT-pcft and the empty vector (mock), were transiently transfected, individually, into HeLa-R1-11 cells. As indicated in Fig. 2, influx of 0.5 μm [3H]MTX over 1 min at pH 5.5 in cells transiently transfected with the H49A, H84A, H140A, and H201A mutants was equal to that of the WT carrier with only a modest reduction in function of the H248A and H449A mutants. There were substantial reductions in function for the H247A and H281A mutants, both fully conserved, and, to a much lesser extent, the H312A mutant that is not fully conserved. The pattern of transport changes was the same when influx of 0.5 μm [3H]MTX was assessed in the absence of a proton driving force at pH 7.0, although the overall rate was substantially lower (∼1/25th the rate at pH 5.5, data not shown). These results indicated that His247 and His281 are residues that play important roles in PCFT function. Western blot analyses of crude cell plasma membrane protein fractions were evaluated to assess levels of protein expression of the two fully conserved mutants along with the H312A mutant. Immunoblots of crude membrane protein fractions from HeLa cells transiently transfected with empty vector (mock) or C-HA-tagged WT-pcft, H247A, H281A, and H312A-pcft mutants are shown in Fig. 3A. At equivalent protein loading, H281A and H312A expression was similar to WT-pcft. The H247A mutant protein migrated at ∼47 kDa as a narrower band, faster than the other proteins that ran as a broad band at ∼55 kDa. To determine the role of glycosylation in this pattern along with the structural integrity of the H247A mutant, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with WT-PCFT or the H247A mutant and incubated with 1.0 μg/ml tunicamycin for 48 h. Cell membrane protein fractions were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis along with membranes from cells transfected with the N58Q/N68Q double mutant (deglycosylated PCFT) (23Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 3B, high molecular weight broad PCFT bands disappeared for the WT carrier and the protein migrated at the same size (∼35 kDa) as the deglycosylated (C-HA-N58Q/N68Q) carrier. Similarly, the H247A mutant protein showed a size shift from ∼47 kDa to ∼35 kDa in cells exposed to tunicamycin. Hence, H247A PCFT is expressed to the same extent as WT-PCFT, and the protein is not degraded. Rather, the alteration in protein mobility for the H247A mutant appears to be due to a change in the extent of glycosylation or a protein conformational change. There were profound and distinct changes in influx kinetics mediated by the H247A mutant as compared with WT-PCFT (Fig. 4A). The influx Kt for folic acid decreased by a factor of ∼8.4 (from 1.43 ± 0.64 to 0.17 ± 0.03 μm). This was associated with a ∼11-fold decrease in influx Vmax (from 247 ± 37 to 23 ± 1.5 pmol/mg/min). Hence, this amino acid substitution resulted in a marked increase in the affinity of carrier for folic acid. The change in folic acid influx kinetics for the H281A mutant was quite different (Fig. 4B). The influx Kt for folic acid increased ∼12-fold (from 1.88 ± 0.58 to 21.4 ± 2.8 μm). The Vmax values for the WT-PCFT and H281A mutant were similar (743 ± 84 and 715 ± 49 pmol/mg/min, respectively, p > 0.05). Hence, in the case of this mutant, the major change was a marked decrease in carrier affinity for folic acid. The inter-experimental differences between Vmax values are due to differences in transient transfection efficiency which affect Vmax, but not Kt, determinations. The loss of function for the H312A mutant was small, and this was, as expected, associated with small changes in folic acid influx kinetics. The folic acid influx Kt for H312A was only 2-fold higher than WT-PCFT (2.43 ± 0.3 versus 1.22 ± 0.12 μm, respectively). This was accompanied by a 2-fold decrease in influx Vmax of 127 ± 4.5 versus 256 ± 5.7 pmol/mg/min, respectively (data not shown). Substrate specificity of the three His mutants was evaluated. The pcft cDNA constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa-R1-11 cells and inhibition of 0.5 μm [3H]MTX influx by several other folates (at 2 μm) was assessed. As indicated in Fig. 5A, the pattern of [3H]MTX influx inhibition was 5-methyl-THF > 5-formylTHF > folic acid for WT-PCFT. To facilitate comparison of the degree of inhibition by folates, the data were plotted as a percentage of control influx in the absence of inhibitors for each pcft construct (Fig. 5B). The pattern of inhibition of MTX influx into H281A and H312A transfectants by the various folates was similar to that of WT-pcft transfectants. However, the magnitude and pattern of inhibition was remarkably different for the H247A mutant. The degree of inhibition was markedly increased and was comparable for all the folates. This was more evident when the inhibitor concentration was decreased to a level (0.25 μm) so low that there was no inhibition at all of MTX influx mediated by WT-PCFT. Under these conditions there still was marked (∼40%), and comparable, inhibition of MTX influx into the H247A transfectant by the three folate substrates (supplemental Fig. S1). Ki values were computed based upon inhibition of 0.5 μm [3H]MTX influx by 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF, or folic acid, each at 2 μm for the WT carrier, and each at 0.25 μm for the H247A mutant (Table 1). Influx Ki values for the H247A mutant were similar for all the substrates and were decreased by factors of ∼3.4, ∼7, and ∼8 for 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF, and folic acid, respectively, as compared with the WT-PCFT. Hence, the H247A mutation resulted in both increased affinity for all its folate substrates and a loss of substrate selectivity.TABLE 1Ki values for 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF, and folic acid based upon inhibition of 0.5 μm [3H]MTX influxki5-formylTHF5-methylTHFFolic acidμmWT-PCFT1.17 ± 0.120.67 ± 0.211.63 ± 0.18H247A0.17 ± 0.020.20 ± 0.010.20 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab To further explore the role of the His247 residue in PCFT function, other mutants were constructed with a variety of amino acid substitutions. When His was replaced with Arg (positively charged) there was a marked loss of function (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, substitution with the uncharged Gln produced transport activity higher than that of H247A; substitution with the negatively charged Glu preserved t"
https://openalex.org/W2015283443,"A functional collaboration between growth factor receptors such as platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and integrins is required for effective signal transduction in response to soluble growth factors. However, the mechanisms of synergistic PDGFR/integrin signaling remain poorly understood. Our previous work showed that cell surface tissue transglutaminase (tTG) induces clustering of integrins and amplifies integrin signaling by acting as an integrin binding adhesion co-receptor for fibronectin. Here we report that in fibroblasts tTG enhances PDGFR-integrin association by interacting with PDGFR and bridging the two receptors on the cell surface. The interaction between tTG and PDGFR reduces cellular levels of the receptor by accelerating its turnover. Moreover, the association of PDGFR with tTG causes receptor clustering, increases PDGF binding, promotes adhesion-mediated and growth factor-induced PDGFR activation, and up-regulates downstream signaling. Importantly, tTG is required for efficient PDGF-dependent proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for cell surface tTG in the regulation of the joint PDGFR/integrin signaling and PDGFR-dependent cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W1985795125,"Determining proper responsiveness to incoming signals is fundamental to all biological systems. We demonstrate that intracellular signaling nodes can tune a signaling network's response threshold away from the basal median effective concentration established by ligand-receptor interactions. Focusing on the bistable kinase network that governs progesterone-induced meiotic entry in Xenopus oocytes, we characterized glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) as a dampener of progesterone responsiveness. GSK-3beta engages the meiotic kinase network through a double-negative feedback loop; this specific feedback architecture raises the progesterone threshold in correspondence with the strength of double-negative signaling. We also identified a marker of nutritional status, l-leucine, which lowers the progesterone threshold, indicating that oocytes integrate additional signals into their cell-fate decisions by modulating progesterone responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1986674952,"How transcription factors interpret the output from signal transduction pathways to drive distinct programs of gene expression is a key issue that underpins development and disease. The ubiquitously expressed basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper upstream stimulating factor-1 binds E-box regulatory elements (CANNTG) to regulate a wide number of gene networks. In particular, USF-1 is a key component of the tanning process. Following UV irradiation, USF-1 is phosphorylated by the p38 stress-activated kinase on threonine 153 and directly up-regulates expression of the POMC, MC1R, TYR, TYRP-1 and DCT genes. However, how phosphorylation on Thr-153 might affect the activity of USF-1 is unclear. Here we show that, in response to DNA damage, oxidative stress and cellular infection USF-1 is acetylated in a phospho-Thr-153-dependent fashion. Phospho-acetylated USF-1 is nuclear and interacts with DNA but displays altered gene regulatory properties. Phospho-acetylated USF-1 is thus proposed to be associated with loss of transcriptional activation properties toward several target genes implicated in pigmentation process and cell cycle regulation. The identification of this critical stress-dependent USF-1 modification gives new insights into understanding USF-1 gene expression modulation associated with cancer development.

The identification of this critical stress-dependent USF-1 modification gives new insights into understanding USF-1 gene expression modulation associated with cancer development. The ability of a cell to direct specific programs of gene regulation that enable it to adapt to changing environmental cues is mediated by the response of transcription factors to signal transduction pathways. Whether a gene is activated will therefore depend on a combination of the repertoire of transcription factors that may decorate its promoter, together with signaling-dependent post-translational modifications of those factors that regulate their interaction with specific transcriptional cofactors. A further level of regulation may be achieved if signal transduction-induced post-translational modifications of transcription factors lead to alterations in their ability to bind different sets of genes. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning post-translational-dependent targeting of transcription factors to distinct gene sets is relatively unexplored. The basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor USF-1 binds to characteristic E-box elements via base-specific DNA contacts with its basic region and can homo- and heterodimerize with the related USF-2 transcription factor (1.Corre S.

Because 6-bp E-box motifs (CANNTG), including the canonical sequence (CACGTG) and the M-box subtype (CATGTG), are well represented within promoter sequences, USF proteins regulate transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in the immune response (Ig Chain, C4) (6.Galibert M.D. Boucontet L.

Previously we implicated the USF-1 transcription factor as a key stress-responsive, regulatory element of the pigmentation cascade in response to UV stimulation (12.Corre S. Primot A. Sviderskaya E.

However, although phosphorylation of USF-1 by p38 leads to altered gene regulatory activity, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of USF-1 by p38 have not been fully determined. We now demonstrate that USF-1 is subject to a post-translational modification cascade in which p38-dependent phosphorylation on Thr-153 is a pre-requisite to acetylation of lysine 199 lying immediately adjacent to the USF-1 basic region that in turn leads to altered gene regulation. Taken together our data highlight a novel mechanism that directs USF-1 to an altered repertoire of target genes. Human 501mel, and mice B16F1 melanoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (catalogue no. 21875-034, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 3The abbreviations used are: FBSfetal bovine serumMMSmethylmethane sulfonateVSVvesicular stomatitis virusWTwild typeAbantibodyChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation. and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics (Invitrogen), in a controlled atmosphere (10% CO2). fetal bovine serum methylmethane sulfonate vesicular stomatitis virus wild type antibody chromatin immunoprecipitation. BLM 1492 and CS6269 human fibroblasts, isolated, respectively, from patients that displayed Bloom and Cockaine syndromes (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cat. No. 41966-029, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics in a controlled atmosphere (5% CO2). DNA damage was obtained using specific UV lights (UVB 312 nm and UVC 254 nm) using UV Stratalinker apparatus (Stratagene), methylmethane sulfonate (MMS: 0.2 mm and 1 mm), and hydroxyurea (2 μm). Oxidative stress was performed with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2: 0–10 mm) and menadione (0.1 μm). Heavy metal stress was obtained with cadmium (5 μm) and arsenic (5 μm). Briefly, cells were plated at 50–70% confluence, depending on their doubling time, in 10- and 3.5-cm diameter Petri dishes for, respectively, RNA and protein preparation, such that they reached 80% confluence at the harvesting time. 12 h before stress induction, medium was replaced with medium containing only 1% FBS. Chemical inductions were then obtained by adding specific compounds directly into the medium. UVB induction was performed as previously described (12.Corre S. Primot A. Sviderskaya E. Bennett D.C. Vaulont S. Goding C.R. Galibert M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51226-51233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When required, cells were pre-treated, for 1 h prior to stimulation, with specific inhibitors of p38α and -β (10 μm SB203580), p38β kinase (10 μm SB202190), mitogen-activated protein kinase (10 μm U0126), Cyclin A2/B1-CDC2 (10 μm roscovitin and 10 μm olomucin), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (200 nm wortmannin), Braf protein (1 μm ZM336372), p70 S6 kinase (1 nm rapamycin), protein kinase A-protein kinase C (100 nm bisindolylmaleimide), and the deacetylases (Trichostatin A 100 nm to 10 μm). Stimulated monolayer cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping and then centrifuged at a low speed. Cell pellets were resuspended in either 350 μl of lysis buffer (Nucleospin® RNA II extraction kit, Macherey-Nagel®, or RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen®) solution for mRNA extraction, or resuspended in Laemmli buffer for Western blotting analysis. To prevent action of proteases, phosphatases and deacetylases, respectively, proteases inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), phosphatases inhibitor (sodium fluoride 25 mm, orthovanadate 1 mm, and β-glycerophosphate 25 mm) and deacetylases inhibitor sodium butyrate (10 mm) were added to the medium before induction and also in cells lyses buffer. VSV strain (vesicular stomatitis virus, a kind gift of A. Ruffaud) was amplified in vitro using Vero cells. The titer, estimated by plaque assays with Vero cells, was 5 × 106 plate forming units per ml (pfu/ml). Infections were performed in CS6269 fibroblasts and 501mel cells with gradual dilutions of virus solutions. 24 h post-infections, cells were recovered for Western blotting protein analysis. The Mycoplasma hyorrhinis strain was isolated from the supernatant of a contaminated cell line. Contamination of CS6269, BLM1492, and 501mel cells, were monitored by immunofluorescent staining using Hoechst solution, included in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting medium (Vectashield®, Vector), according to manufacturer's instructions. Contaminated cells were recovered also for Western blot analysis. Cell viability in response to H2O2 was analyzed in a 96-well plate. Briefly, 501mel cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/well, 8 h before H2O2 inductions, which were performed at increasing concentrations from 50 nm up to 100 mm. 24 h post-induction, tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/ml (M2128, Sigma) was added at 0.5 mg/ml to the cell culture medium. After 4 h of incubation (37 °C), the medium was removed and 150 μl of DMSO was added to each well to solubilize salt crystals. Percentage of cell viability was then analyzed by measuring the DMSO-optical density, at 690 and 540 nm with a Multiskan spectrophotometer, as the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt (yellow) is transformed in formazan (purpal) by the mitochondrial deshydrogenase enzyme in viable cells. None-induced cells were used as the reference. Wild-type pCMV-USF-1 constructs with T153E and T153A mutants have been previously described (13.Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. Embo J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The K188R, K199R, K214R, K286R, K288R, and K306R USF-1 mutant forms were obtained by single mutation of the WT pCMV-USF-1 using the Stratagene® QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (200518-5) according to the manufacturer's specifications. All vectors were sequenced previously to their use. Details of the cloning strategies can be provided under request. 501mel cells were plated in 10% FBS-supplemented medium and allowed to grow overnight to 80% confluence. Transfections were performed using FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg of plasmid DNA for 6 wells plates or 6 μg for 10-cm Petri dishes. 48 h post-transfection, cells were or not induced with UVB (400 J/m2) or 1 mm H2O2, for 3 h. Whole cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, using a 200:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio. Following blotting, membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies, and positive signals were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies, visualized by ECL Super Signal Detection Kit (Pierce). The primary antibodies used were the polyclonal anti-USF-1 (SC-229, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-USF-2 (SC-861, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Lamin B (SC-6216, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetylated-K (AB3879, Chemicon International), anti-Ub (SC-6085, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p38 antibodies (9212, Cell Signaling) and the monoclonal anti-tubulin (T5201, Sigma), anti-P-p38 Ab (9211, Cell Signaling), and anti-SV5 flag antibodies (MCA1360CA, Serotec). Phosphoproteins purification was performed from mycoplasma-contaminated BLM 1492 cells using the PhosphoProtein purification kit (37101, Qiagen®), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, proteins that carry a phosphate group on any amino acid are bound with high specificity to PhosphoProtein purification resin, whereas proteins without phosphate groups do not bind to the resin and can therefore be found in the flow-through fraction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed in CS6268 and 501mel cell lines, as previously described (12.Corre S. Primot A. Sviderskaya E. Bennett D.C. Vaulont S. Goding C.R. Galibert M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51226-51233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and using μMACS Protein G MicroBeads (Miteney Biotec). ChIP products were eluted and recovered by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 100 μl of H2O for PCR. The primers used to amplify the different promoters are available on request. The DNA-binding mobility assays were performed using both mycoplasma-free and mycoplasma-contaminated BLM 1492 whole cell extracts or following 501mel cells transfection with various SV5 tag USF-1 expression vectors following the protocol described previously (16.Carreira S. Liu B. Goding C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21920-21927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Either the consensus M box (5′-TCTCAGCCAAGACATGTGATAATCACTGT-3′) located in the human TYR promoter (−183) or the derived E-box (5′-TCTCAGCCAAGACACGTGATAATCACTGT-3′) were 32P-labeled to used as a probe. Supershift was obtained with the polyclonal anti-USF-1 antibody. RNA was extracted by using the Nucleospin® RNA II extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel) or RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instruction. Recovered RNA was quantified using the Nanodrop device (Nanodrop Technology). Reverse transcription reactions were carried out using the reverse transcriptase avian myeloblastosis virus enzyme (11495062001, Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's specific recommendations, with 1 μg of total RNA and 300 ng of random primer (48190-011, Invitrogen). Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in sealed 96-well microtiter plates using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), and the results were evaluated using the associated software (version 1.2.3, Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was also carried out in a 100-well disc using the SensiMixPlus SYBR (QT605, Quantace) using the Rotor-GeneTM 6000 (Corbett Life Science). The 18 S ribosomal RNA subunit, the values of which remain constant over time, was used as a housekeeping gene. The relative amounts of transcripts were determined using the ΔCt method. The mRNA levels at each time point following stimulation are expressed as a -fold increase compared with non-stimulated control cells. Each experiment was carried out at least twice, and each time point was done in duplicate. Forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were designed using the Universal Probe Library Assay Design Center (Roche Applied Science) and have been previously tested for their efficiencies (data not shown). The human and murin primers used for quantitative PCR are available on request. The pGL3-vectors used for tyrosinase luciferase assays were previously described (13.Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. Embo J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 501mel cell lines were platted in 12-wells plate in 10% FBS supplemented medium 24 h prior to transfection. Cotransfections of 500 ng of pGL3-vectors (TYR promoter −300/+80, TYR promoter −300/+80 plus mutation of E box element environment −183) with 500 ng of distinct pCMV-USF-1-expressing vectors (WT, T153E, T153A, and K199R) were performed as above. 48 h after transfection and 4 h after H2O2 (200 μm and 1 mm) treatment, cells were recovered in 100 μl of luciferase assay lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was evaluated in 20 μl with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega), using a Microplate Luminometer LB96V (EG & G Berthold). We have previously shown that the ubiquitously expressed USF-1 transcription factor is a downstream target of the UV-activated p38 kinase, leading to the appearance of a phospho-USF-1 form (P-T153-USF-1), which can be distinguished by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) (13.Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. Embo J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). P-T153-USF-1 correlates with the appearance of activated p38 kinase (P-p38), 1.5 h following treatment of B16F1 or 501mel melanoma cells, or fibroblasts with the DNA-damaging agents MMS (0.2 mm) or menadione (0.1 μm) treatments) (Fig. 1A). To analyze further the implication of the USF-1 transcription factor in mediating the stress response to these agents, we examined USF-1 protein 24 h post stimulation (Fig. 1B). The results indicate that MMS treatment over 24 h induces the appearance of a novel 47-kDa USF-1-specific band that we term M-USF-1 for “Modified USF-1,” which is specifically and predominantly observed by Western blotting following long term stimulation of cells with additional inducers of cellular stress, hydroxyurea (2 μm), cadmium (5 μm), or arsenic (5 μm) (Fig. 1B). These levels of stress induce a full post-translational modification of the USF-1 transcription factor. Comparable results are obtained in a dose- and time-dependent manner when 501 melanoma cells are treated with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1C). H2O2 treatment of cells also induces the appearance of the 47-kDa USF-1 form when the treatment lasts 4 h and the H2O2 dose is at least 1.25 mm. Under these conditions no post-translational modification of the related factor USF-2 was detected. When samples were analyzed 24 h post H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1D), M-USF-1 appears at lower doses (10 μm H2O2), which interestingly correlates with a decrease of cell viability attested by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test (Fig. 1E), and with the presence of ROS species, quantified using the fluorescent H2-DCFDA Probe and FACS analysis (data not shown). Also, with these specific dose stimulations (Fig. 1D), the three forms of USF-1 are concomitantly present, indicating that the relative percentage of the three USF-1 protein forms in the cell is correlated with the type of cellular stress, and the level of induction. Cell confluence is also an important factor that seems to modulate also the USF-1 ratio (data not shown). Then, we investigated the possibility for USF-1 to be a downstream target of bacterial infection. M. hyorrhinis, one of the most common strains found to infect tissue cultures cells, was used over a 2-day time course. Immunofluorostaining to monitor Mycoplasma contamination of CS6269 cells revealed the presence of a low contamination level on day 1, which increased dramatically on day 2, and correlated with the appearance and increase of M-USF-1 (Fig. 1F). Comparable results were obtained with different cell lines (501mel, B16F1, and BLM1492), and high infection level could also lead directly to the appearance of M-USF-1. In addition to its cellular functions, the USF-1 transcription factor also participates in virus gene regulation, and virus infection activates the p38 signaling pathway (17.Rahaus M. Desloges N. Yang M. Ruyechan W.T. Wolff M.H. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18.Zachos G. Clements B. Conner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5097-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether biological insults also induced the appearance of M-USF-1. To this end, we infected CS6269 fibroblasts and 501mel cells with VSV. 24 h post-infection CS6269 cells infected with increasing titers of VSV show a dramatic appearance of the 47-kDa USF-1 band in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1G). Again, the level of infection is sufficient to entirely modify USF. Comparable results are observed in 501mel cells using VSV, or following herpes simplex virus infection (data not shown). Thus, a wide variety of cellular stresses ranging from viral and bacterial infection to DNA-damage can induce the appearance of M-USF-1. We next investigated the possibility that additional phosphorylation events were responsible for the appearance of M-USF-1, because USF-1 is reported to be a downstream target of several different kinases (p38α,β, Cyclin-CDC2, protein kinase A-protein kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) (6.Galibert M.D. Boucontet L. Goding C.R. Meo T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6176-6183PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Nowak M. Helleboid-Chapman A. Jakel H. Martin G. Duran-Sandoval D. Staels B. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Taskinen M.R.

We first used specific inhibitors of each kinase pathway (respectively, SB203580, roscovitin, olomucin, bisindolylmaleimide, and wortmannin) to facilitate the identification of the signaling pathway responsible for the appearance of M-USF-1. We also used additional inhibitors (ZM336372, U0126, rapamycin, and SB202190) to explore possible roles of the BRAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the P70S6 and p38β. As shown in Fig. 2A, 24 h of MMS (0.2 mm) treatment results in the predominant appearance of M-USF-1, which is only abrogated in the presence of the p38α,β-specific inhibitor pathway (SB203580, 10 μm) but not using the other inhibitors tested, including SB202190, which is specific for p38β, suggesting that p38α kinase activity is necessary for the induction of M-USF-1. Comparable results are obtained following UV, H2O2, and hydroxyurea treatment (Fig. 2B and data not shown). These results suggest that M-USF-1 contains at least one phosphorylated residue and thus can possibly be purified according to its phosphorylation state using a specific phosphoprotein affinity purification column. Western blot analysis of the purified fractions revealed that M-USF-1 is indeed retained specifically by the column (PP fraction) and co-purified with phosphorylated (active) p-38 kinase (P-p38), while unphosphorylated p-38 kinase is present in the flow-through fractions (Fig. 2C). To identify any additional modifications participating in the low mobility shift of the M-USF-1 protein, we performed two independent immunoprecipitations of USF-1 forms in mycoplasma-contaminated 501mel cells (Fig. 2D, 1 and 2), using the anti-USF-1-specific antibody. Under such conditions, M-USF-1 is the predominant form present in the cell. Given the role of lysine acetylation (22.Stankovic-Valentin N. Deltour S. Seeler J. Pinte S. Vergoten G. Guérardel C. Dejean A. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2661-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in regulation of gene expression, we analyzed the immunoprecipitated M-USF-1 for modifications on lysine residues. The immunoprecipitations confirmed that M-USF-1 is phosphorylated on TP residues by using anti-phospho-Thr/Pro-antibody and also potentially acetylated by Western blotting using anti-acetyl lysine antibodies. No ubiquitin residue could be observed using an anti-ubiquitin-antibody (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, mycoplasma contaminated BLM 1492 cells, presenting only the M-USF-1 form in Western Blot analysis and treated with an increasing amount of the specific deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, led to an increasing abundance of M-USF-1 that correlated to the amount of trichostatin A used, supporting the notion that M-USF-1 is acetylated (Fig. 2E). To identify the acetylated lysine(s) present in M-USF-1, several lysines within the protein at relevant positions were replaced by arginine (K>R) (Fig. 3A) from the WT USF-1 SV5-tagged recombinant protein. These mutations prevent physiological acetylation of the recombinant transcription factor at the targeted amino acid position. The impact of the different mutations on the mobility of WT or mutated USF-1 was examined by Western blotting following transfection of the corresponding epitope-tagged expression vectors into 501mel cells treated or not by UVB (400 J/m2) (Fig. 3B). Under normal conditions, WT and mutated recombinant USF-1 proteins display identical mobility, with the exception of the T153E mutant that leads to a reduced mobility by SDS-PAGE and mimics the mobility of P-Thr-153 USF-1 as previously shown (13.Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. Embo J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). After UVB treatment, we can distinguish the different post-translational modifications of the transcription factor, and WT and USF-1 single mutants K188R, K214R, K286R, K288R, or K306R, are resolved into three closed bands of various intensities corresponding to M-USF-1, P-T153-USF-1, and native USF-1 forms. By contrast, the K199R-USF-1 mutant displayed only two poorly resolved bands corresponding to P-T153-USF-1 and native USF-1. Significantly, the T153A-USF-1 mutant resolved as a single band corresponding to native USF-1. Comparable results were obtained 4 h after H2O2 (1 mm) treatment of 501mel cells (data not shown). To characterize further the nature of the modification occurring on Lys-199 in response to stress, we immunoprecipitated WT USF-1 and the T153A and K199R mutants following transfection of the corresponding expressing vectors into BLM 1492 cells and subsequently subjected the cells to UVB stimulation (400 J/m2) (Fig. 3C). As expected, WT-USF-1 displayed three bands, the T153A mutant only one, and the K199R mutant only two. Acetylation was detected only with WT-USF-1, when the M-USF-1 form was present, but not with the T153A or K199K mutants. Taken together, the data suggest that under severe stress conditions USF-1 is acetylated on Lys-199 following phosphorylation of Thr-153. To investigate the role of M-USF-1, we concomitantly examined native USF-1 and M-USF-1 subcellular localization in fractionated cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 4A, M-USF-1, like native USF-1, is exclusively present in the nuclear fraction of treated cells (0.2 mm for 12 h). To analyze the interaction of M-USF-1 with promoters for genes that are known to be regulated by USF-1 (POMC, MC1R, TYR, CCNB1, CDC2, and TERT) after binding of specific E box (Fig. 4C), we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using the USF-1-specific antibody (13.Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. Embo J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and treated cells presenting exclusively the M-USF-1 form (to avoid USF-1 and P-USF-1 background). Untreated cells were used as positive control. Western blot analysis confirmed that in these experiments the M-USF-1 form is exclusively present in ChIP extracts, when 501mel cells are treated with MMS (0.2 mm-24 h) (Fig. 4B). In vivo interactions of USF-1 and M-USF-1 with the POMC, MC1R, TYR, CCNB1, CDC2, TERT, and HSP70 promoters were evaluated by PCR amplification using promoter-specific primers. The results indicate that M-USF-1 interacts specifically with POMC, MC1R, TYR, CCNB1, CDC2, and TERT promoters, which all possess E-box regulatory elements, whereas no interaction is found with HSP70 promoter, which lacks an E-box motif. Finally, no PCR product was observed after immu"
https://openalex.org/W2130302956,"The peptide toxins of poisonous Amanita mushrooms are bicyclic octapeptides (amatoxins) or heptapeptides (phallotoxins). In Amanita bisporigera, α-amanitin and phallacidin are synthesized as 35- and 34-amino acid proproteins, respectively, in which the amino acid sequences found in the mature toxins are flanked by conserved amino acid sequences. The presence of invariant Pro residues immediately upstream of the toxin regions and as the last predicted amino acid in the toxin regions themselves suggests that a Pro-specific peptidase is responsible for the initial post-translational processing of the Amanita toxin proproteins. We purified an enzyme from the phalloidin-producing mushroom Conocybe albipes that cleaves a synthetic 22-mer phalloidin peptide to release the mature toxin peptide (AWLATCP). Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein combined with isolation and sequencing of the encoding gene indicates that the responsible processing enzyme is a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) subfamily of proteases (EC 3.4.21.26). The processing enzyme was able to use the chromogenic POP substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide and was inhibited by the specific POP inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-prolinal. Both Pro bonds in the proprotein are cleaved by the same enzyme, with the C-terminal Pro bond cleaved first or much faster than the N-terminal Pro bond. Transient accumulation of the N-terminal intermediate indicates that cleavage is not strongly processive. A synthetic peptide representing the phallacidin proprotein was also cleaved by the POP of C. albipes, but a precursor of amanitin (which is not made by C. albipes) was cleaved inefficiently.

Deadly poisonous mushrooms in the genera Amanita, Galerina, Lepiota, and Conocybe synthesize the cyclic peptide amatoxins and phallotoxins (1.Brady L.R. Benedict R.G. Tyler V.E. Stuntz D.E. Malone M.H. Lloydia. 1975; 38: 172-173PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Enjalbert F. Cassanas G. Rapior S. Renault C. Chaumont J.-P.

Peptides of Poisonous Amanita Mushrooms. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Structurally, amatoxins (e.g. α-amanitin) are bicyclic octapeptides, and phallotoxins (e.g. phalloidin and phallacidin) are chemically related bicyclic heptapeptides. Both are hydroxylated and contain a Trp-Cys cross-bridge (tryptathionine), which has not been found in other natural products (5.May J.P. Perrin D.M. Pept. Sci. 2007; 88: 714-724Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phallotoxins also contain one d amino acid (d-hydroxy-Asp or d-Thr). Despite their chemical similarity, amatoxins and phallotoxins have different modes of action; amatoxins are specific inhibitors of RNA polymerase II, and phallotoxins bind and stabilize F-actin (6.Bushnell D.A. Cramer P. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7.Wulf E. Deboben A. Bautz F.A. Faulstich H. Wieland T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4498-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Unlike other known cyclic peptides from fungi, the amatoxins and phallotoxins are biosynthesized on ribosomes instead of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (8.Hallen H.E. Luo H. Scott-Craig J.S. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19097-19101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In A. bisporigera, the genes for α-amanitin and phallacidin are translated as 35 and 34-amino acid proproteins, respectively (8.Hallen H.E. Luo H. Scott-Craig J.S. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19097-19101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although α-amanitin and phallacidin have only three amino acids in common, the upstream and downstream sequences of the proproteins are highly similar. Furthermore, the genome of A. bisporigera contains at least another 20 related sequences which collectively are characterized by conserved sequences flanking a hypervariable “toxin” region of 7–10 amino acids (8.Hallen H.E. Luo H. Scott-Craig J.S. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19097-19101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We refer to this family of genes as the MSDIN family for the first five highly conserved amino acids of the proproteins. Apparently, these poisonous mushrooms have evolved a mechanism of combinatorial peptide biosynthesis that uses the same biochemical template to synthesize a wide range of small, cyclic peptides. Among the conserved amino acids in the MSDIN gene family are two invariant Pro residues flanking the hypervariable region (Fig. 1B). All known amatoxins and phallotoxins contain one Pro, and A. phalloides is also known to make other cyclic peptides (of 6–10 amino acids), all of which contain at least one Pro residue (4.Wieland T. Peptides of Poisonous Amanita Mushrooms. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Post-translational processing of the MSDIN proproteins is predicted to involve cleavage at these Pro residues, resulting in one Pro remaining in the toxin and the other being removed (Fig. 1B). The goal of the present work was to identify the enzyme that cleaves the MSDIN proproteins to release the peptides of the mature toxins. To identify the responsible peptidase, it was necessary to find a practical starting material. Most toxin-producing fungi in the genus Amanita are obligately ectomycorrhizal with their host plants, and they grow very slowly and do not produce toxins in culture. Galerina marginata produces toxins in culture but grows slowly (9.Muraoka S. Shinozawa T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2000; 89: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Some species of the mushroom genus Conocybe produce phallotoxins or amatoxins (1.Brady L.R. Benedict R.G. Tyler V.E. Stuntz D.E. Malone M.H. Lloydia. 1975; 38: 172-173PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Hallen H.E. Watling R. Adams G.C. Mycol. Res. 2003; 107: 969-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Conocybe species are abundant locally at certain seasons. In particular, Conocybe albipes (Fig. 1C), which produces the phallotoxin phalloidin, grows on lawns in the Midwest United States, and in the spring it is possible to collect large (>1 kg) quantities (10.Hutchinson L.J. Madzia S.E. Barron G.L. Can. J. Bot. 1996; 74: 431-434Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For these reasons we chose C. albipes as a starting material for identification of the enzyme that processes the toxin proproteins. Here we report the purification of the enzyme that releases the mature heptapeptide from a phallotoxin precursor and show that it is a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) 2The abbreviations used are: POPprolyl oligopeptidaseZ-benzyloxycarbonylpNAp-nitroanilideLCliquid chromatographyMS/MStandem mass spectrometryRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: POPprolyl oligopeptidaseZ-benzyloxycarbonylpNAp-nitroanilideLCliquid chromatographyMS/MStandem mass spectrometryRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. subfamily of serine proteases. prolyl oligopeptidase benzyloxycarbonyl p-nitroanilide liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry rapid amplification of cDNA ends high performance liquid chromatography. prolyl oligopeptidase benzyloxycarbonyl p-nitroanilide liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry rapid amplification of cDNA ends high performance liquid chromatography. Fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) of C. albipes were collected from lawns on the campus of Michigan State University during the spring and summer of 2008 and stored at −80 °C until use. Fifty grams of frozen mushroom were ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle. The ground powder was resuspended in 200 ml of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 ml of protease inhibitor mixture solution. The inhibitor mixture solution (10 ml) contained five tablets of Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and 5 ml of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P2714) that had been dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water. The sample was centrifuged in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 10,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 30% saturation (16.6 gm/100 ml). After stirring at 4 °C for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged (10,200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Ammonium sulfate was then added to 60% saturation (the addition of 18.4 gm/100 ml) and centrifuged again. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 80% saturation (the addition of 13.1 gm/100 ml), and the pellet from this final spin was redissolved in 5 ml of 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0. Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.7 m, and the sample was filtered through a 0.22-μm Millex filter (Millipore). Five ml was applied to a TosoHaas phenyl 5PW hydrophobic interaction column (7.5 mm × 7.5 cm) and eluted with a 30 min gradient from 20 mm NaH2PO4 + 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, to 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Protease inhibitor mixture solution (50 μl) was added to each fraction. Fractions with activity (see below) were buffer-exchanged into 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.8, 0.02% sodium azide on an Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad). The sample (5 ml) was then applied to a Bio-Rad CHT5-I hydroxyapatite column (10 mm × 6.4 cm) and eluted with a gradient from 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.8, 0.02% sodium azide to 0.35 m KH2PO4, pH 6.8, 0.02% sodium azide over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protease inhibitor mixture solution (50 μl) was added to each fraction. Active fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged into 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. The sample (5 ml) was applied onto a TosoHaas DEAE-5PW column (7.5 mm × 7.5 cm) and eluted with a 40-min linear gradient from 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, to 40% 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.6 m NaCl. Protease inhibitor mixture solution (50 μl) was added to each fraction. The chromogenic POP substrate Z-Gly-Pro-pNA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used at a final concentration of 1 mm. The POP inhibitor Z-Pro-prolinal was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and used at 1 μm. All assays were done at 37 °C. Synthetic peptides (Table 1) representing proproteins of phalloidin, phallacidin, and α-amanitin were obtained from Bachem, Celtek, or the Michigan State University Research Technology Support Facility. The peptides were dissolved in deionized water at 1 mg/ml. Purified POP (50 μl of a 1-ml fraction (typically in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0) was mixed with 5 μl of synthetic peptide (7 μl for the phalloidin precursor). At the end of the incubation 1 μl of 100 mm DTT was added, and the samples held for another 10 min at 21 °C and then stored at −80 °C. POP was inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 2 min (boiled control).TABLE 1Synthetic peptides used in this studyNameSequencePhalloidin precursor (22-mer)MSDINATRLPAWLATCPCAGDDPhalloidin mature peptideAWLATCPPhallacidin precursor (17-mer)ATRLPAWLVDCPCVGDDPhallacidin mature peptideAWLVDCPα-Amanitin precursor (16-mer)TRLPIWGIGCNPCVGDα-Amanitin mature peptideIWGIGCNP Open table in a new tab Peptides were separated on an Agilent Model 1100 HPLC equipped with a C18 column (Vydac 218TP54). Elution solution A was water + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solution B was acetonitrile + 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid. Flow rate was 1 ml/min with a gradient from 20% solution A to 60% solution B in 15 min. Detection was at 280 nm. Peaks were collected manually, evaporated by vacuum centrifugation, and transferred to autosampler vials. LC-MS/MS was performed on a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima API instrument equipped with a Waters CapLC capillary HPLC. Spectra were analyzed with MassLynx software (Waters). MS/MS fragmentation of the most abundant molecule in each fraction was performed. The spectra were converted with the MaxEnt 3 module (MassLynx) into singly charged spectra. The spectra were then submitted to the PepSeq module of MassLynx for peptide sequence prediction. The molecular mass was set to be the mass shown on the spectrum. Minimum mass S.D. was set to 0.025. Sequence display threshold (% probability) was set to 1. Peptide identity was further confirmed with the Proteins module of MassLynx. The putative peptide sequences that matched the obtained mass spectra were used to calculate potential fragments. The MS/MS spectra of the peptides were then loaded and used to search against the calculated fragments. When hits were seen throughout the calculated fragmentation, the predicted sequences were taken to reflect the true peptide sequences. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy plant RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-strand cDNAs for 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Clontech). Degenerate primers (5′-GGRACBACDCKRTCRTC-3′ and 5′-GGBGSDTCBAAYGGHGG-3′) were based on five predicted Basidiomycetes POP gene sequences; R stands for A or G; B stands for C, G, or T; K stands for G or T; Y stands for C or T. A 275-bp PCR fragment was cloned, and analysis of its sequence by BLASTX indicated strong similarity to known POP genes. This fragment was used as a template for RACE primer design. Using the SMART RACE kit (Clontech), 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were performed using primers 5′-CTCCGCAATCGCAGCTCCAAAGGTC-3′ and 5′-GGACGAGTGACTACGGCAACCCAGATG-3′, respectively. Sequences generated from the RACE reactions were used to assemble a full-length cDNA of CaPOP1. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the fractions with POP activity were dialyzed against 2 liters of deionized water and lyophilized. SDS-PAGE was performed on 7.5% Ready Gels (Bio-Rad). Protein bands were visualized with ProtoBlue Safe (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Gel bands were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion (11.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar), and the extracted peptides were injected with a Waters nanoAcquity Sample Manager onto a Waters Symmetry C18 peptide trap (5 μm, 180 μm × 20 mm) at 4 μl/min in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The bound peptides were then eluted onto a Waters BEH C18 nanoAcquity column (1.7 μm, 100 μm × 100 mm) over 35 min with a gradient of 5% B to 35% B in 21 min, ramping to 90% B from 21–24 min and back to constant 5% B at 24.1 min using a Waters nanoAcquity Ultra Performance LC (buffer A = 99.9% water, 0.1% formic acid; buffer B = 99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The flow rate was 700 nl/min, ramping to 800 nl/min at 21 min and back to 700 nl/min at 35 min. Eluted peptides were sprayed into a ThermoFisher LTQ Linear Ion trap mass spectrometer outfitted with a MICHROM Bioresources ADVANCE nano-spray source. The top five ions in each survey scan were then subjected to data-dependent zoom scans followed by low energy collision-induced dissociation, and the resulting MS/MS spectra were converted to peak lists using BioWorks Browser Version 3.3.1 (ThermoFisher) using the default LTQ instrument parameters. Peak lists were searched using the Mascot searching algorithm, Version 2.2, against a data base of the complete proteome of Laccaria bicolor downloaded from the Joint Genome Institute (www.jgi.doe.gov) to which the sequence of CaPOP1 had been added (12.Perkins D.N.

The Mascot output was then analyzed using Scaffold to probabilistically validate protein identifications using the ProteinProphet computer algorithm (13.Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3621) Google Scholar). Assignments validated above the Scaffold 95% confidence filter were considered true. Mascot parameters for all databases were: up to 2 missed tryptic sites; fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine; variable modification of oxidation of methionine; peptide tolerance of ±200 ppm; MS/MS tolerance of 0.8 Da; peptide charge state limited to +2/+3. Using a synthetic 22-mer peptide corresponding to the proprotein of phalloidin from A. bisporigera as substrate (Table 1), we purified in three steps from C. albipes an enzyme capable of releasing the heptapeptide corresponding to phalloidin. The cleavage enzyme was very sensitive to proteolysis, necessitating the inclusion of a mixture of protease inhibitors in all of the purification buffers. After the final step (Fig. 2A), the cleavage activity appeared as a single band by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). The apparent molecular mass of the purified protein was ∼80 kDa (Fig. 2B). At each step of the purification, activity against the chromogenic POP substrate Z-Gly-Pro-pNA and cleavage activity were co-eluted (data not shown), suggesting that the cleavage enzyme is a POP. We isolated a gene encoding a POP from C. albipes using degenerate PCR primers based on putative POP genes from other fungi. Sequencing and RACE (5′ and 3′) were used to obtain the sequence of the full-length cDNA and, hence, protein. The C. albipes POP cDNA (CaPOP1) transcript has a 5′-untranslated region of 84 nucleotides and a 3′-untranslated region (stop codon to poly(A) tail) of 209 nucleotides. The deduced protein has 733 amino acids and a molecular mass of 83.0 kDa, a pI of 6.3, and no predicted signal peptide (14.Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). CaPOP1 has the conserved catalytic triad (Ser, Asp, His) as well as all of the amino acids of the “pocket.” However, not all residues of the “flexible side chains” are conserved (15.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 16.Shan L. Mathews I.I. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3599-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The sequence of CaPOP1 shows highest overall amino acid identity to hypothetical proteins from the mushrooms L. bicolor and Coprinopsis cinerea, with expect scores of 0.0 and overall identity of 65 and 59%, respectively. The sequence of CaPOP1 is also strongly similar to many other putative or known POPs from animals, plants, and bacteria. It has 40% overall identity with porcine POP (expect score 3e-154) (15.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Orthologs of CaPOP1 were found in all fully sequenced Basidiomycetes (available at the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, the Broad Institute, and GenBankTM) including A. bisporigera (8.Hallen H.E. Luo H. Scott-Craig J.S. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19097-19101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The purified cleavage enzyme (Fig. 2B) was digested with trypsin and subjected to LC MS/MS. The results were compared against a full in silico tryptic proteome of L. bicolor to which was added the sequence of CaPOP1. Twenty-two unique peptides giving 39% coverage that matched CaPOP1 were obtained (Fig. 3). The log (e) score was −230.5 (17.Craig R. Beavis R.C. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1466-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). The next best match in the L. bicolor proteome was one peptide and a log(e) value of −2.6. This result unambiguously identifies the cleavage enzyme as the product of CaPOP1. A time course of cleavage of the synthetic phalloidin peptide is shown in Fig. 4. Peaks were identified by continuous mass monitoring of the LC effluent and by manual collection of the individual UV absorbing peaks. Mass spectra of the intermediate eluting at 9.5 min and the product eluting at 7.2 min are shown in Fig. 5, A and B. All peptide sequences were confirmed by MS/MS using the PepSeq module of MassLynx. Peptide identities were further confirmed with the Proteins module of MassLynx.FIGURE 5A, MS of the compound eluting at 9.5 min in $Φg. 4 (phalloidin intermediate). B, MS of the compound eluting at 7.2 min in $Φg. 4 (phalloidin mature peptide).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence of the final product indicates that the C. albipes enzyme cuts on the carboxyl end of Pro, like other POPs. During the cleavage of the synthetic proprotein to the final 7-mer product, only one intermediate was observed which consisted of the N-terminal peptide produced by cleavage at the C-terminal Pro. Continuous selective ion monitoring in this and other experiments found no evidence for the C-terminal peptide (i.e. cleavage after the N-terminal Pro only). There was also no evidence for the cyclized form of the intermediate or the final product. Quantitation of the products formed during the time course indicates that the same POP enzyme cleaves at both Pro residues of the phalloidin precursor and that the enzyme hydrolyzes the C-terminal Pro bond before the N-terminal Pro bond (Fig. 6). Alternatively, the enzyme initially cleaves randomly, but cleaves the C-terminal Pro bond much faster than the N-terminal. The transient appearance of an intermediate indicates that CaPOP1 does not act processively, i.e. the intermediate is released from the enzyme between cleavage reactions (Figs. 5 and 8). The amino acid sequence of phalloidin (AWLATCP) differs from that of phallacidin (AWLVDCP) by two amino acids. A synthetic 17-mer peptide based on phallacidin was also cleaved efficiently by CaPOP1 (Fig. 7, A and B). The specific POP inhibitor Z-Pro-prolinal blocks cleavage of the phallacidin precursor peptide completely (Fig. 7C); the inhibitor also blocks cleavage of the phalloidin precursor (data not shown). Using the same batch of CaPOP1 and identical assay conditions, a 16-mer peptide based on the proprotein of α-amanitin was cleaved less efficiently than the phallacidin precursor (Fig. 7, D–F); even after 2 h, only a small amount of the mature amanitin 8-mer had accumulated (Fig. 7F). The mass spectrum of the mature amanitin cleavage product, eluted at 7.8 min, is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The sequences of the proproteins of amatoxins, phallotoxins, and other members of the MSDIN gene family suggest that a Pro-specific peptidase catalyzes the initial post-translational processing of this group of natural products (8.Hallen H.E. Luo H. Scott-Craig J.S. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19097-19101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Combined biochemical and molecular genetic approaches were used to demonstrate that, in the phalloidin-producing mushroom C. albipes, the initial processing step is catalyzed by a member of the POP subfamily of serine proteases (EC 3.4.21.26; Merops family S9A). The same enzyme cleaves at the carboxyl side of both flanking Pro residues to release the peptide of the mature toxin. The enzyme cleaves initially, or much faster, at the C-terminal Pro and is non-processive, evidenced by transient accumulation of the N-terminal intermediate. POPs or DNA sequences encoding POP-like proteins have previously been identified in many animals, plants, bacteria, and other Basidiomycetes, including Basidiomycetes in the Agaricales (i.e. gilled mushrooms). All available Basidiomycetes genomes have at least one gene strongly similar to mammalian POPs and to CaPOP1, but based on a survey of more than 20 completed Ascomycetes fungal genomes, this taxonomic group seems to lack POP genes. POPs have been especially well studied in mammals, where they have been shown to hydrolyze several classes of Pro-containing peptides including many peptide hormones (18.Brandt I. Scharpé S.

Changes in human blood serum levels of POP have been associated with depression, mania, schizophrenia, and response to lithium (24.Williams R.S. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2005; 29: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A POP inhibitor reverses scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats (18.Brandt I. Scharpé S. Lambeir A.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 377: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). POPs are also being investigated as a treatment for celiac-sprue disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by Pro-rich peptides in certain cereal glutens (16.Shan L. Mathews I.I. Khosla C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3599-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23.Szeltner Z. Polgár L. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate a novel function of POP, which is to process the precursor proproteins of the toxic cyclic peptides of amatoxin and phallotoxin-producing mushrooms. Small, modified, and biologically active peptides synthesized on ribosomes are known from bacteria, spiders, snakes, cone snails, plants, and amphibian skin (25.Craik D.J. Cemazar M. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2007; 10: 176-184PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Escoubas P. Mol. Divers. 2006; 10: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27.Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

Like the toxins of Amanita species and other mushrooms, these peptides are synthesized as proproteins and, thus, must undergo at least one post-translational proteolytic cleavage. The cone snail toxins (conotoxins) are cleaved at dibasic amino acids (Arg and Lys), and only one cleavage is necessary to release the mature conotoxin (30.Milne T.J. Abbenante G. Tyndall J.D. Halliday J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31105-31110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The precursors of the patellamides and other cyanobactins, which are head-to-tail cyclic peptides made by symbiotic cyanobacteria, must be cleaved twice to release the mature peptides, and this reaction is predicted to be catalyzed by an endopeptidase of the subtilisin family (Merops S8) that is encoded within the patellamide operon (28.Schmidt E.W. Nelson J.T. Rasko D.A. Sudek S. Eisen J.A. Haygood M.G. Ravel J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7315-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cyclization of the patellamides is not known, although theoretical calculations suggest that it could be spontaneous (31.Milne B.F. Long P.F. Starcevic A. Hranueli D. Jaspars M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2006; 4: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cyclotides are true head-to-tail cyclic peptides that are larger (28–37 amino acids) than the mushroom toxins. Cyclotides are cleaved from their proproteins by an Asn endopeptidase, which simultaneously catalyzes cyclization (25.Craik D.J. Cemazar M. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2007; 10: 176-184PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Saska I. Gillon A.D. Hatsugai N. Dietzgen R.G. Hara-Nishimura I. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29721-29728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In our experiments we saw no evidence of cyclized phalloidin heptapeptide or amanitin octapeptide, and therefore, cyclization of the MSDIN family of compounds is probably not catalyzed by POP. In the biosynthesis of microcin J25, which is a “head-to-backbone” cyclic peptide, the precursor proprotein must be proteolytically cleaved once to release the mature peptide. Cleavage and cyclization are catalyzed by two clustered genes, mcjB and mcjC, and the processing requires ATP (33.Duquesne S. Destoumieux-Garzón D. Zirah S. Goulard C. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Another family of small, bacterial cyclic peptides, the autoinducing peptides of staphylococci, which are thiolactones, are processed by a membrane-bound cysteine endopeptidase (34.Novick R.P. Geisinger E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 541-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 35.Qiu R. Pei W. Zhang L. Lin J. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16695-16704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In being catalyzed by a Pro-specific peptidase, processing of the MSDIN peptides of poisonous mushrooms occurs by a different mechanism than any previously described. It is known from studies on other POPs that the specificity of POP enzymes is controlled by more than simply the presence of an internal Pro residue. Mammalian POP has been reported to cleave sometimes at other amino acids, such as Val, Ala, or Cys (20.García-Horsman J.A. Männistö P.T. Venäläinen J.I. Neuropeptides. 2007; 41: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36.Nomura K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Conversely, POPs often do not cleave at all possible Pro residues (20.García-Horsman J.A. Männistö P.T. Venäläinen J.I. Neuropeptides. 2007; 41: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37.Moriyama A. Nakanishi M. Sasaki M. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For example, POP of lamb kidney can cleave peptides after a double Pro but not between adjacent Pro residues (38.Koida M. Walter R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7593-7599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some members of the extended MSDIN family have additional predicted Pro residues within the hypervariable region (Ref. 8.Hallen H.E. Luo H. Scott-Craig J.S. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19097-19101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession numbers EU196139–EU196155). Furthermore, some additional cyclic peptides purified from A. phalloides have internal, nonadjacent Pro residues, such as CyAB (cyclo[Ser-Phe-Phe-Phe-Pro-Ile-Pro]) and CyAD (cyclo[Met-Leu-Gly-Phe-Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro]) (4.Wieland T. Peptides of Poisonous Amanita Mushrooms. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Insofar as these compounds are processed from their proproteins like the amatoxins and phallotoxins, then the responsible POP must not cut at all possible Pro residues. Another interesting situation is found with the cyclic decapeptide antamanide, also made by A. phalloides, which contains four Pro residues in two pairs (cyclo[Phe-Phe-Val-Pro-Pro-Ala-Phe-Phe-Pro-Pro]) (4.Wieland T. Peptides of Poisonous Amanita Mushrooms. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that CaPOP1 cleaves two phallotoxin precursors more efficiently than an α-amanitin precursor (Fig. 7). This might be related to the fact that C. albipes only produces phallotoxins. However, it cannot be excluded that this is due to different lengths of the synthetic peptides used (Table 1). The extra amino acids of the phalloidin precursor (22-mer) compared with the phallacidin and α-amanitin precursors (Table 1) might provide essential amino acids to promote interaction with CaPOP1. Further studies with synthetic derivatives of the MSDIN family and with the full-length proproteins will be necessary to establish the detailed substrate specificities of CaPOP1 and other MSDIN-processing POPs from other toxin-producing fungi. Yoshimoto et al. (39.Yoshimoto T. Sattar A.K. Hirose W. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) found POP activity in 19 of 22 species of mushroom (Agaricales) tested, and of the species that could be cultured, POP activity was always intracellular. However, the same authors later purified an extracellular POP from the common mushroom Agaricus bisporus (40.Sattar A.K. Yamamoto N. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our experiments CaPOP1 was very sensitive to proteolytic degradation during purification, which is atypical of extracellular fungal enzymes. It also lacks any detectable signal peptide. These observations suggest that CaPOP1 is intracellular, which is consistent with CaPOP1 having a role in posttranslational processing of the phalloidin proprotein. Our studies do not, however, unequivocally establish that CaPOP1 is the enzyme that processes the phalloidin precursor in vivo. The role of POP in toxin non-producing mushrooms is unknown, although an extracellular location in the case of A. bisporus would suggest a role in saprophytic scavenging. Although many naturally occurring peptides, such as mammalian hormones, can be cleaved by POPs in vitro, the in vivo substrates of POPs in animals, plants, and bacteria are unknown in most cases (18.Brandt I. Scharpé S. Lambeir A.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 377: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In conclusion, in this paper we have shown that the POP of the phalloidin-producing mushroom C. albipes can efficiently and precisely cleave the precursor of phalloidin, releasing the heptapeptide of the mature toxin. Subsequent steps in the biosynthesis of phalloidin must include cyclization, hydroxylation, epimerization of l-Thr to d-Thr, and formation of the tryptathionine cross-bridge.

We found that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells were generally killed by lower doses of tubacin than EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) or EBV-negative BL cells. Tubacin induced apoptosis of LCLs, which was inhibited by pretreatment with a pancaspase inhibitor but not by butylated hydroxyanisole, which inhibits reactive oxygen species. In contrast, tubacin killed EBV-positive BL cells in a caspase-3-independent pathway that involved reactive oxygen species and was blocked by butylated hydroxyanisole. Previously, we showed that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, induces apoptosis of EBV LCLs and that LCLs are killed by lower doses of bortezomib than EBV-positive BL cells. Here we found that the combination of bortezomib and tubacin acted in synergy to kill EBV-positive BL cells and LCLs. Tubacin or the combination of bortezomib and tubacin did not induce EBV lytic replication. These findings suggest that the combination of a proteasome inhibitor and an HDAC6 inhibitor may represent a useful strategy for the treatment of certain EBV-associated B cell lymphomas.

Tissues from patients with EBV post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease typically have a type 3 latency pattern in which each of the EBV latency-associated proteins, including EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, and -3C) and latent membrane proteins (LMP1 and LMP2) are expressed. A type 3 latency pattern is also seen in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), derived from primary B cells transformed with EBV in vitro. Tissues from patients with EBV-positive BL usually have a type 1 latency pattern with expression of EBNA-1 but not the other latency-associated proteins.

Degradation of proteins is required for vital cell functions and is carried out both in proteasomes and aggresomes. Misfolded or unfolded proteins are polyubiquitinated by a complex of proteins and subsequently degraded by proteasomes. However, if ubiquitinated proteins escape degradation by proteasomes and aggregate, they accumulate into aggresomes (6Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Aggresome formation can be abrogated by disrupting the microtubule cytoskeleton or by overexpression of the p50 subunit of dynactin (7Johnston J.A. Illing M.E. Kopito R.R. Cell Motil.

HDAC6 contains a dynein motor binding domain, two catalytic domains with histone deacetylase activity, and a carboxyl-terminal domain that binds polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins (11Kawaguchi Y.

Med. 2002; 8: S49-S54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that bortezomib induces apoptosis of EBV-transformed B cells and prolongs survival of mice inoculated with EBV-transformed B cells (14Zou P. Kawada J. Pesnicak L. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10029-10036Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma cells were much less sensitive to killing by bortezomib. Since bortezomib has been shown to interact synergistically with tubacin to induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells (4Hideshima T. Bradner J.E. Wong J. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Schreiber S.L. Anderson K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8567-8572Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of tubacin on EBV-transformed B cells and Burkitt lymphoma cells both in the absence and presence of bortezomib. We show that tubacin kills LCLs by apoptosis and induction of caspase-3, whereas tubacin kills EBV-positive BL cells by induction of reactive oxygen species. Bortezomib and tubacin acted in synergy to kill EBV-positive BL cells and LCLs. These findings suggest that the combination of tubacin and bortezomib may have potential as a model for the treatment of certain EBV-associated lymphomas. Three EBV-transformed LCLs (LCLa, LCLb, and LCLc), EBV-positive BL cell lines (Akata (15Takada K. Horinouchi K. Ono Y. Aya T. Osato T. Takahashi M. Hayasaka S.

BJAB cells stably transfected with vector (BJgpt-3) or LMP1 (BJLMP-6 and BJLMP-15) were a gift from Fred Wang (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School) and were grown in medium containing mycophenolic acid, xanthine, and hypoxanthine, as described previously (19Wang F. Gregory C. Sample C. Rowe M. Liebowitz D. Murray R. Rickinson A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2309-2318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bortezomib was purchased from Millennium Pharmaceutical Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and prepared in DMSO (20Caserta T.M. Smith A.N. Gultice A.D. Reedy M.A. Brown T.L. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 21DeBiasi R.L. Robinson B.A. Sherry B. Bouchard R. Brown R.D. Rizeq M. Long C. Tyler K.L. J.

The HDAC6-specific inhibitor tubacin was prepared in DMSO and obtained from the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (12Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, and ethoxyquin were purchased from Sigma. 2×105 cells/ml were cultured in 12-well plates, and cell viability was assayed by trypan blue exclusion using a Vi-Cell cell viability analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Cells were pretreated with the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH (50 μm) 1 h prior to the addition of tubacin. Apoptosis was measured using an annexin V-PE/7-AAD apoptosis assay kit (BD Pharmingen Biosciences, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, LCLs (2 × 105) were treated with various concentrations of tubacin for 24 and 48 h, and cells were harvested, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in binding buffer, and incubated with annexin V-PE for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and viable cells were defined as negative for annexin V-PE and 7-AAD staining, whereas apoptotic cells were defined as positive for annexin V-PE and negative for 7-AAD staining. Cells were lysed in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibody. Antibody to caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP), acetylated lysine (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), β-actin and acetylated α-tubulin (Sigma), Bcl-2 (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), Bax (Trevigene, Gaithersburg, MD), Bcl-XL and α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), EBV BZLF-1, LMP1 (DAKO, Carpintera, CA), and EBV early antigen D (Capricorn, Portland, ME) were used for immunoblots. Cells were treated with tubacin or DMSO and stained with the Image-iT LIVE Green reactive oxygen species detection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to measure production of ROS. The Chou-Talalay method was used to determine if drug combinations were synergistic or additive (22Chou T.C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6007) Google Scholar). The combination index (CI) was determined based on the formula, CI = (D)1/(Dx)1 + (D)2/(Dx)2, where (D)1 and (D)2 are the concentrations of drug 1 and drug 2 that have effect x when used together, and (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 are the concentrations of drug 1 and drug 2 that have the same effect x when used alone. A CI of <1 is indicative of a synergistic effect, CI of 1 is indicative of an additive effect, and CI of >1 is indicative of an antagonistic effect. Various EBV-positive and -negative B cells were treated with different concentrations of tubacin for 48 h. EBV-positive BL cells with a type 1 latency pattern (Akata, Mutu 1, and Kem 1) were killed by tubacin with ≥40% loss of cell viability at ≤10 μm (Fig. 1A). In contrast, EBV-transformed primary B cells (LCLa and LCLc) were less sensitive to tubacin-induced cell death with <30% loss in viability at 10 μm tubacin. EBV-negative B cells (BL30, Ramos, and BCBL) showed little loss in viability even at 10 μm tubacin. EBV-negative B cells stably expressing EBV LMP1 (BJLMP-6 and BJLMP-15) or EBV-negative B cells infected with EBV B95-8 that stably express LMP1, EBNA-1, and EBNA-2 (BL30-B95-8) showed no increased susceptibility to tubacin when compared with their parental cell lines that do not express EBV proteins (supplemental Fig. 1). Akata cells that lost their EBV genomes showed no reduction in susceptibility to tubacin compared to the parental EBV-positive Akata cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, the original status of the tumor cell (before EBV genes are added or are lost from the cell) tends to determine its susceptibility to tubacin. Tubacin reduced the number of viable LCLa and LCLb cells in a dose-dependent manner with ∼40% cell loss at 50 μm tubacin (Fig. 1B). Treatment of LCLa and EBV-positive BL cells with tubacin over longer periods of time resulted in increasing cell death (Fig. 1C). Although tubacin is specific for inhibiting HDAC6, trichostatin A inhibits HDAC1 to -11 (23Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). In contrast to tubacin, trichostatin A showed little difference in killing LCLs or EBV-positive BL cells (Fig. 1D). To test the toxicity of tubacin, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with 5 or 10 μm tubacin for 48 h. No significant cell death was observed (data not shown), consistent with a previous report (4Hideshima T. Bradner J.E. Wong J. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Schreiber S.L. Anderson K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8567-8572Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). EBV-positive BL cells and LCLs were treated with various concentrations of tubacin for 24 and 48 h, and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry after annexin V staining. LCLa cells treated with tubacin showed increasing numbers of apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive, 7-AAD-negative) in a dose-dependent manner when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2). Similar results were observed in LCLb cells (data not shown). In contrast, two EBV-positive BL cells, Akata and Kem 1, showed few apoptotic cells with tubacin treatment but a large number of necrotic cells (annexin V-positive, 7-AAD-positive). Although the number of apoptotic cells was elevated in Kem 1 cells treated with 20 μm of tubacin at 48 h, the proportion of apoptotic to necrotic cells was low. EBV-negative BJAB cells showed a similar response to tubacin as the EBV-positive BL cells (data not shown). To further analyze the mechanism of tubacin-induced cell death, caspase cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis, was investigated by immunoblotting. Tubacin (50 μm for 12 h) induced cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP in LCLa cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were seen in LCLb cells (data not shown). In contrast, tubacin failed to induce cleavage of caspase-3 in EBV-positive BL cells (Akata and Kem 1), although PARP and caspase-7 were cleaved in cells treated with tubacin. Although caspase-3 is important for cleavage of a number of substrates, including PARP, and functions as an “executioner” for apoptosis, caspase-7 has been shown to cleave PARP but few other substrates and by itself has little effect on apoptosis (24Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). PARP cleavage, in the absence of caspase-3 cleavage, was also seen in Akata and Kem 1 cells treated with 10 μm tubacin (data not shown). Tubacin induced caspase-3 cleavage in BJAB cells (data not shown). To determine whether inhibition of caspases reduces apoptosis due to tubacin, cells were incubated with Q-VD-OPH (a pancaspase inhibitor) for 1 h followed by treatment with tubacin (10 μm) for 48 h. Pretreatment with Q-VD-OPH inhibited tubacin-induced cell death of LCLa cells but not EBV-positive BL cells (Akata and Kem 1) (Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed in LCLb cells treated with Q-VD-OPH (data not shown). Q-VD-OPH also inhibited caspase-3 cleavage induced by tubacin in LCLa cells; the p20 peptide, but not the mature p17 peptide required for apoptosis (25Han Z. Hendrickson E.A. Bremner T.A. Wyche J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13432-13436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), was detected in Q-VD-OH-treated LCLa cells (Fig. 3A). Q-VD-OPH inhibited PARP and caspase-7 cleavage, induced by tubacin in LCLa, Akata, and Kem 1 cells (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that tubacin-induced cell death of LCLs is mediated by caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Since tubacin inhibits the carboxyl catalytic domain of HDAC6, which has α-tubulin deacetylase activity, we studied the effect of tubacin on acetylation of α-tubulin in EBV-transformed B cells. Tubacin, but not bortezomib, induced acetylation of α-tubulin in LCLa, Kem 1, and Akata cells (supplemental Fig. 2A). The addition of bortezomib had no effect on acetylation of α-tubulin by tubacin. To verify that acetylation of α-tubulin was specific, LCLs, Kem 1, and Akata cells were treated for 6 h with various concentrations of tubacin, and lysates were immunoblotted with antibody to acetylated lysine. At concentrations of tubacin that induced cell death (10 μm for Kem 1 or Akata cells or 50 μm for LCLs), tubulin acetylation was markedly increased relative to acetylation of histones H3 or H4 (supplemental Fig. 2B). Besides apoptosis, other pathways can induce cell death, including production of ROS. Cell lines were labeled with carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and treated with tubacin, and ROS was measured using production of carboxyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein using flow cytometry. ROS was induced in Akata, Kem 1, or LCLa treated with tubacin (Fig. 4A). Similar results were seen with LCLb (data not shown). BHA inhibits cell death induced by ROS. BHA (40 μm) prevented tubacin-induced death of Akata or Kem 1 cells but did not inhibit tubacin-induced death of LCLs (Fig. 4B). Other ROS inhibitors (propyl gallate and ethoxyquin) showed similar results. These results suggest that tubacin induces death of EBV-positive BL cells, but not LCLs, by production of ROS. BHA did not inhibit tubacin-induced cell death of BJAB cells (data not shown). Pretreatment of Akata cells with BHA followed by tubacin resulted in reduced ROS compared with cells not treated with BHA (Fig. 4C). Similar results were seen in Kem 1 cells. To determine if tubacin induces expression of EBV lytic proteins, we examined the expression of the EBV immediate early protein BZLF-1 and early antigen D in tubacin-treated cells. No difference was noted in the level of EBV BZLF1 or early antigen D in Akata, Kem 1, or LCLb cells treated with the two drugs for 6 h when compared with untreated cells (supplemental Fig. 3A). Similar results were seen when cells were treated for 24 h. To determine if tubacin induces apoptosis of LCLs by regulating the expression of pro- or antiapoptosis proteins, we examined the expression of several of these proteins in LCLs. There was no detectable change in the level of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bax (supplemental Fig. 3B) in LCLs or in BL (Kem 1 or Akata) cells treated with tubacin. Similarly, there was no change in the level of these proteins in LCLs or BL cells treated with bortezomib or tubacin combined with bortezomib. Since some HDAC inhibitors increase the expression of EBV LMP1 (26Park J.H. Faller D.V. Virology. 2002; 303: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we tested whether tubacin might also increase expression of the protein. Treatment of LCLs or BL cells with tubacin, bortezomib, or tubacin and bortezomib did not change the expression of EBV LMP1. Previously, we found that bortezomib induces apoptosis of LCLs; however, the drug was much less effective for EBV-positive BL cells (14Zou P. Kawada J. Pesnicak L. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10029-10036Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the combination of bortezomib and tubacin could enhance the killing of LCLs and EBV-positive BL cells compared with tubacin alone. LCLa cells treated with 5–20 μm tubacin alone for 48 h showed a maximum loss in cellular viability of 18% compared with no drug, and incubation with 5–20 nm bortezomib alone resulted in a maximum loss in viability of 49% compared with untreated cells. However, when the cells were cultured with these concentrations of both agents together, the loss in viability was 74% (Fig. 5A). An isobologram analysis (Fig. 5B) showed synergy with each combination of tubacin and bortezomib, and this was confirmed by combination indices of less than 1.0 for each the four combinations of drugs (Fig. 5C). Akata cells treated with 5–20 μm tubacin alone showed loss of cellular viability of up to 52% compared with control cells, and incubation with 5–20 nm bortezomib alone resulted in a maximum loss of viability of 43% compared with untreated cells; however, when the cells were cultured with both drugs the maximum loss of viability was 73% (Fig. 5D). An isobologram showed synergy of the two drugs for killing Akata cells (Fig. 5E) and the combination indices were all ≤0.4, indicative of synergy (Fig. 5F). Treatment of LCLa with 10 μm tubacin alone did not result in significant loss of viability (Fig. 1A) or cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 5G). However, 10 μm tubacin enhanced caspase-3 cleavage of LCLa cells by bortezomib, compared with bortezomib alone. Similar results were seen with LCLb cells (data not shown). Although 2.5 μm tubacin did not result in cleavage of caspase-3 in Akata or Kem 1 cells, 2.5 μm tubacin enhanced caspase-3 cleavage of these cells by bortezomib compared with bortezomib alone. We have found that tubacin usually kills EBV-positive BL cells at lower concentrations of drug than LCLs or EBV-negative BL cells. Tubacin inhibits HDAC6 (12Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C.

Biol. 2003; 10: 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which belongs to the class IIb family of HDACs. HDAC inhibitors result in covalent modification of histones, with chromatin remodeling and increased expression of multiple genes. HDAC inhibitors have been studied for their effects on EBV-positive B cells. Depsipeptide induced apoptosis of LCLs in vitro and improved survival of mice with severe combined immunodeficiency inoculated with LCLs but had little activity in killing EBV-positive BL cells (27Roychowdhury S. Baiocchi R.A. Vourganti S. Bhatt D. Blaser B.W. Freud A.G. Chou J. Chen C.S. Xiao J.J. Parthun M. Chan K.K. Eisenbeis C.F. Ferketich A.K. Grever M.R. Chen C.S. Caligiuri M.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Valproic acid, an inhibitor of class I and IIa HDACs, had a modest effect in killing LCLs in vitro or in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency but enhanced the ability of cytotoxic drugs to kill LCLs in vitro and in the mice (28Feng W.H. Kenney S.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8762-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A inhibits class I, II, and IV HDACs and induces apoptosis of EBV-positive and EBV-negative BL Akata cells (29Son Y.O. Choi K.C. Lee J.C. Kook S.H. Lee H.J. Jeon Y.M. Kim J.G. Kim J. Lee W.K. Jang Y.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 1420-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Arginine butyrate, which inhibits class I and IIa HDACS, induces lytic EBV gene expression to potentiate the toxic effect of ganciclovir on LCLs (30Faller D.V. Mentzer S.J. Perrine S.P. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Some HDAC inhibitors (e.g. butyrate and trichostatin A) up-regulate LMP1 (26Park J.H. Faller D.V. Virology. 2002; 303: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); however, tubacin did not increase LMP1 (supplemental Fig. 3B). Thus, tubacin is more selective than the other inhibitors that have previously been used to kill EBV-infected cells. Tubacin induced apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage in LCLs but had little effect on caspase-3 cleavage in EBV-positive BL cells. Tubacin-associated cell death in LCLs was inhibited by a pancaspase inhibitor, whereas death of EBV-positive BL cells was not affected by the inhibitor. LCLs express each of the EBV latency proteins, while EBV-positive BL cells express only EBNA-1. The EBV latency proteins apparently are not required for tubacin-induced apoptosis of B cells, since tubacin induces apoptosis and caspase cleavage of multiple myeloma B cells (4Hideshima T. Bradner J.E. Wong J. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Schreiber S.L. Anderson K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8567-8572Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). ROS were induced in LCLs and EBV-positive BL cells treated with tubacin. Accumulation of ROS can cause cell damage and death (31Yu L. Wan F. Dutta S. Welsh S. Liu Z. Freundt E. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4952-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors can result in accumulation of ROS in some tumor cells, and free radical scavengers can reduce cell death (23Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors can induce ROS-mediated cell death, which is caspase-independent and not blocked by caspase inhibitors (32Ungerstedt J.S. Sowa Y. Xu W.S. Shao Y. Dokmanovic M. Perez G. Ngo L. Holmgren A. Jiang X. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Myc can induce DNA damage, induction of ROS, and loss of cell viability without induction of apoptosis; antioxidants can reduce ROS and increase survival (33Vafa O. Wade M. Kern S. Beeche M. Pandita T.K. Hampton G.M. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1031-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). We found that the EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, Akata and Kem 1 cells showed high levels of c-Myc, relative to LCLa and LCLb (data not shown), consistent with production of ROS and improved survival of the Burkitt cell lines after treatment with ROS inhibitors. BHA protected EBV-positive BL cells, but not LCLs, from tubacin-induced cell death. In contrast, tubacin-treated LCLs, but not BL cells, underwent apoptosis with caspase-3 cleavage and were protected from cell death by Q-VD-OPH. These results indicate that tubacin kills LCLs by caspase-induced apoptosis, whereas the ROS pathway is important for tubacin-induced cell death of BL cells. We found that the combination of tubacin and bortezomib acted in synergy to enhance apoptosis of EBV-positive Akata cells and LCLs. Bortezomib interacted synergistically with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or sodium butyrate to induce apoptosis of leukemic or multiple myeloma cells (34Pei X.Y. Dai Y. Grant S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 3839-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 35Yu C. Rahmani M. Conrad D. Subler M. Dent P. Grant S. Blood. 2003; 102: 3765-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Bortezomib induced aggresome formation in pancreatic tumor cells or multiple myeloma cells that were disrupted with induction of apoptosis after treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (5Nawrocki S.T. Carew J.S. Pino M.S. Highshaw R.A. Andtbacka R.H. Dunner Jr., K. Pal A. Bornmann W.G. Chiao P.J. Huang P. Xiong H. Abbruzzese J.L. McConkey D.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3773-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Although bortezomib also acted in synergy with tubacin to induce apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells (4Hideshima T. Bradner J.E. Wong J. Chauhan D. Richardson P. Schreiber S.L. Anderson K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8567-8572Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), our study is the first to demonstrate this in EBV-positive B cells. Administration of bortezomib to mice with severe combined immunodeficiency inoculated with LCLs results in significantly prolonged survival in these mice; however, some animals treated with bortezomib developed EBV-positive B cell lymphomas. Thus, some tumors were probably resistant to bortezomib. Bortezomib stimulates aggresome formation, which seems to have a cytoprotective response in reaction to proteasome inhibition. The addition of an HDAC inhibitor, which can disrupt aggresomes, may enhance the effect of bortezomib. In contrast to other studies of HDAC inhibitors on EBV, the combination of bortezomib and tubacin did not lead to the induction of EBV viral lytic replication. These findings suggest that tubacin combined with bortezomib may serve as a novel therapy for the treatment of certain EBV-associated lymphomas.

https://openalex.org/W2040702688,"Obesity causes lipid accumulation in the heart and may lead to lipotoxic heart disease. Traditionally, the size of the cardiac triglyceride pool is thought to reflect the balance between uptake and beta-oxidation of fatty acids. However, triglycerides can also be exported from cardiomyocytes via secretion of apolipoproteinB-containing (apoB) lipoproteins. Lipoprotein formation depends on expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP); the mouse expresses two isoforms of MTP, A and B. Since many aspects of the link between obesity-induced cardiac disease and cardiac lipid metabolism remain unknown, we investigated how cardiac lipoprotein synthesis affects cardiac expression of triglyceride metabolism-controlling genes, insulin sensitivity, and function in obese mice. Heart-specific ablation of MTP-A in mice using Cre-loxP technology impaired upregulation of MTP expression in response to increased fatty acid availability during fasting and fat feeding. This resulted in cardiac triglyceride accumulation but unaffected cardiac insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Long-term fat-feeding of male C57Bl/6 mice increased cardiac triglycerides, induced cardiac expression of triglyceride metabolism-controlling genes and attenuated heart function. Abolishing cardiac triglyceride accumulation in fat-fed mice by overexpression of an apoB transgene in the heart prevented the induction of triglyceride metabolism-controlling genes and improved heart function. The results suggest that in obesity, the physiological increase of cardiac MTP expression serves to attenuate cardiac triglyceride accumulation albeit without major effects on cardiac insulin sensitivity. Nevertheless, the data suggest that genetically increased lipoprotein secretion prevents development of obesity-induced lipotoxic heart disease."

MIDAS (multiple reaction monitoring-initiated detection and sequencing) analysis revealed additional phosphorylated residues, Ser-440 and Ser-441, 6) in vitro 32P incorporation was significantly reduced in Kv1.2-S449A, Kv1.2-S449D, and Kv1.2-S440A/S441A/S449A mutant channels, but Kv1.2-S440A/S441A was identical to wild-type Kv1.2 (Kv1.2-WT), and 7) bath applied 8-Br-cAMP or dialysis with PKA catalytic subunit (cPKA) increased Kv1.2-WT but not Kv1.2-S449A current amplitude. cPKA increased Kv1.2-WT current in inside-out patches. Rp-CPT-cAMPS reduced Kv1.2-WT current, blocked the increase due to 8-Br-cAMP, but had no effect on Kv1.2-S449A. cPKA increased current due to double mutant Kv1.2-S440A/S441A but had no effect on Kv1.2-S449D or Kv1.2-S440A/S441A/S449A. We conclude that Ser-449 in Kv1.2 is a site of PKA phosphorylation and a potential molecular mechanism for Kv1-containing KDR channel modulation by agonists via PKA activation. Vascular smooth muscle Kv1 delayed rectifier K+ channels (KDR) containing Kv1.2 control membrane potential and thereby regulate contractility. Vasodilatory agonists acting via protein kinase A (PKA) enhance vascule smooth muscle Kv1 activity, but the molecular basis of this regulation is uncertain.

Steady-state Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, resulting in elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and contraction, requires sustained depolarization. In contrast, Kv1 channel activation induces hyperpolarization, reduces voltage-gated Ca2+ channel open probability, and promotes relaxation (1Nelson M.T. Quayle J.M. Am. J.

Previous studies showed that gating of Kv1.2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes is stimulated by PKA (23Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), similar to VSM KDR channels, which contain this pore-forming Kv1 subunit (7Plane F. Johnson R. Kerr P. Wiehler W. Thorneloe K.

There are six potential PKA phosphorylation sites within the cytoplasmic regions of Kv1.2 (see Fig. 1, A and B) based on the consensus motif Arg/Lys-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr (24Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An N-terminal residue, Thr-46, was proposed to be the site of PKA phosphorylation, as mutation to valine (T46V) prevented modulation by β-adrenoreceptor activation or exposure to the catalytic subunit of PKA (cPKA) (23Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion has been questioned based on structural analysis of the N-terminal domain and the positive shift in voltage-dependent gating produced by the T46V mutation (25Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Sites Ser-440, Ser-441, and Ser-449 near the C terminus were recently identified to be phosphorylated in Kv1.2 immunoprecipitates derived from brain as well as transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and COS-1 cells using a proteomic approach (26Yang J.W.

Phosphorylation of these residues was suggested to be important for trafficking to the cell membrane (26Yang J.W. Vacher H. Park K.S. Clark E. Trimmer J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20055-20060Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but the kinase(s) involved was not identified. cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling was reported to alter surface expression of Kv1.2, but phosphorylation at Ser-440 and Ser-449 was not required (27Connors E.C. Ballif B.A. Morielli A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3445-3453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study we used a combination of biochemical, mutagenesis, and electrophysiological analyses to 1) determine whether Kv1.2 is a substrate for PKA, 2) identify the PKA phosphorylation site(s) involved, and 3) determine whether phosphorylation of the identified residue(s) mediates PKA-dependent changes in Kv1.2 current amplitude. Kv1.2-T46A, -T46D, -S449A, -S449D, -S440A/S441A, and -S440A/S441A/S449A mutants were engineered from rabbit Kv1.2 (GenBankTM accession number AF284420) (see Fig. 1B) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 by overlap extension using the PCR (12Aiello E.A.

A 10 residue c-Myc tag was added to the C terminus of each construct, and cDNAs from positive colonies were sequenced. Myc-tagged protein expressed in HEK 293 cells was recognized by anti-Kv1.2 and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc (see Fig. 1, C and D). HEK 293 cells were maintained and transfected as previously described (4Kerr P.M. Clément-Chomienne O. Thorneloe K.S. Chen T.T. Ishii K. Sontag D.P. Walsh M.P. Cole W.C. Circ.

For patch clamp experiments, cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding green fluorescent protein and channel constructs and studied within 48 h. For biochemical experiments, cells were grown to ∼80% confluence, transfected with Kv1.2 constructs alone, and harvested after ∼48 h. HEK 293 cells were harvested, lysates were prepared, and Kv1.2-WT and mutant construct proteins were immunoprecipitated using Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), as previously described (5Thorneloe K.S. Chen T.T. Kerr P.M. Grier E.F. Horowitz B. Cole W.C. Walsh M.P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Proteins were phosphorylated in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 1 μm okadaic acid, and cPKA (0.1 μg/ml except for mass spectrometry at 1.0 μg/ml). Reactions were initiated with 0.2 mm ATP and 1.0 μCi/nmol [γ-32P]ATP and terminated with Laemmli SDS buffer before elution from beads and separation by SDS-PAGE. 32P-Labeled proteins on SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted as previously described (28Chen T.T. Luykenaar K.D. Walsh E.J. Walsh M.P. Cole W.C. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) before exposure to Kodak XB-1 blue film and densitometric analysis using Image Master 1D software. Mean values ± S.E. were compared by unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin digestion of 32P-labeled channel protein and phosphopeptide mapping were performed as previously described (29Xiao B. Jiang M.T. Zhao M. Yang D. Sutherland C. Lai F.A. Walsh M.P. Warltier D.C. Cheng H. Chen S.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Migration of 32P-labeled tryptic peptides was compared with synthetic pSASTISK and detected by autoradiography and 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone. Lyophilized tryptic peptides were resuspended in 6 m HCl (250 μl) for 2 h at 110 °C before drying, resuspension, mixing with phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards and separation as previously described (30Colburn J.C. Michnoff C.H. Hsu L.C. Slaughter C.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled residues and standards were detected by autoradiography and ninhydrin, respectively. Immobilized metal (Fe3+) affinity chromatography was performed using a 1-ml (0.7 × 2.5 cm) pre-packed HiTrapTM Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) (32Erickson A.C. Johnson G.V. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 46: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) charged with 50 mm ferric chloride. Lyophilized 32P-labeled tryptic peptides were applied and eluted using a stepwise gradient from pH 6.0 to 9.5 in 0.5 increments, and radioactive content was assessed by C̆erenkov counting. Phosphorylated Kv1.2-Myc digests were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid and loaded on a self-packed cartridge (150 μm × 25 mm C18; Zorbax Stablebond C18, 300 Å, 5 μm), and the flow-through was analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Voyager DE-STR, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A fraction of the flow-through was analyzed by direct infusion nanospray MS/MS on an ion trap mass spectrometer (XCT Ultra, Agilent Technologies) to determine the fragmentation pattern of the m/z 773.4 phosphorylated tryptic peptide detected using this method. The sequence was determined by 1) peptide fragment fingerprinting against Kv1.2 tryptic peptide sequences using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, England), allowing for variable phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues, and 2) manual sequencing. This approach was also used to identify Ser-449 phosphorylation in situ in control and 8-Br-cAMP-treated HEK 293 cells. A MIDAS (multiple reaction monitoring-initiated detection and sequencing) approach was also used to identify sites on Kv1.2 in situ. Tryptic digests of HEK 293 Kv1.2 immunoprecipitates were reduced to dryness in vacuo and reconstituted in mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid, 3% acetonitrile in water). Sample was injected into a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system configured with trap and separation columns (PepMap C18 reversed phase). Phosphorylation events were detected by MIDAS using a Qtrap 4000 MS (AB/MDS Analytical Technologies). All tryptic peptides derived from cytosolic regions of Kv1.2 (Fig. 1) were considered in this analysis to ensure high sensitivity while achieving a comprehensive survey of all potential intracellular phosphorylation sites on the channel protein. Synthetic peptides (KKSRSASTISK, KKSRAASTISK, and LLRRASLG) were used as substrate in phosphorylation reactions with cPKA and [γ-32P]ATP as previously described (29Xiao B. Jiang M.T. Zhao M. Yang D. Sutherland C. Lai F.A. Walsh M.P. Warltier D.C. Cheng H. Chen S.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Km and Vmax values were calculated by linear regression analysis of Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee plots or by Michaelis-Menten analysis using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and expressed as the mean ± S.E. of five experiments in triplicate. Peptide phosphorylation stoichiometry was determined as above, except cPKA was varied between 1.0 and 5.0 μg/ml, and peptide was fixed at 50 μm. Values are the means ± S.E. of three experiments in triplicate. Whole-cell currents due to Kv1.2-WT and mutant channel constructs in HEK 293 cells were recorded and analyzed as previously described (4Kerr P.M. Clément-Chomienne O. Thorneloe K.S. Chen T.T. Ishii K. Sontag D.P. Walsh M.P. Cole W.C. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Aiello E.A. Malcolm A.T. Walsh M.P. Cole W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H448-H459PubMed Google Scholar). Current-voltage (I-V) relations were determined using 250-ms step pulses between −80 and +30 mV or 5-s ramp pulses between −80 and +40 mV. Because of marked cell-to-cell variability in expressed channel protein density, current amplitudes were normalized to the value at +30 mV (step protocol) in control conditions for each cell for determination of the mean change in I-V relation due to PKA activation or inhibition. Current density (pA/pF) was determined by normalization to cell capacitance. Mean changes in I-V relation, current density, and fractional changes in current amplitude at +20 (steps) or +40 mV (ramps) were compared by unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test. Peptides were synthesized in the University of Calgary Peptide Synthesis Core Facility and purified as previously described (33Allen B.G. Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29288-29298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence was confirmed by amino acid analysis and shown to be >95% pure by analytical high performance liquid chromatography. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Biomedical Inc. cPKA was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from bovine heart according to Demaille et al. (34Demaille J.G. Peters K.A. Strandjord T.P. Fischer E.H. FEBS Lett. 1978; 86: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose beads were obtained from GE Healthcare. All other chemicals were purchased from VWR or Sigma-Aldrich. To address the relevance of Thr-46, Myc-tagged Kv1.2-WT, Kv1.2-T46A, and Kv1.2-T46D proteins were immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cell lysates with anti-Myc and phosphorylated in vitro with cPKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Fig. 2A shows that Kv1.2-WT protein was phosphorylated by PKA, as were T46A and T46D mutant proteins. 32P incorporation was not detected for reactions performed in the absence of cPKA (data not shown). This demonstrates that Kv1.2 is a substrate for PKA and sites other than Thr-46 are involved. To determine the identity of the amino acid residue(s) phosphorylated by PKA, tryptic digests of 32P-labeled Kv1.2-WT were subjected to acid hydrolysis, mixed with phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine, subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, and viewed by autoradiography. Fig. 2B shows that the phosphorylated residue(s) co-migrated with phosphoserine, detected by ninhydrin staining. Thus, Kv1.2 is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro exclusively at serine residues. Phosphopeptide maps of Kv1.2-WT and T46A mutant are compared in Fig. 3A. A single major phosphopeptide of identical mobility was generated after digestion of both proteins. Minor spots in Fig. 3A represent <5% of the total radioactivity. This indicates that Kv1.2 is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro on one tryptic fragment. The presence of one major phosphorylated peptide was also indicated by separation of Kv1.2-WT tryptic peptides by immobilized metal affinity chromatography that detected a single major radioactive peak at fractions 18–23 (Fig. 3B). Based on canonical PKA phosphorylation consensus sequences (24Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ser-449 (Fig. 1) presented as an excellent candidate site. Assuming complete digestion with trypsin, Ser-449 would be expected to be the first serine in the peptide SASTISK. Tryptic digests of 32P-labeled Kv1.2-WT-myc were, therefore, mixed with pSASTISK and separated. Fig. 3C shows that the tryptic Kv1.2-WT phosphopeptide migrated to the same position as the monophosphorylated synthetic peptide, consistent with phosphorylation at one serine residue(s) between 449 and 455. The high hydrophilicity of 32P-labeled tryptic peptide permitted partial purification using a reverse phase C18 column, with the flow-through examined by MALDI-TOF MS. This approach identified a major peptide of m/z 773.4 corresponding to the predicted protonated mass of the tryptic peptide containing phosphorylated Ser-449 (i.e. pSASTISK). This species was visible in direct infusion nanospray experiments, as shown in Fig. 4A. The singly charged m/z 773.4 ion was selected for MS/MS analysis, and fragmentation produced the product ion spectrum shown in Fig. 4B. Phosphorylation was detected by the M-98 peak corresponding to the loss of H3PO4 (m/z 675.4) and supported by the detection of a residue mass consistent with the presence of dehydroalanine at m/z 606.5 (arising from the β-elimination of phosphate from serine residues). The peptide sequence was determined by MASCOT to correspond to pSASTISK and manually verified. The synthetic phosphopeptide, pSASTISK, generated an identical fragmentation pattern (data not shown). Mass spectrometry was employed to identify residues of Kv1.2-WT and Kv1.2-S449A exhibiting phosphorylation in situ. Kv1.2-WT was immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells in control conditions and after treatment with 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) for 30 min and subjected to tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis. The m/z 773.5 ion was detected in control and 8-Br-cAMP-treated cell samples of Kv1.2-WT, and the product ion spectra shown in Figs. 5, A and B, respectively, were consistent with those obtained in the in vitro phosphorylation experiments. A MIDAS approach was used to determine whether additional sites on Kv1.2-WT and Kv1.2-S449A were also phosphorylated in situ. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio associated with this approach allows for more sensitive detection of phosphopeptides in low abundance proteins compared with LC-MS/ MS (35Unwin R.D. Griffiths J.R.

Tryptic peptides derived from all cytoplasmic domains of Kv1.2-WT (Fig. 1) and Kv1.2-S449A of control and 8-Br-cAMP-treated HEK 293 cells were considered in this analysis. Phosphorylation of Ser-449 (data not shown) and two additional residues, Ser-440 and Ser-441 (at retention times of 23 and 24 min, respectively; Fig. 6, A and B), was identified in Kv1.2-WT of control and 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells. This result is similar to the pattern previously detected by Yang et al. (26Yang J.W. Vacher H. Park K.S. Clark E. Trimmer J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20055-20060Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but contrary to their observations, we did not detect phosphorylation of Ser-434. The Ser-440 and Ser-441 sites had 532.8 > 488.8 transitions (2+ charged state), indicating a loss of H3PO4. Associated MASCOT and manual product ion scans confirmed these phosphorylated tryptic peptides to be IPpSSPDLKK and IPSpSPDLKK (i.e. Ser-440 and Ser-441, respectively; Fig. 6). We also detected Ser-440 and Ser-441 phosphorylation in control and 8-Br-cAMP-treated HEK 293 cells expressing Kv1.2-S449A (data not shown). Significantly, no additional phosphorylated tryptic fragments were identified after 8-Br-cAMP treatment compared with control conditions for HEK 293 cells expressing Kv1.2-WT or Kv1.2-S449A. The effect of mutating Ser-440, Ser-441, and Ser-449 on in vitro 32P incorporation was examined. Fig. 7A shows an autoradiogram of 32P incorporation and anti-Myc immunoblot of Kv1.2-WT, -T46A, -S449A, -S449D, the double mutant Kv1.2-S440A/S441A, and the triple mutant Kv1.2-S440A/S441A/S449A. 32P incorporation for each mutant expressed as a % of that for Kv1.2-WT is shown in Fig. 7B. The T46A and double S440A/S441A mutations were without effect on 32P incorporation. The S449A, S449D, and triple S440A/S441A/S449A mutations significantly reduced 32P incorporation to 25.8 ± 6.7, 31.8 ± 6.6, and 35.1 ± 3.8%, respectively, of wild-type protein, but incorporation was not abolished. For this reason we performed phosphopeptide mapping on 32P-labeled Kv1.2-S449A after mixing the tryptic digest with synthetic pSASTISK (Fig. 7C). The peptides migrated to the same position, but visualization of 32P-labeled peptide required an exposure time of 4 weeks compared with just 3 days for Kv1.2-WT peptide (Fig. 3C). This is consistent with a much lower efficiency of 32P incorporation. Synthetic peptide KKSRSASTISK corresponding to residues 445–455 of Kv1.2 was tested as a substrate using [γ-32P]ATP and varied cPKA concentrations. Phosphorylation was dependent on cPKA concentration and did not exceed 1 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide (Fig. 8A). Kemptide (LLRRASLG) and the Ser-449 null peptide, KKSRAASTISK, were tested as positive and negative controls, respectively. Kemptide was phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of ∼1 mol/mol at all concentrations of cPKA tested, whereas the null peptide showed low, non-stoichiometric levels of 32P incorporation even at 5 μg/ml cPKA (Fig. 8A). These results indicate that there is one principal site of phosphorylation between residues 445–455 but that phosphorylation at substoichiometric levels can occur at adjacent residues in the absence of Ser-449. The kinetics of PKA phosphorylation were examined using KKSRSASTISK, Kemptide, and the Ser-449 null peptide. PKA phosphorylation of KKSRSASTISK and Kemptide demonstrated substrate concentration dependence (Fig. 8B) that obeyed Michaelis-Mente"

Homolytic decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides gives rise to endogenous genotoxins such as 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal, which cause the formation of mutagenic DNA adducts. Chiral lipidomics analysis was employed to show that a 5-LO-derived lipid hydroperoxide was responsible for endogenous DNA-adduct formation. The study employed human lymphoblastoid CESS cells, which expressed both 5-LO and the required 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP). The major lipid peroxidation product was 5(S)-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-(E,Z,Z,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid, which was analyzed as its reduction product, 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-(E,Z,Z,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HETE)). Concentrations of 5(S)-HETE increased from 0.07 +/- 0.01 to 45.50 +/- 4.05 pmol/10(7) cells upon stimulation of the CESS cells with calcium ionophore A23187. There was a concomitant increase in the 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal-derived DNA-adduct, heptanone-etheno-2'-deoxyguanosine (HepsilondGuo) from 2.41 +/- 0.35 to 6.31 +/- 0.73 adducts/10(7) normal bases. Biosynthesis of prostaglandins, 11(R)-hydroxy-5,8,12,14-(Z,Z,E,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid, and 15(R,S)-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-(Z,Z,Z,E)-eicosatetraenoic acid revealed that there was cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in the CESS cells. Western blot analysis revealed that COX-1 was expressed by the cells, but there was no COX-2 or 15-LO-1. FLAP inhibitor reduced HepsilondGuo-adducts and 5(S)-HETE to basal levels. In contrast, aspirin, which had no effect on 5(S)-HETE, blocked the formation of prostaglandins, 15-HETE, and 11-HETE but did not inhibit HepsilondGuo-adduct formation. These data showed that 5-LO was the enzyme responsible for the generation of the HepsilondGuo DNA-adduct in CESS cells."

However, the mechanisms underlying these differences are unclear, and these formins do not interact with muscle actin in vivo. We use yeast wild type and mutant actins to further assess these differences between Bnr1 and Bni1. Low ionic strength G-buffer does not promote actin polymerization. However, Bnr1, but not Bni1, causes the polymerization of pyrene-labeled Mg-G-actin in G-buffer into single filaments based on fluorometric and EM observations. Polymerization by Bnr1 does not occur with Ca-G-actin. By cosedimentation, maximum filament formation occurs at a Bnr1:actin ratio of 1:2. The interaction of Bnr1 with pyrene-labeled S265C Mg-actin yields a pyrene excimer peak, from the cross-strand interaction of pyrene probes, which only occurs in the context of F-actin. In F-buffer, Bnr1 promotes much faster yeast actin polymerization than Bni1. It also bundles the F-actin in contrast to the low ionic strength situation where only single filaments form. Thus, the differences previously observed with muscle actin are not actin isoform-specific. The binding of both formins to F-actin saturate at an equimolar ratio, but only about 30% of each formin cosediments with F-actin. Finally, addition of Bnr1 but not Bni1 to pyrene-labeled wild type and S265C Mg-F actins enhanced the pyrene- and pyrene-excimer fluorescence, respectively, suggesting Bnr1 also alters F-actin structure.

A major unsolved protein in the study of formins is the elucidation of the individual functions of different isoforms and their regulation. In vivo, these two budding yeast formins have distinct cellular locations and dynamics (1Evangelista M. Pruyne D. Amberg D.C. Boone C. Bretscher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 260-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. Nat.

Bni1 concentrates at the budding site before the daughter cell buds from the mother cell, moves along with the tip of the daughter cell, and then travels back to the neck between daughter and mother cells at the end of segregation. Bnr1 localizes only at the neck of the budding cell in a very short period of time after bud emergence. Although a key cellular function of these two formins in yeast is to promote actin cable formation (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the roles of the individual formins in different cellular process is unclear because deleting either individual formin gene has limited impact on cell growth and deleting both genes together is lethal (21Ozaki-Kuroda K. Yamamoto Y. Nohara H. Kinoshita M. Fujiwara T. Irie K. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although each of the two formins can nucleate actin filament formation in vitro, the manner in which they affect polymerization is distinctly isoform-specific. Most of this mechanistic work in vitro has used formin fragments containing the FH1 and FH2 domains. Bni1 alone processively caps the barbed end of actin filaments partially inhibiting polymerization at this end (14Kovar D.R. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14725-14730Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 16Zigmond S.H. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Forkey J. Pring M. Curr.

Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The profilin-actin complex, recruited to the actin barbed end through its binding to Bni1 FH1 domain, possibly raises the local actin concentration and appears to allow this inhibition to be overcome, thereby, accelerating barbed end polymerization. It has also been shown that this complex modifies the kinetics of actin dynamics at the barbed end (9Neidt E.M. Scott B.J. Kovar D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Kovar D.R. Wu J.Q. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In comparison, the Bnr1 FH1-FH2 domain facilitates actin polymerization much more efficiently than does Bni1. Moseley and Goode (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed Bnr1 accelerates actin polymerization up to 10 times better than does Bni and produces actin filament bundles when the Bnr1/actin molar ratio is above 1:2. Finally, the regulation of Bni1 and Bnr1 by formin binding is different. For example, Bud 6/Aip3, a yeast cell polarity factor, binds to Bni1, but not Bnr1, and also stimulates its activity in vitro. For their studies, Moseley and Goode (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) utilized mammalian skeletal muscle actin instead of the S. cerevisiae actin with which the yeast formins are designed to function. It is entirely possible that the differences observed with the two formins are influenced quantitatively or qualitatively by the nature of the actin used in the study. This possibility must be seriously considered because although yeast and muscle actins are 87% identical in sequence, they display marked differences in their polymerization behavior (23Rubenstein P.A. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Yeast actin nucleates filaments better than muscle actin (24Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Kim E. Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16566-16572Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It appears to form shorter and more flexible filaments than does muscle actin (26McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Finally, the disposition of the Pi released during the hydrolysis of ATP that occurs during polymerization is different. Yeast actin releases its Pi concomitant with hydrolysis of the bound ATP whereas muscle actin retains the Pi for a significant amount of time following nucleotide hydrolysis (28Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This difference is significant because ADP-Pi F-actin has been shown to be more stable than ADP F-actin (30Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Another example of this isoform dependence is the interaction of yeast Arp2/3 with yeast versus muscle actins (31Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24168-24174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Yeast Arp2/3 complex accelerates polymerization of muscle actin only in the presence of a nucleation protein factor such as WASP. However, with yeast actin, no such auxiliary protein is required. In light of these actin behavioral differences, to better understand the functional differences of these two formins in vivo, we have studied the behavior of Bni 1 and Bnr 1 with WT and mutant yeast actins, and we have also explored the molecular basis underlying the Bnr 1-induced formation of actin nuclei from G-actin. WT yeast actin and S265C yeast actin were prepared from frozen cells as described previously (32Wen K.K. Giardina P.C. Blake M.S. Edwards J. Apicella M.A. Rubenstein P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8638-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Modification of the actins with N-(1-pyrenyl) maleimide (Sigma) on C374 of WT actin and C265C and C374 of S265C actin was carried out according to Feng et al. (33Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The purified yeast actins were stored in the Ca2+-form in Ca-G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT) for no more than a week. His-tagged FH1-FH2 fragments from the yeast formins Bnr1 and Bni1 were prepared in yeast strain BGY 502 from Gal-induced overexpression plasmids generously provided by Dr. Bruce Goode, Brandeis University, as previously described (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Moseley J.B. Maiti S. Goode B.L. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 215-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Purified formin fragments were stored in stock buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) at a concentration of 5–10 μm at −20 °C. Samples were retained no more than a week at 4 °C after thawing. Mg-G-actin was prepared by diluting Ca-G-actin at least 10-fold with Mg-G-buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 100 μm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT at room temperature 2 min prior to use. To assay the binding of G-actin, different concentrations of formin were incubated with 1 μm G-actin in either Ca- or Mg-G-buffer. To induce actin polymerization, G-actin and formin were preincubated at room temperature for at least 15 min, and polymerization was induced by the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 mm and 50 mm, respectively. The change in actin-pyrene fluorescence due to the binding of formin or to actin polymerization was recorded with either a Florolog-3 or a FlouroMax-3 instrument (Jobin Yvon-Spex). The excitation wavelength was 365 nm. The change in fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength 386 nm was recorded over time for kinetics analyses, and the emission spectrum from 375 nm to 600 nm was also recorded before and after each reaction. To calculate the net change in fluorescence intensity, the final intensity values at emission wavelength either 386 nm or 485 nm (pyrene excimer) of each reaction was subtracted from the control value obtained with actin alone. To normalize the change in fluorescence intensity, the net change in fluorescence with formin was divided by the net change of the control reaction. To assay the binding of formin to G-actin in G-buffer, the formin at the desired concentration was mixed with 1 μm Mg-G-actin in Mg-G-buffer in a final volume of 120 μl for 20 min at room temperature. For interaction with F-actin, the mixture of G-actin and formin was allowed to polymerize by the addition of salts at room temperature from 30 min as described above. The reaction solutions were centrifuged in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge in a TLA.1 rotor at 80 K rpm for 15 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of Mg-G-buffer. The whole pellet sample and a quarter of the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the bands were stained with Coomassie Blue. Gels were quantitated by densitometry using an Epson Perfection 2450 Photo scanner (Epson America Inc.) with 600 dpi resolution. The intensity (histogram count) of the actin and formin bands in the image was further quantified by ImageJ (NIH) software making sure the density was in the linear detection range of the instrument. The ratio of formin to actin in each pellet was determined using the density values normalized to the MW of the two proteins. A 3-μl aliquot of the appropriate actin solution was deposited on a carbon-coated Formvar grid, which was then negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The sample was observed on a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope in the University of Iowa Central Electron Microscopy Facility. The lengths of the filaments in the images were measured by ImageJ (NIH). At least 100 filaments from each sample were measured, and the statistic analysis was done by using Excel (Microsoft). To begin to assess a possible difference in the ability of the two yeast formins to interact with G-actin, we examined their interaction with yeast G-actin in the Mg-form labeled at Cys-374 with pyrene maleimide. Because of the abundance of Mg2+ in the cell, this is the most physiologically relevant form of the actin. However, because actin conformation is known to be affected by the nature of the cation at the high affinity cation binding site (35Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Gershman L.C. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 358: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we also examined the interaction of the formins with Ca-G-actin. This is the form in which actins are generally purified because it has been well established that the nature of the bound divalent cation can markedly affect actin polymerization properties. Addition of Bnr1 to Mg-G-actin in low ionic strength buffer caused a dose-dependent increase in actin pyrene fluorescence (Fig. 1A). If this fluorescence increase was due solely to the interaction of the formin with actin monomers, the increase in fluorescence would be expected to occur almost instantaneously, such as occurs in the binding of pyrene-labeled G-actin to profilin (26McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this was not the case. Fig. 1B shows a slow increase in fluorescence in the presence of Bnr1 that plateaus over about 800 s, a kinetic profile possibly suggestive of actin polymerization but without the nucleation phase often observed. A titration curve with increasing amounts of Bnr1 against a fixed amount of actin shows saturation at a level of one Bnr1 monomer per two actins (Fig. 1C). Contrary to the case with Mg-actin, no increase in fluorescence was observed following the addition of Bnr1 to Ca-G-actin (data not shown). To determine whether this reaction was formin-specific, we repeated the experiments with Mg- and Ca-G-actin using Bni1. In this case, no increase in fluorescence was observed with either form of actin. To further assess the possibility that Bnr1 induces actin polymerization in Mg-G-buffer, we examined negatively stained samples of G-actin/Bnr1 mixtures by electron microscopy. With Ca-G-actin (Fig. 2A), we observed only small non-descript aggregates that might be due to the actin alone. On the other hand, with Mg-G-actin under low ionic strength conditions, abundant single filamentous structures, not bundles, were observed. Length measurements show ranges of 0.2–3 μm with an average of about 0.8 μm (Fig. 2B), independent of the Bnr1/actin ratio. These filaments are about one-fourth the length of F-actin filaments formed in F-buffer in the absence of formin (26McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With Bni1, no such filaments were observed, only the small non-descript aggregates (data not shown). Although Bnr1 can apparently facilitate the formation of filaments with the appearance of F-actin, we wished to gain further insight into the nature of these filaments. For these experiments, we utilized a mutant form of yeast actin we had previously characterized, S265C (33Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Position 265 is near the tip of a hydrophobic loop between actin subdomains 3 and 4. Labeling of this actin with pyrene maleimide introduces two mol of probe per mol of actin, one at Cys-265 and one at Cys-374. In the filament, the pyrene at 265 interacts with the pyrene on Cys-374 of a monomer on the apposing strand of the two-stranded actin helix across the interstrand space. This interaction produces a new pyrene excimer fluorescence signal at 485 nm, which forms only in the context of F-actin. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the combination of Bnr1 with Mg pyrene-labeled S265 yeast actin produces such an excimer band at 485 nm, identical to that observed with F-actin alone. The intensity of this band increases in a Bnr1 concentration-dependent manner saturating at or near a Bnr1/actin ratio of 1:2, based on the significant overlap of error bars for the final points on the saturation curve. This result is identical to that seen with the 385-nm peak using pyrene-labeled WT and S265C actins (Figs. 3B and 1C, respectively). We next wished to gain information concerning the efficiency with which Bnr1 could induce G-actin to polymerize. Toward this aim, we assessed the extent of filament formation as a function of increasing Bnr1 concentration by centrifugation analysis. Samples of the two proteins were mixed, filaments were collected by centrifugation under conditions normally sufficient to pellet F-actin, and the distribution of the two proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands. Fig. 4A shows that increasing Bnr1 led to increasing amounts of actin in the pellet fraction until about 50–60% of the total actin had been pelleted at saturating formin levels. Assessment of the relative amount of Bnr1 and actin in the pellet fraction (Fig. 4B), again based on substantial overlap of the error bars for the final points on the saturation curve, showed the ratio increased until reaching a plateau value of about 1:2 as we observed in the fluorescence experiments in Figs. 1C and 3B. Our work to this point demonstrates that formin can overcome the inhibition of actin polymerization caused by low ionic strength solutions. We next wanted to assess the extent to which other types of disruption of normal monomer-monomer interactions could be overcome by Bnr1 binding. We thus assessed the effects of Bnr1 on actin modified by tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) at Cys-374. Previous studies have shown that this actin is incapable of polymerization under normal polymerizing (F-salt) conditions (37Kudryashov D.S. Phillips M. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1136-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38Pelikan Conchaudron A. Didry D. Le K.H. Larquet E. Boisset N. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We added Bnr1 to a mixture of Mg-G-actin containing 90% TMR-actin and 10% pyrene-labeled actin and recorded the change in pyrene fluorescence as a function of time. No increase in fluorescence was observed in the pyrene peak (data not shown), either in a G-actin sample or following addition of F-salts. EM examination of the samples before and after the addition of salt shows no identifiable filaments, only small aggregates (data not shown). Previous work comparing the effects of the two yeast formins on actin polymerization utilized pyrene-labeled muscle actin (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We thus wished to assess the differential effects of Bni1 and Bnr1 on the salt-induced polymerization of Cys-374 pyrene-labeled yeast actin. Fig. 5 demonstrates that, as seen previously with muscle actin, Bnr1 is much more effective than Bni1 in promoting actin polymerization. However, we saw a striking difference between the two formins in the extent of the change in pyrene fluorescence that occurred. With three different actin preparations, the total pyrene fluorescence change with Bnr1 was always about 25% greater than that caused by Bni1 and WT actin alone. To determine if this difference reflected a difference in the extent of polymerization with the two formins, we carried out a cosedimentation analysis on the material at the end of the reaction to verify possible changes in the amount of actin polymerization. Analysis of the actin amount in the pellet and supernatant fractions in the presence and absence of formin showed no significant difference in the extent of polymerization (Fig. 6). Thus, the fluorescence difference has to reflect a difference in the environment sampled by the actin probe in the presence of the two formins. Examination of the final states of the polymerization reactions by electron microscopy (Fig. 7) showed that, as reported before (34Moseley J.B. Maiti S. Goode B.L. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 215-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in F-buffer Bnr1 bundled actin but Bni1 did not. However, the enlarged image in Fig. 7B demonstrated that the Bnr1-mediated actin bundle is not well organized.FIGURE 6Cosedimentation assay for the binding of yeast formins to Mg-F-actin. 1 μm Mg-actin was copolymerized in Mg-G-buffer at room temperature for 30 min with yeast formin at different concentrations as indicated on the top of the gel, and then the mixture was centrifuged. The pellet (P) and supernatant (SN) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining as described as under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B, the intensity of each actin and formin band in the pellet was quantified by densitometry. The molar ratio of formin to actin in the pellet was calculated based on the intensity of each protein band, corrected for their differences in MW, and plotted on the y axis against the Bnr1 concentration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Bnr1 binding data are averaged from three individual experiments, and Bni1 binding data are from two individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7EM analysis of Mg-F-actin mixed with either Bnr1 or Bni1. 1 μm Mg-actin was polymerized in the presence of 0.25 μm of either Bnr1 (panels A and B) or Bni1 (panel C) at room temperature for 30 min. The product from each reaction was examined by EM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B, enlarged Bnr1/F actin bundle compared with the bundle in panel A. Bar = 0.2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cosedimentation data (Fig. 6) show that the interaction of both formins with F-actin is saturable. Interestingly, at saturation, the ratio of formin: actin in the pellet was about 1:3 for Bnr1 and 1:4 for Bni1 suggesting that only limited binding sites are available on the actin filament. The difference in fluorescence change caused by the two formins during the copolymerization experiments suggested that formin binding to F-actin could alter its conformation. To test this possibility, we assessed the effect of Bnr1 on pyrene-labeled S265C F-actin by copolymerizing Bnr1 with S265C actin in F-salts and examining the emission fluorescence spectrum at the steady state. Fig. 8A shows that the addition of Bnr1 results in about a 40% maximum increase in the pyrene excimer fluorescence, indicative of a significant change in filament conformation as a result of the binding. Under the same condition, Bni1 produced no change (data not shown). We then assessed the effects of increasing Bnr1 concentration on excimer fluorescence. Fig. 8B demonstrates a saturable effect at a Bnr1:actin ratio of 1:5 that levels off substantially below the ratio (about 1:5 of Bnr1 to actin) at which saturable G-actin binding of the formin occurs. We initially wished to gain insight into the mechanism underlying the difference in activity of the yeast formins Bnr1 and Bni1 toward muscle actin and to determine if these differences were dependent on the actin isoform used. Our initial experiments with yeast actin produced a very unexpected result. Addition of Bnr1, but not Bni 1, to yeast actin in low ionic strength conditions (G-buffer) led to actin filament formation. Furthermore, the pyrene-excimer results with labeled S265C yeast actin showed these filaments had a relatively normal F-actin structure. We observed the same result with muscle actin indicating that differences in formin behavior were inherent to the formins themselves. In their studies (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), Moseley and Goode had also demonstrated an increase pyrene fluorescence when they added Bnr 1 to their muscle actin sample just prior to adding salts to induce polymerization. They hypothesized that this may have resulted from some type of nucleus formation but did not further investigate the cause of this fluorescence increase. Muscle actin, as opposed to yeast actin, will polymerize in the presence of F-buffer containing Ca2+ instead of Mg2+ (25Kim E. Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16566-16572Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that the calcium form of muscle G-actin might be closer in conformation than yeast actin to that required for inducement of polymerization. However, the Bnr1-dependent polymerization of either actin in G-buffer required the actin in its Mg2+ form. Evidently, even with muscle actin, the potential stabilization of actin monomer-monomer conformation afforded by Bnr1 was insufficient to push calcium actin to a polymerization-competent state in the absence of added salt. The inability of Bnr1 to polymerize TMR-modified actin in G-buffer, even in the Mg2+ form, is further evidence of the actin structural limitations needed for low ionic strength polymerization to occur. Two routes to this Bnr1-facilitated G-actin polymerization could theoretically be envisioned. Bnr1 could nucleate the filament causing a change in filament end conformation, which would allow elongation without a need for additional Bnr1, even in the absence of higher ionic strength conditions, in essence a propagated effect along the elongating filament. Alternatively, some type of Bnr1 binding along the entire length of the filament under G-buffer conditions stabilizes the filament as it is forming. Results of our titration experiments show that both of these alternatives might be involved. Increasing formin results in increasing filament formation until saturation is reached at a molar ratio of one FH2 domain per two actin monomers. However, by cosedimentation, the ratio of Bnr1:actin in the pelleted fraction increased as a function of the amount of added formin. This result suggests that initial stabilization of a filament nucleus by the formin under G-buffer conditions leads to an actin conformational change that propagates well beyond where the formin binds. Bugyi et al. (39Bugyi B. Papp G. Hild G. Lõrinczy D. Nevalainen E.M. Lappalainen P. Somogyi B. Nyitrai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10727-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reached a similar conclusion based the application of an anisotropy decay assay using pyrene-labeled muscle actin in the presence of the mouse formin mDia 1 under F-buffer conditions. Finally, under G-buffer conditions, pelletable actin with the Bnr1 was only about 50–60% of the actin that would normally sediment under the usual F-buffer conditions. These results, coupled with the decreased length of the Bnr-1 G-actin filaments compared with normal yeast F-actin (26McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggest that filaments formed in G-buffer in the presence of Bnr1 have a higher critical concentration than does normal F-actin. Together, these findings suggest that a mechanism for Bnr1-initiated filament formation under G-buffer conditions is nucleation followed by elongation and subsequent polymer stabilization by the available formin in solution due to filament side binding. An alternative mechanism would involve the annealing of small formin-initiated actin oligomers. However, we cannot judge the relative contribution of these two routes to overall polymerization at the present time. Mosley and Goode (8Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that the addition of Bnr1 but not Bni1 to preformed muscle F-actin resulted in filament bundle formation. We found the same to be true when we copolymerized each of these formins with yeast actin in F-buffer. However, we observed no bundles with Bnr1 under G-buffer conditions, suggesting that bundle formation might require higher ionic strengths to allow access of the formin bundling motif to the surface of the actin filament. Based on experiments with the mammalian bundling forming FLR1, Harris et al. (40Harris E.S. Rouiller I. Hanein D. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14383-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) suggested that FLR1-dependent bundling resulted from the interaction of a basic patch of residues on the formin ring with an acidic patch on a neighboring filament. If the two apposing protein faces were constitutively exposed, and this simple hypothesis was correct, an increase in ionic strength should work to inhibit bundling, the opposite of what we observed. The formation of filament bundles in F- but not G-buffer gives credence to the idea that an ionic strength-dependent conformation change in either the formin or the actin is required for formin interaction with the side of the actin filament. A large body of data does suggest that ionic strength is a major determinant of actin conformation in agreement with this hypothesis (41Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 42Hosek M. Tang J. X. Physical Review E. 2004; 69 (051907)Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrated that the two yeast formins could differentially alter the conformation of yeast F-actin. Our pyrene fluorescence data, showing a greater change induced by Bnr1 compared with Bni1, suggest one of two possibilities. Either the Bnr1 preferentially interacts somehow with the probe, directly altering its fluorescence, or it causes a conformational change in the filament that secondarily alters the environment of the pyrene leading to an increase in its fluorescence yield. Further insight into this differential alteration of filament conformation was obtained when we polymerized pyrene-S265C actin in the presence of Bnr1 in F-buffer resulting in a 40% greater pyrene excimer signal than that obtained with actin alone. One possible reason for this observation is that the interaction of the formin with the actin on the outside of the filament caused a propagated conformation change in the strand-strand interface within the filament leading to an increase in the total number of overlapping pyrene probes and hence a greater excimer signal. Alternatively, the formin may have produced a change in the environment of existing interacting pyrenes leading to improved inter-probe energy transfer. Significantly, a similar change was not caused by Bni1 binding, even though polymerization extent was the same as with Bnr1 and the formin:actin ratio in the pelleted fractions were nearly the same in both cases. Further evidence supporting a Bnr1-induced filament conformation change was the fact that the maximum increase in excimer fluorescence was reached at a Bnr1:actin ratio far below the 1:5 observed for saturable binding. This observation suggested that the interaction of Bnr1 with a pre-existing filament can exert a substantial propagated effect on conformation along the filament length. In summary, our results show an enhanced ability of Bnr1 over Bni 1 to affect actin structure and behavior. Not only does it nucleate and bundle filaments under physiological conditions, but we show that its interaction with actin is strong enough to polymerize actin under G-conditions. We also show that it alters the conformation of preformed actin filaments, suggesting it can induce propagated changes along these filaments. The role of Bnr1 in vivo is to aid in the formation of polarized actin cables as tracks for optimal delivery of vesicles to the new cell bud. Our data suggest that the ability of Bnr1 to bundle filaments and to alter their conformation may play a role in the ability of actin binding regulatory proteins to properly facilitate cable deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1964245866,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is often controlled by cell signals, for example, those activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV). We have shown that CaMKIV regulates alternative splicing through short CA repeats and hnRNP L. Here we use a splicing reporter that shows PKA/CaMKIV promotion of exon inclusion to select from exons containing random 13-nt sequences for RNA elements responsive to the kinases in cultured cells. This selection not only identified both PKA- and CaMKIV-responsive elements that are similar to the CaMKIV-responsive RNA element 1 (CaRRE1) or CA repeats, but also A-rich elements not previously known to respond to these kinases. Consistently, hnRNP L is identified as a factor binding the CA-rich elements. Analyses of the motifs in the highly responsive elements indicate that they are indeed critical for the kinase effect and are enriched in alternative exons. Interestingly, a CAAAAAA motif is sufficient for the PKA/CaMKIV-regulated splicing of the exon 16 of the CaMK kinase β1 (CaMKK2) transcripts, implying a role of this motif in signaling cross-talk or feedback regulation between these kinases through alternative splicing.

These elements have all been defined through intensive mutagenesis analyses of individual splicing reporter minigenes. SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) has been used for A/C-rich splicing enhancers and G-rich silencers (23Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell.

It would be particularly difficult to enrich kinase-responsive elements from spliced mRNA in cells with SELEX when a kinase, like CaMKIV, shows exon-exclusion activity through the CaRREs in the current splicing reporter systems (6Xie J.

In this report, we selected PKA- and CaMKIV-responsive RNA elements using SELEX based on the context-dependent promotion of exon inclusion by the kinases and characterized the selected elements. The Flag-PKA (A), Flag-CaMKIV-dCT (CaMKIV or IV) or -dCTK75E (CaMKIVm or IVm, kinase-dead) and PKCγ are as described (6Xie J. Black D.L.

Particularly for the CaMKIV and PKA plasmids, their activity or inactivity was confirmed by monitoring the phosphorylation levels of their target proteins CREB Ser133 and PTB Ser16, respectively (6Xie J.

AAA39936, corresponding to Lys72 and Lys168 in the previous report (28Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Splicing reporter minigene 33SB is a chimera of pDUP4-1 and pL53In (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Modafferi E.F. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ApaI/BglII fragment of pDUP4-1 was cloned into the ApaI/BamHI sites of pL53In (a gift from Dr. Harold König), and SalI and BamHI restriction sites were introduced into the 33-nucleotide (nt) middle exon (23Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell.

For cTNTβ splicing reporters, the SalI-BamHI fragment of the cTNTβ minigene (a kind gift of Dr. Thomas A. Cooper) (23Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), was substituted with that of 33SB-derived constructs containing cloned elements. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum in 12-well plates. Transfection was done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. To test PKA or PKCγ effect on splicing, 0.2 μg of a minigene splicing reporter construct was cotransfected with 0.6 μg of Flag-PKAm (Am), Flag-PKA (A), or pPKCγ-EGFP (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) plasmid for 16–24 h. For PKCγ effect, cells were then washed, maintained in DMEM, and treated with TPA (120 ng/ml) or DMSO (TPA vehicle control) for 24 h. The translocation of PKCγ-EGFP from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane as a result of TPA activation of the PKC signal was monitored under a fluorescence microscope (27Xie J. Lee J.A. Kress T.L. Mowry K.L. Black D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8776-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. GH3 cells were cultured as described previously (9Yu J. Hai Y. Liu G. Fang T. Kung S.K. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1505-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cells following transfection/treatments with the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) according to the supplier's protocol. About 2.5 μg of RNA was used in a 10-μl reverse transcription (RT) reaction containing M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT18. 2 μl of the RT product was used in a 25-μl PCR reaction for 26 cycles at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. The RT-PCR products were resolved in 3.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. For examination of endogenous exons, about 200 ng of RNA was used in a 10-μl RT reaction. 1 μl of the RT product was used in a 13-μl PCR reaction for 35 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55 °C, and the RT-PCR products were resolved in 3% agarose gels. Band intensities of the splice variants were quantified with the NIH Image J software 1.37v (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health). The percentages of exon inclusion were relative to the total band intensities of the spliced two products. The PCR primers for 33SB-derived splicing reporters: Insulin1, 5′-GATCCGCTTCCTGCCCCTG-3′; Insulin2a, 5′-ACCCAGCTCCAGTTGTGC-3′; for cTNTβ-derived splicing reporters: cTNT1, 5′-AGGAGTATGTGGAAGAAG-3′; cTNT2, 5′-GTCATCCTGAGTGTGGTTGGCAAAG-3′. Primers for endogenous exon STREX: RbSlo1, 5′-AGTGCCTTCGTGGGTCTGTCCTT-3′, QRA59, 5′-CACATTGGAGTCCATGTTGTC-3′; for CaMKK2 exon 16: 93437s, 5′-GATCCTAGTGAAGACCATG-3′, 93437a, 5′-CCACCTTTCACAAGAGCAC-3′; for LKAP exon 7: rh37944s, 5′-AGCTGATCAGATTTGAAG-3′, r37944a, 5′-GCTCCCATGGCCTTGCTG-3′. To test the kinase activity of Flag-PKA and its mutant, overnight HEK293T cultures in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.6 μg of Myc-PTB plasmid, or cotransfected with 0.6 μg of pcDNA3.1(+), Flag-PKA, or Flag-PKA mutant plasmid. Cells were harvested about 1.5 days after transfection and sonication-lysed in Buffer E (20 mm HEPES KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (31Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 488: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and 10 mm NaF. A fraction of the cell lysates cotransfected with Myc-PTB plus Flag-PKA or PKA mutant plasmid was treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) in 1× dephosphorylation buffer (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for about 30 min. For Western blot analysis, 5-μg cell lysates of each non-PKA cotransfected sample and 2.5 μg of each PKA-cotransfected sample (including those treated with CIAP) were resolved in Novex® 4–20% Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), followed by blocking in TBS (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl) containing 5% (w/v) dried skim milk. Total Myc-PTB and phospho-PTB were then probed by c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Clontech) and anti-phospho-Ser16-PTB antibody (27Xie J. Lee J.A. Kress T.L. Mowry K.L. Black D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8776-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). After three washes in TBS, membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for about 1 h, followed by three washes in TBS. Proteins were then visualized by applying Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and exposing to x-ray films. For detection of PKA and PKA mutant protein, membranes were washed in TBS and reprobed by a monoclonal ANTI-FLAG® M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Co). To create a library of splicing reporters, a synthesized nominally random sequence of 13 nt in a primer was substituted for the 13-nt replacement cassette in 33SB in PCR reactions. The PCR products were digested with ApaI and BglII, and ligated with ApaI- and BamHI-digested pL53In. The resulting plasmid pool contained ∼1.16 × 107 reporter clones as estimated from transformation of Escherichia coli cells with an aliquot of the plasmids. The complexity of the sequence pool was verified by randomly sequencing 17 clones, with no identical sequences obtained. The pool was cotransfected with 10 μg of Flag-PKA or Flag-CaMKIV-dCT plasmid and 5 μg of an EGFP plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 into HEK293T cells in a 10-cm dish (∼7 × 106 cells). The transfection efficiency was estimated 24 h later to be at least 90% by counting green cells under a fluorescence microscope. Total RNA was harvested using the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) followed by digestion with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) to remove contaminating plasmid DNA, which was confirmed by the absence of PCR products using an RT sample without reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR was then performed to selectively amplify middle exon-included mRNA using primers targeted to splice junctions (primer SXenh-J1, 5′-GGAGGACCCACAAGGTCG-3′ and primer SXenh-J2, 5′-CCAGTTGTGCCACTGGAT-3′). The PCR products were cloned as SalI-BamHI fragments back into the 33SB vector and the selection cycle went through multiple rounds, repeating the same procedure in the subsequent rounds as in the first one except that about 1 × 106 plasmid clones (as estimated by transformation in E. coli) were cotransfected with 1.5 μg of Flag-PKA (or CaMKIV-dCT) and 1 μg of the EGFP plasmid into about 1 × 106 HEK293T cells. This assay was carried out as described previously using [α-32P]CTP-labeled RNA transcripts (9Yu J. Hai Y. Liu G. Fang T. Kung S.K. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1505-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The anti-hnRNP L antibody, 4D11 (32Piñol-Roma S. Swanson M.S. Gall J.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2575-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DNA templates for RNA probes were amplified from highly PKA or CaMKIV-responsive clones A3.15, C7, and C42 with a T7-tagged primer. RNA probes were in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA probe A3.15 sequence (the 13-nt replacement cassette, underlined) is: gcuauuuucccacccuuagGUCGACGGUGCACAGCAAAAAUACCGGAUCCAGguugguaucaagguuacaagacagguuuaaggagaccaauagaucuucag. RNA probes C7 and C42 are different from A3.15 only at the 13-nt inserts. The control probe CG (CG repeat, underlined) is: GUCCAUGUGUCGCGCGGUUAAAUCUUCUGGAAAGUGUGUACACAAUGUUCCGGAAGGCUGACCUCCCUUCAAAUGUCACUCGCCAG; mCaRRE1 probe from the upstream 3′-splice site of DUP175ST is the same as described previously (9Yu J. Hai Y. Liu G. Fang T. Kung S.K. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1505-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A simplified procedure, modified from the previous method (7Xie J. Jan C. Stoilov P. Park J. Black D.L. RNA. 2005; 11: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was used. Briefly, total RNA (16 μl) was prepared from the splicing reporter-transfected HEK293T cells grown in 12-well plates, heated to 85 °C for 5 min followed by 2-min incubation on ice, and 5 μl was used for reverse transcription with Superscript III at 50 °C for 1.5 h. The resulting products were resolved in denaturing PAGE gel (5.3%), dried, exposed to phosphorimager plates, and scanned in a Bio-Rad phosphorimager scanner. The percent exon exclusion is calculated as relative to the total intensity of both exon-included and -excluded products. Comparison between 23 pairs of primer extension products of DUP175 or its derived splicing reporters showed no significant difference (p = 0.16) in the levels of their exon inclusion between samples transfected with each reporter alone and ones cotransfected with CaMKIVm in HEK293 cells; therefore, the kinase effect on splicing was examined by comparing the effect of kinase-dead mutants and active kinases. The selected 13-nt sequences were analyzed with Mutiple Em Motif Elicitation (MEME) (33Bailey T.L. Williams N. Misleh C. Li W.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W369-W373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar), for consensus motifs. The motif-containing human exons were identified from the ASAPII data base (34Kim N. Alekseyenko A.V. Roy M. Lee C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D93-D98Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The constitutive human exons were obtained from the HOLLYWOOD data base (35Holste D.

A. 2005; 102: 2850-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). CaMKIV inhibited splicing through the CaRRE1 element in the DUP175-based reporters (6Xie J. Black D.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Xie J. Jan C. Stoilov P. Park J. Black D.L. RNA. 2005; 11: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Lee J.A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 1505-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, in reporters derived from pL53In (29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), CaMKIV enhanced splicing through the same element (Fig. 1A). In this test, CaRRE1 responses to coexpressed constitutively active Flag-CaMKIV-dCT (CaMKIV or IV) or its kinase-dead mutant (IVm) were examined in the pL53In-based splicing reporter 33SB-CaRRE1a or b (Fig. 1A), containing exons/introns and promoters different from the previous DUP175 (6Xie J. Black D.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29König H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Dominski Z. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the 33SB vector transcripts, inclusion of the middle exon (63%) was essentially unchanged by CaMKIV (lanes 1 and 2). Replacing part of the middle exon with CaRRE1a or CaRRE1b sequences reduced the level of exon inclusion to 38 and 34% (lanes 3 and 5), respectively, indicating that the CaRRE1 sequences are splicing silencers. However, unlike in DUP175, the exon inclusion was increased by overexpressed CaMKIV (63 and 49% exon inclusion, lanes 4 and 6, respectively). A similar promoting effect on exon inclusion by coexpressed Flag-PKA was also observed in the 33SB-CaRRE1 splicing reporters (Fig. 1, B and C). For this assay, we made a double mutant of PKA (PKAm, K73E, K169E) from the wild type Flag-PKA, which phosphorylates the Ser16 of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB, Fig. 1B) (27Xie J. Lee J.A. Kress T.L. Mowry K.L. Black D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8776-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 38Ma S. Liu G. Sun Y. Xie J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the PKAm, the residues Lys73 and Lys169, essential for phosphate-binding (28Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), were mutated to Glu73 and Glu169, respectively. The PKAm showed no kinase activity on the PKA target Ser16 of PTB (Fig. 1B) and exhibited no effect on the exon inclusion (Fig. 1, A and C, compare lanes 1, 3, 5 in A with 1, 3, 7 in C, respectively, p = 0.25, paired Student's t test), in comparison with the CaMKIVm that is known to be kinase-dead and have no effect on splicing (6Xie J. Black D.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Lee J.A. Xing Y. Nguyen D. Xie J. Lee C.J. Black D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, the wild type Flag-PKA increased the exon inclusion level to 77 and 75%, respectively (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 8), similarly to the effect by CaMKIV (Fig. 1A). Importantly, this increase was reduced to that of the 33SB vector level by mutations in CaRRE1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). Because these clones contain the same promoter, flanking exons/introns and poly(A) signals, their differential responses to CaMKIV or PKA are properties of the insert elements themselves rather than those of the transcriptional unit. The promoting effect of CaMKIV and PKA suggested that these protein kinases would likely enrich exons containing kinase-responsive RNA elements in a pool of random sequences during repeated selections. Moreover, because the vector already showed about 65% exon inclusion with CaMKIVm or PKAm (Fig. 1, A and C), constitutive enhancers in the random pool were expected to cause 100% exon inclusion soon in early rounds of selection and could not be further increased by the kinases during subsequent rounds of selection. Thereby this system would likely allow enrichment of silencer elements preferably targeted by the kinases through repeated selections. According to this approach, a pool of 13-nt random sequences was cloned into the middle exon of the 33SB to obtain a library of splicing reporters (containing about 1.16 × 107 clones). The reporters were cotransfected into HEK293T cells with the constitutively active CaMKIV or PKA plasmids. The spliced products were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned back into the vector, and cycled through five selection rounds (Fig. 1D). Because no PKA-responsive splicing element has been reported yet and also for reasons as found out later (more net changes of exon inclusion by PKA and mostly shared elements between these two kinases as shown below), we analyzed the PKA effect in more detail in the following experiments. Preliminary analyses with RT-PCR of the spliced mRNA pools from each selection round (of five rounds in total) indicated that the net changes of exon inclusion by PKA increased and peaked at round 3 (about 3-fold, compared with the starting pool). We therefore randomly picked up 48 clones from the 2nd and 3rd rounds of selection plus the 33SB vector, and analyzed their constitutive splicing and response to PKA coexpression (Fig. 2A). The constitutive level of exon inclusion of these clones ranges from 0 to 93% (Fig. 2A, from bottom to top). A small group of clones (nos. 1–16) showed higher constitutive level of exon inclusion than the 33SB vector. Most of these clones contain motifs that are similar to the purine- or A/C-rich enhancers in the previous selection (23Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mo"

Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and is thus a central mediator of drug bioavailability. Importantly, P-gp overexpression following drug treatment is responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, a major reason for chemotherapy failure not only in cancer cells (2Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) but also in pathogenic microorganisms (3van Veen H.W. Konings W.N.

Aside from its well known role in drug efflux, P-gp is also expressed at basal levels in many different tissues, yet the normal physiological functions of the protein remain poorly understood.

The possibility that physiological levels of host P-gp play a role in host-pathogen interaction, other than mediating drug resistance, has not been investigated so far. We addressed this question using Toxoplasma gondii as a model pathogenic parasite. T. gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, a potentially fatal disease not only for immunocompromised patients and fetuses but according to recent insights also emerging as a life threatening infection in immunocompetent individuals (5Maubon D. Ajzenberg D. Brenier-Pinchart M.P. Dardé M.L. Pelloux H. Trends Parasitol. 2008; 24: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). T. gondii infects virtually all nucleated host cells and resides in a highly specialized vacuole, called the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), which is formed by invaginating the host cell membrane at the time of invasion. The PV is not competent for lysosome fusion, thus avoiding acidification (6Mordue D.G. Håkansson S. Niesman I. Sibley L.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 92: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but it is closely associated with host organelles, including lysosomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Ref. 7Martin A.M. Liu T. Lynn B.C. Sinai A.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2007; 54: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Even though the PV does not intersect directly with host vesicular traffic, T. gondii remains dependent on host cells for a number of critical nutrients. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms T. gondii uses to scavenge nutrients from its host, especially in the case of lipid molecules. An important recent example was the identification of H.O.S.T. (host organelle-sequestering tubulo-structures), a unique system of tubular structures formed by the parasite to sequester cholesterol-containing endo-lysosomes from the host cytoplasm into the PV (8Coppens I. Dunn J.D. Romano J.D. Pypaert M. Zhang H. Boothroyd J.C. Joiner K.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of the traffic from the host cell to the PV are not completely elucidated, and the existence of transporters has been proposed frequently. To analyze whether the P-gp transporter plays a role in T. gondii biology we compared parasite replication in wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with double knock-out (DKO) fibroblasts in which neither of the two murine P-gp isoforms are expressed (9Schinkel A.H. Mayer U. Wagenaar E. Mol C.A. van Deemter L. Smit J.J. van der Valk M.A. Voordouw A.C. Spits H. van Tellingen O. Zijlmans J.M. Fibbe W.E. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4028-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). In parallel, we also analyzed DKO cells complemented with the human P-gp homologue (DKO/P-gp) (10Alemán C. Annereau J.P. Liang X.J. Cardarelli C.O. Taylor B. Yin J.J. Aszalos A. Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3084-3091PubMed Google Scholar), which restored P-gp functionality to DKO cells and allowed P-gp expression levels higher than those found in WT cells (supplemental Fig. S1). In this way, our model did not depend on either drug-selected P-gp-overexpressing cells, which may acquire adaptation mechanisms different from P-gp overexpression during the development of the MDR phenotype, or P-gp inhibitors, several of which are known to have side effects on host metabolism.

The cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Mdr1 transfected 77.1 and G185 cells were maintained in 20 and 60 ng/ml colchicine, respectively. Colchicine was removed from the culture medium during parasite infection. β-Galactosidase expressing T. gondii and Neospora caninum were a kind gift from J. Boothroyd and D. Sibley, respectively. The parasites were maintained by serial passages in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, harvested from infected host cells by passage through a 26-gauge needle, and purified by separation on Sephadex-G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described (13Hemphill A. Gottstein B. Kaufmann H. Parasitology. 1996; 112: 183-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified parasites were counted in a hemocytometer chamber and used for a new cycle of host cell invasion at the multiplicity of infection of 1. Parasite burden was quantified after 24 h by direct parasite counting or after 48 or 72 h by colorimetric detection of parasite β-galactosidase using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate, as described (14Sonda S.

In some experiments, parasite quantification in infected host cells was performed by flow cytometry analysis on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), after staining permeabilized cells with a rabbit polyclonal anti-T. gondii tachyzoite antiserum (15Fuchs N. Sonda S. Gottstein B. Hemphill A. J. Parasitol. 1998; 84: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at 1:2000 dilution, followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 1:300 dilution. Parasite invasion was determined by dual color immunostaining with the described anti-T. gondii antiserum to differentiate intracellular and extracellular parasites, as described (16Hemphill A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cholesterol transport to intracellular T. gondii, infected host cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 5 h. After extensive washing with PBS and 0.05% fat-free bovine serum albumin in PBS, parasites were isolated as previously described and counted, and the associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Background radioactivity resulting from host cell debris was determined using similarly processed uninfected host cells and subtracted from parasite samples. For cholesterol uptake analysis, host cells were incubated with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 5 h and extensively washed, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Steady state cholesterol mass was assessed using the Amplex Red kit (Invitrogen) or by lipid extraction according to Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and high performance thin layer chromatography separation of aliquots corresponding to equal protein content on Silica Gel 60 plates in benzene/2-propanol/water (100:10:0.25). The bands were visualized with 10% CuSO4 in 8% aqueous phosphoric acid and quantified by densitometry. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of lipids from T. gondii grown in WT or DKO host cells was performed as described (18Munoz-Olaya J.M. Matabosch X. Bedia C. Egido-Gabás M. Casas J. Llebaria A. Delgado A. Fabriàs G. Chem. Med. Chem. 2008; 3: 946-953Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in a Waters Aquity UPLC system connected to a Waters LCT Premier orthogonal accelerated time of flight mass spectrometer (Waters, Millford, MA), operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. For analysis of sphingolipid synthesis in T. gondii, purified parasites were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid for 3 h, lipids were extracted as before and aliquots corresponding to equal protein content were separated by high performance thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/25% NH4OH (65:25:4.5). Radiolabeled bands were visualized by use of a tritium-sensitive screen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a Personal Molecular PhosphoImager FX (Bio-Rad), identified according to co-migrating standards visualized by iodine vapors and quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For kinetic of cholesterol esterification, host cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 5, 24, and 48 h, and lipids were extracted as before and separated by high performance thin layer chromatography using benzene/2-propanol/water (100:10:0.25) as a solvent system. After iodine vapor visualization, bands co-migrating with cholesterol and cholesteryl ester standards were cut out of the plates, and the associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. The data for cholesterol esterification are reported as a percentage of [3H]cholesteryl esters from total cellular [3H]cholesterol. For cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) and efflux to reconstituted high density lipoproteins (HDL) or apoA-I, the cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h, extensively washed, and incubated with 2 mm CD, 20 μg/ml reconstituted HDL, or 10 μg/ml apoA-I in medium without fetal calf serum. Medium aliquots were measured by liquid scintillation at the time points indicated in the figures. Residual cell radioactivity was measured after cell solubilization in 0.1 n NaOH. Total radioactivity was calculated as medium + cell-associated radioactivity. Background efflux to medium alone was measured at the same time points and subtracted from the values obtained with the cholesterol acceptors CD, reconstituted HDL, and apoA-I. To visualize intracellular transport of fluorescent cholesterol, host cells were seeded on glass slides and infected with T. gondii for 24 h. The cells were incubated with 5 μm NBD-cholesterol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum for 1 h at 37 °C, fixed in 3% formaldehyde, mounted in Vectashield antifade agent (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and imaged employing an excitation filter of 450–500 nm. For visualization of unesterified cholesterol, the cells were seeded as before, fixed, and incubated with 0.05 mg/ml filipin in PBS, 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h at room temperature. The images were collected using an excitation filter of 350–410 nm. For visualization of esterified cholesterol in intracellular lipid droplets, the cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde, blocked, and stained with Nile red at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in PBS for 20 min. The cells were extensively washed in PBS and mounted, and lipid fluorescence was analyzed employing an excitation filter of 450–500 nm. For P-gp localization, DKO/Pgp host cells grown on glass slides were infected with T. gondii for 24 h, prior to fixation in acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. Anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody C219 was used at 1:10 dilution according to the manufacturer's instruction, followed by fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody at 1: 200 dilution. T. gondii was stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-T. gondii tachyzoite antiserum (15Fuchs N. Sonda S. Gottstein B. Hemphill A. J. Parasitol. 1998; 84: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at 1:2000 dilution, followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 1:300 dilution. The nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For endo-lysosome localization, host cells grown on glass slides were infected with T. gondii or N. caninum for 24 h, incubated with 6 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit for 60 min at 37 °C, and analyzed after fixation. For lysosome and Golgi localization, cells were seeded as before, fixed, and stained with anti-Lamp1 (1:50) or anti-giantin (1:750) antibodies followed by fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. Microscopy analyses were performed on a Leica DM IRBE fluorescence microscope or on a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), using the appropriate settings. Image stacks of optical sections were further processed using the Huygens deconvolution software package version 2.7 (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, NL). Host cells grown on sapphire disks were infected with T. gondii and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, prior to fixation with 0.25% glutaraldehyde and freezing in a high pressure freezing machine (HPM 010, BAL-TEC) as described by Monaghan et al. (19Monaghan P. Cook H. Hawes P. Simpson J. Tomley F. J. Microsc. 2003; 212: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Frozen cells were transferred into a freeze substitution unit (FS 7500, Boeckeler Instruments, Tucson, AZ) precooled to −88 °C for substitution with acetone and subsequent fixation with 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% osmium tetraoxide at temperatures between −30 °C and +2 °C as described in detail (20Wild P. Schraner E.M. Adler H. Humbel B.M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 53: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and embedded in Epon. 50–60-nm-thick sections were stained with uranyl-acetate and lead-citrate and analyzed in a transmission electron microscope (CM12; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a CCD camera (Ultrascan 1000; Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Host cells were loaded with cyclodextrin-cholesterol complexes (Sigma) for 24 h at the concentrations indicated in the figure legend, washed in medium, and incubated at 37 °C for additional 24 h. Cell viability was tested by using the AlamarBlue® assay (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. P-gp activity was assessed by cellular retention of the P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 (Rho). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Rho in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS, and incubated in medium at 37 °C for the time points indicated in the figure legend. The kinetic of rhodamine retention was quantified by flow cytometry. Cell lysates for immunoblots were prepared by sonicating cells at 107/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Samples corresponding to 40 μg proteins were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubated 10 min at room temperature to prevent P-gp aggregation. The samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed using anti-P-gp C219 (1:50) and anti-tubulin (1:2000) monoclonal antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL. Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Bovine serum albumin was used for the standard curve. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was performed (GraphPad Prism 4.0c; GraphPad Software, Inc.), and a probability value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. When the overall probability value was < 0.05, the Dunnett multiple-comparisons test was used as a post-test to determine whether there was a significant difference between values of control (reference sample) and samples of interest. To determine whether the activity of host P-gp plays a role in parasite replication, host cells expressing different levels of the protein (supplemental Fig. S1) were infected with T. gondii expressing β-galactosidase, which allows parasite quantification by colorimetric reaction (21McFadden D.C. Seeber F. Boothroyd J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct parasite count at 24 h post-infection (p.i.) revealed the presence of smaller vacuoles containing fewer parasites in P-gp-deficient host cells (Fig. 1A). Importantly, complementation of P-gp-deficient cells with the human P-gp homologue fully restored parasite replication. Analysis of parasite burden by visualization of parasite vacuoles at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1B) and colorimetric reaction at 48 and 72 h p.i. (Fig. 1C) confirmed that T. gondii replication was strongly inhibited in the absence of host P-gp. In addition, P-gp-complemented host cells generated a higher T. gondii burden than that found in WT cells. To further confirm that P-gp activity confers a replication advantage for the parasite, we used WT 3T3 fibroblasts transfected to overexpress P-gp as host cells (12Currier S.J. Kane S.E. Willingham M.C. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25153-25159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parasite quantification was performed either at the level of single host cells using flow cytometry or as parasite burden of the whole host cell monolayer by colorimetric reaction (supplemental Fig. S2). Both analyses indicated a positive correlation between P-gp expression levels and parasite replication. Absence of the multidrug transporter MRP1, in addition to the two P-gp isoforms (triple KO cells) (11Wijnholds J. deLange E.C. Scheffer G.L. van den Berg D.J. Mol C.A. van der Valk M. Schinkel A.H. Scheper R.J. Breimer D.D. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), did not further decrease parasite replication (data not shown). Collectively, these data unambiguously show that the presence of an active P-gp in the host is directly involved in a process controlling T. gondii replication. The reduction in parasite number seen in P-gp-deficient cells could have resulted from either decreased parasite replication or decreased invasion efficiency. To assess whether the absence of P-gp on the host plasma membrane compromises the ability of T. gondii to enter host cells, an invasion assay was performed using parasites harvested from WT host cells and allowed to infect cells expressing different levels of P-gp. The number of intracellular parasites was comparable in all tested cell lines at 2 h post-infection (Fig. 1D), indicating that host P-gp is not required for parasite invasion and that the reduced parasite burden observed in DKO cells is not due to a defect in host cell entry. The reduced parasite replication observed in P-gp-deficient host cells led us to hypothesize that the absence of P-gp may disturb the supply of lipid components necessary for assembly of new parasite membranes. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated cholesterol trafficking and metabolism in the parasite, because T. gondii is auxotrophic for cholesterol and depends solely on the host for its supply (22Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When we tested the transport of exogenous radiolabeled cholesterol to the parasite, we found that in the absence of host P-gp, cholesterol delivery was strongly reduced (Fig. 2A). Importantly, P-gp DKO cells showed normal uptake of exogenous cholesterol (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that the reduced cholesterol transport to the parasite is not caused by a compromised uptake of this lipid by the host cells. In addition, the increased T. gondii replication in P-gp-complemented host cells coincided with enhanced cholesterol delivery to the parasites, suggesting that the level of cholesterol transport was regulating parasite replication rate. In addition, we monitored the cholesterol transport in vivo by using the fluorescently labeled analogue NBD-cholesterol (Fig. 2B). Similar to the observations during the radiolabeled cholesterol incubation, transport of NBD-cholesterol to parasites grown in DKO cells was reduced compared with WT cells and a pattern of punctuated structures, reminiscent of endocytic vesicles, accumulated around the parasite vacuoles. Conversely, parasites infecting P-gp-complemented cells showed high level of fluorescence, indicating a robust trafficking of cholesterol to the vacuole. To test whether decreased cholesterol availability in the absence of host P-gp was directly responsible for the reduced T. gondii replication, we evaluated the parasite burden in DKO cells loaded with exogenous cholesterol following infection. This treatment improved parasite replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), confirming that insufficient cholesterol availability was indeed the limiting factor for parasite replication. To investigate the mechanism of P-gp involvement in the cholesterol trafficking to T. gondii, we inhibited the vesicular transport of host cholesterol from lysosomes to both plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum with the class 2 amphiphile U-18666A (23Underwood K.W. Andemariam B. McWilliams G.L. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with U-18666A has been shown to decrease the cholesterol delivery to intracellular parasites (22Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This broad inhibition of cholesterol trafficking severely affected T. gondii replication in WT host cells, with higher levels of inhibition than the ones observed in P-gp defective cells (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, parasite replication in DKO cells was further inhibited by only 10% upon U-18666A treatment. The absence of a significant cumulative effect between the lack of P-gp and inhibitor treatment indicates that P-gp may operate, directly or indirectly, on a similar pathway of cholesterol trafficking that is essential for parasite replication. Our previous results suggest that P-gp may be involved in the cholesterol trafficking to the parasite via the endocytic pathway. To investigate this possibility, we localized host P-gp in infected cells. P-gp is mainly present in the plasma membrane of the cells, but a minority also localizes in intracellular compartments, including endo-lysosomes (24Kim H. Barroso M. Samanta R. Greenberger L. Sztul E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1997; 273: C687-C702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fu D. Roufogalis B.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C1543-C1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because endo-lysosomes have been shown to be recruited to the PV in T. gondii infected cells (8Coppens I. Dunn J.D. Romano J.D. Pypaert M. Zhang H. Boothroyd J.C. Joiner K.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we reasoned that P-gp also associates with the parasite vacuole. To test this hypothesis, we infected P-gp-complemented host cells, whose level of P-gp expression allows analysis by immunofluorescence using the P-gp specific monoclonal antibody C219 (supplemental Fig. S1). This analysis showed that P-gp was predominantly present on the host plasma membrane as expected. In addition, P-gp was also found closely associated with the PV (Fig. 3, A and B). T. gondii scavenges cholesterol from host endo-lysosomal compartments (22Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and these organelles are actively recruited by the parasite to the PV in a time-dependent manner after infection (8Coppens I. Dunn J.D. Romano J.D. Pypaert M. Zhang H. Boothroyd J.C. Joiner K.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To test whether the decreased cholesterol delivery to the parasite in P-gp-deficient cells was due to a failure in recruiting the cholesterol rich endo-lysosomes, we probed the localization of these organelles in infected cells (Fig. 3C). First we analyzed the labeling of endocytic vesicles using cholera toxin B-subunit, which binds to the raft-associated sphingolipid GM1 and enters the cell by retrograde transport in the secretory pathway (26Lencer W.I. Saslowsky D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cholera toxin-positive structures were equally found around the PV of parasites infecting WT, DKO, and P-gp-complemented host cells. Moreover, Lamp1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1) staining further confirmed that lysosomes are recruited to the PV in DKO cells. Finally, host Golgi, which was previously shown to redistribute at the PV (8Coppens I. Dunn J.D. Romano J.D. Pypaert M. Zhang H. Boothroyd J.C. Joiner K.A. Cell. 2006; 125: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), was also found close to the PV surface in all tested cell lines. Collectively, our results show that the absence of host P-gp does not inhibit the parasite-mediated"
https://openalex.org/W2131950709,"Kit-ligand (Kitl), also known as stem cell factor, is a membrane-anchored, noncovalently bound dimer signaling via the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase, required for migration, survival, and proliferation of hematopoietic stem and germ cells, melanocytes, and mastocytes. Despite its fundamental role in morphogenesis and stem cell biology, the mechanisms that regulate Kitl dimerization are not well understood. By employing cell-permeable cross-linker and quantitative bimolecular fluorescence complementation of wildtype and truncated forms of Kitl, we determined that Kitl dimerization is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum and mediated to similar levels by the transmembrane and the extracellular growth factor domain. Further biochemical and mutational analysis revealed a conserved Ser-Gly-Gly-Tyr-containing motif that is required for transmembrane domain dimerization and efficient cell-surface expression of Kitl. A novel intracellular capture assay with the Kitl transmembrane domain as bait revealed specific interactions with Kitl, but not with unrelated transmembrane proteins. During evolution, the transmembrane dimerization motif appeared in Kitl at the transition from teleosts to tetrapods, which correlates with the emergence of Kitl as a supporter of stem cell populations. Thus, transmembrane-mediated association of membrane-anchored growth factors consists of a novel mechanism to improve paracrine signaling and morphogenesis.—Paulhe, F., Wehrle-Haller, M., Jacquier, M.-C., Imhof, B.

In this study, we examined the regulation of TAFI in hepatocytes during liver regeneration, and revealed its pivotal role in hepatocyte proliferation. In rat models, partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury suppressed the levels of plasma TAFI activity and hepatic TAFI mRNA, whereas this operation markedly increased both the hepatic plasmin activity and the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, the TAFI mRNA level was decreased under growth-promoting culture conditions. Treatment of the hepatocytes with TAFI siRNA increased the amount of plasmin on the hepatocytes and promoted hepatocyte proliferation. We concluded that TAFI regulates plasmin activity through its enzymatic activity whereby it reduces the plasminogen-binding capacity of the hepatocytes. The TAFI gene expression is down-regulated in hepatocyte proliferation for producing a fibrinolytic microenvironment suitable for cell growth. This is the first report on the role of TAFI in the pericellular fibrinolysis necessary for cellular proliferation."

Here, we show that Xdpcp (Xenopus dok-PTB containing protein) has a pivotal role in regulating mesendoderm formation in Xenopus, and negatively regulates the activin/nodal signaling pathway. We isolated cDNA for xdpcp and examined its potential role in Xenopus embryogenesis. We found that Xdpcp is strongly expressed in the animal hemisphere at the cleavage and blastula stages. The overexpression of xdpcp RNA affects activin/nodal signaling, which causes defects in mesendoderm formation. In addition, loss of Xdpcp function by injection of morpholino oligonucleotides leads to the expansion of the mesodermal territory. Moreover, we found that axis duplication by ventrally forced expression of activin is recovered by coexpression with Xdpcp. In addition, Xdpcp inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2. Furthermore, we also found that Xdpcp interacts with Alk4, a type I activin receptor, and inhibits activin/nodal signaling by disturbing the interaction between Smad2 and Alk4.

TGF-β signaling is implicated in a number of cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Disturbance of TGF-β signaling is related to serious human diseases including cancer, fibrosis, and heritable disorders (9Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is initiated by the binding of ligands to two types of Ser/Thr kinase receptors, called type I and type II receptors. The type I receptor is activated by the type II receptor and propagates intracellular signaling to the nucleus through the phosphorylation of receptor-activated Smads (R-Smad) including Smad1, -2, -3, -5, and -8. Then, the active Smad complex that is formed by the interaction of R-Smad with Smad4 translocates into the nucleus where it regulates the transcription of target genes. TGF-β signaling is also crucial for developmental processes including germ-layer specification and patterning during embryogenesis. Xenopus late blastula embryo consists of three regions with different cell fates including the animal cap, the marginal zone, and the vegetal mass (10Heasman J. Development. 2006; 133: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As development proceeds, animal cap cells become ectodermal derivatives such as the skin and nervous system, and marginal zone cells develop into mesodermal derivatives such as bone, blood, kidney, and muscle. Vegetal cells grow into endodermal derivatives such as lung, pancreas, and digestive organs. In Xenopus early embryo, the mesodermal cell fate is established in the marginal zone between the animal and vegetal poles by inductive signals from the underlying endoderm. Several TGF-β family ligands, such as activin, Vg1, and nodal-related proteins are responsible for the induction of mesoderm and endoderm, as well as the subsequent embryonic patterning. In this study, we identified a novel PTB protein, Xdpcp (Xenopus dok-PTB containing protein), as a negative regulator of activin/nodal signaling, a branch of TGF-β superfamily signaling. Activin/nodal signaling is essential for mesoderm induction and patterning in Xenopus embryos (11Shen M.M. Development. 2007; 134: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We show that Xdpcp negatively regulates the activin/nodal signaling by inhibiting the interaction between the activin receptor and Smad2, and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mesendoderm formation during Xenopus embryogenesis. Eggs were obtained from Xenopus laevis primed with 600 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (DAE SUNG Microbiological Labs Co.), in vitro fertilized as described previously (12Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Embryos were cultured in 0.33× modified Ringer until stage 8 and then transferred to 0.1× modified Ringer until they reached the appropriate stage for the experimentation outlined below. Developmental stages of the embryos were determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (13Nieuwkoop P. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994: 163-188Google Scholar). Microinjection using a Nanoliter Injector (WPI) was performed in 0.33× modified Ringer containing 4% Ficoll-PM400 (GE Healthcare). For expression in Xenopus embryos, the entire coding region of Xdpcp was cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pCS2+ vector and GFP-pCS2+ vector, and into the ClaI site of the Myc-pCS2+ vector. Deletion mutants of Xdpcp were cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the GFP-pCS2+ vector. Capped mRNAs were synthesized from linearized plasmids using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Xdpcp, Xdpcp-Myc, and other deletion mutants of Xdpcp were linearized with NotI, and mRNA was synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) were obtained from Gene Tools. The morpholino oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: xdpcp MO, 5′-TTCCAGAGTGAAAGCCATCATGTTG-3′; control MO, 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. HA-hALK4, HA-hALK4(TD), HA-hALK4(KR), and Myc-Smad2 in the pCS2+ vector were linearized with NotI. Xnr-1 in the pCS2+ vector was linearized with Asp718 and activin-βb in the pSP64T vector was linearized with EcoRI. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled probes as described by Harland (14Harland R.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense in situ probes against xdpcp were generated by linearizing the pBSKII-xdpcp construct with XcmI and transcribing with the T7 RNA polymerase. RT-PCR analysis was performed as described (15Cheong S.M. Choi S.C. Han J.K. BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 63Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Primers and amplification cycles for RT-PCR analysis were as follows: xdpcp forward, 5′-CCCAAACCCCAAGGAATGGT-3′; xdpcp reverse, 5′-AGGATGGCAGGTACCTTGTG-3′ (25 cycles); primers for ODC, sox17, xbra, mix2, and chordin were as described (15Cheong S.M. Choi S.C. Han J.K. BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 63Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For luciferase assay in Xenopus embryo, the embryos were injected with the indicated reagents into the animal regions of the 4-cell stage, and animal cap explants isolated at stage 9 were separated into three pools of six explants each for assay in triplicate. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293FT cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using Lipofectamine-Plus Reagent (Invitrogen), sonicated in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphatate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.75 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. The indicated antibodies were added to the supernatants and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h. Protein-A-Sepharose conjugates (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The immune complexes bound to Protein-A beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Monoclonal antibodies against GFP, Myc, and HA, and polyclonal antibodies against Actin, Myc, and HA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-phospho Smad2 and -1 were from Cell Signaling. Because PTB domain proteins play pivotal roles in many biological processes, we have attempted to identify the in vivo function of novel PTB domain proteins. Toward this goal, we cloned cDNA encoding a novel PTB domain protein using a PCR-based method and sequence information in the Xenopus EST data base (GenBankTM accession number BC073514) and named it xdpcp (Xenopus dok-PTB containing protein). xdpcp cDNA consists of 1782 nucleotides encoding a protein of 593 amino acids. PTB domains are divided into three groups, including Shc-like, IRS-like, and Dab-like (16Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As implied by the name, Xdpcp has a dok-PTB domain, one of the IRS-like PTB domains. To investigate the function of Xdpcp in the Xenopus embryo, we first examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of xdpcp, and found that it is strongly expressed in the animal hemisphere at the cleavage and blastula stages and around the anterior border of the neural plate and paraxial mesoderm at the neurula stages (Fig. 1). Later in development, the gross expression of xdpcp decreases, and it is only observed in the head region at the tailbud and tadpole stages. Consistent with the spatial expression patterns, the temporal expression patterns analyzed by RT-PCR indicated that its expression is strongest at the cleavage and blastula stages and then it gradually decreases after the gastrula stages (Fig. 1G). Based on its strong localization to the animal hemisphere at the late blastula stage, we focused on the function of Xdpcp in early development. Thus, we addressed the effects of the gain-of-Xdpcp function on the early patterning of Xenopus embryos. Our analysis of embryos overexpressed xdpcp RNA in two dorsal blastomeres at the 4-cell stage revealed abnormal patterning such as bending and shortening of the anterior-posterior axis (Fig. 2A). We reasoned that this phenotype may be due to an abnormality in mesoderm formation. Therefore, we examined whether overexpression of xdpcp inhibits the expression of endogenous mesodermal markers such as xbra, chordin, and goosecoid. As shown in Fig. 2B, the expression of these mesodermal markers is remarkably reduced in embryos with xdpcp overexpression. These data suggest an inhibitory role of Xdpcp in mesoderm formation during Xenopus early development. As mentioned previously, PTB domain proteins are also related to the activin/nodal signaling pathway, which is involved in mesendoderm formation during Xenopus early development. Therefore, we initially hypothesized that Xdpcp regulates mesendoderm formation by inhibiting activin/nodal signaling. To address whether overexpression of xdpcp affects mesendoderm formation and activin/nodal signaling, we performed RT-PCR analysis. Functional analysis in Xenopus animal caps showed that the injection of activin RNA could induce mesodermal markers such as xbra, chordin, and mix2 as well as endodermal markers such as sox17, endodermin, and vegT, and the induction of these markers was inhibited by coexpression of xdpcp RNA (Fig. 2C). However, Xdpcp did not affect the expression of BMP-induced genes such as msx-1 and xvent-1, suggesting that Xdpcp has a specific function in activin/nodal signaling (Fig. 2D). To examine the effects of Xdpcp on activin/nodal signaling-dependent promoter activity, we carried out various luciferase assays using an ARE-Luc reporter containing three copies of an ARE (activin-response element of the Xenopus mix2 promoter) (17Huang H.C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D. Whitman M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or a 6DE-Luc reporter containing six copies of a DE (activin/nodal-inducible distal element of the Xenopus gsc promoter) (18Watabe T. Kim S. Candia A. Rothbächer U. Hashimoto C. Inoue K. Cho K.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3038-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similar to our findings with RT-PCR analysis, we observed that Xdpcp diminished transcriptional activity associated with activin/nodal signaling (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that Xdpcp inhibits the formation of mesendoderm by activin/nodal signaling. To investigate whether Xdpcp is indispensable for regulating mesendoderm formation, we carried out loss-of-function analysis using antisense MO capable of depleting the Xdpcp protein (19Heasman J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We designed a morpholino to target the start codon region of the xdpcp gene to disrupt translation of the xdpcp mRNA. To confirm the efficacy and targeting specificity of the xdpcp MO, we coinjected the MO with Myc-tagged xdpcp RNAs with and without the MO targeting sites (untranslated region and open reading frame, respectively), and performed Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, xdpcp MO can specifically block production of the Xdpcp protein. To examine the effects of Xdpcp depletion on embryonic patterning and mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos, we injected xdpcp MO into the dorsal-animal regions of 4-cell stage embryos and then observed its effects on the patterning of embryos and the expression of endogenous mesodermal markers such as xbra and goosecoid. Intriguingly, xdpcp knockdown embryos revealed a slightly dorso-anteriorized phenotype, which is translated into the dorso-anterior index 6 (20Muñoz-Sanjuán I. H.-Brivanlou A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). This demonstrates that activin/nodal signaling might be increased in response to Xdpcp depletion, because activin/nodal activity induces dorso-anterior fates. Xdpcp-depleted embryos also show an expansion in the expression of mesodermal markers toward the ectodermal territory (Fig. 3C). To obtain more evidence that Xdpcp inhibits mesendoderm formation of Xenopus embryos, we performed RT-PCR analysis using mesodermal markers such as xbra, chordin, and mix2 and endodermal markers such as sox17 and endodermin. As shown in Fig. 3D, endogenous expression of these markers was decreased by xdpcp overexpression, whereas xdpcp knockdown leads to the increase of these expression. These data suggest that the presence of Xdpcp in the ectodermal region prevents the mesodermal territory from expanding. Because Xdpcp may inhibit activin/nodal signaling, we asked whether activin-induced phenotypes can be rescued by forced expression of xdpcp. To answer this question, we tested whether secondary axis formation by ectopic expression of activin into the ventral blastomeres of Xenopus 4-cell stage embryos could be rescued by coexpression of xdpcp RNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, a partial secondary axis is formed by ectopic expression of activin, and this phenotype is rescued by xdpcp RNA, but not by the control preprolactin RNA. These results confirm that Xdpcp inhibits activin/nodal signaling. Because our combined data from RT-PCR, luciferase assay, and ectopic axis formation reveal that Xdpcp diminishes the responses to activin/nodal signaling, we asked whether Xdpcp inhibits phosphorylation of Smad2. To test this, we injected activin-βB, xdpcp RNA, and xdpcp MO into the animal region of 4-cell stage embryos. We then isolated animal caps at the blastula stages, cultured them to stage 10, and then performed a Western blot analysis with phospho-Smad2 antibody (Fig. 4C). Injection of activin-βB induced phosphorylation of Smad2, and this phosphorylation was reduced by coexpression of xdpcp. Interestingly, Xdpcp depletion by MO induced more phosphorylation of Smad2, which demonstrates that the endogenous function of Xdpcp is to negatively regulate activin/nodal signaling. However, Xdpcp did not affect Smad1 phosphorylation induced by Bmp signaling (Fig. 4D). Because Xdpcp inhibits the phosphorylation of Smad2, we examined whether it also affects the next step in the pathway, the nuclear translocation of Smad2. The results of immunostaining analysis show that activin-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad2 is inhibited by coexpression of xdpcp (Fig. 4E). Because Xdpcp inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2, we tested whether Xdpcp is incapable of inhibiting the activin/nodal signaling induced by constitutively active Smad2 (CA-Smad2) (21Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the results of RT-PCR analysis revealed that CA-Smad2 could induce the expression of mesendodermal markers, and this induction was unaffected by xdpcp overexpression. Next, we examined whether the morphological defects induced by xdpcp overexpression could be rescued by coexpression of CA-Smad2. xdpcp overexpression caused abnormal embryonic patterning such as the shortening and bending of the anterior-posterior body axis, and these phenotypes were partially rescued by coexpression of CA-Smad2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Together, these results indicate that Xdpcp acts upstream of Smad2 in the activin/nodal signaling pathway. Based on our finding that Xdpcp functions upstream of Smad2 in the pathway, we asked whether Xdpcp can interact with Alk4, a type I receptor, or Smad2. To answer this, we injected RNAs including Myc-tagged Xdpcp and HA-tagged Alk4 into the animal regions of 2-cell stage embryos, cultured the embryos until stage 10 and performed an immunoprecipitation assay. In this experiment, we found that Xdpcp interacts with Alk4 in a signal-independent manner (Fig. 6A). However, we did not observe an interaction between Xdpcp and Smad2 (data not shown). In addition, we found that Xdpcp specifically interacts with the activin receptor, but not the Bmp receptor, indicating a specific function of Xdpcp in the activin/nodal branch of TGF-β superfamily signaling (Fig. 6B). To address the inhibitory mechanism of Xdpcp in activin/nodal signaling, we examined whether the interaction between activin receptor and Smad2 under activin signaling is affected by coexpression of xdpcp. Thus, we injected RNAs as indicated in Fig. 6C into the animal regions of 2-cell stage embryos, cultured the injected embryos until stage 10, and then performed an immunoprecipitation assay. Intriguingly, Smad2 interacts with Alk4 under activin signaling and this interaction is inhibited by coexpression of xdpcp (Fig. 6C). Because Xdpcp inhibits the association of Smad2 with Alk4, we asked whether the same interface of Alk4 is involved in binding to Xdpcp and Smad2. To test this, we cloned a mutant form of Alk4, which is deleted in the L45 region known as the Smad-binding site, then examined the capability of the mutant Alk4 to associate with Xdpcp and Smad2. As shown in Fig. 6D, wild type Alk4 interacts with Xdpcp and Smad2, whereas the L45-deletion mutant of Alk4 did not bind to both Xdpcp and Smad2. This indicates that Xdpcp and Smad2 competitively interact with the same region of Alk4. To better understand the mechanisms for Xdpcp action, we examined subcellular localization of Xdpcp in both cultured cells and Xenopus embryonic cells. Consistently, the results of immunostaining analysis reveal that Xdpcp is localized in the cytoplasm, but not nucleus of HeLa cells (Fig. 7A), and it is colocalized with Alk4 in the cytoplasmic vesicles and plasma membrane of both HeLa cells and Xenopus animal cap cells (Fig. 7B). These subcellular localization data support the action mechanism of Xdpcp that interacts with Alk4 and inhibits the association of Alk4 with Smad2 in the cytoplasmic vesicles and plasma membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that Xdpcp may inhibit activin/nodal signaling by masking the receptor, thereby inhibiting the interaction between activin receptor and Smad2. To test our hypothesis that Xdpcp inhibits the activin/nodal signaling by masking the activin receptor, we examined whether interaction between Xdpcp and the receptor is essential for the inhibitory roles of Xdpcp in activin/nodal signaling. To test this, we designed several deletion mutants of Xdpcp (Fig. 8A), transfected them into HEK293FT cells, and then carried out an immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 8B, the PTB-deletion mutant (Xdpcp-ΔN2) cannot bind to Alk4, whereas wild type (Xdpcp-fl) and PTB-including mutants (Xdpcp-ΔN1 and -ΔC) interact with the activin receptor. This indicates that the PTB domain is essential for interaction between Alk4 and Xdpcp. Next, to test whether the PTB-deletion mutant lacks the inhibitory function in activin/nodal signaling, we analyzed the effects of PTB deletion on the transcriptional activity of luciferase reporters driven by the goosecoid promoter responding to the activin/nodal signals. As shown in Fig. 8C, the transcriptional response stimulated by Xnr-1 (Xenopus nodal-related-1) is down-regulated by coexpression of xdpcp. However, coexpression of the PTB-deletion mutant (Xdpcp-ΔN2), which is incapable of interacting with Alk4, did not affect that response and coexpression of the PTB-containing mutants (Xdpcp-ΔN1 and -ΔC), which are capable of interacting with the receptor, resulted in down-regulation of Xnr-1. These data suggest that interaction of Xdpcp with Alk4 via its PTB domain is essential for negative regulation of activin/nodal signaling. Taken together, the results suggest a model in which Xdpcp inhibits activin/nodal signaling by masking the receptor, thereby protecting the ectodermal fate from activin/nodal signals capable of inducing mesoderm during early embryogenesis (Fig. 9).FIGURE 9A model for the function of Xdpcp to regulate activin/nodal signaling during embryogenesis. A, in the presence of Xdpcp, it inhibits activin/nodal signaling by masking the receptor to inhibit the contact of Smad2 to the receptor, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 protein. B, in the Xenopus embryo, Xdpcp in the animal region inhibits the mesoderm inducing signals such as activin/nodal signaling from the vegetal region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have provided evidence that a novel PTB protein, Xdpcp, negatively regulates the activin/nodal signaling pathway in germ-layer specification during Xenopus development. First, xdpcp is expressed in the prospective ectodermal region in the Xenopus early embryo. Second, gain-of- and loss-of-Xdpcp function lead to abnormal mesoderm formation and embryonic patterning in the Xenopus embryo. Third, using RT-PCR, luciferase assay, and axis duplication assay, we found that Xdpcp inhibits responses to the activin/nodal signaling. In addition, Xdpcp inhibits phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2. Finally, Xdpcp binds to Alk4, a type I receptor and interferes with the interaction between Alk4 and Smad2. Together, these results indicate that the Xdpcp-Alk4 interaction mediates inhibition of Smad2 binding and phosphorylation, thus regulating activin/nodal signaling. This Xdpcp-mediated regulation of the activin/nodal signaling pathway is pivotal for correct germ-layer specification in Xenopus embryogenesis. Regulation of germ-layer specification is one of the most critical and classical problems in vertebrate development. As mentioned previously, mesoderm is formed by mesoderm-inducing signals such as activin/nodal signaling from the underlying endoderm in the Xenopus embryo. In addition, mesoderm-restriction factors from the overlying ectoderm are also required for determining the proper territory of the mesoderm.

Briefly, Coco is a secreted antagonist of BMP, TGF-β, and Wnt ligands, and Sox3 inhibits nodal expression and induces other regulators such as Ectodermin, Xema, and Coco. In addition, Ectodermin controls the level of Smad4 as an ubiquitin ligase, and serum response factor inhibits the formation of the Smad2-Fast-1 complex. Finally, XFDL156 inhibits the function of p53 cooperating with Smad2. These findings provide evidence that the tight regulation of activin/nodal signaling at multiple points is involved in correct germ-layer formation. Consistent with this concept, we have shown that Xdpcp is involved in the proper formation of embryonic germ-layers by inhibiting activin/nodal signaling through disruption of the association between Alk4 and Smad2. TGF-β family growth factors including activin and nodal-related proteins are pivotal for controlling diverse cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation and disturbances of these signals can cause many serious human diseases and disorders. Therefore, it is very important to clarify the fine molecular mechanisms regulating these signals. Many molecules have been identified as negative regulators to achieve tight regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway (28Itoh S. ten Dijke P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Especially when it comes to the regulation at the level of type I receptor, which has three regulatory points including dephosphorylation, degradation of type I receptor, and interference of R-Smad binding and phosphorylation. The inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and -7), known as core players in the negative regulation of TGF-β signaling, are involved in regulation of receptors, including the competitive inhibition of R-Smad binding (29Hayashi H.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6914-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) are involved in degradation of the type I receptor. Moreover, Akt has been suggested to bind to Smad3, thereby sequestering it from the type I receptor in an Akt kinase-independent manner (38Remy I. Montmarquette A. Michnick S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 39Conery A.R. Cao Y. Thompson E.A. Townsend Jr., C.M. Ko T.C. Luo K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, there is still controversy over whether Akt inhibits Smad3 phosphorylation via mTOR in an Akt kinase-dependent manner (40Song K. Wang H. Krebs T.L. Danielpour D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We suggest that Xdpcp inhibits activin/nodal signaling by interacting with Alk4, a type I receptor, and masking it from Smad2. Xdpcp is a novel regulator that competes with Smad2 for binding to Alk4. Like Xdpcp, Smad7 was originally reported as a negative regulator inhibiting the association between type I receptor and R-Smad. In addition, Smad7 is also involved in the dephosphorylation and degradation of the type I receptor by protein phosphatases and ubiquitin ligases. However, we did not observe an association between Xdpcp and Smad7 (data not shown), and the relationship of Xdpcp with other molecules implicated in the regulation of type I receptor and other mechanisms of Xdpcp function remains to be further elucidated. Here we report on a novel PTB protein, Xdpcp, that is implicated in activin/nodal signaling. Growth factor receptors generally employ adaptor proteins for stabilization and amplification of signaling (41Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). PTB domains, which include IRS-like, Shc-like, and Dab-like domains, are found in many adaptor proteins (16Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In particular, in the activin/nodal pathway of TGF-β signaling, two PTB adaptor proteins, Dab2 and Dok1, play similar roles promoting the signals between receptors and R-Smads (7Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 8Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Sugino H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1684-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Dok1 has an IRS-like PTB domain similar to Xdpcp, whereas Dab2 has a Dab-like PTB. Regardless of the similarity between PTB domains, our data show that Xdpcp possesses an opposite role to that of Dok1 in activin/nodal signaling. Unlike Dok1, Xdpcp lacks a PH domain and does not interact with Smad2 or -4 proteins that bind to the N-terminal PH and PTB domains of Dok1. This finding suggests that there are structural differences in the PTB region between Dok1 and Xdpcp. Moreover, our data using deletion mutants show that the association of Alk4 with the PTB domain of Xdpcp is essential for negative regulation of activin/nodal signaling (Fig. 8). In addition, Yamakawa and colleagues (8Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Sugino H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1684-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that a deletion mutant (Dok PP) of Dok1 composed of only PH and PTB domains down-regulates activin A- and TGF-β-induced promoter activity, indicating that another region of Dok1 is related to up-regulation of the signaling. We reason that these differences between Dok1 and Xdpcp lead to their opposite roles in activin signaling. In summary, our study reveals that Xdpcp plays a crucial role in correct germ-layer formation during vertebrate embryogenesis by disrupting the interaction between Alk4 and Smad2, resulting in the negative regulation of activin/nodal signaling. The detailed mechanisms by which Xdpcp regulates activin/nodal signaling in embryo development remain to be further elucidated.
