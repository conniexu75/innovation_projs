https://openalex.org/W1986301799,"IN 1962, Tönz, Simon and Hasselfeld1 described a German family with forty-six cyanotic members. This cyanosis was found to be due to an abnormal haemoglobin. This abnormal haemoglobin was characterized as an Hb M type on the basis of electrophoresis on starch block at pH 7.0 and on the absorption spectrum of the haemolysate. The abnormal haemoglobin was called Hb MOldenburg."

https://openalex.org/W2094350582,"MUCH has been written over the past years on the effect of microwave radiation on body tissues and animals, but most of the experiments reported have been concerned with the production of heat and its associated behavioural and physiological effects1–4. There are very few references to ‘athermal’ effects such as muscular disturbances5 and disorientation—phenomena which have not attracted the scientific attention that they merit. In fact, there appears to have evolved a body of opinion dismissing the existence of any effect other than a thermal one on the pretext stated in one report4 that the photon energy in the frequency band of microwave radiation is insufficient by several orders of magnitude to produce ionization. Apparently no consideration has been given to the effect of induced electrical currents on the activity of the nervous system of an animal. Animal tissues absorb microwave radiation diffusely and since such tissues contain membrane interfaces which are semi-conducting, polarization can occur. If the microwave radiation is in pulsed form, the induced electrical currents will be modulated at the frequency of pulse repetition. It has been demonstrated experimentally that nerve conduction characteristics undergo a profound change when the nerve is subjected to a.c. excitation6. Therefore, it is to be expected that microwave radiation would have an effect on the nervous system of an animal depending on the depth of penetration."

https://openalex.org/W2078660310,"FREQUENTLY in scientific papers one finds the terms ‘insignificant’, ‘significant’ and ‘highly significant’ used in discussing the difference between control and experimental, with their ranges usually established by P = 0.05 and P = 0.01. Statistics text-books provide little or no guidance as to their proper usage because statisticians apparently disapprove of the convention. Yet the universality of the convention attests to the need for clearly defined, commonly accepted terms which properly weight the results of the experiment. The present convention is commonly accepted among non-statisticians, but, as will be shown here, is not clearly defined. Therefore an improved convention is proposed for the consideration of those who would benefit from it—the non-statisticians in research. Perhaps by improving the convention, it can be made more palatable to statisticians, as well as more useful to non-statisticians."

https://openalex.org/W2086713358,"IT has recently been suggested that a genetic basis for cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms might be reflected in the distribution pattern of inactivated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the chromosomes1. Inactivated DNA is characterized by three features, namely, heterochromatinization, late replication at the time of doubling, and inactivity of synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA). To substantiate this hypothesis, we are now studying the pattern of DNA and RNA synthesis of chromosomes in human cells of various origin by means of autoradiography. In studying the synthesis of RNA by human chromosomes, we encountered a dilemma. The chromosomes are identifiable only in metaphase as are most somatic cell chromosomes in multicellular organisms. During metaphase and anaphase, however, synthesis of RNA completely ceases in all the cells of multicellular organisms so far investigated2–7. It is not, therefore, feasible at present to study the pulse labelling pattern of RNA on metazoan chromosomes except polytenic ones. Previous investigators6,8 have studied RNA synthesis mainly in meiotic chromosomes as these chromosomes remain visible throughout the meiotic cycle. However, they are not chromosomes of differentiated somatic cells in which we are interested. Hsu reported synthesis of RNA in intermitotic nuclei of mammalian somatic cells9, in which the Barr body was shown to be inactive in the synthesis of RNA. In general, however, the chromosome is not identifiable as a distinct morphological unit in the intermitotic phase of metazoan cells. To overcome this dilemma, we decided to label the cell just before division and examine the distribution of the label at metaphase which immediately follows the labelling. The interval between the labelling and the examination was chosen so as to be sufficiently short to prevent secondary diffusion of the labelled RNA from the site of the synthesis. If the labelled RNA is not released immediately after its synthesis and does persist during mitosis, it would be expected that the label incorporated at late G2 and prophase would also remain detectable on the metaphase chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2011449416,"WE have shown1 that the clotting time of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is progressively shortened by incubation at 37° C with a suspension of kaolin, and that this reflects a progressive increase in availability of platelet factor 3 (PF3) as well as activation of the plasma clotting system. Since maximal acceleration of clotting by kaolin was only achieved when platelets and plasma were activated to-together, it seemed likely that a plasma component was required for the reaction of platelets with kaolin. In order to determine whether a plasma coagulation factor was concerned in this reaction, investigations were carried out on the PRP of patients with a series of congenital coagulation defects. Equal volumes (0.1 ml.) of PRP and kaolin (5 mg per ml. of buffered saline, pH 7.3) were incubated at 37° C for 20 min and then recalcified with 0.1 ml. of 0.025 M calcium chloride, 0.1 ml. of a partially purified preparation of the deficient factor (or of buffered saline) being added in each case immediately before or after incubation with the kaolin. In the cases of factor-XII and factor-XI deficiency, activation product (prepared by the method of Nossel2) was used in place of the respective purified factors. Factors V and VIII were prepared by ammonium sulphate precipitation from barium sulphate-adsorbed platelet-poor oxalated normal plasma and factors VII, IX and X by adsorption of normal serum on to barium sulphate and subsequent elution into 5 per cent trisodium citrate. The fibrinogen reagent used (kindly provided by the Blood Products Laboratory of the Lister Institute) was prepared from fresh plasma by the method of Kekwick and Mackay3 and was 66 per cent clottable; it also contained plasminogen and some factor VIII and anti-von Willebrand activity."

https://openalex.org/W1980838151,"INVESTIGATIONS of the comparative toxicities of organic pesticides to fish have to some extent been hampered by the insolubility of these compounds in water. The most widely used solvent in such tests is acetone, but this compound has important disadvantages. Although it is relatively non-toxic to fish (in this laboratory goldfish have tolerated 18 p.p.t. for at least one week) acetone in solution has a high oxygen demand which may lead to oxygen depletion in the test media1,2, and if the compound under evaluation, or the solvent vehicle, is volatile it is clearly undesirable to rely on artificial oxygenation."

So far no other variation has been shown in the blood of this or other marsupials. The present communication reports the investigation of red cell acid phosphatase in two species of Australian marsupials, M. rufus and M. giganteus, the former commonly known as the red kangaroo and the latter as the grey kangaroo."
https://openalex.org/W2051873216,"Beutler and Mathai1 have rather simplified my thesis2. A central theme, that the methaemoglobin–oxyhaemoglobin and oxidized-reduced glutathione (GSSG–GSH) systems are loosely linked in a buffering system against the selective and destructive effects of different types of oxidizing compound, has already been discussed3. On the basis of published4–10 and otherwise unpublished2 observations, it was also proposed that the pentose phosphate pathway governs the equilibrium between methaemoglobin formation and GSH depletion, and thus generally between the degrees of methaemoglobinaemia and haemolysis in eryfchrocytes exposed to catalytic oxidants. The suggestion was made that, by providing a source of reductant energy which varies in degree and direction with the oxidant stress, the pentose phosphate pathway might well have played an important part in the evolution of the anuclear mammalian erythrocyte. These concepts, relating to the adaptive role of the pentose phosphate pathway, seemed essentially in accord with previous and concurrent observations concerning the role and control of the pentose phosphate pathway in other mammalian tissues (see refs. 11–22, and refs. 70–74 cited by Jandl et al.23"

https://openalex.org/W2022723844,"RECENTLY Currie1 reported the strong adsorption of purine bases on precipitated protein. In spite of repeated washings with 8 per cent perchloric acid, only 30–40 per cent of the added quantity of xanthine, hypoxanthine and uric acid was recovered. The determination of the bases was carried out enzymatically with xanthine oxidase. As perchloric acid is at present being used as the standard method for deproteinization much of the work concerning the metabolism of purine derivatives would, as a result, be incorrect2–4."

https://openalex.org/W1998362993,"IT has been conclusively demonstrated that fragments of lymph nodes obtained from previously immunized rabbits can be secondarily stimulated in vitro with the specific antigen1,2. Richards et al.3 and Richardson4 have shown that the antibody released by fragments in vitro is actually synthesized de novo. In the main, glass wool pads have been used to support the fragments in the culture. Unfortunately, the use of glass wool pads impairs histological investigation of the fragments during antibody synthesis. The glass wool cannot be sectioned on a microtome so that any fragment studied must be removed from the pad, resulting in loss of the periphery of the fragment which clings tightly to the glass wool. The cells which migrate from the tissue into the interstices of the pad are also not available for histological study. An ideal supporting medium for combined histological and antibody studies should be capable of being sectioned so that the cells can be observed in their relationships to each other and to the supporting medium. In order to pursue this type of investigation, we decided to investigate the possible use of absorbable gelatin sponges, as a replacement for the glass wool."

https://openalex.org/W1989755098,"RECENT evidence indicates that thymectomy in newborn laboratory animals of some species may result in immunological deficiencies. These may become manifest as compromised capacity to form circulating antibodies1, as delayed homograft rejection2,3, as diminished capacity to develop tuberculin-type sensitivities1, and as lowered resistance to infection1. These deficiencies may be related to a reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes and a failure of germinal centre development, as observed in neonatally thymectomized mice2."
