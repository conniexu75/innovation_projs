https://openalex.org/W3164326780,"Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) induced the open conformation of RBD and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2 and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis revealed that all of the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the NTD. Structural analysis demonstrated that all infectivity-enhancing antibodies bound to NTD in a similar manner. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected at high levels in severe patients. Moreover, we identified antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site in uninfected donors, albeit at a lower frequency. These findings demonstrate that not only neutralizing antibodies but also enhancing antibodies are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3165705254,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide, causing a global pandemic. Bat-origin RaTG13 is currently the most phylogenetically related virus. Here we obtained the complex structure of the RaTG13 receptor binding domain (RBD) with human ACE2 (hACE2) and evaluated binding of RaTG13 RBD to 24 additional ACE2 orthologs. By substituting residues in the RaTG13 RBD with their counterparts in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we found that residue 501, the major position found in variants of concern (VOCs) 501Y.V1/V2/V3, plays a key role in determining the potential host range of RaTG13. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 could induce strong cross-reactive antibodies to RaTG13 and identified a SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), CB6, that could cross-neutralize RaTG13 pseudovirus. These results elucidate the receptor binding and host adaption mechanisms of RaTG13 and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance of coronaviruses (CoVs) carried by animal reservoirs to prevent another spillover of CoVs."

We identified common genetic variants influencing white matter microstructure using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of 43,802 individuals. Genome-wide association analysis identified 109 associated loci, 30 of which were detected by tract-specific functional principal components analysis. A number of loci colocalized with brain diseases, such as glioma and stroke. Genetic correlations were observed between white matter microstructure and 57 complex traits and diseases. Common variants associated with white matter microstructure altered the function of regulatory elements in glial cells, particularly oligodendrocytes. This large-scale tract-specific study advances the understanding of the genetic architecture of white matter and its genetic links to a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3169973500,"Neutrophils communicate with each other to form swarms in infected organs. Coordination of this population response is critical for the elimination of bacteria and fungi. Using transgenic mice, we found that neutrophils have evolved an intrinsic mechanism to self-limit swarming and avoid uncontrolled aggregation during inflammation. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization acts as a negative feedback control to stop migration of neutrophils when they sense high concentrations of self-secreted attractants that initially amplify swarming. Interference with this process allows neutrophils to scan larger tissue areas for microbes. Unexpectedly, this does not benefit bacterial clearance as containment of proliferating bacteria by neutrophil clusters becomes impeded. Our data reveal how autosignaling stops self-organized swarming behavior and how the finely tuned balance of neutrophil chemotaxis and arrest counteracts bacterial escape."
https://openalex.org/W3169688525,"In the pursuit of suitable and effective solutions to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated the efficacy of several phenolic compounds in controlling key cellular mechanisms involved in its infectivity. The way the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the cell is a complex process and comprises four main stages: attachment to the cognate receptor, cellular entry, replication and cellular egress. Since, this is a multi-part process, it creates many opportunities to develop effective interventions. Targeting binding of the virus to the host receptor in order to prevent its entry has been of particular interest. Here, we provide experimental evidence that, among 56 tested polyphenols, including plant extracts, brazilin, theaflavin-3,3’-digallate, and curcumin displayed the highest binding with the receptor-binding domain of spike protein, inhibiting viral attachment to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and thus cellular entry of pseudo-typed SARS-CoV-2 virions. Both, theaflavin-3,3’-digallate at 25 μg/ml and curcumin above 10 μg/ml concentration, showed binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor reducing at the same time its activity in both cell-free and cell-based assays. Our study also demonstrates that brazilin and theaflavin-3,3’-digallate, and to a still greater extent, curcumin, decrease the activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 both in cell-free and cell-based assays. Similar pattern was observed with cathepsin L, although only theaflavin-3,3’-digallate showed a modest diminution of cathepsin L expression at protein level. Finally, each of these three compounds moderately increased endosomal/lysosomal pH. In conclusion, this study demonstrates pleiotropic anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of specific polyphenols and their prospects for further scientific and clinical investigations."

Despite their importance, there has been no method to genetically, specifically, and effectively attenuate astrocyte Gq GPCR pathways to explore consequences of this prevalent signaling mechanism in vivo. We report a 122-residue inhibitory peptide from β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (iβARK; and inactive D110A control) to attenuate astrocyte Gq GPCR signaling. iβARK significantly attenuated Gq GPCR Ca2+ signaling in brain slices and, in vivo, altered behavioral responses, spared other GPCR responses, and did not alter astrocyte spontaneous Ca2+ signals, morphology, electrophysiological properties, or gene expression in the striatum. Furthermore, brain-wide attenuation of astrocyte Gq GPCR signaling with iβARK using PHP.eB adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), when combined with c-Fos mapping, suggested nuclei-specific contributions to behavioral adaptation and spatial memory. iβARK extends the toolkit needed to explore functions of astrocyte Gq GPCR signaling within neural circuits in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3167152581,"Background The increase in violence against health professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic makes it necessary to identify the predictors of violence, in order to prevent these events from happening. Objective Evaluating the prevalence and analyzing the variables involved in the occurrence of violence against health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Method This is a cross-sectional study conducted online involving Brazilian health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire (Google Online Form) sent to health professionals on social networks and analyzed through logistic regression by using sociodemographic variables. The set of grouped variables was assigned to the final model when p &lt;0.05. A network was built using the Mixed Graph Models (MGM) approach. A centrality measurement chart was constructed to determine which nodes have the greatest influence, strength and connectivity between the nodes around them. Results The predictors of violence in the adjusted regression model were the following: being a nursing technician / assistant; having been working for less than 20 years; working for over 37 hours a week; having suffered violence before the pandemic; having been contaminated with COVID-19; working in direct contact with patients infected by the virus; and having family members who have suffered violence. The network created with professionals who suffered violence demonstrated that the aggressions occurred mainly in the workplace, with an indication of psycho-verbal violence. In cases in which the aggressors were close people, aggressions were non-verbal and happened both in public and private places. The assaults practiced by strangers occurred in public places. Conclusions Violence against health professionals occurs implicitly and explicitly, with consequences that can affect both their psychosocial well-being and the assistance given to their patients and families."
https://openalex.org/W3168449333,"Purpose To evaluate if reduced muscle mass, assessed with Computed Tomography (CT), is a predictor of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Methods In this Institution Review Board approved study, we retrospectively evaluated COVID-19 patients treated in our tertiary center from March to November 2020 who underwent an unenhanced chest CT scan within three weeks from hospitalization.We recorded the mean Hounsfield Unit (Hu) value of the right paravertebral muscle at the level of the 12 th thoracic vertebra, the hospitalization unit (ICU and COVID-19 wards), clinical symptoms, Barthel Index, and laboratory findings.Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess if muscle loss (Hu&lt;30) is a predictor of ICU admission and outcome.Fisher’s exact and Student’s tests were applied to evaluate if differences between patients with and without muscle loss occurred (p&lt;0.05). Results One-hundred-fifty patients matched the inclusion criteria (46 females; mean age±SD 61.3±15 years-old), 36 treated in ICU. Patients in ICU showed significantly lower Hu values (29±24 vs 39.4±12, p = 0.001). Muscle loss was a predictor of ICU admission (p = 0.004).Patients with muscle loss were significantly older (73.4±10 vs 56.4±14 years), had lower Barthel Index scores (54.4±33 vs 85.1±26), red blood-cell count (3.9±1 vs 4.6±1 ×10 12 L −1 ), and Hb levels (11.5±2 vs 13.2±2 g/l ) as well as higher white blood-cell count (9.4±7 vs 7.2±4 ×10 9 L −1 ), C-reactive protein (71.5±71 vs 44±48 U/L ), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (335±163 vs 265.8±116 U/L ) (p&lt;0.05, each). Conclusions Muscle loss seems to be a predictor of ICU hospitalization in COVID-19 patients and radiologists reporting chest CT at admission should note this finding in their reports."

https://openalex.org/W3171164514,"Background COVID-19 is a novel respiratory disease associated with severe morbidity and high mortality in the elderly population and people with comorbidities. Studies have suggested that pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women. However, it’s unclear whether pregnant women in Ghana are knowledgeable about COVID-19 and practice preventive measures against it. This study sought to assess the knowledge and preventive practices towards COVID-19 among pregnant women seeking antenatal services in Northern Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire in the Nabdam district in Ghana. A total of 527 pregnant women were randomly sampled from health facilities offering antenatal care services in the district. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the predictors and outcome variables. Results The prevalence of adequate knowledge and good COVID-19 preventive practices were 85.6%, (95% CI: 82.57, 88.59) and 46.6%, (95% CI: 42.41, 50.95) respectively. Having at least a primary education, residing in an urban area, and receiving COVID-19 education at a health facility were positively associated with adequate knowledge on COVID-19. Factors positively associated with good COVID-19 preventive practices were older age, having at least a primary education, pregnant women with a chronic disease, and living in an urban area. Multiparity was negatively associated with good COVID-19 preventive practices. Conclusion Although majority of women had adequate knowledge of COVID-19, less than half of them were engaged in good COVID-19 preventive practices. Education of pregnant women on COVID-19 preventive practices should be intensified at health facilities while improving upon the water, sanitation and hygiene need particularly in rural communities."
https://openalex.org/W3171960265,"West Nile Virus (WNV) is a life threatening flavivirus that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. No preventive therapeutics including vaccines against WNV are available for human use. In this study, immunoinformatics approach was performed to design a multi epitope-based subunit vaccine against this deadly pathogen. Human (HLA) and Mice (H-2) allele specific potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes were shortlisted through a stringent procedure. Molecular docking showed selected epitopes that have stronger binding affinity with human TLR-4. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stable nature of the docked complex. Furthermore, in silico cloning analysis ensures efficient expression of desired gene in the microbial system. Interestingly, previous studies showed that two of our selected epitopes have strong immune response against WNV. Therefore, selected epitopes could be strong vaccine candidates to prevent WNV infections in human. However, further in vitro and in vivo investigations could be strengthening the validation of the vaccine candidate against WNV."
https://openalex.org/W3166120058,"Objective To quantify excess all-cause mortality in Switzerland in 2020, a key indicator for assessing direct and indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using official data on deaths in Switzerland, all-cause mortality in 2020 was compared with that of previous years using directly standardized mortality rates, age- and sex-specific mortality rates, and life expectancy. Results The standardized mortality rate was 8.8% higher in 2020 than in 2019, returning to the level observed 5–6 years before, around the year 2015. This increase was greater for men (10.6%) than for women (7.2%) and was statistically significant only for men over 70 years of age, and for women over 75 years of age. The decrease in life expectancy in 2020 compared to 2019 was 0.7%, with a loss of 9.7 months for men and 5.3 months for women. Conclusions There was an excess mortality in Switzerland in 2020, linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as this excess only concerned the elderly, the resulting loss of life expectancy was restricted to a few months, bringing the mortality level back to 2015."
https://openalex.org/W3170321061,"The cholesterol-sensing protein Scap induces cholesterol synthesis by transporting membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus for proteolytic activation. Transport requires interaction between Scap's two ER luminal loops (L1 and L7), which flank an intramembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD). Cholesterol inhibits Scap transport by binding to L1, which triggers Scap's binding to Insig, an ER retention protein. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate two structures of full-length chicken Scap: (1) a wild-type free of Insigs and (2) mutant Scap bound to chicken Insig without cholesterol. Strikingly, L1 and L7 intertwine tightly to form a globular domain that acts as a luminal platform connecting the SSD to the rest of Scap. In the presence of Insig, this platform undergoes a large rotation accompanied by rearrangement of Scap's transmembrane helices. We postulate that this conformational change halts Scap transport of SREBPs and inhibits cholesterol synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3167540898,"Recent evidence suggests that psychological health deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic but far less is known about changes in other measures of well-being. We examined changes in a broad set of measures of well-being among seniors just before and after the recognition of community spread of COVID-19 in the United States. We fielded two waves of a survey to a large, national online panel of adults ages 60 to 68 at wave 1. We measured depressive symptoms, negative affect, positive affect, pain, life satisfaction and self-rated health in each survey wave. 16,644 adults answered well-being questions in waves 1 and 2 of our survey (mean[SD]: age 64 [2.6]; 10,165 women [61%]; 15,161 [91%] white). We found large (20%; p&lt;0.001) increases in the rate of depressive symptoms (1.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.86) and negative mood (0.225 scale points; 95% CI, 0.205 to 0.245) but no change in self-reported health and a decrease (12.5%; p&lt;0.001) in the rate of self-reported pain (5 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.8 to -4.3). Depressive symptoms and negative affect increased more for women. Higher perceived risk of getting COVID-19 and of dying from the disease were associated with larger increases in the rate of depressive symptoms and negative affect and larger decreases in positive affect and life satsifaction. COVID-19 related job/income loss was the only pandemic-related factor predictive of the decline in pain. Although depressive symptoms and mood worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, other measures of well-being were either not materially affected or even improved."
https://openalex.org/W3168258255,"Classification of clinical symptoms and diagnostic microbiology are essential to effectively employ antimicrobial therapy for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in a timely manner. Empirical antibiotic treatment without microbial identification hinders the selective use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics and effective patient treatment. Thus, the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic procedures that can be readily adopted by the clinic is necessary to minimize non-essential or excessive use of antibiotics and accelerate patient recovery from LRTI-induced damage. We developed and validated a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) assay with good analytical performance and high specificity to simultaneously detect four bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The analytical performance of mRT-PCR against target pathogens was evaluated by the limit of detection (LOD), specificity, and repeatability. Two hundred and ten clinical specimens from pneumonia patients were processed using an automatic nucleic acid extraction system for the ""respiratory bacteria four"" (RB4) mRT-PCR assay, and the results were directly compared to references from bacterial culture and/or Sanger sequencing. The RB4 mRT-PCR assay detected all target pathogens from sputum specimens with a coefficient of variation ranging from 0.29 to 1.71 and conservative LOD of DNA corresponding to 5 × 102 copies/reaction. The concordance of the assay with reference-positive specimens was 100%, and additional bacterial infections were detected from reference-negative specimens. Overall, the RB4 mRT-PCR assay showed a more rapid turnaround time and higher performance that those of reference assays. The RB4 mRT-PCR assay is a high-throughput and reliable tool that assists decision-making assessment and outperforms other standard methods. This tool supports patient management by considerably reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3168950270,"Background Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to reduce the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants, and patients are increasingly on oral anticoagulants and PPI co-therapy. However, evidence is lacking on the safety and effectiveness of oral anticoagulants when co-administered with PPIs. Methods Among patients initiating oral anticoagulants (warfarin and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [NOACs], i.e. rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, and edoxaban) during 2013–2017, those concomitantly prescribed PPIs were identified (n = 19,851). The primary endpoint was hospitalization for major upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and secondary endpoints were death and ischemic stroke. Results During a mean 1.4 years of follow-up, the primary endpoint occurred in 512 (2.58%) patients. Overall, NOACs were associated with lower upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities and concomitant medications (adjusted hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.65–0.94), compared to warfarin. There was no significant difference in upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk among the individual NOACs. This trend of reduced risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in NOACs compared to warfarin was consistent for both regular and reduced doses, throughout bleeding risk groups, and other subgroup analyses. NOACs were also associated with lower risk of death compared to warfarin. The risk for ischemic stroke was not significantly different among the oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation. Conclusion In patients on oral anticoagulant and PPI co-therapy, NOACs were associated with lower risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and mortality compared to warfarin, while there was no difference among the oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention. In patients on PPI therapy, NOACs may preferred over warfarin for decreasing risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and mortality."

We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes.Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%). There were modest declines in self-reported physical and mental health, and 48.2% did less physical activity. In multivariable regression models, adherence to guidance by leaving the house less often associated with less professional occupational class (OR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.51-0.98) and poorer self-rated general health (OR = 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92). Increased internet use associated with female sex (OR = 2.32, 95%CI 1.12-4.86) and higher general cognitive ability (OR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.03-2.33). Loneliness associated with living alone (OR = 0.15, 95%CI 0.07-0.31) and greater anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.76, 95%CI 0.45-1.24).

We checked for Salmonella contamination in 201 sandwiches (one per seller), according to the ISO 6579:2002 standard. All Salmonella isolates were characterized by serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing was performed on a subset of isolates, to investigate their phylogenetic relationships and antimicrobial resistance determinants.The prevalence of Salmonella enterica was 17.9% (36/201) and the Salmonella isolates belonged to 16 different serotypes, the most frequent being Kentucky, Derby and Tennessee, with five isolates each. Six Salmonella isolates from serotypes Brancaster and Kentucky were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Whole-genome sequencing revealed that four of these MDR isolates belonged to the emergent S. enterica serotype Kentucky clone ST198-X1 and to an invasive lineage of S. enterica serotype Enteritidis (West African clade).This study reveals a high prevalence of Salmonella spp. in sandwiches sold in Ouagadougou.

Screening and optimization of tabula rasa bait regions incorporating matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) substrate sequences produced an A2M that was specifically cleaved by MMPs and inhibited MMP2 cleavage activity as efficiently as wild-type A2M.

Protease trapping is associated with covalent conjugation of the protease by a thiol ester bond that is initially buried within A2M and exposed upon its proteolysis-induced conformational change; although covalent conjugation is required for protease trapping by the monomeric αMs, tetramers such as A2M can trap proteases noncovalently (8Enghild J.J.

As a consequence of its conformational change, A2M reveals a binding site that interacts with a scavenger receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and this interaction quickly removes A2M-protease complexes from circulation through internalization and endosomal degradation, primarily in the liver (12Imber M.J.

In order for a protease to be inhibited by an αM protease inhibitor, the protease must be able to cleave within the αM’s bait region. The bait region of A2M contains 15 of the 20 canonical amino acids, permitting cleavage by most proteases with simple substrate recognition (e.g., only involving the P1 or P1’ residue) and also has an MMP cleavage site (14Enghild J.J.

Int. Ed. Engl. 2012; 51: 3340-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have recently developed a low-resolution model of native A2M using negative stain electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cross-linking mass spectrometry (41Harwood S.L. Lyngsø J. Zarantonello A. Kjøge K. Nielsen P.K. Andersen G.R. Pedersen J.S. Enghild J.J. Structural investigations of human A2M identify a hollow native conformation that underlies its distinctive protease-trapping mechanism.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2021; 20: 100090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model indicates that proteases must enter the interior of native A2M to access and cleave the bait regions, at which point A2M collapses and closes off its entrances, thereby trapping the intruding protease (Fig. 1D). The bait regions occupy the interior space of native A2M and may interact with each other, as suggested by the formation of intersubunit disulfides upon the introduction of cysteine residues into the bait region (42Bowen M.E. Gettins P.G. Bait region involvement in the dimer-dimer interface of human alpha 2-macroglobulin and in mediating gross conformational change. Evidence from cysteine variants that form interdimer disulfides.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1825-1831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanism by which bait region cleavage triggers A2M’s conformational collapse is not known. In the αM complement factors, the anaphylactic domain corresponds to the bait region of αM protease inhibitors, and its removal by proteolysis is thought to perturb the adjacent MG3 and MG8 domains, thereby initiating a conformational change (36Mortensen S. Kidmose R.T. Petersen S.V. Szilagyi A. Prohaszka Z. Andersen G.R. Structural basis for the function of complement component C4 within the classical and lectin pathways of complement.J. Immunol. 2015; 194: 5488-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, while the anaphylactic domain has a rigid α-helix structure (32Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Structures of complement component C3 provide insights into the function and evolution of immunity.Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and is evolutionarily conserved across species, the bait region is unstructured and poorly conserved (Fig. S1), and it is unclear how it could participate in an equivalent triggering mechanism. While the reaction of A2M’s thiol ester with nucleophiles (e.g., lysine side chain ε-amino groups on the surface of proteases) takes place during or after its conformational change (43Sottrup-Jensen L. Hansen H.F. Christensen U. Generation and reactivity of “nascent” alpha 2-macroglobulin: Localization of cross-links in alpha 2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 421: 188-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), its amino- or hydrolysis is not required for the conformational change to take place, as A2M lacking a thiol ester is still induced to change its conformation by proteolysis (44Harwood S.L. Nielsen N.S. Pedersen H. Kjoge K. Nielsen P.K. Andersen G.R. Enghild J.J.

Harris Jr., E.D. Ovostatin: A novel proteinase inhibitor from chicken egg white. II. Mechanism of inhibition studied with collagenase and thermolysin.J. Biol.

In this study, we have produced and characterized recombinant A2M proteins with modified bait regions, which investigate the bait region’s functional role and demonstrate the design of new protease inhibitors. We found that A2M’s bait region can be replaced in its entirety with 13 Gly-Gly-Ser triplets without preventing A2M from assembling into its usual homotetrameric structure or assuming its native conformation. This tabula rasa bait region was not initially cleaved by any of 12 tested proteases, but could be cleaved by trypsin, LysC, or MMP2 upon introducing an appropriate cleavage site into its sequence. Bait region cleavage of tabula rasa A2Ms resulted in protease conjugation through A2M’s thiol ester, the induction of A2M’s conformational collapse, and protease inhibition, as demonstrated for trypsin and MMP2. An MMP2 substrate bait region that was selectively cleaved by MMPs was identified by screening using ten human proteases. Further optimization of the bait region yielded a tabula rasa A2M, which inhibited MMP2 as efficiently as wild-type A2M. Altogether, these results demonstrate an approach to developing more specific A2M-based protease inhibitors through bait region engineering and have identified several factors that are important during bait region design, including the cleavage site position and bait region length. The bait region is both ground zero for A2M’s proteolytically induced conformational change and the major determiner of which proteases are inhibited by A2M. However, the low conservation of the bait region sequence across species (Fig. S1) suggests that it has no essential structure or sequence motifs. In order to remove essentially all protease cleavage sites or putative structural features from the bait region and determine the extent to which it tolerates modification, we entirely replaced the 39-residue bait region sequence with 13 Gly-Gly-Ser repeats, chosen for their solubility and low susceptibility to proteolysis (Fig. 2A). The resulting tabula rasa bait region could be incorporated into recombinant A2M, resulting in a tabula rasa A2M protein that was predominantly tetrameric and in its native conformation, with an intact thiol ester apparent from the formation of characteristic heat-induced autolysis products in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 2, B and C). Upon aminolysis of its thiol ester with methylamine, tabula rasa A2M underwent a conformational collapse indistinguishable from that of wild-type A2M, as determined by pore-limited native PAGE; however, tabula rasa A2M was not cleaved in its bait region by either trypsin or LysC and remained in its native conformation despite proteolysis by these proteases outside of its bait region (Fig. 2, B and C). While the majority of tabula rasa A2M assembled into the normal homotetramer, dimeric tabula rasa A2M that had failed to tetramerize was slightly more abundant than wild-type A2M; dimers were removed during purification prior to all characterization (Fig. S2). Similarly, while the majority of tabula rasa A2M was in a native conformation, both fully collapsed A2M and conformations with an intermediate electrophoretic mobility were apparent in pore-limited native PAGE and more abundant than in wild-type A2M (Fig. 2B). Before using these proteins in quantitative protease inhibition assays, nonnative A2M was depleted using LRP1-conjugated resin (Fig. S3). The TR K704 bait region added a lysine residue at position 704 and was cleaved by trypsin and LysC, which caused A2M to undergo a conformational collapse (Fig. 2, A–C); as the wild-type bait region and the initial tabula rasa bait region contain no lysine residues, LysC cleaved these A2Ms in locations other than the bait region without inducing a conformational change, as has been previously reported (45Van Leuven F. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Proteolysis of human alpha 2-macroglobulin without hydrolysis of the internal thiolesters or expression of the receptor recognition site.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protease-induced conformational change of A2M TR K704 activated its thiol ester and resulted in the formation of covalent conjugation products that were apparent as high-MW bands in reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). Altogether, these results showed that while the wild-type bait region may make minor contributions toward A2M’s tetrameric assembly and the assumption of its native conformation, no part of its sequence is structurally or functionally essential. The majority of tabula rasa A2M is tetrameric and in a native conformation and can undergo a methylamine- or proteolysis-induced conformational change (if protease substrate sites are incorporated into the bait region). Bait region cleavage of A2M TR K704 by both trypsin and LysC produced an intense band migrating as ∼250 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE that was not produced by trypsin-cleaved wild-type A2M (Fig. 2C). The bait region is spatially close to the TE domain when A2M is proteolytically activated (Fig. 1, B–D), and we hypothesized that the nucleophilic ε-amine group of Lys704’s side chain might attack the thiol ester following proteolysis, conjugating the N- and C-terminal bait region cleavage fragments together into an aberrantly migrating ∼180 kDa product. This proposed product of Lys704 autoconjugation disappeared when 3-aminopropanenitrile (BAPN), a small nucleophile that reacts with the thiol ester after it is proteolytically exposed and out-competes conjugation to other nucleophiles (9Salvesen G.S. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Further characterization of the covalent linking reaction of alpha 2-macroglobulin.Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was included alongside trypsin, demonstrating that it is formed through thiol-ester-mediated conjugation (Fig. 3A). After cleavage of A2M TR K704 with Cy5-labeled trypsin, this band was not fluorescent and therefore does not contain trypsin (Fig. 3A). In fact, the product band became more intense upon cleaving A2M TR K704 with acetylated trypsin, which is not efficiently conjugated as it lacks primary amine groups (Fig. 3A). LC-MS/MS analysis of the pepsin-digested product band identified a cross-linked peptide containing an isopeptide cross-link between the thiol ester Gln975 and the bait region Lys704 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the band was not produced upon tryptic cleavage of tabula rasa A2M with a bait region arginine residue instead of a lysine residue (Fig. S4, A and B). These results conclusively show that this band represents an autoconjugation product of the thiol ester and a bait region lysine residue. We proceeded to investigate the trypsin-inhibiting ability of tabula rasa-based A2Ms using a fluorescently labeled gelatin substrate. In addition to A2M TR K704, bait regions incorporating an Arg704, Lys710, or Arg710 residue were produced (Fig. 4A). These A2M proteins appeared similar to A2M TR K704 during their initial characterization by electrophoresis (Fig. S4, A and B). In order to quantitatively determine the inhibitory capacity of the native tabula rasa A2Ms, nonnative A2M was depleted from these proteins using LRP1-conjugated resin before all inhibitory assays (Fig. S3).

This study investigated a therapeutic DNA vaccine delivered with a single adjuvant or a novel combination of adjuvants to augment T cell immunity in the blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Animals that received DNA vaccines expressing SIV proteins, combined with plasmids expressing adjuvants designed to increase peripheral and mucosal T cell responses, including the catalytic subunit of the E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, IL-12, IL-33, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2, soluble PD-1 and soluble CD80, were compared to mock-vaccinated controls. Following treatment interruption, macaques exhibited variable levels of viral rebound, with four animals from the vaccinated groups and one animal from the control group controlling virus at median levels of 103 RNA copies/ml or lower (controllers) and nine animals, among all groups, exhibiting immediate viral rebound and median viral loads greater than 103 RNA copies/ml (non-controllers). Although there was no significant difference between the vaccinated and control groups in protection from viral rebound, the variable virological outcomes during treatment interruption enabled an examination of immune correlates of viral replication in controllers versus non-controllers regardless of vaccination status. Lower viral burden in controllers correlated with increased polyfunctional SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and blood prior to and during treatment interruption. Notably, higher frequencies of colonic CD4+ T cells and lower Th17/Treg ratios prior to infection in controllers correlated with improved responses to ART and control of viral rebound. These results indicate that mucosal immune responses, present prior to infection, can influence efficacy of antiretroviral therapy and the outcome of immunotherapeutic vaccination, suggesting that therapies capable of modulating host mucosal responses may be needed to achieve HIV cure."
https://openalex.org/W3166734826,"A large number of studies have shown that the variation and disorder of miRNAs are important causes of diseases. The recognition of disease-related miRNAs has become an important topic in the field of biological research. However, the identification of disease-related miRNAs by biological experiments is expensive and time consuming. Thus, computational prediction models that predict disease-related miRNAs must be developed. A novel network projection-based dual random walk with restart (NPRWR) was used to predict potential disease-related miRNAs. The NPRWR model aims to estimate and accurately predict miRNA-disease associations by using dual random walk with restart and network projection technology, respectively. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was adopted to evaluate the prediction performance of NPRWR. The results show that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(AUC) of NPRWR was 0.9029, which is superior to that of other advanced miRNA-disease associated prediction methods. In addition, lung and kidney neoplasms were selected to present a case study. Among the first 50 miRNAs predicted, 50 and 49 miRNAs have been proven by in databases or relevant literature. Moreover, NPRWR can be used to predict isolated diseases and new miRNAs. LOOCV and the case study achieved good prediction results. Thus, NPRWR will become an effective and accurate disease-miRNA association prediction model."
https://openalex.org/W3171975732,"Objective Reports of disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates are emerging in the public health literature as the pandemic continues to unfold. Alcohol misuse varies across the US and is related to poorer health and comorbidities that likely affect the severity of COVID-19 infection. High levels of pre-pandemic alcohol misuse in some counties may have set the stage for worse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, this relationship may depend on how rural a county is, as access to healthcare in rural communities has lagged behind more urban areas. The objective of this study was to test for associations between county-level COVID-19 mortality, pre-pandemic county-level excessive drinking, and county rurality. Method We used national COVID-19 data from the New York Times to calculate county-level case fatality rates (n = 3,039 counties and county equivalents; October 1 –December 31, 2020) and other external county-level data sources for indicators of rurality and health. We used beta regression to model case fatality rates, adjusted for several county-level population characteristics. We included a multilevel component to our model and defined state as a random intercept. Our focal predictor was a single variable representing nine possible combinations of low/mid/high alcohol misuse and low/mid/high rurality. Results The median county-level COVID-19 case fatality rate was 1.57%. Compared to counties with low alcohol misuse and low rurality (referent), counties with high levels of alcohol and mid ( β = -0.17, p = 0.008) or high levels of rurality ( β = -0.24, p&lt;0.001) demonstrated significantly lower case fatality rates.

However, the study of Khib in plant species is still relatively limited. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a global important cereal plant. In this study, the systematic Khib analysis was performed in wheat leave tissues. A total of 3004 Khib sites in 1104 proteins were repeatedly identified. Structure characterization of these Khib peptides revealed 12 conserved sequence motifs. Function classification and enrichment analysis indicated these Khib proteins showed a wide function and pathway distribution, of which ribosome activity, protein biosynthesis and photosynthesis were the preferred biological processes. Subcellular location predication indicated chloroplast was the dominant subcellular compartment where Khib was distributed. There may be some crosstalks among Khib, lysine acetylation and lysine succinylation modification because some proteins and sites were modified by all these three acylations. The present study demonstrated the critical role of Khib in wheat biological and physiology, which has expanded the scope of Khib in plant species. Our study is an available resource and reference of Khib function demonstration and structure characterization in cereal plant, as well as in plant kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W3167024176,"The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands regulate many physiological and pathological processes. EphA4 plays important roles in nervous system development and adult homeostasis, while aberrant EphA4 signaling has been implicated in neurodegeneration. EphA4 may also affect cancer malignancy, but the regulation and effects of EphA4 signaling in cancer are poorly understood. A correlation between decreased patient survival and high EphA4 mRNA expression in melanoma tumors that also highly express ephrinA ligands suggests that enhanced EphA4 signaling may contribute to melanoma progression. A search for EphA4 gain-of-function mutations in melanoma uncovered a mutation of the highly conserved leucine 920 in the EphA4 sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. We found that mutation of L920 to phenylalanine (L920F) potentiates EphA4 autophosphorylation and signaling, making it the first documented EphA4 cancer mutation that increases kinase activity. Quantitative Föster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence intensity fluctuation (FIF) analyses revealed that the L920F mutation induces a switch in EphA4 oligomer size, from a dimer to a trimer. We propose this switch in oligomer size as a novel mechanism underlying EphA4-linked tumorigenesis. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the L920F mutation alters EphA4 SAM domain conformation, leading to the formation of EphA4 trimers that assemble through two aberrant SAM domain interfaces. Accordingly, EphA4 wild-type and the L920F mutant are affected differently by the SAM domain and are differentially regulated by ephrin ligand stimulation. The increased EphA4 activation induced by the L920F mutation, through the novel mechanism we uncovered, supports a functional role for EphA4 in promoting pathogenesis."

The aim of our study was to correlatep16 immunohistochemistry in oropharynx squamous cell carcinomas(OPSCC) with clinical and epidemiological features.We conducted across-sectional study on patients with OPSCC treated at a single institution from 2014 to 2019. Epidemiological and clinical-pathological data were collected from medical records and a questionnaire was applied to determine alcohol consumption, smoking, and sexual behavior. The HPV status was determined by p16 immunohistochemistry.A total of 252 patients participated in the study, of these 221 (87.7%) were male. There were 81 (32.14%) p16 positive cases and 171 (67.85%) p16 negative cases. The p16positive group was significantly associated with younger patients (50-59 years), higher education level, lower clinical stage and patients who never drank or smoked. Through univariate logistic regression, we observed that female sex (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.60-7.51) and higher education level (OR, 9.39; 95% CI, 2, 81-31,38) were significantly more likely to be p16 positive. Early clinical stage (AJCC8ed) was more associated with p16 positivity both in univariate (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.07-0.26, p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.49, p = 0.001).This study showed that drinkers and current smokers were less likely to be p16+. Female sex, higher education level and younger age at diagnosis were associated with a higher probability of being p16+. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of patients with early clinical stage (I or II) in the p16 positive group when compared to the p16 negative group."
https://openalex.org/W3170428922,"Previous research shows that female athletes sleep better according to objective parameters but report worse subjective sleep quality than male athletes. However, existing sleep studies did not investigate variations in sleep and sleep stages over longer periods and have, so far, not elucidated the role of the menstrual cycle in female athletes' sleep. To address these methodological shortcomings, we investigated sex differences in sleep and sleep stages over 61 continuous days in 37 men and 19 women and examined the role of the menstrual cycle and its phases in 15 women. Sleep was measured by a non-contact radar, and menstrual bleeding was self-reported. Associations were investigated with multilevel modeling. Overall, women tended to report poorer subjective sleep quality (p = .057), but objective measurements showed that women obtained longer sleep duration (p < .001), more light (p = .013) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM; hours (h): p < .001, %: p = .007), shorter REM latency (p < .001), and higher sleep efficiency (p = .003) than men. R2 values showed that sleep duration, REM and REM latency were especially affected by sex. Among women, we found longer time in bed (p = .027) and deep sleep (h: p = .036), and shorter light sleep (%: p = .021) during menstrual bleeding vs. non-bleeding days; less light sleep (h: p = .040), deep sleep (%: p = .013) and shorter REM latency (p = .011) during the menstrual than pre-menstrual phase; and lower sleep efficiency (p = .042) and more deep sleep (%: p = .026) during the follicular than luteal phase. These findings indicate that the menstrual cycle may impact the need for physiological recovery, as evidenced by the sleep stage variations. Altogether, the observed sex differences in subjective and objective sleep parameters may be related to the female athletes' menstrual cycle. The paper provides unique data of sex differences in sleep stages and novel insights into the role of the menstrual cycle in sleep among female athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3171682936,"Particleboards are widely used in the artificial board market, which can be constructed from a variety of raw materials and require small amounts of energy to be produced. In the particleboard production process, forming machines play an important role as the key equipment for achieving continuous production. In recent years, airflow forming machines have received increasing attention in particleboard production lines because of their strong separation ability and low price. However, the internal flow field is complex and difficult to control, which affects the surface quality and strength of the particleboard. The most pressing technical difficulty is controlling the flow field characteristics of the airflow paver. At present, the research on this subject is conducted primarily through repeated experiments, which entail long research periods and high processing costs. To reduce human and financial costs, in this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is employed to investigate the flow field and the gas-solid two-phase flow field coupled with particle movement of an airflow forming machine. The accuracy of the calculation model is verified by comparing characteristic point velocities obtained from experimental analysis and a simulation. The simulation results show that in practical production, the frequency of a negative pressure fan should be greater than 27 Hz. It is necessary to set the shoulder properly, and the slab smoothness can be improved by moving the shoulder back on the premise of meeting the strength requirements of the box. The distance between the shoulders of the box body should be less than 2570 mm, and particles with uniform diameter should be added to the paving box to reduce the turbulence effect, improve the quality of particle forming and provide actual particleboard production with a solid theoretical foundation."
https://openalex.org/W3171787725,"Thorough knowledge of the germination behavior of weed species could aid in the development of effective weed control practices, especially when glyphosate resistance is involved. A study was conducted using two glyphosate-resistant (GR) (SGW2 and CP2) and two glyphosate-susceptible (GS) (Ch and SGM2) populations of Chloris virgata, an emerging and troublesome weed species of Australian farming systems, to evaluate their germination response to different alternating temperature (15/5, 25/15 and 35/25°C with 12 h/12 h light/dark photoperiod) and moisture stress regimes (0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8 and -1.6 MPa). These temperature regimes represent temperatures occurring throughout the year in the eastern grain region of Australia. Seeds germinated in all the temperature regimes with no clear indication of optimum thermal conditions for the GR and GS populations. All populations exhibited considerable germination at the lowest alternating temperature regime 15/5°C (61%, 87%, 49%, and 47% for Ch, SGM2, SGW2, and CP2, respectively), demonstrating the ability of C. virgata to germinate in winter months despite being a summer annual. Seed germination of all populations was inhibited at -0.8 and -1.6 MPa osmotic potential at two alternating temperature regimes (15/5 and 35/25°C); however, some seeds germinated at 25/15°C at -0.8 MPa osmotic potential, indicating the ability of C. virgata to germinate in arid regions and drought conditions. Three biological parameters (T10: incubation period required to reach 10% germination; T50: incubation period required to reach 50% germination; and T90: incubation period required to reach 90% germination) suggested late water imbibition with increasing moisture stress levels. The GR population SGW2 exhibited a distinctive pattern in T10, T50, and T90, possessing delayed germination behaviour and thus demonstrating an escape mechanism against pre-plating weed management practices. Knowledge gained from this study will help in developing site-specific and multi-tactic weed control protocols."
https://openalex.org/W3167765701,"In this paper, we explore mutual information based stock networks to build regular vine copula structure on high frequency log returns of stocks and use it for the estimation of Value at Risk (VaR) of a portfolio of stocks. Our model is a data driven model that learns from a high frequency time series data of log returns of top 50 stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India for the year 2014. The Ljung-Box test revealed the presence of Autocorrelation as well as Heteroscedasticity in the underlying time series data. Analysing the goodness of fit of a number of variants of the GARCH model on each working day of the year 2014, that is, 229 days in all, it was observed that ARMA(1,1)-EGARCH(1,1) demonstrated the best fit. The joint probability distribution of the portfolio is computed by constructed an R-Vine copula structure on the data with the mutual information guided minimum spanning tree as the key building block. The joint PDF is then fed into the Monte-Carlo simulation procedure to compute the VaR. If we replace the mutual information by the Kendall's Tau in the construction of the R-Vine copula structure, the resulting VaR estimations were found to be inferior suggesting the presence of non-linear relationships among stock returns."

Lost workdays within 1-year post-injury were compared by guideline adherence using quantile regressions.Of the 59,656 workers who met the study inclusion criteria, 66.1% were male and the average (SD) age was 41 (12) years. The median number (IQR) of lost workdays was 27 (6-146) days. In the first week of treatment, 14.2% of workers received only recommended interventions, 14.6% received only non-recommended interventions, and 51.1% received both recommended and non-recommended interventions. Opioid prescriptions fell 86% from 2009 to 2018. Workers who received only guideline-recommended interventions experienced significantly fewer lost workdays (11.5 days; 95% CI: -13.9, -9.1), a 29.3% reduction, than workers who received only non-recommended interventions. The percentage of workers receiving only recommended interventions increased from 10.3% to 18.2% over the 9 years.When workers received guideline-recommended interventions, they typically returned to work in fewer days. The majority of workers received at least one non-recommended intervention, demonstrating the need for adherence to guideline recommendations. Fewer lost workdays and improved quality care are outcomes that strongly benefit injured workers."
https://openalex.org/W3169346250,"Delayed umbilical cord clamping (UCC) after birth is thought to cause placental to infant blood transfusion, but the mechanisms are unknown. It has been suggested that uterine contractions force blood out of the placenta and into the infant during delayed cord clamping. We have investigated the effect of uterine contractions, induced by maternal oxytocin administration, on umbilical artery (UA) and venous (UV) blood flows before and after ventilation onset to determine whether uterine contractions cause placental transfusion in preterm lambs.At ~128 days of gestation, UA and UV blood flows, pulmonary arterial blood flow (PBF) and carotid arterial (CA) pressures and blood flows were measured in three groups of fetal sheep during delayed UCC; maternal oxytocin following mifepristone, mifepristone alone, and saline controls. Each successive uterine contraction significantly (p<0.05) decreased UV (26.2±6.0 to 14.1±4.5 mL.min-1.kg-1) and UA (41.2±6.3 to 20.7 ± 4.0 mL.min-1.kg-1) flows and increased CA pressure and flow (47.1±3.4 to 52.8±3.5 mmHg and 29.4±2.6 to 37.3±3.4 mL.min-1.kg-1). These flows and pressures were partially restored between contractions, but did not return to pre-oxytocin administration levels. Ventilation onset during DCC increased the effects of uterine contractions on UA and UV flows, with retrograde UA flow (away from the placenta) commonly occurring during diastole.We found no evidence that amplification of uterine contractions with oxytocin increase placental transfusion during DCC. Instead they decreased both UA and UV flow and caused a net loss of blood from the lamb. Uterine contractions did, however, have significant cardiovascular effects and reduced systemic and cerebral oxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W3169785359,"The human ZC3H14 gene, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed polyadenosine zinc finger RNA-binding protein, is mutated in an inherited form of autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic intellectual disability. To gain insight into neurological functions of ZC3H14, we previously developed a Drosophila melanogaster model of ZC3H14 loss by deleting the fly ortholog, Nab2. Studies in this invertebrate model revealed that Nab2 controls final patterns of neuron projection within fully developed adult brains, but the role of Nab2 during development of the Drosophila brain is not known. Here, we identify roles for Nab2 in controlling the dynamic growth of axons in the developing brain mushroom bodies, which support olfactory learning and memory, and regulating abundance of a small fraction of the total brain proteome. The group of Nab2-regulated brain proteins, identified by quantitative proteomic analysis, includes the microtubule-binding protein Futsch, the neuronal Ig-family transmembrane protein turtle, the glial:neuron adhesion protein contactin, the Rac GTPase-activating protein tumbleweed, and the planar cell polarity factor Van Gogh, which collectively link Nab2 to the processes of brain morphogenesis, neuroblast proliferation, circadian sleep/wake cycles, and synaptic development. Overall, these data indicate that Nab2 controls the abundance of a subset of brain proteins during the active process of wiring the pupal brain mushroom body and thus provide a window into potentially conserved functions of the Nab2/ZC3H14 RNA-binding proteins in neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W3167781211,"Despite the high burden of hearing loss (HL) globaly, most countries in resource limited settings lack infant hearing screening programs(IHS) for early HL detection. We examined the feasibility of establishing an IHS program in this setting, and in this pilot program measured the prevalence of infant hearing loss (IHL) and described the characteristics of the infants with HL.We assessed feasibility of establishing an IHS program at a regional referral hospital in south-western Uganda. We recruited infants aged 1 day to 3 months and performed a three-staged screening. At stage 1, we used Transient Evoked Oto-acoustic Emissions (TEOAEs), at stage 2 we repeated TEOAEs for infants who failed TEOAEs at stage 1 and at stage 3, we conducted Automated brainstem responses(ABRs) for those who failed stage 2. IHL was present if they failed an ABR at 35dBHL.We screened 401 infants, mean age was 7.2 days (SD = 7.1). 74.6% (299 of 401) passed stage 1, the rest (25.4% or 102 of 401) were referred for stage 2. Of those referred (n = 102), only 34.3% (35 of 102) returned for stage 2 screening. About 14.3% (5/35) failed the repeat TEOAEs in at least one ear. At stage 3, 80% (4 of 5) failed the ABR screening in at least one ear, while 25% (n = 1) failed the test bilaterally. Among the 334 infants that completed the staged screening, the prevalence of IHL was 4/334 or 12 per 1000. Risk factors to IHL were Newborn Special Care Unit (NSCU) admission, gentamycin or oxygen therapy and prematurity.IHS program establishment in a resource limited setting is feasible. Preliminary data indicate a high prevalence of IHL. Targeted screening of infants at high risk may be a more realistic and sustainable initial step towards establishing IHS program s in a developing country like Uganda."

Assessment of proliferation used gastric AGS cells (Alamar blue), IgG function measured bovine IgG anti-E.coli binding and ELISAs quantified growth factor constituents. In vivo bioassay assessed ability of BC alone or with soy to reduce injury caused by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS, 4% in drinking water, 7 days, test products started 2 days prior to DSS).Proliferative activity of BC reduced 61% following HCl/pepsin and CT exposure. This was truncated 50% if soy was co-present, and also protected against loss of total IgG, IgG E.coli binding, TGFβ, lactoferrin and EGF (all P<0.01 vs BC alone). Co-packaging with trehalose was ineffective in preventing digestion whereas casein or stearine provided some intermediate protective effects. Rats given BC alone showed beneficial effects on weight gain, disease activity index, tissue histology and colonic MPO. Soy alone was ineffective. BC+ soy combination showed the greatest benefit with a dose of 7 mg/kg (6.4 BC + 0.6 soy flour) having the same degree of benefit as using 20 mg/kg BC alone.Soy, and to a lesser extent casein, enhanced the biostability of BC against digestive enzymes. Co-packaging of BC with other food products such as soy flour could result in a decreased dose being required, improving cost-effectiveness and patient compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3169725131,"It has been reported that valproic acid (VPA) combined with therapeutic hypothermia can improve survival and neurologic outcomes in a rat asphyxial cardiac arrest model. However, neuroprotective mechanisms of such combined treatment of valproic acid with hypothermia remains unclear. We hypothesized that epigenetic regulation of HSP70 by histone acetylation could increase HSP70-mediated neuroprotection suppressed under hypothermia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats that achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from asphyxial cardiac arrest were randomized to four groups: normothermia (37°C ± 1°C), hypothermia (33°C ± 1°C), normothermia + VPA (300 mg/kg IV initiated 5 minutes post-ROSC and infused over 20 min), and hypothermia + VPA. Three hours after ROSC, acetyl-histone H3 was highly expressed in VPA-administered groups (normothermia + VPA, hypothermia + VPA). Four hours after ROSC, HSP70 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in normothermic groups (normothermia, normothermia + VPA) than in hypothermic groups (hypothermia, hypothermia + VPA). The hypothermia + VPA group showed significantly higher HSP70 mRNA expression than the hypothermia group. Similarly, at five hours after ROSC, HSP70 protein levels were significantly higher in normothermic groups than in hypothermic groups. HSP70 levels were significantly higher in the hypothermia + VPA group than in the hypothermia group. Only the hypothermia + VPA group showed significantly attenuated cleaved caspase-9 levels than the normothermia group. Hypothermia can attenuate the expression of HSP70 at transcriptional level. However, VPA administration can induce hyperacetylation of histone H3, leading to epigenetic transcriptional activation of HSP70 even in a hypothermic status. Combining VPA treatment with hypothermia may compensate for reduced activation of HSP70-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway."

Methods NPC patients were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2016. Pathologically confirmed patients with complete data of retropharyngeal lymph node metastasis were investigated. The included patients were divided into N1a and N1b groups. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses. Results This retrospective cohort study examined 759 patients: 70 who were stage N1a and 689 who were stage N1b. Before PSM, N1a group was associated with similar 5-year OS (77.7% vs. 72.4%; P = 0.15) and CSS (85.6% vs. 79.9%; P = 0.09) compared to N1b group. After PSM, a similar OS (75.0% vs. 60.7%; P = 0.12) was found between the radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy groups. However, N1a group showed a better 5-year CSS (83.8% vs. 71.1%; P = 0.04) compared to N1b group. Stage N1b was an independent risk prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio = 2.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.02–6.34; P = 0.04). Conclusions OS was not different between N1a and N1b groups.

https://openalex.org/W3170746952,"The literature on the timeliness of childhood vaccination (i.e. vaccination at the earliest appropriate age) in low-and middle-income countries has important measurement and methodological issues that may limit their usefulness and cross comparison. We aim to conduct a comprehensive scoping review to map the existing literature with a key focus on how the literature on vaccination timeliness has evolved, how it has been defined or measured, and what determinants have been explored in the period spanning the last four decades. This scoping review protocol was developed based on the guidance for scoping reviews from the Joanna Briggs Institute. We will include English and French language peer-reviewed publications and grey literature on the timeliness of routine childhood vaccination in low-and middle-income countries published between January 1978 through to 2021. A three-step search strategy that involves an initial search of two databases to refine the keywords, a full search of all included electronic databases, and screening of references of previous studies for relevant articles missing from our full search will be employed. The search will be conducted in five electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL and Web of Science. Google search will also be conducted to identify relevant grey literature on vaccination timeliness. All retrieved titles from the search will be imported into Endnote X9.3.3 (Clarivate Analytics) and deduplicated. Two reviewers will screen the titles, abstracts and full texts of publications for eligibility using Rayyan-the web based application for screening articles for systematic reviews. Using a tailored data extraction template, we will extract relevant information from eligible studies. The study team will analyse the extracted data using descriptive statistical methods and thematic analysis. The results will be presented using tables, while charts and maps will be used to aid the visualisation of the key findings and themes. The proposed review will generate evidence on key methodological gaps in the literature on timeliness of childhood vaccination. Such evidence would shape the direction of future research, and assist immunisation programme managers and country-level stakeholders to address the needs of their national immunisation system."

However, N. gonorrhoeae responds so uniquely to growth conditions that it cannot be assumed gonorrhea will respond to common microbiological methods used for other pathogenic organisms. In this paper, we explore visual colorimetric indicators of N. gonorrhoeae growth that can be seen without a microscope or spectrophotometer. We evaluate growth media, pH indicators, resazurin-based dyes, and tetrazolium-based dyes for their use in simple colorimetric system. Overall, we identified Graver Wade media as the best at supporting robust gonococcal growth while also providing the least background when analyzing results of colorimetric tests. XTT, a tetrazolium-based dye, proved to show to brightest color change over time and not negatively impact the natural growth of N. gonorrhoeae. However, other dyes including PrestoBlue, MTT, and NBT are less expensive than XTT and work well when added after bacterial growth has already occurred. By identifying the specific use cases of these dyes, this research lays the groundwork for future development of a color-based antibiotic susceptibility low-cost test for N. gonorrhoeae."

Many researchers have pointed out the thermal effects of treatments such as infrared saunas, which are known to increase blood flow. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with gradual decreases in brain blood flow and resulting dementia. In this study, we attempted to clarify the beneficial effects of far infrared light using the 5xFAD mouse, a transgenic model of AD. We exposed 5xFAD mice to far infrared light for 5 months. Among the far infrared-exposed AD mice, body weights were significantly decreased, and the levels of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein were significantly increased in selected brain areas (compared to those in non-irradiated AD mice). However, cognition and motor function (as assessed by Morris water maze and Rota Rod tests, respectively) did not differ significantly between the irradiated and non-irradiated AD mouse groups. These results indicated that exposure to far infrared light may have beneficial biological effects in AD mice. However, the experimental schedule and methods may need to be modified to obtain clearer results."
https://openalex.org/W3172994224,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a global zoonotic disease that has detrimental economic impacts worldwide. The NOS2A gene plays a key role in immunological control of many infectious diseases. However, research on the association between NOS2A polymorphisms and bTB infection in Holstein cattle reared on the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau of China is scarce. This study investigated a possible linkage between NOS2A polymorphisms and risk of developing bTB in Chinese Holstein cattle. The NOS2A gene was genotyped in 144 bTB-infected Holstein cows and 139 healthy controls were genotyped through nucleotide sequencing. Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, six of which were associated with susceptibility/resistance patterns of bTB. Furthermore, the C/T genotypes of 671 and 2793, and T/T genotype of E22 (+15) were significantly associated with susceptibility risk; the G/A genotype of 2857, T/T genotype of E9 (+65), and C/C genotype of E9 (+114) probably increased resistance to bTB. In addition, the haplotypes of NOS2A-2 and NOS2A-9 were risk factors for bTB susceptibility, while the NOS2A-5 and NOS2A-8 haplotypes were contributing protective variants against tuberculosis. There is a significant association between variation in SNPs of NOS2A and tuberculosis susceptibility/resistance pattern. These findings suggest that substitution of genetic selection would be helpful for eradicating bTB. However, further investigation is required to study the underlying mechanism through which NOS2A polymorphisms affect bTB infection."
https://openalex.org/W3173001774,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved energy sensor. Activation of AMPK leads to a number of metabolic benefits, including improved mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle and lowering of serum glucose levels in type-2 diabetes models. However, direct activation of AMPK leads to cardiac enlargement, and an alternative strategy that activates AMPK without affecting the heart is needed. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which is poorly expressed in the human heart, activates AMPK in other tissues. In a screen to identify novel PDE4 inhibitors, we discovered compound CBU91, which is 5-10 fold more potent than rolipram, the best characterized PDE4 inhibitor. CBU91, like rolipram, is able to activate AMPK and Sirt1 and increase mitochondrial function in myotubes. These findings suggest that activation of AMPK in myotubes is a general property of PDE4 inhibition and that PDE4 inhibition may activate AMPK in metabolically relevant tissues without affecting the heart."

https://openalex.org/W3168279678,"In this paper, the heat transfer characteristics of the forced air quenching with non-isothermal and non-uniform oxidation are investigated. By introducing the variations of interfacial temperature and oxygen partial pressure, a three-layered non-isothermal high-temperature oxidation kinetic model is developed, in which a discrete-time modeling method is employed to solve the problem of integration of the transient terms, and a special interfacial grid treatment is used for considering the growth of each oxide layer and updating of the thermal properties. Moreover, a parameter identification method using the multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed for the inverse solution of the oxidation parabolic parameters based on the measured scale thicknesses in oxidation experiment. A case study of the forced air quenching of a Q235 disk is presented to validate the availability of the developed formulas. Then the interfacial heat transfer characteristics are analyzed, while the numerical solutions with and without oxidation are both performed for in-depth comparison. Results indicate that the active quenching region is mainly centralized in the vicinity of stagnation region. The radial variation regularity of the temperature difference across the total oxide layer is mainly determined by the thermal conductivity and the scale thickness. The existence of the oxide scale actually produces a certain thermal resistance during the quenching process and the effects of the oxide scale increases with the radial coordinate due to the interfacial temperature distribution. The results obtained can provide theoretical derivation for precise control of the internal phase transformation during the forced air quenching process."
https://openalex.org/W3170920881,"Understanding the anti-carbohydrate antibody response toward epitopes expressed on porcine cells, tissues, and organs is critical to advancing xenotransplantation toward clinical application. In this study, we determined IgM and IgG antibody specificities and relative concentrations in five cynomolgus monkeys at baseline and at intervals following intraportal xenotransplantation of adult porcine islets. This study utilized a carbohydrate antigen microarray that comprised more than 400 glycoconjugates, including historically reported α-Gal and non-α-Gal carbohydrate antigens with various modifications. The elicited anti-carbohydrate antibody responses were predominantly IgM compared to IgG in 4 out of 5 monkeys. Patterns of elicited antibody responses greater than 1.5 difference (log2 base units; 2.8-fold on a linear scale) from pre-serum to post-serum sampling specific for carbohydrate antigens were heterogeneous and recipient-specific. Increases in the elicited antibody response to α-Gal, Sda, GM2 antigens, or Lexis X antigen were found in individual monkeys. The novel carbohydrate structures Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1 and N-linked glycans with Manα1-6(GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-3)Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ structure were common targets of elicited IgM antibodies. These results provide important insights into the carbohydrate epitopes that elicit antibodies following pig-to-monkey islet xenotransplantation and reveal possible targets for gene editing."
https://openalex.org/W3171269048,"While the localization of radiological sources has traditionally been handled with statistical algorithms, such a task can be augmented with advanced machine learning methodologies. The combination of deep and reinforcement learning has provided learning-based navigation to autonomous, single-detector, mobile systems. However, these approaches lacked the capacity to terminate a surveying/search task without outside influence of an operator or perfect knowledge of source location (defeating the purpose of such a system). Two stopping criteria are investigated in this work for a machine learning navigated system: one based upon Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) strategies commonly used in source localization, and a second providing the navigational machine learning network with a ""stop search"" action. A convolutional neural network was trained via reinforcement learning in a 10 m × 10 m simulated environment to navigate a randomly placed detector-agent to a randomly placed source of varied strength (stopping with perfect knowledge during training). The network agent could move in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) after taking a 1 s count measurement at the current location. During testing, the stopping criteria for this navigational algorithm was based upon a Bayesian likelihood estimation technique of source presence, updating this likelihood after each step, and terminating once the confidence of the source being in a single location exceeded 0.9. A second network was trained and tested with similar architecture as the previous but which contained a fifth action: for self-stopping. The accuracy and speed of localization with set detector and source initializations were compared over 50 trials of MLE-Bayesian approach and 1000 trials of the CNN with self-stopping. The statistical stopping condition yielded a median localization error of ~1.41 m and median localization speed of 12 steps. The machine learning stopping condition yielded a median localization error of 0 m and median localization speed of 17 steps. This work demonstrated two stopping criteria available to a machine learning guided, source localization system."
https://openalex.org/W3168034090,"Marye Anne Fox, a leading force in the development of organic photochemistry, died on 9 May at the age of 73. Fox conducted groundbreaking research with applications in renewable energy and environmental chemistry, and she was a gifted university administrator and national leader. A pioneering woman in a male-dominated field, Fox freely gave advice to early-career women about how to become successful chemists while balancing both career and family. She was an outstanding educator who taught chemistry at all levels from middle school to graduate school, and she was an effective advocate for broadening inclusion in chemistry education and beyond.

Born in Canton, Ohio, on 9 December 1947, Fox was inspired by Sputnik to pursue a career as a scientist. She received her BS in chemistry from Notre Dame College in Ohio in 1969, her MS degree in chemistry from Cleveland State University in 1970, and her PhD in chemistry in 1974 from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. In 1976, Fox joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin as the first female assistant professor and rose through the ranks; she was named to her first endowed chair in 1986 and was appointed as the first vice president for research in 1994. She then served as chancellor at both North Carolina State University and University of California San Diego (UCSD) before her retirement in 2012.

Fox made fundamental discoveries related to the mechanisms of chemical reactions that were initiated by light absorption or the application of electric fields. She built a career that went beyond the traditional bounds of condensed-phase organic chemistry to enable applications in biological and materials chemistry. A hallmark of her research was a desire to understand and exploit the chemistry of electronically excited states and charge transfer processes in molecules and molecular assemblies. She is credited with the origination of organic photoelectrochemistry, a technique that can purify organic-contaminated materials by exploiting wide bandgap semiconductor substrates to control the initiation of oxidative reactions. Fox aimed to address the grand challenge of efficient solar energy conversion, and her work on photocells that produce both electrical current and hydrogen gas achieved that goal by facilitating the development of clean energy sources.

Moving into ever-larger systems while maintaining a focus on mechanisms, Fox's laboratory gained insights into the role that electron–hole pair formation plays in conductivity at semiconductor–liquid interfaces in a variety of materials. This work yielded a panoply of tools for influencing interfacial electron transfer over long distances. The contributions made by Fox and her co-workers will have a lasting impact on these important fields.



In addition to being a distinguished researcher and administrator, Fox was a gifted teacher and mentor. She was a certified secondary school chemistry and mathematics teacher in Ohio, and her teaching experiences in a disadvantaged school in East Cleveland shaped her understanding of education, the effort required for classroom instruction, and the principle that communicating clear expectations for strong student performance was essential. In her academic career, she supervised the graduate research of more than 75 students and many postdocs, and she coauthored a widely adopted textbook on organic chemistry that focused on the mechanistic approach, the hallmark of her own research program.

As the scientific impact of her research grew, Fox was increasingly called on to serve a broader mission. As vice president for research at the University of Texas at Austin, she supported the creation of new interdisciplinary institutes and improved technology transfer. As the 12th chancellor of North Carolina State University, she promoted the expansion of research, the educational mission, and the commercialization of intellectual property for the benefit of society. A science teaching laboratory building on that campus is now named in her honor.

In 2004, Fox became the first woman to serve as permanent chancellor of UCSD. We met while I was serving as chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. I found her to be an inspiring role model who persevered through challenging times with vision and a steady hand. She had a calm demeanor that lent itself well to engagement, and she was a gifted administrative leader. She led the university during an era of extraordinary campus growth while dealing with unprecedented financial challenges. She used her position to make UCSD one of the greenest campuses in the nation and to combat racism on campus. She engaged in dialogue with student leaders and empowered the campus community to address difficult issues. By instituting systemic changes in leadership with a focus on improving the campus climate, she paved the way for the establishment of a vice chancellor for equity, diversity, and inclusion to promote sustained progress. She also championed programs to support outreach to underrepresented communities in the broader San Diego region.

Fox served as an adviser to Governor George W. Bush of Texas and later served the nation on the National Science Board and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. She was elected, in 1994, to both the US National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and, in 1996, to the American Philosophical Society. In 2010, she was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Barack Obama, the highest honor bestowed by the United States on a scientist.

Fox was a scientific pioneer in physical organic chemistry, an exceptional educator, and a gifted academic leader. She was motivated by a desire to discover and build, and thereby leave the world a better place. She was a role model for aspiring young scientists, especially women. Her efforts were fruitful, and the discipline of chemistry, institutions of higher education she served, and society overall continue to benefit immensely from her contributions."
https://openalex.org/W3168724860,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a fatal stroke caused by bleeding in the brain. SAH can be caused by a ruptured aneurysm or head injury. One-third of patients will survive and recover. One-third will survive with disability; one-third will die. The focus of treatment is to stop bleeding, restore normal blood flow, and prevent vasospasm. Treatment for SAH varies, depending on the bleeding's underlying cause and the extent of damage to the brain. Treatment may include lifesaving measures, symptom relief, repair of the bleeding vessel, and complication prevention. However, the useful diagnostic biomarkers of SAH are still limited due to the instability of gene marker expression. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new protocol pairing genes and screened significant gene pairs based on the feature selection algorithm. A classifier was constructed with the selected gene pairs and achieved a high performance."
