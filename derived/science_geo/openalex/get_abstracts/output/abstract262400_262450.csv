https://openalex.org/W2043383780,"Molecular recognition by proteins is fundamental to almost every biological process, particularly the protein associations underlying cellular signal transduction. Understanding the basis for protein-protein interactions requires the full characterization of the thermodynamics of their association. Historically it has been virtually impossible to experimentally estimate changes in protein conformational entropy, a potentially important component of the free energy of protein association. However, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamics of proteins. Here we employ changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for corresponding changes in conformational entropy. We find that the change in internal dynamics of the protein calmodulin varies significantly on binding a variety of target domains. Surprisingly, the apparent change in the corresponding conformational entropy is linearly related to the change in the overall binding entropy. This indicates that changes in protein conformational entropy can contribute significantly to the free energy of protein-ligand association."

At the time of diagnosis, Gleason score provides the gold standard for assessing the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. However, the recent discovery of TMPRSS2 fusions to the ERG gene in prostate cancer raises the possibility of using alterations at the ERG locus as additional mechanism-based prognostic indicators. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were used to assess ERG gene status in a cohort of 445 prostate cancers from patients who had been conservatively managed. The FISH assays detected separation of 5′ (labelled green) and 3′ (labelled red) ERG sequences, which is a consequence of the TMPRSS2–ERG fusion, and additionally identify interstitial deletion of genomic sequences between the tandemly located TMPRSS2 and ERG gene sequences on chromosome 21. Cancers lacking ERG alterations exhibited favourable cause-specific survival (90% survival at 8 years). We identify a novel category of prostate cancers, characterized by duplication of the fusion of TMPRSS2 to ERG sequences together with interstitial deletion of sequences 5′ to ERG (called ‘2+Edel’), which by comparison exhibited extremely poor cause-specific survival (hazard ratio=6.10, 95% confidence ratio=3.33–11.15, P<0.001, 25% survival at 8 years). In multivariate analysis, ‘2+Edel’ provided significant prognostic information (P=0.003) in addition to that provided by Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis. Other individual categories of ERG alteration were associated with intermediate or good prognosis. We conclude that determination of ERG gene status, including duplication of the fusion of TMPRSS2 to ERG sequences in 2+Edel, allows stratification of prostate cancer into distinct survival categories."

https://openalex.org/W2060410804,"Pseudomonas syringae, the cause of bacterial speck disease in tomatoes, injects an array of effector molecules into the host cell in order to secure its infection. One of them, AvrPtoB, has now been found to target the host kinase Fen, part of a highly conserved plant immunity pathway. To do this, AvrPtoB employs E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which promotes protein degradation, and must have been acquired by this bacterial pathogen at some stage in evolution for this purpose. Pseudomonas syringae translocates many effectors into the plant host cell on infection, one of which is AvrPtoB. This E3 ubiquitin ligase has now been demonstrated to specifically modulate the host kinase Fen, which is involved in plant resistance. Many bacterial pathogens of plants and animals use a type III secretion system to deliver diverse virulence-associated ‘effector’ proteins into the host cell1. The mechanisms by which these effectors act are mostly unknown; however, they often promote disease by suppressing host immunity2. One type III effector, AvrPtoB, expressed by the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, has a carboxy-terminal domain that is an E3 ubiquitin ligase3. Deletion of this domain allows an amino-terminal region of AvrPtoB (AvrPtoB1–387) to be detected by certain tomato varieties leading to immunity-associated programmed cell death4. Here we show that a host kinase, Fen, physically interacts with AvrPtoB1–387 and is responsible for activating the plant immune response. The AvrPtoB E3 ligase specifically ubiquitinates Fen and promotes its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. This degradation leads to disease susceptibility in Fen-expressing tomato lines. Various wild species of tomato were found to exhibit immunity in response to AvrPtoB1–387 and not to full-length AvrPtoB. Thus, by acquiring an E3 ligase domain, AvrPtoB has thwarted a highly conserved host resistance mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2153733894,"The activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor transduces growth signals through signal transduction pathways to the nucleus, leading to the expression of genes involved in growth and malignant transformation in many cell types. We have previously shown that overexpression of a dominant negative form of the cJun proto-oncogene, a cJun dominant negative mutant (Tam67), blocks AP-1 transcriptional activity, induces a G(1) cell cycle block and inhibits breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We found that AP-1 blockade by Tam67 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells downregulates cyclin D1 transcriptional activity by at least two mechanisms: by suppressing transcription at the known AP-1 binding site (-934/-928) and by suppressing growth factor-induced expression through suppressing E2F activation at the E2F-responsive site (-726/-719). AP-1 blockade also led to reduced expression of E2F1 and E2F2, but not E2F4, at the mRNA and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and supershift assays demonstrated that AP-1 blockade caused decreased binding of E2F1 protein to the E2F site in the cyclin D1 promoter. We also found that Tam67 suppressed the expression of the E2F1 dimerizing partner, DP1 and E2F-upregulated cell cycle genes (cyclins E, A, B and D3) and enhanced the expression of E2F-downregulated cell cycle genes (cyclins G(2) and I). Reduced expression of other E2F-regulated genes was also seen with AP-1 blockade and E2F suppression. Thus, the AP-1 factor regulates the expression of cyclin D and E2F (the latter in turn regulates E2F-downstream genes), leading to cell cycle progression and breast cancer cell proliferation."

Recent in vivo mouse models suggest this signaling network plays an essential role in bone metabolism. Using a coculture system containing bone marrow macrophage and osteoblastic cells, here we report that EGF-like ligands stimulate osteoclastogenesis by acting on osteoblastic cells. This stimulation is not a direct effect because osteoclasts do not express functional EGF receptors (EGFRs). Further studies reveal that EGF-like ligands strongly regulate the expression of two secreted osteoclast regulatory factors in osteoblasts by decreasing osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression and increasing monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) expression in an EGFR-dependent manner and consequently stimulate TRAP-positive osteoclast formation. Addition of exogenous OPG completely inhibited osteoclast formation stimulated by EGF-like ligands, while addition of a neutralizing antibody against MCP-1 exhibited partial inhibition. Coculture with bone metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells had similar effects on the expression of OPG and MCP1 in the osteoblastic cells, and those effects could be partially abolished by the EGFR inhibitor PD153035.

The adult human skeleton continuously undergoes remodeling, namely, being resorbed by osteoclasts and renewed by osteoblasts. The maintenance of the skeleton requires the coordinated activity and constant generation of these cells. Osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stromal stem cells and, along with their precursors, are the major sources for regulating osteoclast formation by producing several cytokines, including receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), 2The abbreviations used are:RANKLreceptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligandEGFepidermalgrowthfactorHB-EGFheparinbinding-EGFEGFREGF receptorOPGosteoprotegerinM-CSFmacrophage colony-stimulating factorMCP1monocyte chemoattractant protein 1PI 3-kinasephosphoinositide 3-kinasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBMMbone marrow macrophagesTGFtransforming growth factorTRAPtartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 2The abbreviations used are:RANKLreceptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligandEGFepidermalgrowthfactorHB-EGFheparinbinding-EGFEGFREGF receptorOPGosteoprotegerinM-CSFmacrophage colony-stimulating factorMCP1monocyte chemoattractant protein 1PI 3-kinasephosphoinositide 3-kinasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBMMbone marrow macrophagesTGFtransforming growth factorTRAPtartrate-resistant acid phosphatase osteoprotegerin (OPG), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).

Recently, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), a CC chemokine, was shown to have the ability to induce tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated osteoclastic cells and to stimulate osteoclast fusion and activity (5Kim M.S.

This network modulates cell functions in a variety of ways, including proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. There are four distinct receptors in this family: EGF receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB-1/HER1), ErbB-2 (HER2), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4). The EGF-like ligands consist of EGF, amphiregulin, and transforming growth factor α (TGFα), which only bind to the EGFR, and heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), betacellulin, and epiregulin, which can bind to both the EGFR and ErbB4. The EGFR is a receptor-tyrosine kinase. Upon ligand binding, it undergoes dimerization and phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in its intracellular domain, thus activating several important cellular signal transduction pathways, such as Ras-Raf-MAP-kinase, PI3-kinase-Akt, and PLCγ-PKC pathways etc (reviewed in Ref. 8Yarden Y. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: S3-S8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling contributes to bone metabolism by affecting both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Although most EGFR-null mice die within the first postnatal week, surviving animals display craniofacial alterations and cleft palate (9Miettinen P.J. Chin J.R. Shum L. Slavkin H.C. Shuler C.F.

Overexpression of EGF-like ligands in mouse, such as betacellulin, EGF, and TGFα, all resulted in stunted growth (10Sandgren E.P. Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Lee D.C. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38693-38698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mice humanized for the EGFR (the endogenous mouse EGFR gene was replaced by human EGFR cDNA) exhibit low EGFR activity in bone and display accelerated osteoblast differentiation (13Sibilia M. Wagner B. Hoebertz A. Elliott C. Marino S. Jochum W. Wagner E.F. Development. 2003; 130: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have shown that amphiregulin-null mice displayed significantly less tibial trabecular bone than wild-type mice (14Qin L. Tamasi J. Raggatt L. Li X. Feyen J.H. Lee D.C. DiciccoBloom E.

Consistent with these in vivo results, in vitro cell culture experiments suggest that EGF and amphiregulin stimulate proliferation of preosteoblastic cells but inhibit their further differentiation into osteoblastic cells (14Qin L.

Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Beside these effects on osteoblasts, EGF and TGFα have the ability to strongly stimulate bone resorption in cultured fetal rat long bones, newborn mouse calvarial cultures, and long term human marrow culture (18Lorenzo J.A. Quinton J. Sousa S. Raisz L.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi N. MacDonald B.R. Hon J. Winkler M.E. Derynck R. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D.

S. A. 1986; 83: 2228-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), suggesting these growth factors participate in regulating osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. A recent study of neonatal EGFR-null mice revealed that EGFR deficiency causes delayed primary ossification of the cartilage anlage and delayed osteoclast and osteoblast recruitment. Further studies have suggested that primary osteoclastic cultures express the EGFR (21Wang K. Yamamoto H. Chin J.R. Werb Z. Vu T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53848-53856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of how EGF-like ligands stimulate bone resorption is still largely unknown. Bone is the preferred metastasis site for many cancer cells, such as breast, lung, and prostate cancers, etc. The metastasized tumors result in osteolytic lesions, osteoblastic lesions, or both. In all cases, especially in osteolytic lesions, the osteoclast formation and activity are greatly stimulated by tumor invasion. The prevailing view is that PTH-related protein (PTHrP), secreted by tumor cells, plays a major role in this process by acting on osteoblasts in bone to increase the expression of RANKL (reviewed in Ref. 22Kozlow W. Guise T.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2005; 10: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The EGFR family plays indispensable roles in the pathogenesis of many human carcinomas. Many studies suggest that the majority of cancers express at least one, or in many cases coexpress, several EGF-like ligands. The autocrine loop consisting of tumor-derived EGF-like ligands and their overexpressed receptors on tumor cells are essential for tumor growth and progression (reviewed in Ref. 23Normanno N. Bianco C. Strizzi L. Mancino M. Maiello M.R. De Luca A. Caponigro F. Salomon D.S. Curr. Drug Targets. 2005; 6: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It raises the question of whether bone-metastasized tumors utilize EGF-like ligands to facilitate bone destruction by osteoclasts. Here we report that EGF-like ligands strongly stimulate osteoclast formation in the coculture of osteoblastic cells and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), the precursors for osteoclasts, by regulating the expression of OPG and MCP-1 in osteoblastic cells. Because coculture with bone metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells had similar effects on the expression of OPG and MCP1 in the osteoblastic cells, and those effects could be partially abolished by EGFR inhibitor, we reason that EGF-like ligands, similar to PTHrP secreted by tumors cells, may contribute to osteolytic lesions in bone metastases. Chemicals—Recombinant human EGF, TGFα, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, heregulin were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PD153035 was obtained from Calbiochem. Murine secreted RANKL (sRANKL), M-CSF, human OPG, and neutralizing antibody against mouse MCP-1 were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human PTHrP and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against RANKL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), EGFR, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were used for immunoblotting experiments. Cell Culture—MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 cells (24Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 25Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) were maintained in growth medium (αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 100 international units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). For experiments, MC3T3 cells were seeded in either growth medium or osteoblast differentiation medium (growth medium with 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid) at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2. Media were changed every 2 days. To obtain primary osteoclastic cultures, bone marrow cells were flushed out from femora and tibiae of a 1–2-month-old mouse, plated in coculture medium (αMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine) in a 100-mm dish, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight. The next day, the nonadherent cells were pelleted and seeded at a density of 200,000 cells/cm2. These cells are considered as BMM, the osteoclast precursors, and cultured in the presence of sRANKL (30 ng/ml) and M-CSF (30 ng/ml) for 5 days with a medium change at day 3 to obtain mature osteoclasts. In the presence of M-CSF but not RANKL, these cells became preosteoclastic cells, which would further differentiate into mature osteoclastic cells after addition of RANKL. To obtain primary bone marrow osteoblastic cultures, bone marrow cells were flushed out from femora and tibiae of 1–2-month-old mice and plated at a density of 300,000 cells/cm2 in growth medium. Media were changed to differentiation medium on day 5 and every 2–3 days afterward. For coculture experiments of MC3T3 cells and osteoclasts, MC3T3 cells were seeded on day 0 in coculture medium plus 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid. On day 2, freshly isolated BMMs were seeded on top of MC3T3 cells with addition of sRANKL (30 ng/ml) to promote osteoclast formation. Media were changed 3 days later, and cells were either harvested for RNA or stained to detect TRAP-positive osteoclastic cells on day 7. For coculture experiments of primary osteoblastic cells and osteoclasts, primary osteoblastic cells were cultured as described above. On day 12, BMMs were seeded on top of primary osteoblastic cells along with sRANKL (10 ng/ml). TRAP staining was performed 2 and 4 days later with one medium change on day 14. Breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was obtained from ATCC and maintained in coculture medium. To coculture MC3T3, MDA-MB-231, and BMM cells, MC3T3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at the same density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in coculture medium at day 0. Two days later, freshly isolated BMMs were seeded in the same well in the presence of sRANKL (30 ng/ml). TRAP staining was performed on day 7 with a medium change at day 5. The animal protocol was approved by Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. TRAP Staining—The osteoclast preparations were stained for TRAP activity using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit from Sigma. Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA from cell cultures was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma). TaqMan® Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to reverse-transcribe mRNA into cDNA. Following this, PCR was performed on Opticon (MJ Research) using a SYBR® Green PCR Core kit (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for the RT-PCR are summarized in the supplemental Table S1. Mouse β-actin was used as an internal control for mouse genes. In the coculture experiments of MC3T3 and MDA-MB-231 cells in the same well, mouse ATF4 was used as an internal control because its primers only detect the mouse gene and not the human homolog, and ATF4 expression was not regulated by EGF-like ligands (data not shown). EGF Ligand Binding and Autoradiography—Cells were cultured in 24-well plates and incubated with 0.8 μl/well mouse 125I-EGF (80–120 μCi/μg, 50 μCi/ml, GE Healthcare) with or without 250-fold cold EGF in αMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 0.5 m NaOH and counted in a gamma counter (1282 CompuGamma CS, LKB Wallac). Alternatively, cells were cultured in 4-well chamber slides. After 125I-EGF binding as described above, slides were fixed, dried, and dipped into NTB emulsion solution (Eastman Kodak Company). After 6 weeks of exposure, slides were developed to view the silver grains and counterstained with cresyl violet. Mineral Dissolution Assay—Mouse BMMs were plated onto 16-well BD BioCoat™ Osteologic™ Discs (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) seeded at a density of 200,000 cells/cm2 in coculture medium plus sRANKL (30 ng/ml) and M-CSF (30 ng/ml). Two days later, media were changed to 50% fresh coculture medium and 50% conditioned medium from either control or EGF-treated MC3T3 cells for 4 days plus sRANKL. Similar medium changes were performed every 2 days until day 8 for quantitation of resorption areas using SPOT Advanced software under microscopy. ELISA—The OPG and TGFα protein levels in media were determined using the mouse OPG Quantikine ELISA kit and human TGFα Quantikine ELISA kit from R&D Systems. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as means ± S.E. of triplicate measurements with all experiments being repeated at least three times. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Student's t test (Microsoft Excel 2002). EGF-like Ligands Stimulate Osteoclastogenesis in Cocultures of Osteoblastic Cells and BMMs—To study the ability of osteoblasts to support osteoclast formation, we cocultured mouse BMMs with differentiating MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 cells. MC3T3 is a preosteoblastic cell line, which undergoes osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of l-ascorbic acid. However, there were almost no TRAP-positive osteoclastic cells formed in the coculture system even in the presence of exogenous RANKL (Fig. 1A, left panel). Interestingly, addition of EGF-like ligands, such as EGF, TGFα, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin, strongly stimulated formation of TRAP-positive osteoclastic cells in this coculture system (Fig. 1A, right four panels). Real-time RT-PCR experiments further demonstrated that there were about 28-fold and 39-fold increases in TRAP mRNA expression levels in the EGF and TGFα-treated cocultures, respectively (Fig. 1B). To further confirm this phenomenon, we repeated this coculture experiment using mouse primary bone marrow osteoblastic cells instead of MC3T3 cells. In our hands, it takes about 2–3 weeks for the primary bone marrow osteoblastic cells to form bone nodules as shown by von Kossa staining and to abundantly express osteoblastic markers, such as osteocalcin, integrin-binding bone sialoprotein, and alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). In this experiment, the primary osteoblastic cells were treated with or without TGFα from day 5, and BMMs were added into the culture at day 12. Fig. 1, C and D show that there were significantly more TRAP-positive osteoclastic cells formed in the TGFα-treated coculture system than in the control coculture 2 or 4 days later. Other EGF-like ligands exhibited similar effects (data not shown). The above results clearly indicate a dramatic increase in osteoclastogenesis in the osteoblast-osteoclast coculture system when EGF-like ligands are present. Note that exogenous RANKL is indispensable for this phenomenon because both MC3T3 cells (Fig. 5B) and primary osteoblastic cells (data not shown) express very low levels of endogenous RANKL and those levels are not sufficient to support osteoclast formation. EGF-like Ligands Do Not Have Direct Effects on Osteoclastic Cells—The effects of EGF-like ligands on the osteoblast and osteoclast coculture could be caused by two possibilities: 1) EGF-like ligands have direct effects on osteoclastic cells, or 2) these peptides have indirect effects on osteoclastic cells by acting through osteoblastic cells. To investigate the first possibility, we studied whether osteoclastic cells express functional EGF binding sites. A previous report suggested that primary osteoclastic cells express EGFR mRNA (21Wang K. Yamamoto H. Chin J.R. Werb Z. Vu T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53848-53856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our RT-PCR analyses with either bone marrow primary osteoclastic cells or RAW264.7 cells, a preosteoclast cell line, also indicated the existence of EGFR mRNA albeit at low abundance (data not shown). However, EGFR protein cannot be detected by Western blot (Fig. 2D, last lane). To further clarify it, we used radioisotope-labeled ligand binding experiments to detect the existence of functional EGFR in osteoclasts. When cells were incubated with 125I-EGF ligand, we found no strong binding in RAW264.7 cells, primary preosteoclastic cells (obtained by culturing BMMs with M-CSF), or primary mature osteoclastic cells (obtained by culturing BMMs with both M-CSF and RANKL) (Fig. 2A). In addition, the presence of 250-fold unlabeled EGF did not further decrease the 125I-EGF binding with the above cells, suggesting the binding observed with these cells is most likely due to nonspecific binding. ROS17/2.8 cells, an EGFR-deficient osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line, were used as a negative control. In contrast, 125I-EGF bound strongly to Saos2 cells, an EGFR-positive osteoblastic cell line, and this binding was dramatically decreased by 250-fold unlabeled EGF. To further confirm that osteoclasts lack functional EGF binding sites, we performed 125I-EGF ligand binding experiments with cells cultured on chamber slides. After exposing cells to emulsion for 6 weeks, we observed abundant silver grains, indicators of 125I-EGF binding, in the Saos2 cells, but few or no silver grains over either RAW264.7 or mature osteoclastic cells (Fig. 2B). In summary, the above results demonstrate that both pre- and mature osteoclastic cells exhibit very low levels of EGF binding sites, namely, EGFRs. Our further experiments showed that EGF-like ligand treatment had no effects on osteoclast formation (supplemental Fig. S1A) or osteoclast-specific gene expression, such as TRAP, NFAT2, and cathepsin K (supplemental Fig. S1B). Therefore, it seems unlikely that EGF-like ligands have direct effects on osteoclasts. In contrast, EGFR was readily detectable in MC3T3 cells at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D). MC3T3 cells also strongly bound 125I-EGF, and this was specific because it was completely inhibited by addition of excess cold EGF (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, while real-time RT-PCR and Western blot experiments indicated that EGFR expression decreases in differentiating MC3T3 cells, binding assays suggest that differentiating cells bind comparable amounts of 125I-EGF as the proliferating cells do. Note that this result does not indicate that differentiating and proliferating MC3T3 cells express a similar number of EGFR per cell because Scatchard analyses are needed to calculate receptor number but it is very difficult to count cell numbers of differentiating osteoblasts due to abundant extracellular matrix in the culture. One possibility for why osteoclasts do not bind 125I-EGF while MC3T3 cells do, is that osteoclasts might express much more EGF-like ligands and therefore have already saturated their EGFR sites. However, real-time RT-PCR showed both osteoclasts and MC3T3 cells express low and comparable amounts of EGF-like ligands (supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that MC3T3 cells, but not osteoclasts, express functional EGFR and therefore EGF-like ligands must have indirect effects on osteoclastic cells by acting through osteoblastic cells. The existence of functional EGFR in osteoblasts has been well documented in osteoblastic cell lines, such as UMR 106-01, primary osteoblastic cell cultures (26Ng K.W. Partridge N.C. Niall M. Martin T.J. Calcif, Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and in vivo osteoblasts using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (27Davideau J.L. Sahlberg C. Thesleff I. Berdal A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 32: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). EGF-like Ligands Regulate the Expression of Secreted Osteoclast Regulatory Factors in Osteoblastic Cells—To study how EGF-like ligands regulate osteoclast formation indirectly, conditioned media were collected from either control or EGF-treated MC3T3 cells after 4 days of differentiation and were used to culture mouse BMMs for 5 days with one medium change on day 3. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, multinucleated osteoclasts formed in control-treated conditioned medium were generally small and had less than 30 nuclei per cell. In contrast, osteoclasts formed in EGF-treated MC3T3-conditioned medium were much larger and many of them had more than 30 nuclei per cell. Mineral dissolution assay further indicates that osteoclasts cultured with EGF-treated conditioned medium resorbed about 5-fold more mineralized surface on osteologic discs than that cultured in control-treated conditioned medium (Fig. 3, C and D). Note that exogenous RANKL was required in this experiment because MC3T3 cells do not express sufficient RANKL and most RANKL molecules exist in a transmembrane form. This result clearly indicates that EGF regulates expression of certain secreted factor(s) in MC3T3 cells, and those factors have the ability to regulate osteoclastogenesis. EGF-like Ligands Decrease OPG Expression and Increase MCP1 Expression but Have No Effect on RANKL Expression in Osteoblastic Cells—Many secreted factors are known to influence osteoclast formation, such as OPG, M-CSF, MCP1, and IL-6, etc. Next we studied whether EGF treatment regulates expression of those genes in MC3T3 cells. Using real-time RT-PCR, we measured the mRNA levels of OPG during MC3T3 cell differentiation in the absence or in the presence of EGF treatment. Addition of l-ascorbic acid strongly stimulates osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3 cells and bone nodules are normally abundant in the culture after 8 days. Interestingly, we found differentiating MC3T3 cells expressed much more OPG mRNA than non-differentiating MC3T3, and EGF treatment completely abolished this increase. As shown in Fig. 4A, MC3T3 cells cultured in growth medium expressed similar levels of OPG during the 8 days of culture. In contrast, MC3T3 cells cultured in differentiation medium (growth medium plus l-ascorbic"

https://openalex.org/W2033438402,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is overexpressed at sites of wound repair and in most adenocarcinomas including prostate cancer. In stromal tissues, TGF-β regulates cell proliferation, phenotype and matrix synthesis. To address mechanisms of TGF-β action in cancer-associated reactive stroma, we developed prostate stromal cells null for TGF-β receptor II (TβRII) or engineered to express a dominant-negative Smad3 to attenuate TGF-β signaling. The differential reactive stroma (DRS) xenograft model was used to evaluate altered stromal TGF-β signaling on LNCaP tumor progression. LNCaP xenograft tumors constructed with TβRII null or dominant-negative Smad3 stromal cells exhibited a significant reduction in mass and microvessel density relative to controls. Additionally, decreased cellular fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) immunostaining was associated with attenuated TGF-β signaling in stroma. In vitro, TGF-β stimulated stromal FGF-2 expression and release. However, stromal cells with attenuated TGF-β signaling were refractory to TGF-β-stimulated FGF-2 expression and release. Re-expression of FGF-2 in these stromal cells in DRS xenografts resulted in restored tumor mass and microvessel density. In summary, these data show that TGF-β signaling in reactive stroma is angiogenic and tumor promoting and that this effect is mediated in part through a TβRII/Smad3-dependent upregulation of FGF-2 expression and release."
https://openalex.org/W2057107990,"Necl-5 is an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like molecule that was originally identified as a poliovirus receptor and is often upregulated in cancer cells. We recently found that it colocalizes with integrin αvβ3 at the leading edges of moving cells and enhances growth factor-induced cell movement and proliferation. Upon cell–cell contact, Necl-5 is removed from the cell surface by its trans-interaction with the cell adhesion molecule nectin-3, resulting in reduced cell movement and proliferation. Here, we investigated the role of Necl-5 in the interaction of cancer cells with platelets. Necl-5 was upregulated in CT26 cells, a colon adenocarcinoma cell line. When CT26 cells were injected into the tail vein of mice, they were arrested in the pulmonary vessels by adhering to platelets and subsequently metastasized to the lungs. Overexpression of Necl-5 in CT26 cells enhanced this metastasis, while inhibition of the trans-interaction of Necl-5 with CD226 by an anti-Necl-5 monoclonal antibody reduced the metastasis. Depletion of platelets by treatment with a rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum reduced the Necl-5-enhanced metastasis in mice. Thus, the trans-interaction of upregulated Necl-5 in cancer cells with its counter-receptor in platelets, probably CD226, is critical for efficient metastasis of cancer cells to the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W1967893697,"Apoptosis resistance is crucially involved in cancer development and progression, represents the leading cause for failure of anticancer therapy and is caused, for example, by downregulation of proapoptotic intracellular signaling molecules such as caspase-8. We found that the cytotoxic drugs methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were both able to sensitize resistant tumor cells for induction of apoptosis by p53-mediated upregulation of caspase-8. Increase in caspase-8 messenger RNA and protein expression disabled tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced proliferation and restored sensitivity toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis which was inhibited by transfection of p53 decoy oligonucleotides, p53 shRNA and caspase-8 shRNA. Upregulation of caspase-8 and sensitization toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis was found both in a broad panel of tumor cell lines with downregulated caspase-8 and in TRAIL-resistant primary tumor cells of children with acute leukemia. Taken together, we have identified caspase-8 as an important p53 target gene regulated by cytotoxic drugs. These findings highlight a new drug-induced modulation of physiological apoptosis pathways, which may be involved in successful anticancer therapy using MTX and 5-FU in leukemia and solid tumors over decades."
https://openalex.org/W2166979779,"Hypoxia or hypoxia mimetic has been shown to induce differentiation together with the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein of myeloid leukemic cells and normal hematopoietic progenitors. To provide direct evidence for the role of HIF-1α in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell differentiation and its mechanisms, we generated myeloid leukemic U937T transformants, in which HIF-1α was tightly induced by tetracycline withdrawal. The results showed that the conditional HIF-1α induction triggered granulocytic differentiation of these transformants, while the suppression of HIF-1α expression by specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) effectively inhibited hypoxia-induced differentiation of U937 cells, as evidenced by morphology, maturation-related antigens as well as expressions of myeloid differentiation signatures and hematopoietic cells-specific cytokine receptors. The specific shRNAs-inhibited expression of HIF-1β, an essential partner for transcription activity of HIF-1, failed, while the inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation-critical CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) significantly eliminated HIF-1α-mediated myeloid leukemic cell differentiation. Collectively, this work provided several lines of direct evidence for the role of HIF-1α protein through its nontranscriptional activity in myeloid cell differentiation, in which C/EBPα elicits a role as an effector downstream to HIF-1α. These discoveries would shed new insights for understanding mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis and designing the new therapeutic strategy for differentiation induction of AML."
https://openalex.org/W2014534172,"Cells respond to DNA damage in a complex way and the fate of damaged cells depends on the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic signals. This is of crucial importance in cancer as genotoxic stress is implied both in oncogenesis and in classical tumor therapies. p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD), initially described as a p53-inducible gene, is one of the molecular switches able to activate a survival or apoptotic program. Two isoforms of PIDD, PIDD (isoform 1) and LRDD (isoform 2), have already been reported and we describe here a third isoform. These three isoforms are differentially expressed in tissues and cell lines. Genotoxic stress only affects PIDD isoform 3 mRNA levels, whereas isoforms 1 and 2 mRNA levels remain unchanged. All isoforms are capable of activating nuclear factor-kappaB in response to genotoxic stress, but only isoform 1 interacts with RIP-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain and activates caspase-2. Isoform 2 counteracts the pro-apoptotic function of isoform 1, whereas isoform 3 enhances it. Thus, the differential splicing of PIDD mRNA leads to the formation of at least three proteins with antagonizing/agonizing functions, thereby regulating cell fate in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2015536907,"Docetaxel is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents against cancer; nevertheless, some patients develop resistance. Unfortunately, their causes and mechanisms remain unknown. We created docetaxel-resistant DRHEp2 from human laryngeal cancer HEp2 and investigated the roles of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) on docetaxel resistance. DRHEp2 had greatly increased mtDNA content. Reduction of mtDNA content in DRHEp2 by ethidium bromide treatment reduced the resistance. These results indicate the possible roles of mtDNA-coded enzymes in mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) in resistant mechanisms. Oligomycin A, an Fo-ATPase inhibitor, eliminated docetaxel resistance in DRHEp2; in contrast, inhibitors of other MRC did not. RNA interference targeted to Fo-ATPase d-subunit restored docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity to DRHEp2. These results indicate the roles of Fo-ATPase for resistant mechanisms. Docetaxel induced ROS generation in HEp2 but not in DRHEp2 and antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate eliminated docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting roles of ROS in docetaxel-induced cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of Fo-ATPase by Oligomycin A induced docetaxel-mediated ROS generation in DRHEp2. Taken together, DRHEp2 acquired docetaxel resistance through increasing Fo-ATPase, which led to diminish docetaxel-induced ROS generation and subsequently inhibited cell death. In conclusion, mtDNA plays an important role in developing docetaxel resistance through the reduction of ROS generation by regulating Fo-ATPase."

The current understanding of membrane-bound desaturases is based on mutant studies, biochemical topology analysis, and the comparison of related enzymes with divergent functionality. Because structural information is lacking, the principles of membrane-bound desaturase specificity are still not understood despite of substantial research efforts. Here we compare two membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases from Aspergillus nidulans: a strictly monofunctional oleoyl-Δ12 desaturase and a processive bifunctional oleoyl-Δ12/linoleoyl-ω3 desaturase. The high similarities in the primary sequences of the enzymes provide an ideal starting point for the systematic analysis of factors determining substrate specificity and bifunctionality. Based on the most current topology models, both desaturases were divided into nine domains, and the domains of the monofunctional Δ12 desaturase were systematically exchanged for their respective corresponding matches of the bifunctional sister enzyme. Catalytic capacities of hybrid enzymes were tested by heterologous expression in yeast, followed by biochemical characterization of the resulting fatty acid patterns. The individual exchange of two domains of a length of 18 or 49 amino acids each resulted in bifunctional Δ12/ω3 activity of the previously monofunctional parental enzyme. Sufficient determinants of fatty acid desaturase substrate specificity and bifunctionality could, thus, be narrowed down to a membrane-peripheral region close to the catalytic site defined by conserved histidine-rich motifs in the topology model.

Sufficient determinants of fatty acid desaturase substrate specificity and bifunctionality could, thus, be narrowed down to a membrane-peripheral region close to the catalytic site defined by conserved histidine-rich motifs in the topology model. Metabolic processes are often controlled by the presence of highly specific enzymes. An interesting model to study enzyme specificity is a fatty acid desaturase, which introduces double bonds at specific positions into acyl chains (1Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Desaturase enzymes differ in substrate- and regioselectivity (2Heinz E. Lipid Metabolism in Plants.in: Moore Jr., T.S. CRC Press, London1993: 33-89Google Scholar). The strict substrate- and regiospecificities are of physiological relevance, because the major mechanism controlling the biophysical properties of a membrane, aside from changing its overall lipid class composition, is the modification of acyl chain length, position, and number of the double bonds in glycerolipids (3Somerville C. Browse J. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology of Plants.in: Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L.

Fatty acid desaturases may also control the acyl composition of seed storage lipids, which is of considerable economic interest.

However, the majority of desaturase enzymes reside within membranes, and up to now the principles of membrane-bound desaturase specificity are not understood. Moreover, structural information on membrane-bound desaturases is limited, so only hydropathy and topology analyses are available, predicting the formation of four transmembrane domains and either one or two membrane-peripheral protein domains (7Diaz A.R.

Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Depending on the enzyme studied, introduction of a double bond can occur counting carbons from the carboxyl end or from the methyl terminus of the acyl chain. Other enzymes may use a pre-existing double bond as a reference point for subsequent desaturation (2Heinz E. Lipid Metabolism in Plants.in: Moore Jr., T.S. CRC Press, London1993: 33-89Google Scholar). Also the carbon chain length (2Heinz E. Lipid Metabolism in Plants.in: Moore Jr., T.S. CRC Press, London1993: 33-89Google Scholar) or the specific lipid head group of the glycerolipid to which the substrate fatty acid is esterified can be distinguished (13Heilmann I. Pidkowich M.S. Girke T. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One conceivable model how changes in regiospecificity may have developed in evolution is by gene duplication and random accumulation of mutations in the catalytic portion of the enzymes to produce first a broader and then a different specificity (10Sperling P. Ternes P. Zank T.K. Heinz E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2003; 68: 73-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Shanklin J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Changes to an enzyme regiospecificity typically require between two and six specific alterations at key locations along the amino acid chain (6Guy J.E. Whittle E. Kumaran D. Lindqvist Y. Shanklin J.

According to the described model the first step toward a new specificity of an enzyme is the accumulation of mutations in the corresponding gene, which result in decreased enzyme specificity and lead to broader substrate acceptance and/or formation of multiple products (12Shanklin J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The simplest case of multi-functionality is represented by bifunctional enzymes.

The determinants of altered desaturase specificity may be identified by the comparison of a strictly specific monofunctional to a bifunctional enzyme. Here we compare the specific An2 oleoyl-Δ12 desaturase (19Damude H.G. Zhang H. Farrall L. Ripp K.G. Tomb J-F. Hollerbach D. Yadav N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heterologous expression of the Δ12/ω3 desaturase gene in yeast and in Arabidopsis seeds demonstrated its broad ω6 substrate specificity and especially its bifunctionality, similar to that of reported bifunctional enzymes (19Damude H.G.

By using a domain-swapping approach between the genes for the two enzymes, domains responsible for the broadened substrate specificity and altered regioselectivity were identified and reside in a small membrane-peripheral region in close proximity to the active site.

Isolation and Cloning of Desaturase Genes—Total RNAs were extracted from mycelia obtained from vegetative growth or sexual development using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (MBI Fermentas). The desaturase genes An2 (GenBank™ accession no. XP_658641) and An1 (GenBank™ accession no. XP_664808) were isolated by PCR amplification using the Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and a standard PCR protocol (2 min at 94 °C, 10 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, followed by 15 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C; and a terminal extension step of 5 min at 72 °C) with primers 5′-GAA TTCATGGCTGCAACTGCAACAACCC-3′ (An2.forward)/5′-GGCGGCCGCCTATTCCGCTTTGGCACCCTTC-3′ (An2. reverse), and (An1.forward) 5′-GAA TTC ATG GCC TCG GAT GCG GGC AAG-3′/(An1.reverse) 5′-GGCGGCCGCTTAGTTAGGCTTGGTCAGCTTAATG-3′, respectively, introducing EcoRI sites upstream of the start codons and NotI sites downstream of the stop codons. The ORFs were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and moved as EcoRI/NotI fragments into the yeast expression vector pESC-HIS (Stratagene), yielding pESC-An2 and pESC-An1. Preparation of Δ12- and Δ12/ω3 Desaturase Constructs—The ORFs of An2 and An1 desaturases were modified using the Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and a standard PCR protocol (see above) with primers: 5′-GGGAATTCGCTATGGCCTCGGATGCGGGCAAG-3′(An2for)/5′-GTCACTCGAGGTTAGGCTTGGTCAGCTT-3′ (An2rev) and (An1for) 5′-GGGAATTCGCTATGGCTGCAACTGCAACAACC-3′/(An1rev) 5′-GTCACTCGAGTTCCGCTTTGGCACCCTTCTT-3′, respectively, introducing EcoRI sites upstream of the start codons (in boldface) and removing the stop codons, respectively, introducing XhoI sites downstream of the terminal triplets. The ORFs were cloned into the amplification plasmid pGEM-T (Promega) and moved as EcoRI/XhoI fragments into the yeast expression vector pYES2/CT (Invitrogen) in-frame with the sequence encoding a C-terminal V5-tag, yielding pYES2/CT-An2 and pYES2/CT-An1. Cloning and Vector Construction for Production of Transgenic Arabidopsis Plants—The cDNA ORF of AnΔ12/ω3 was moved as an EcoRI/NotI-fragment into the Gateway Entry vector pUC18-Entry (22Hornung E. Krueger C. Pernstich C. Gipmans M. Porzel A. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1738: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The insert was introduced by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) into the binary plasmid pCAMBIA modified for resistance to ammonium glufosinate and seed-specific expression using the USP promoter (22Hornung E. Krueger C. Pernstich C. Gipmans M. Porzel A. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1738: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The construct was transformed into chemically competent Agrobacteria (strain EH105), and introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia by floral dipping (23Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T3-seeds were collected from individual T2 plants resistant to ammonium glufosinate and analyzed individually by GC. Engineering Hybrid Genes—According to results from hydropathy analysis, the desaturases An2 and An1 were divided into nine domains, A1–I1, and A2–I2, respectively (see Fig. 2, A and B), that were systematically exchanged between the two desaturase proteins to delineate determinants of enzymatic specificity. Domain swap constructs between An2 and An1 were generated by overlap extension PCR (24Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). In a first step, domains A1–I1 were amplified individually from an An1 cDNA template with overlapping ends using primers specified in Table 1. Similarly, domains A2–I2 were amplified from An2 cDNA (see Table 1). cDNAs encoding the respective truncated acceptor desaturase domains were amplified from An2 and An1 cDNA using primers also listed in Table 1. Amplifications were carried out with Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and a protocol of 2 min at 94 °C, 10 cycles of 15 sat 94 °C, 30 s at 68 °C, 70 s at 72 °C, followed by 20 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 70 °C, and 70 s at 72 °C; and a terminal extension step of 7 min at 72 °C. Amplicons were fused in a subsequent PCR reaction, using primers An2for/An2rev and An1for/An1rev, respectively, and the protocol specified for the first step, generating the hybrid gene constructs of the An2- and An1 desaturases indicated in Table 1. The hybrid genes were cloned into the amplification plasmid pGEM-T (Promega) and moved as EcoRI/XhoI fragments into the yeast expression vector pYES2/CT (Invitrogen) in-frame with the sequence encoding a C-terminal V5 tag.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used to construct hybrid genes of A. nidulans bifunctional Δ12/ω3-desaturases (An1) and monofunctional Δ12 (An2) fatty acid desaturasesPrimerSequenceBifunctional Δ12/ω3-Desaturase, An1An1for5′-GGGAATTCGCTATGGCTGCAACTGCAACAACC-3′An21rev5′-GCGAGATCACGGAAGACGTAGGCAGAGGAAA-3′An1B1for5′-TCAGGAGTCTGTCCTATGTCGTCCGCGATCTCC-3′An1B1rev5′-TGAGCAAGAACCCAAATGATTCCGGTGCC-3′An1C1for5′-GGTCTGTTCGGTACCGGTATCTGGATCCTC-3′An1C1rev5′-GATCCAGCCAACAGTGTCGTTCCACGTTTG-3′An1D1for5′-ACTTCCAAGGTGCTCAACGATGTCGTCGGA-3′An1D1rev5′-CTTGCCGTGAGAGATCTTCCAGCTGAAA-3′An1E1for5′-GTCCCCTATTTCTCGTGGAAGATCACGCA-3′An1E1rev5′-CAGGATGGAGTGGGTGGCGACGGGCGTGTCCTC-3′An1F1for5′-GAGACCCCCTTGGCCACTTACAACCTTATTAGCCTA-3′An1F1rev5′-TGTCGTGACCGGTAACGTTACAGAGATACATCTG-3′An1G1for5′-CCCTTGTACCTGCTCACCTTTTACGTTAGCGCC-3′An1G1rev5′-GGCGGTGATGGCGAGGCCCGAAATCGCAATCAG-3′An1H1for5′-TCATCATTCTGAGTGATATCGACCTGGGGTTGCTG-3′An1H1rev5′-GCTGGTAGTGGGGGGAGAGTGGGGTGTGTGTGG-3′An1I1for5′-GCCATCACCTACCTCCAGCACACACACCCCT-3′An1rev5′-GTCACTCGAGTTCCGCTTTGGCACCCTTCTT-3′Monofunctional Δ12-Desaturase, An2An2for5′-GGGAATTCGCTATGGCCTCGGATGCGGGCAAG-3′An2A2rev5′-GGAGATCGCGGACGACATAGGACAGACTCCTGA-3′An2B2for5′-TTTCCTCTGCCTACGTCTTCCGTGATCTCGC-3′An2B2rev5′-GAGGATCCAGATACCGGTACCGAACAGCCA-3′An2C2for5′-GGCACCGGAATCATTTGGGTTCTTGCTCA-3′An2C2rev5′-TCCGACCACATCGTTGAGCACCTTGGAAGT-3′An2D2for5′-CAAACGTGGAACGACACTGTTGGCTGGATC-3′An2D2rev5′-TGCGTGATCTTCCACGAGAAATAGGGGAC-3′An2E2for5′-TTTCAGCTGGAAGATCTCTCACGGCAAG-3′An2E2rev5′-GCTAATAAGGTTGTAAGTGGCCAAGGGGGTCTC-3′An2F2for5′-GAGGACACGCCCGTCGCCACCCACTCCATCCTG-3′An2F2rev5′-GGCGCTAACGTAAAAGGTGAGCAGGTACAAGGG-3′An2G2for5′-CAGATGTATCTCTGTAACGTTACCGGTCACGACA-3′An2G2rev5′-CAGCAACCCCAGGTCGATATCACTCAGATTCATGA-3′An2H2for5′-CTGATTGCGATTTCGGGCCTCGCCATCACCGCC-3′An2H2rev5′-AGGGGTGTGTGTGCTGGAGGTAGGTGATGGC-3′An2I2for5′-CCACACACACCCCACTCTCCCCCCACTACCAGC-3′An2rev5′-GTCACTCGAGGTTAGGCTTGGTCAGCTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—Transformation, selection, and growth of transgenic yeast cells were performed as described (25Hornung E. Korfei M. Pernstich C. Struss A. Kindl H. Fulda M. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1686: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of desaturases was induced by supplementing galactose (2%) to the media. If fatty acids were added (at a concentration of 0.02% (w/v)), the media was additionally supplemented with Igepal CA 630 (Nonidet P-40′) from Fluka (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v). Cultures were maintained at 16 °C for 10 days with shaking (140 rpm) to A600 densities of 10–20. Lipid analysis of transgenic yeast cells was performed after harvesting and lyophilization of 100-ml cultures supplemented with linoleic acid or without additional fatty acids. Absolute fatty acid accumulation varied with expression levels between experiments and with different expression vectors (data not shown) and, therefore, specific enzyme activities cannot be directly compared, allowing only for qualitative evaluation of altered enzyme specificities. Growth conditions of chimeric enzymes: Expression cultures were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium lacking uracil, but containing 2% (w/v) galactose. When these cultures had reached an OD600 of 0.5–0.8, they were transferred to room temperature (23–25 °C). After 96 h at 23–25 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min, and pellets were washed once with sterile doubled-distilled H2O before being used for fatty acid analysis. The host strain transformed with the empty vector was used as a negative control in all experiments. Total and Esterified Fatty Acid Analysis—For the analysis of esterified fatty acids, 25 ml of sedimented and lyophilized yeast cultures were homogenized in derivatization solution. Fatty acids were transesterified with sodium methoxide in methanol or methanol/toluol solution (26Hornung E. Pernstich C. Feussner I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were then analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. For the determination and verification of the position of double bond positions in fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters were converted into their 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives as described (27Christie W.W. Lipids. 1998; 33: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and analyzed mass spectrometrically according to Ref. 27Christie W.W. Lipids. 1998; 33: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, using the 6890 Gas Chromatograph/5973 Mass Selective Detector system (Agilent). For the analysis of total fatty acids, FAMEs were prepared from sedimented cell pellets by direct transmethylation with methanol containing 2% (v/v) dimethoxypropane and 2.75% (v/v) of sulfuric acid. After 1 h at 80 °C, 0.2 ml of 5 m NaCl was added, and FAMEs were extracted with 2 ml of hexane. Lipid Analysis and Positional Analysis—Extraction and separation of phospholipids by TLC were performed as described (25Hornung E. Korfei M. Pernstich C. Struss A. Kindl H. Fulda M. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1686: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After extraction of the phospholipids from the silica matrix 1/10 of each sample was transesterified with sodium methoxide and analyzed by GC. In the rest of the sample, the positional distribution of fatty acids was determined by dissolving the phospholipids in 900 μl of Tris-buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2; 0.2% v/v Triton 100; 50 mm boric acid) by sonication. 100 units of Rhizopus arrhizus lipase (Fluka) were added, and the digestion conducted for 2 h at 37 °C. 100 μl of acetic acid was added to stop the reaction, and the aqueous phase was extracted with chloroform and methanol (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The resulting organic phase was dried under nitrogen stream and dissolved in 800 μl of methanol. 400 μl of each sample was transesterified with sodium methoxide to convert lysophospholipids to FAMEs. 6.5 μl of trimethylsilyldiazomethane was added to the rest of each sample to convert free fatty acids into their corresponding methyl esters, shaken for 30 min at room temperature, and 0.2 μl of acetic acid was added to degrade remaining trimethylsilyldiazomethane. Samples were dried under nitrogen stream. The resulting FAMEs were dissolved in acetonitrile and analyzed by GC. GC analysis was performed with an Agilent GC 6890 system coupled with an FID detector equipped with a capillary HP INNOWAX column (30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.5 μm coating thickness; Agilent, Germany). Helium was used as a carrier gas (1 ml min–1). Samples were injected at 220 °C. The temperature gradient was 150 °C for 1 min, 150–200 °C at 15 °C min–1, 200–250 °C at 2 °C min–1, and 250 °C for 10 min. Fatty acids were identified according to authentic standards. GC/MS analysis was carried out using an Agilent 5973 Network mass selective detector connected to an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary DB-23 column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25-μm coating thickness; J&W Scientific, Agilent. Helium was used as a carrier gas (1 ml min–1). Samples were injected at 220 °C. The temperature gradient was 150 °C for 1 min, 150-200 °C at 4 °C min–1, 200–250 °C at 5 °C min–1, and 250 °C for 10 min. The detector was set to an electron energy of 70 eV, an ion source temperature of 230 °C, and a transfer line temperature of 260 °C. Identification of Genes Encoding A. nidulans Membrane-bound Desaturases—To characterize and identify new desaturases from fungi, we searched the A. nidulans genome sequence (29Galagan J.E. Calvo S.E.

Nature. 2005; 438: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) databases with known query desaturase sequences from plants. Two sequences with similarity to known plant desaturases were identified. The genomic sequence information was used to design primers to amplify putative fatty acid desaturases from cDNA prepared from A. nidulans cultures in vegetative and sexual growth states. Two cDNA fragments were successfully amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The resulting deduced full ORF of the first sequence, An2 (GenBank™ accession no. XP_658641), encodes a polypeptide of 426 amino acids and is largely identical with the annotated gene odeA (GenBank™ accession no. AF262955) with the exception of six additional encoded amino acids at the C terminus of An2. The gene odeA has been suggested to encode a fatty acid Δ12 desaturase according to knock-out studies in A. nidulans (21Calvo A.M. Gardner H.W. Keller N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25766-25774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The second sequence identified, An1 (GenBank™ accession no. XP_664808) encodes a polypeptide of 394 amino acids. Sequencing of the cloned cDNA fragments for An1 revealed An1 to be longer than the predicted and published sequence from the genome data base because of insertion of eight amino acids following amino acid position 13. The longer sequence has been delineated before and associated with a putative fatty acid ω3-desaturase in a patent (30Ursin V.M. Voelker T. Froman B. PCT WO 03/099216 A2. 2003; Google Scholar). Classification of An2 and An1 Sequences in the Phylogenetic System—Pairs of Δ12 desaturase-like proteins similar to that found in A. nidulans have been reported from several fungal species, and the relationship between these fungal enzymes has led Damude et al. (19Damude H.G. Zhang H. Farrall L. Ripp K.G. Tomb J-F. Hollerbach D. Yadav N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The polypeptides deduced from the An2 and An1 cDNA sequences share 45% identity. The deduced An2 protein is most similar to representatives of the group of monofunctional desaturases (19Damude H.G. Zhang H. Farrall L. Ripp K.G. Tomb J-F. Hollerbach D. Yadav N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9446-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), with the highest degree of similarity to the putative Δ12 desaturase from Neurospora crassa (GenBank™ accession no. XP_959528, 70% identity), followed by the putative Δ12 desaturases from M. grisea (GenBank™ accession no. XP_365283, 69% identity) and from F. moniliforme (GenBank™ accession no. ABB88515, 63% identity). Similarity of the deduced An2 protein toward bifunctional enzymes from the species mentioned above is around 45% identity. The situation for the deduced An1 protein from A. nidulans is reversed in that with ∼60% identity in all cases, the An1 sequence is most similar to representatives of the bifunctional desaturase group (19Damude H.G.

https://openalex.org/W1993272638,"Neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation in prostate cancer (CaP) has been reported to be an early marker associated with the development of androgen independence. The mechanisms by which CaP acquires NE properties are poorly understood. In this study, a putative role of adrenomedullin (AM) in the NE differentiation was investigated. The expression of AM and AM receptors (calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR)/receptor activity modifying protein-2 and -3 (RAMP2 and RAMP3) was evaluated after experimental manipulation of androgen status. Levels of AM mRNA and immunoreactive AM (ir-AM) increased four- to sevenfold in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells after androgen withdrawal in vitro and in LNCaP xenografts in animals after castration. Treatment of LNCaP cells with androgen analogue (dihydrotestosterone; 10(-9) M) prevented the increase in AM mRNA and ir-AM levels. Interestingly, the expression of CRLR, RAMP2 and RAMP3 is not regulated by androgen status. We demonstrate that in the presence of serum, AM is able to induce an NE phenotype in LNCaP cells via CRLR/RAMP2 and RAMP3, which includes extension of neuritic processes and expression of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE), producing cGMP in a dose-dependent manner, which is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. 8-Bromo-cGMP mimicked the effects of AM on cell differentiation. We demonstrate that AM induces a G-kinase Ialpha translocation to the nucleus. The protein kinase G inhibitor KT-5823 inhibited the neurite outgrowth induced by both AM and 8-bromo-cGMP. In noncastrated animals, administration of AM enhanced expression of NSE and chromogranin A in LNCaP xenografts with a significant increase of NSE levels in serum and no changes in tumor growth. In castrated animals, intraperitoneal injection of AM resulted in a 240+/-18% (P<0.001) increase in tumor volume 36 days after treatment, indicating that the nature of effect of AM in CaP depends on the presence or absence of endogenous androgen. Together, these results demonstrate that AM may function as a mediator of NE-like differentiation in culture as well as in vivo and indicate that its production may be important for tumor resurgence following androgen ablation."
https://openalex.org/W2036931417,"Wnt signaling follows canonical and non-canonical pathways to regulate a variety of processes during cellular homeostasis and development. The large T-antigen (T-Ag) of the human neurotropic JC virus, has been shown to modulate the Wnt-signaling pathway via interaction with β-catenin, one of the most important components of the canonical Wnt pathway. Here, we have identified an alternative non-canonical pathway that allows T-Ag to recruit Rac1 for stabilizing β-catenin by inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. We demonstrate that inhibition of Rac1 by its dominant negative mutant, RacN17, abrogates T-Ag-mediated stabilization of β-catenin yet exhibits no impact on the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Results from immunocytochemistry revealed that together with T-Ag, a pool of β-catenin appears at the cell surface, particularly at the membrane ruffles where active Rac1 is positioned. Interestingly, cooperativity between T-Ag and β-catenin leads to activation of Rac1, which in turn, stimulates its association with β-catenin. These observations unravel the interplay between β-catenin and Rac1 that is initiated by T-Ag and results in stabilization of β-catenin and its presence in cell membrane ruffles."
https://openalex.org/W2037164834,"Since p63-deficient mice display severe defects in formation of epidermis, p63 has been considered to be a multi-isoform p53 family member essential for epidermal development. However, it is still unclear how p63 could contribute to keratinocyte differentiation. In the present study, we have found that TAp63α is induced in association with the upregulation and a secretion of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) during the keratinocyte differentiation of HaCaT cells bearing p53 mutation. Short interference RNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous TAp63 resulted in a remarkable reduction of GDF15. Luciferase reporter assay and reverse transcription–PCR analysis demonstrated that enforced expression of TAp63α significantly increases the luciferase activity driven by GDF15 promoter and the expression of GDF15. Consistent with these results, the proximal p53/p63-binding site within the GDF15 promoter region was required for the TAp63α-mediated transcriptional activation of GDF15, and TAp63α was recruited onto this site. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous GDF15 permitted cell growth and inhibited the expression of the differentiation markers such as keratin 10 and involucrin in response to differentiation stimuli. Taken together, our present results provide a novel insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms behind TAp63α-mediated keratinocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1967001743,"One of the most common origins of multidrug resistance occurs via the overproduction of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. These ABC transporters then act as broad specificity drug pumps and efflux a wide range of toxic agents out of the cell. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits multiple or pleiotropic drug resistance (Pdr) often through the over-production of a plasma membrane-localized ABC transporter protein called Pdr5p. Expression of the PDR5 gene is controlled by two zinc cluster-containing transcription factors called Pdr1p and Pdr3p. Cells that lack their mitochondrial genome (ρ0 cells) strongly induce PDR5 transcription in a Pdr3p-dependent fashion. To identify proteins associated with Pdr3p that might act to regulate this factor, a tandem affinity purification (TAP) moiety was fused to Pdr3p, and this recombinant protein was purified from yeast cells. The cytosolic Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1p co-purified with TAP-Pdr3p. Overexpression of Ssa1p repressed expression of PDR5 but had no effect on expression of other genes involved in the Pdr phenotype. This Ssa1p-mediated repression required the presence of Pdr3p and did not influence Pdr1p-dependent gene expression. Loss of the nucleotide exchange factor Fes1p mimicked Ssa1p-mediated repression of PDR5. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Ssa1p was associated with Pdr3p but not Pdr1p in yeast cells. Finally, ρ0 cells had less Ssa1p bound to Pdr3p than ρ+ cells, consistent with Ssa1p-mediated repression of Pdr3p activity serving as a key regulatory step in control of multidrug resistance in yeast.

The same similarities to mammalian cells that have made yeast a powerful model eukaryotic organism restrict the ability to design antifungal drugs without also impacting the health of the animal host. This has led to a limited repertoire of antifungal drugs and makes the development of drug-resistant fungi a special burden on chemotherapy of infections by these organisms. Even more serious is the acquisition of fungi with a multidrug resistance phenotype that can permit tolerance to many antifungal agents with a single genetic change (reviewed in Ref. 1Sanglard D.

Genetic experiments indicate that these mutant transcription factors behave as dominant, hyperactive forms of the regulatory proteins. Pdr1p and Pdr3p share partially over-lapping function and control expression of their target genes by binding to a sequence element referred to as the Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE) (11Katzmann D.J.

The PDR3 gene itself is also controlled by two PDREs in its promoter and involves an autoregulatory loop (13Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The relative ease of isolation of these hyperactive transcription factors led to the suggestion that both Pdr1p and Pdr3p are subject to negative regulation under normal laboratory conditions, with this negative input eliminated in these mutants (9Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Poch O. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 184: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In an effort to find negative regulators of Pdr5p, it was observed that mutants lacking their mitochondrial genome (ρ0 cells) exhibited a striking induction of PDR5 transcription and drug resistance (15Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Traven A. Wong J.M. Xu D. Sopta M. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4020-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the elevation in Pdr5p expression and subsequent increased drug resistance was dependent on Pdr3p but not Pdr1p (15Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of an Hsp70 protein called Ssz1p (formerly Pdr13p) induced PDR5 transcription but in a manner dependent only on Pdr1p (17Hallstrom T.C. Katzmann D.J. Torres R.J. Sharp W.J. MoyeRowley W.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Even though Pdr1p and Pdr3p share 36% sequence identity and similar domain organizations, these factors respond to different regulatory inputs. The mitochondrial regulation of Pdr3p function represents the first physiological context in which the Pdr pathway is activated. Analyses of the expression of Pdr3p demonstrate that levels of this protein are maintained at an extremely low level in ρ+ cells (18Zhang X. Kolaczkowska A. Devaux F. Panwar S.L. Hallstrom T.C. Jacq C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2759-2770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PDR3 transcription is strongly induced in ρ0 mutants, and this autoregulation is required for normal development of multidrug resistance in these cells. Previous data suggest that Pdr3p is regulated post-translationally in ρ0 cells to acquire a higher activity state (15Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47844-47852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In an effort to find regulators of Pdr3p, we took a biochemical approach in which a tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Pdr3p was used to facilitate purification of this factor and associated proteins. We found that the Hsp70 Ssa1p co-purified with TAP-Pdr3p. Various genetic and biochemical studies revealed that Pdr3p was under negative regulation by this Hsp70 protein. Importantly, Ssa1p-Pdr3p association was reduced in ρ0 cells, consistent with this interaction maintaining Pdr3p in a low activity state in the absence of mitochondrial signaling. These studies argue for an important role of the Hsp70-Pdr3p association in the regulation of multidrug resistance. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Cells were grown in cultures containing YPD (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose) under nonselective conditions or appropriate SC media under selective conditions (20Sherman F. Fink G.

Drug resistance was measured by the spot test assay on plates with either a single concentration of drug or gradient plates (21Katzmann D.J. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol.

TAP-tagged PDR3 Strain Construction—PDR3 was TAP-tagged as described by Puig et al. (27Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid pBS1761 was used to amplify the tag by N-TAP Pdr3 for and rev primer GACAACTGCATCAGCAGTTTTATTAATTTTTTCTTATTGCGTGACCGCAgaacaaaagctggagctcat and TTGACACATGCTGTCGAAACTTTTGATCTAGTTGATTTCTTCACTTTCATcttatcgtcatcatcaagtg, respectively. The amplified ∼2.5-kb fragment was than transformed into in a pdr1Δ background. Transformants were selected on sc media lacking tryptophan and tagging was verified by PCR. Purification of TAP-tagged Pdr3p—Purification of TAP-tagged Pdr3p was modified from Rigaut et al. (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Protein extractions for the strain carrying the TAP-tagged PDR3 allele were performed as described (27Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in rich medium containing galactose as carbon source, so as to induce the GAL-TAP-PDR3 fusion gene. After protein extraction, 500 μl of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-Sepharose (Sigma) was added to 500 mg of total protein in a volume of 25 ml. This slurry was incubated at 4 °C, rotating overnight. After incubation, the resin was washed three times with 50 bead volumes of IPP150 (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once with 50 bead volumes of tobacco etch virus protease cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The IgG-Sepharose was resuspended in 1 ml of tobacco etch virus protease cleavage buffer containing 100 units of tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature, rotating, for 1.5 h. The supernatant was recovered, and added to 3 ml of calmodulin binding buffer (10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), 3 μl of 1 m CaCl2, and 500 μl of calmodulin beads (Stratagene). This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, with rotating. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with 5 bead volumes of calmodulin binding buffer and eluted 5 times with 250 μl of calmodulin elution buffer (10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm magnesium-acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The eluate was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and the pellet was washed two times with ice-cold acetone. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (29Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified at the University of Iowa Molecular Analysis Facility. Polypeptides of interest were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin following the procedure of Shevchenko et al. (30Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7820) Google Scholar). The digested proteins were identified using MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry as described by Kinter et al. (31Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Desiderio D.M. Nibbering N.M.M. Wiley Interscience Series on Mass Spectrometry. 2000: 1-301Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a Bruker Daltonics, Inc. Biflex III mass spectrometer. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from each fraction with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Synthesis of cDNA was performed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). 1 μg of RNA was used as template in each sample with 1× iScript reaction mix and 1 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived reverse transcriptase. The reaction mix was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 85 °C. For the quantitative PCR reaction, primers were designed using the Primer Select program from DNASTAR. Primer concentrations were optimized for each gene and annealing profiles were analyzed to evaluate nonspecific amplification by primer dimers. Control reactions, including RNA instead of cDNA were performed for each gene and condition. The threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined in the logarithmic phase of amplification for all genes, and the average Ct value for each sample was calculated from three replicates. The Ct value of the gene coding for actin (ACT1) was used for normalization of variable cDNA levels, and induction factors were determined for each gene and condition by three independent experiments. Primers used were ACT1For (5′-TTGGCCGGTAGAGATTTGACTGAC-3′) and ACT1Rev (5′-AGCGGTTTGCATTTCTTGTTCG-3′). The samples were prepared by adding to the cDNA 12.5 μl of the reaction mixture, containing 1× iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) and 200 nm of the both forward and reverse oligonucleotides. PDR5 forward (5′-GAATCATTTGGCGGAAGTAGCA-3′) and PDR5 reverse (5′-CCAAAGCGGTAGCGGAATC-3′); or SNQ2 forward (5′-TGCCTGGCTTCTGGACATTC-3′) and SNQ2 reverse (5′-TGAGCCGTTTGGTGGGTTGA-3′). H2O was added to reach the final volume of 15 μl. Each standard sample was prepared in triplicate using serial dilutions starting from 100 ng and ending at 10 ng. The unknown samples were also prepared in triplicate with 50 ng of cDNA and the same reaction mixture as the standard samples. Amplification was carried out in the iCycler apparatus from Bio-Rad, in a two-step process as follows: a denaturation step of 3 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, with annealing and extension at 60 °C for 45 s each. The reporter signals were analyzed using the iCycler iQ software (Bio-Rad). These values can be translated into a quantitative result by constructing a standard curve, with the standard sample values. A melting curve was obtained after completion of the cycles to verify the presence of a single amplicon. The presented RT-PCR results are mean values of at least three independent experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—All immunoprecipitation assays were performed using lysed spheroplasts. In brief, cells growing in log phase were washed with spheroplast solution I (1 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2,30 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm K2HPO4), resuspended in spheroplast solution II (1 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2,30 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.5) containing oxylyticase and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After chilling on ice for 10 min, cell suspensions were overlaid on a sucrose cushion (20 mm HEPES, 1.2 m sucrose, 0.02% sodium azide). Spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a Beckman JA-20 rotor. These spheroplasts were either stored at –80 °C or lysed immediately using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). Glass beads were added to cells suspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, followed by addition of 2 mm EDTA, 200 μm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride. Lysis was performed by shaking cell suspensions on a Tomy shaker at 4 °C. Protein extracts were clarified by centrifuging lysates at 14,000 rpm for 5 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. For immunoprecipitation, washed protein A or G beads were treated with either anti-HA, rabbit anti-Ssa1p (from Elizabeth Craig), or anti-Myc antibody for 2 h. These beads were then mixed with cell lysates and incubated for 4 h. Finally, the beads were washed and immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered by adding 3× Laemmli dye (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% bromphenol blue dye). Immunoprecipitated proteins along with input proteins were then loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Ssa1p, anti-HA, or anti-Myc antibodies. The Hsp70 Protein Ssa1p Co-purifies with Pdr3p—Genetic experiments strongly suggest that Pdr3p is negatively regulated to maintain this factor in a state of low transcriptional activity. First, missense mutations in various regions of Pdr3p or loss of the mitochondrial genome convert this protein into a hyperactive and constitutive positive regulator of expression (8Nourani A. Papajova D. Delahodde A. Jacq C. Subik J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Simonics T. Kozovska Z. Michalkova-Papajova D. Delahodde A. Subik J. Curr.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Second, rapid depletion of the mitochondrial inner membrane chaperone protein Oxa1p accomplished by use of a temperature-sensitive OXA1 allele (19Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47844-47852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) triggers rapid induction of PDR5, in a manner believed to be dependent on Pdr3p. To determine if other proteins might associate with Pdr3p to repress the activity of this transcriptional regulator, we constructed a TAP-tagged (27Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) allele of PDR3. The TAP moiety allows gentle purification measures to be used to help maintain protein-protein interactions and has been successfully utilized to purify rare proteins (28Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Expression levels of Pdr3p are very low (32Mamnun Y.M. Pandjaitan R. Mahe Y. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and to facilitate isolation of the TAP-Pdr3p protein, initial experiments used the GAL promoter to drive this fusion gene. The fusion protein was functional and activated PDR5 expression on galactose-containing medium (data not shown). Cells containing the TAP-tagged PDR3 were grown, induced with galactose, and lysed. Protein extract was purified using the two-step IgG-Sepharose and calmodulin resin affinity steps as described previously (27Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) from a 10-liter culture. Polypeptides co-purifying with the TAP-Pdr3p chimera were recovered and subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry to determine their identity. This mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the Hsp70 protein Ssa1p was found in fractions enriched in TAP-Pdr3p and suggested that these proteins might be associated. An important qualification of this analysis comes from the fact that Ssa1p and Ssa2p are 99% identical (33Craig E.A. Jacobsen K. Cell. 1984; 38: 841-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), so it is probable that both or either of these proteins may associate with Pdr3p. SSA1 and SSA2 differ primarily in their regulation and deletion of both these genes is required to uncover phenotypes dependent on these Hsp70 proteins (34Craig E.A. Jacobsen K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Our analysis will focus on Ssa1p, but it is likely that Ssa2p can also bind and regulate Pdr3p. This point will be considered in the discussion below. To confirm that this association of Ssa1p with Pdr3p has functional relevance, we tested the effect of elevating Ssa1p levels on Pdr3p-dependent drug resistance. Increase in Cycloheximide Sensitivity of Cells Overproducing Ssa1p—To test the contribution of Ssa1p to control of Pdr3p-dependent PDR5 regulation, we overproduced Ssa1p using a high copy number plasmid containing SSA1 in an isogenic series of strains with varying levels of Pdr3p-dependent transactivation. Transformants were grown to mid-log phase, and equal number of cells were spotted on YPD plates containing 0.4 μg/ml 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 75 μm CdSO4, 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide or a gradient of this drug and incubated for 2 days at 30 °C (Fig. 1). Cells lacking their mitochondrial genome (ρ0 cells) exhibit increased cycloheximide resistance in a Pdr3p-dependent fashion (15Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) compared with ρ+ cells. Overproduction of Ssa1p reduced cycloheximide in both the ρ+ and ρ0 strains. When this same analysis was performed in cells lacking Pdr3p, no significant influence of the high copy number SSA1 clone was seen. Note that, in these cells (pdr3Δ), PDR5-dependent transcription and cycloheximide resistance are provided by Pdr1p function (11Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 36Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Conversely, when cells lacking Pdr1p (pdr1Δ) were used, overproduction of Ssa1p led to a large decrement in cycloheximide resistance, because the only factor driving PDR5 expression and cycloheximide resistance was Pdr3p. Repression of the activity of Pdr3p would be expected to cause a reduction to PDR5-dependent phenotypes, and this is the result we observed. Overproduction of Ssa1p had no significant effect on resistance to 4-nitroquinoline, which can arise due to activation of the SNQ2 ABC transporter-encoding gene (a target of Pdr1p and Pdr3p (25Decottignies A.

Cadmium resistance was also unaffected by these genotypic changes (data not shown). These data support the view that overproduction of Ssa1p leads to an inhibition of transcriptional activation driven by Pdr3p. This inhibition does not represent a general effect as resistance to another drug is unaffected. To confirm that the decreased cycloheximide resistance is due to diminution of Pdr3p-mediated activation of PDR5 transcription, we assayed PDR5 expression levels. Overexpression of Ssa1p Leads to Reduced PDR5 Expression in a Pdr3p-dependent Manner—To examine the influence of Ssa1p on Pdr3p transcriptional activation, expression of several different genes known to be Pdr3p-responsive was assessed. Previous work has established that the ABC transporter-encoding genes YOR1 and SNQ2, along with PDR5, are regulated by Pdr3p transcriptional control (reviewe"
https://openalex.org/W2052120397,"Little is known on the role of disulfide bonds in the catalytic domain of serine proteases. The Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond is located between the 190 strand leading to the oxyanion hole and the 220-loop that contributes to the architecture of the primary specificity pocket and the Na+ binding site in allosteric proteases. Removal of this bond in thrombin produces an ∼100-fold loss of activity toward several chromogenic and natural substrates carrying Arg or Lys at P1. Na+ activation is compromised, and no fluorescence change can be detected in response to Na+ binding. A 1.54-Å resolution structure of the C191A/C220A mutant in the free form reveals a conformation similar to the Na+-free slow form of wild type. The lack of disulfide bond exposes the side chain of Asp-189 to solvent, flips the backbone O atom of Gly-219, and generates disorder in portions of the 186 and 220 loops defining the Na+ site. This conformation, featuring perturbation of the Na+ site but with the active site accessible to substrate, offers a possible representation of the recently identified E* form of thrombin. Disorder in the 186 and 220 loops and the flip of Gly-219 are corrected by the active site inhibitor H-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl, as revealed by the 1.8-Å resolution structure of the complex. We conclude that the Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond confers stability to the primary specificity pocket by shielding Asp-189 from the solvent and orients the backbone O atom of Gly-219 for optimal substrate binding. In addition, the disulfide bond stabilizes the 186 and 220 loops that are critical for Na+ binding and activation. Little is known on the role of disulfide bonds in the catalytic domain of serine proteases. The Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond is located between the 190 strand leading to the oxyanion hole and the 220-loop that contributes to the architecture of the primary specificity pocket and the Na+ binding site in allosteric proteases.

Thrombin is a Na+-activated, allosteric serine protease involved in blood clotting (1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and is composed of two polypeptide chains of 36 (A chain) and 259 (B chain) residues covalently linked through the Cys-1–Cys-122 disulfide bond (3Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 4Bode W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2006; 36: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The shorter A chain runs in the back of the B chain that has the typical fold of serine proteases, with two six-stranded β-barrels of similar structure that pack together asymmetrically to accommodate at their interface the residues of the catalytic triad His-57, Asp-102, and Ser-195 (5Di Cera E. Page M.J. Bah A. Bush-Pelc L.A. Garvey L.C. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2007; 9: 1292-1306Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The B chain is stabilized by three disulfide bonds, Cys-42–Cys-58, Cys-168–Cys-182, and Cys-191–Cys-220, that connect contiguous strands shaping the Na+ binding site, the primary specificity pocket, and the active site. These bonds are highly conserved among serine proteases, but the Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond is absent in cathepsins and granzymes. Previous studies using reduction with dithiothreitol have addressed the role of disulfide bonds in the mechanism of thrombin unfolding (6Rajesh Singh R. Chang J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1651: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The role of disulfide bonds in thrombin function and allostery, however, remains unexplored. Indeed, remarkably little is known on the role of conserved disulfide bonds for serine proteases in general (7Kenesi E. Katona G. Szilagyi L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and no structural information on relevant mutants lacking one or more such bonds is currently available. Previous mutagenesis studies on trypsin have addressed the role of the Cys-191–Cys-220 bond and offered conflicting reports. In one case elimination of the disulfide bond with the C191A/C220A mutation was found to be inconsequential on the function, structure, and stability of the enzyme and affected kcat but not Km for the hydrolysis of chromogenic amide substrates (8Wang E.C. Hung S.H. Cahoon M. Hedstrom L. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In another case removal of the disulfide bond with the same C191A/C220A mutation was associated with a loss of catalytic function toward chromogenic amide substrates due mostly to increased Km, with a concomitant slight shift in substrate specificity from trypsin-like to chymotrypsin-like (9Varallyay E. Lengyel Z. Graf L. Szilagyi L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given the similarity of reagents and experimental conditions used in these previous studies, it is difficult to rationalize the origin of the discrepancy or to offer conclusive answers about the role of the Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond. Studies on tissue-type plasminogen activator have shown that the Cys-136–Cys-201 bond, which is not present in Na+-activated allosteric proteases, is inconsequential on function (10Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Cys-1–Cys-122 bond in thrombin was also found to be dispensable for function (11Hageman T.C. Endres G.F. Scheraga H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 171: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12DiBella E.E. Maurer M.C. Scheraga H.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2987-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the possibility exists that the conserved disulfide bonds play a role in the allosteric properties of the enzyme that control its numerous and opposing functions in vivo (19Dang O.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat.

The Cys-42–Cys-58 disulfide bond anchors the catalytic His-57 and may influence the response to Na+ at the level of the active site. The Cys-168–Cys-182 disulfide bond anchors the 170-strand that hosts Thr-172, one of the most important residues linked to Na+ binding (22Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and residues that stabilize the environment of Tyr-225 and part of the Na+ binding pocket. The Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond deserves special attention because it anchors the 220-loop to the 190-strand and ensures communication between the Na+ site and the oxyanion hole (23Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 121: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the bond provides integrity to the primary specificity pocket by shielding Asp-189 from the solvent and burying the RGD sequence of which Asp-189 is a member (24Papaconstantinou M.E. Carrell C.J. Pineda A.O. Bobofchak K.M. Mathews F.S. Flordellis C.S. Maragoudakis M.E. Tsopanoglou N.E. Di Cera E. J. Biol.

Equal volumes of the protein sample and reservoir solution (1 μl) were mixed to prepare the hanging drops.

Activity toward the highly specific substrate FPR drops ∼50-fold in the slow and fast forms due mainly to an increase in Km. Interestingly, the kcat increases relative to wild type especially in the slow form. FPR binding is perturbed in the C191A/C220A mutant, but once docking into the active site is secured, hydrolysis proceeds at a rate that is even faster than in the wild type. The less specific substrate FPK replaces Arg at P1 with Lys (37Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activity toward this substrate is also compromised due to increased Km and reduced binding but without the increase in kcat observed for FPR. Finally, the chymotrypsin-specific substrate FPF, for which thrombin shows considerable activity unlike trypsin (27Bush L.A. Nelson R.W. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7183-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), experiences only a modest drop in kcat/Km in the slow form and a more pronounced drop in the fast form. The limited solubility of this substrate prevents independent assessment of the individual Michaelis-Menten parameters. In all cases, the Na+ effect on substrate hydrolysis is significantly reduced compared with wild type and almost vanishes for FPF. The results suggest that removal of the Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond perturbs the environment of the primary specificity pocket probed by the positively charged P1 residue of substrate. The library of chromogenic substrates FPR, FPK, and FPF provides valuable insights on the effect of P1 substitutions on the perturbed functional properties of the double mutation C191A/C220A.TABLE 2Properties of C191A/C220A thrombin toward chromogenic substrates The experimental conditions were 5 mm Tris, 0.1% PEG8000, pH 8.0, 25°C, and 200 mm NaCl (fast form) or choline chloride (slow form).

Direct measurements of Na+ binding help distinguish between the two alternatives (5Di Cera E. Page M.J. Bah A. Bush-Pelc L.A. Garvey L.C. Phys. Chem. Chem.

Because all nine Trp residues of thrombin contribute to the signal linked to Na+ binding and the residues are distributed over the entire surface of the enzyme (38Bah A. Garvey L.C. Ge J. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40049-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the C191A/C220A mutation affects the structure of the enzyme as a whole in a way that silences all fluorophores. Most likely, Na+ binding to the mutant is too weak to detect in the range of NaCl concentration explored up to 400 mm under conditions where the wild type binds Na+ with an affinity KA = 160 m-1 (38Bah A. Garvey L.C. Ge J. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40049-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Perturbation induced by the C191A/C220A mutation extends to the interaction with physiologic substrates (Table 3). Release of fibrinopeptides A (FpA) and B (FpB) from fibrinogen is reduced 150- and 290-fold, respectively. PAR1 cleavage is compromised ∼100-fold, and specificity toward PAR4 drops ∼600-fold. The effect on protein C activation is less pronounced compared with the procoagulant (fibrinogen) and prothrombotic/signaling (PAR1, PAR4) substrates, as typically observed for mutations that affect Na+ binding and activation and stabilize thrombin in the anticoagulant slow form (5Di Cera E.

However, the drop in kcat/Km for protein C activation in the presence of thrombomodulin is too large (>15-fold) to make the C191A/C220A mutant a compelling candidate as an anticoagulant thrombin mutant for studies in vivo (39Cantwell A.M.

Perturbation of fibrinogen, PAR1, and PAR4 cleavage is comparable with that seen for FPR (Table 2), vouching for a molecular origin of the effect limited to the primary specificity site and possibly to the Na+ site. The conclusion is supported by the observation that inhibition by antithrombin is reduced ∼400-fold with or without heparin. The inhibitor is known to make extensive contacts with the 186 and 220 loops of the Na+ site in addition to the primary specificity pocket (42Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Functional studies point to significant perturbation of the primary specificity pocket and the Na+ site upon removal of the Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond. Direct assessment of the perturbation comes from the x-ray crystal structures of the mutant C191A/C220A in the free (CCF) and PPACK-bound (CCB) forms. The resolution of CCF and CCB is very high, 1.54 and 1.8 Å, respectively, and both structures contain a single molecule in the asymmetric unit. Paradoxically, CCF crystallized at higher resolution than the PPACK-inhibited form CCB and yielded by far the highest resolution structure ever reported for free thrombin and one of the highest resolution structures ever reported for thrombin in general. CCF and CCB are very similar (root mean square 0.42 Å) (Fig. 1). The structure of CCB is practically identical to that of wild-type thrombin bound to PPACK, with r.m.s.d. of 0.33 and 0.32 Å versus the PPACK-bound slow (SL) and fast (FL) forms (22Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), respectively. The whole backbone of the autolysis loop is well defined in the electron density map and assumes a conformation similar to that seen in the SL structure. All side chains are clearly resolved with the exception of Lys-145, Trp-148, and Lys-149e. The backbones of the 186 and 220 loops around the sites of mutation are also well defined in the density map and do not differ significantly from the conformations observed in SL (Fig. 2). The Cβ atoms of Ala-191 and Ala-220 in CCB superimpose well with the Cβ atoms of Cys-191 and Cys-220 in the wild-type structures FL and SL. In summary, the presence of PPACK produces a conformation that shows no obvious departure from those of the slow and fast forms of wild-type bound to the same active site inhibitor. The structure of CCB fails to explain the severe impairment of substrate recognition documented by functional studies (Tables 2 and 3).FIGURE 2Electron density maps 2F0 - FC contoured at 0. 7σ for the thrombin mutant C191A/C220A in its free CCF (A) and PPACK-bound CCB (B) forms. Shown is the region around the mutations (arrows) with the adjacent 186 loop, the 217–220 strand, the primary specificity pocket up to the catalytic Ser-195 and His-57. Removal of he Cys-191–Cys-220 disulfide bond increases exposure of Asp-189 to solvent. Note the flip of the backbone O atom of Gly-219 in the CCF structure. The Oγ atom of Ser-195 is oriented away from His-57 in CCF, as seen in the slow form of wild type (22Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Disorder in the side chains of residues in the 186-loop and around Glu-217 and Gly-219 in the CCF structure (A) is corrected by the presence of PPACK (stick model in green) in the CCB structure (B). Disorder in the Na+ binding site (186 and 220 loops) suggests that the conformation of CCF is unable to bind Na+, in agreement with functional data on the mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our recent work on the W215A/E217A mutant (43Pineda A.O. Chen Z.W. Caccia S. Cantwell A.M. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol.

We, therefore, endeavored to obtain a structure of the C191A/C220A mutant in the free form, devoid of potential bias caused by the presence of an active site inhibitor. As seen for W215A/E217A (43Pineda A.O. Chen Z.W. Caccia S. Cantwell A.M. Savvides S.N. Waksman G. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39824-39828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the structure of CCF shows some significant changes relative to CCB that help explain the perturbed functional properties of the mutant. The overall fold of CCF is very similar to wild type, with r.m.s.d. of 0.34 and 0.38 Å relative to the free slow (S) and fast (F) forms (22Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S.

CCF folds in an active conformation, with access to the active site and primary specificity pocket unperturbed. However, portions of the 186 and 220 loops feature significant disorder (Fig. 2) that is not seen in the CCB structure. Specifically, the side chains of residues Glu-186b, Lys-186d, and Arg-187 are complet"

Brn-3b is elevated in >65% of breast cancer biopsies, and here we demonstrate that Brn-3b is also elevated in NB tumours. We show a significant correlation between Brn-3b and cyclin D1 (CD1) in breast cancers and NB tumours and cell lines. Brn-3b directly transactivates the CD1 promoter in co-transfection experiments, whereas electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that Brn-3b protein binds to an octamer sequence located in the proximal CD1 promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of this sequence resulted in loss of transactivation of the CD1 promoter by Brn-3b. Thus, Brn-3b may act to alter growth properties of breast cancer and NB cells by enhancing CD1 expression in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078128254,"To evaluate the role of murine TFIID subunit TAF4 in activation of cellular genes by all-trans retinoic acid (T-RA), we have characterized the T-RA response of taf4lox/− and taf4−/− embryonic fibroblasts. T-RA regulates almost 1000 genes in taf4lox/− cells, but less than 300 in taf4−/− cells showing that TAF4 is required for T-RA regulation of most, but not all cellular genes. We further show that T-RA-treated taf4lox/− cells exhibit transforming growth factor (TGF)β-dependent autocrine growth and identify a set of genes regulated by loss of TAF4 and by T-RA corresponding to key mediators of the TGFβ signalling pathway. T-RA rapidly and potently induces expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) via a conserved DR2 type response element in its proximal promoter leading to serum-free autocrine growth. These results highlight the role of TAF4 as a cofactor in the cellular response to T-RA and identify the genetic programme of a novel cross talk between the T-RA and TGFβ pathways that leads to deregulated cell growth."
