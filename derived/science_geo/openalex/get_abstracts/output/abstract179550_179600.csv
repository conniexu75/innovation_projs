https://openalex.org/W2019851585,"The parasite Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for hundreds of millions of cases of malaria, and kills more than one million African children annually. Here we report an analysis of the genome sequence of P. falciparum clone 3D7. The 23-megabase nuclear genome consists of 14 chromosomes, encodes about 5,300 genes, and is the most (A + T)-rich genome sequenced to date. Genes involved in antigenic variation are concentrated in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes. Compared to the genomes of free-living eukaryotic microbes, the genome of this intracellular parasite encodes fewer enzymes and transporters, but a large proportion of genes are devoted to immune evasion and host-parasite interactions. Many nuclear-encoded proteins are targeted to the apicoplast, an organelle involved in fatty-acid and isoprenoid metabolism. The genome sequence provides the foundation for future studies of this organism, and is being exploited in the search for new drugs and vaccines to fight malaria."

https://openalex.org/W2156022009,"The completion of the Plasmodium falciparum clone 3D7 genome provides a basis on which to conduct comparative proteomics studies of this human pathogen. Here, we applied a high-throughput proteomics approach to identify new potential drug and vaccine targets and to better understand the biology of this complex protozoan parasite. We characterized four stages of the parasite life cycle (sporozoites, merozoites, trophozoites and gametocytes) by multidimensional protein identification technology. Functional profiling of over 2,400 proteins agreed with the physiology of each stage. Unexpectedly, the antigenically variant proteins of var and rif genes, defined as molecules on the surface of infected erythrocytes, were also largely expressed in sporozoites. The detection of chromosomal clusters encoding co-expressed proteins suggested a potential mechanism for controlling gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2025668422,"A theoretical underpinning of the standard model of fundamental particles and interactions is CPT invariance, which requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the combined discrete operations of charge conjugation, parity and time reversal. Antimatter, the existence of which was predicted by Dirac, can be used to test the CPT theorem—experimental investigations involving comparisons of particles with antiparticles are numerous1. Cold atoms and anti-atoms, such as hydrogen and antihydrogen, could form the basis of a new precise test, as CPT invariance implies that they must have the same spectrum. Observations of antihydrogen in small quantities and at high energies have been reported at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)2 and at Fermilab3, but these experiments were not suited to precision comparison measurements. Here we demonstrate the production of antihydrogen atoms at very low energy by mixing trapped antiprotons and positrons in a cryogenic environment. The neutral anti-atoms have been detected directly when they escape the trap and annihilate, producing a characteristic signature in an imaging particle detector."

Here we report the whole-genome shotgun sequence of one species, Plasmodium yoelii yoelii, and comparative studies with the genome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum clone 3D7. A synteny map of 2,212 P. y. yoelii contiguous DNA sequences (contigs) aligned to 14 P. falciparum chromosomes reveals marked conservation of gene synteny within the body of each chromosome. Of about 5,300 P. falciparum genes, more than 3,300 P. y. yoelii orthologues of predominantly metabolic function were identified. Over 800 copies of a variant antigen gene located in subtelomeric regions were found. This is the first genome sequence of a model eukaryotic parasite, and it provides insight into the use of such systems in the modelling of Plasmodium biology and disease."

https://openalex.org/W1982283061,"Aspirin (ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX) are widely used anti-inflammatory agents yet their mechanism(s) for blocking polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) accumulation at sites of inflammation remains unclear. Here, we report that inhibition of PMN infiltration by ASA and DEX is a property shared by aspirin-triggered lipoxins (ATL) and the glucocorticoid-induced annexin 1 (ANXA1)-derived peptides that are both generated in vivo and act at the lipoxin A(4) receptor (ALXR/FPRL1) to halt PMN diapedesis. These structurally diverse ligands specifically interact directly with recombinant human ALXR demonstrated by specific radioligand binding and function as well as immunoprecipitation of PMN receptors. In addition, the combination of both ATL and ANXA1-derived peptides limited PMN infiltration and reduced production of inflammatory mediators (that is, prostaglandins and chemokines) in vivo. Together, these results indicate functional redundancies in endogenous lipid and peptide anti-inflammatory circuits that are spatially and temporally separate, where both ATL and specific ANXA1-derived peptides act in concert at ALXR to downregulate PMN recruitment to inflammatory loci."

Absolutely secure key exchange between two sites has now been demonstrated over fibre and free-space optical links. Here we describe the secure exchange of keys over a free-space path of 23.4 kilometres between two mountains. This marks a step towards accomplishing key exchange with a near-Earth orbiting satellite and hence a global key-distribution system."

https://openalex.org/W2003029802,"Flotillins are lipid raft-associated proteins, which have been implicated in neuronal regeneration and insulin signaling. We now show that newly synthesized flotillin-1 reaches the plasma membrane via a Sar1-independent and brefeldin A-resistant targeting pathway. Consistent with post-translational membrane association of flotillin, protease sensitivity experiments suggest that flotillin-1 is not a transmembrane protein but is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The N terminus of flotillin contains a prohibitin-like domain (PHB), which shows homology to a number of proteins associated with raft domains including stomatin, podocin, and prohibitin. We show that the PHB domain of flotillin can efficiently target a heterologous protein, green fluorescent protein, to the plasma membrane. Another PHB-containing protein, stomatin, traffics to the plasma membrane via the conventional secretory pathway. Plasma membrane association of both full-length flotillin and the green fluorescent protein-tagged PHB domain of flotillin is dependent on palmitoylation and requires a conserved cysteine residue, Cys-34, in the PHB domain. The results identify a novel targeting mechanism for plasma membrane association of flotillin-1 involving a Golgi-independent trafficking pathway, the PHB domain, and palmitoylation."

In the presence of oxygen, NO and NO-related reactive nitrogen species nitrosate 4,5-diaminofluorescein to yield the highly fluorescent DAF-2 triazole (DAF-2T). However, as reported here, the DAF-2 reaction to form a fluorescent product is not specific to NO because it reacts with dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and ascorbic acid (AA) to generate new compounds that have fluorescence emission profiles similar to that of DAF-2T. When DHA is present, the formation of DAF-2T is attenuated because the DHA competes for DAF-2, whereas AA decreases the nitrosation of DAF-2 to a larger extent, possibly because of additional reducing activity that affects the amount of available N2O3 from the NO. The reaction products of DAF-2 with DHA and AA have been characterized using capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection and electrospray mass spectrometry. The reactions of DAF-2 with DHA and AA are particularly significant because DHA and AA often colocalize with nitric-oxide synthase in the central nervous, cardiovascular, and immune systems, indicating the importance of understanding this chemistry. 4,5-Diaminofluorescein (DAF-2) is widely used for detection and imaging of NO based on its sensitivity, noncytotoxicity, and specificity.

The reactions of DAF-2 with DHA and AA are particularly significant because DHA and AA often colocalize with nitric-oxide synthase in the central nervous, cardiovascular, and immune systems, indicating the importance of understanding this chemistry. NO is involved in a variety of important biological functions in the cardiovascular system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the reproductive system, and the immune system (1Bredt D.S.

Narayan P. Pandey C.M. Agarwal S.S. Immunol. Res. 2000; 22: 1-19Google Scholar). NO is normally generated via an enzymatically regulated pathway with the conversion ofl-arginine to citrulline by a family of at least three distinct nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; AA, ascorbic acid; ASW, artificial seawater; CE, capillary electrophoresis; DAF, diaminofluorescein; DAF-2, 4,5-diaminofluorescein; DAF-2T, DAF-2 triazole; DEA/NONOate, diethylamine NONOate; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; ESI, electrospray ionization; LIF, laser-induced fluorescence; MCC, metacerebral cell; MS, mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; AA, ascorbic acid; ASW, artificial seawater; CE, capillary electrophoresis; DAF, diaminofluorescein; DAF-2, 4,5-diaminofluorescein; DAF-2T, DAF-2 triazole; DEA/NONOate, diethylamine NONOate; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; ESI, electrospray ionization; LIF, laser-induced fluorescence; MCC, metacerebral cell; MS, mass spectrometry. enzymes, the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial NOS forms (or NOS-I, -II, and -III) (7Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Google Scholar, 8Shaul P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 749-774Google Scholar, 9Reutov V.P. Biokhimiya. 2002; 67: 293-311Google Scholar). Endothelial and neuronal NOS, also named constitutive NOS, are calcium-dependent. Although cells expressing constitutive NOS generally produce small amounts of NO (submicromolar at the cellular level), inducible NOS, which is synthesized in immune-competent cells when stimulated by cytokines, endotoxins, and other biologically active compounds, is calcium-independent and produces NO at higher levels (1–10 μm in microphages) (10Nagano T. Yoshimura T. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1235-1269Google Scholar). Although in situ and immunohistochemical techniques allow one to determine whether NOS is present in a particular tissue, whether the NOS is actively producing NO under specific conditions and the amount of NO produced are important questions to answer to understand the physiological roles of NOS.Direct detection (or imaging) of NO production in a biological system was unsatisfactory until the development of a series of fluorescent indicators for NO, the diaminofluoresceins (DAFs) in 1998 by the Nagano group (11Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen, NO nitrosates DAFs to produce the highly fluorescent triazofluoresceins. DAFs provide the advantages of sensitivity (detection limits of 5 nm), simple protocols, and noncytotoxicity, and they are also believed to offer high specificity to NO. Since then, an increasing number of researchers have used them for NO detection and NO imaging (10Nagano T. Yoshimura T. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 1235-1269Google Scholar,12Nagano T. Luminescence. 1999; 14: 283-290Google Scholar).The specificity of 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2), a commonly used form of DAF, has been examined. Broillet et al. (13Broillet M.C. Randin O. Chatton J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Google Scholar) reported that Ca2+, Mg2+, or incident light promoted the production of DAF-2T, the reaction product of DAF-2 and NO, by using NO donors in Ringer solution. It was later reported (14Suzuki N. Kojima H. Urano Y. Kikuchi K. Hirata Y. Nagano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47-49Google Scholar) that the enhancement of fluorescence intensity was not caused by increasing the reaction rate between DAF-2 and NO but by the potentiation of the release rate of NO from NO donors, and it was concluded that DAF-2 could provide reliable information on NO production in a biological system. Recently, Roychowdhury et al. (15Roychowdhury S. Luthe A. Keilhoff G. Wolf G. Horn T.F.W. Glia. 2002; 38: 103-114Google Scholar) evaluated the efficiency and specificity of DAF-2 for the detection of endogenously produced NO in mouse glia cell culture and reported that DAF-2 was more sensitive for peroxynitrite. Jourd'heuil (16Jourd'heuil D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 676-684Google Scholar) described that DAF-2 may be oxidized by either peroxynitrite or a peroxidase to form an intermediate that directly combines with NO to bypass NO/O2reaction and suggested that the results from DAF-2 fluorometric assays are quantitatively difficult to interpret in cells when oxidants and NO are cogenerated. In addition, Nagata et al. (17Nagata N. Momose K. Ishida Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 658-661Google Scholar) investigated the effects of reducers on the NO-induced nitrosation of DAF-2 and reported that catecholamines attenuated the fluorescence induced by NO donor, whereas ascorbic acid (AA, ascorbate, or vitamin C) and other reducers abolished the fluorescence. The authors suggested that the attenuation was mainly through anti-oxidative action of the reducers and oxidized NO and N2O3 or possibly through a direct interaction of reducers with DAF-2. We demonstrate here that DAF-2 directly reacts with dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and AA to form fluorescent compounds with emission spectra similar to that of DAF-2T.AA is the primary water-soluble antioxidant in biological systems, donating reducing hydrogen when being oxidized to DHA (18Carr A. Frei B. Faseb J. 1999; 13: 1007-1024Google Scholar, 19May J.M. Front. Biosci. 1998; 2: d1-d10Google Scholar). Uptake of AA into cells has been suggested to be via DHA, which is preferentially transported through the cell membrane (20Agus D.B. Gambhir S.S. Pardridge W.M. Spielholz C. Baselga J. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2842-2848Google Scholar). Once inside the cell, DHA is rapidly reduced to AA through enzymatic processes that involve GSH, NADH, or NADPH reductants (21Deutsch J.C. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 881: 299-307Google Scholar). Tissues vary widely in AA content with a range of 1–10 mm (22Grunewald R.A. Brain Res. Rev. 1993; 18: 123-133Google Scholar, 23Washko P.W. Wang Y.H. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Google Scholar, 24Ek A. Strom K. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1339-1346Google Scholar, 25Rice M.E. Russo-Menna I. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 1213-1223Google Scholar), but the highest concentrations occur in the pituitary and adrenal glands and in the brain (22Grunewald R.A. Brain Res. Rev. 1993; 18: 123-133Google Scholar). For example, catecholamines require ascorbic acid for synthesis and protection from oxidation. Large quantities of AA are required during conception (26Luck M.R. Jeyaseelan I. Scholes R.A. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 262-266Google Scholar). Leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, possess high concentrations of AA and may be the primary vehicle for its distribution throughout the body. It has been suggested that AA accumulates in activated human neutrophils to 14 mmconcentrations (23Washko P.W. Wang Y.H. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Google Scholar).This study reports a cross-reaction of DHA/AA with DAF-2, confounding detection and measurements of NO levels in biological systems. We investigated the effect of this newly described reaction using capillary electrophoresis (CE) with wavelength-resolved fluorescence detection and chemically characterized the new products using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Because of the extremely high physiological concentrations of AA and DHA colocalized with nanomolar levels of NO, even a poor reactivity of DAF-2 to DHA/AA can generate significant amounts of DAF-2-DHA/AA products. This is a potentially serious complication for direct NO measurements using DAF-2 because the same tissues that contain NOS enzymes have high levels of AA and DHA. NO is involved in a variety of important biological functions in the cardiovascular system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the reproductive system, and the immune system (1Bredt D.S.

https://openalex.org/W2097651960,"Yellow emission variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) have been found useful in a variety of applications in biological systems due to their red-shifted emission spectrum and sensitivity to environmental parameters, such as pH and ionic strength. However, slow maturation properties and new requirements for more intense fluorescence necessitated further mutagenesis studies of these proteins. Venus, a new variant with improved maturation and brightness, as well as reduced environmental dependence, was recently developed by introducing five mutations into the well characterized variant, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). In this paper, we present the crystal structure of Venus at 2.2 Å resolution, which enabled us to correlate its novel features with these mutation points. The rearrangement of several side chains near the chromophore, initiated by the F46L mutation, was found to improve maturation at 37 °C by removing steric and energetic constraints, which may hinder folding of the polypeptide chain, and by accelerating the oxidation of the Cα–Cβ bond of Tyr66 during chromophore formation. M153T, V163A, and S175G were also found to improve the rate of maturation by creating regions of greater flexibility. F64L induced large conformational changes in the molecule, leading to the removal of halide sensitivity by preventing ion access to the binding site.

M153T, V163A, and S175G were also found to improve the rate of maturation by creating regions of greater flexibility. F64L induced large conformational changes in the molecule, leading to the removal of halide sensitivity by preventing ion access to the binding site. green fluorescent protein wild-type yellow fluorescent protein enhanced YFP Green fluorescent protein (GFP),1 originally isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, has been the subject of continued interest since its gene was first cloned in 1992 (1Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The high stability of mature GFP over various environment conditions, the spontaneous autocatalytical generation of the fluorophore of GFP, and the possibility of spectral manipulation by mutagenesis, make GFP and its related proteins attractive tools for numerous biological applications (2Tsien R. Prasher D. Chalfie M. Kain S. Green Fluorescent Protein. Wiley-Liss, New York2000: 97-118Google Scholar). Maturation of GFP proceeds in three major steps, beginning as the 238-residue single GFP polypeptide folds into its nearly native conformation. Residues 65–67 of the folded protein then undergo several chemical reactions necessary for chromophore formation, including cyclization and dehydration (3Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). The final rate-limiting step in the maturation process involves the oxidation of the Cα–Cβ bond of Tyr66 by aerial oxygen. This maturation process takes ∼3 h at room temperature and its efficiency further decreases at 37 °C, hindering the use of GFP in some biological applications. To improve maturation and performance at 37 °C, mutations such as F99S, M153T, and V163A have been introduced, creating valuable GFP variants for a wider range of applications (4Yokoe M. Meyer T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Bastianutta R. Negro A. Zanotti G. Proteins. 2000; 41: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thorough understanding of the relationship between the protein sequence and its physico-chemical properties requires three-dimensional structure determination of GFP at atomic resolution. Crystal structures of both the monomeric and dimeric forms of GFP have been solved previously (6Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 7Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips G.N.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The wild-type GFP (wtGFP) chromophore, which exists in equilibrium between two ground states, produces two maxima in the light absorption spectrum. The near-UV absorption peak at 395 nm originates from the neutral chromophore, while the ionic chromophore absorbs at a longer wavelength and produces a smaller peak at 475 nm (3Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Green light is emitted from wtGFP at 503 nm. Spectral properties of GFP were shown to be influenced by its dimerization state (8Ward W.W. Chalfie M. Kain S. Green Fluorescent Protein. Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1998: 45-75Google Scholar), which is characterized by a dissociation constant of ∼100 μm(9Phillips G.N.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the case of YFP, a yellow variant of GFP, the main absorption maximum of 514 nm corresponds to the chromophore ionic form and is red-shifted relative to wtGFP. Unlike wtGFP, the neutral form does not emit fluorescence efficiently, and the higher energy peak is largely suppressed (10Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The equilibrium between the neutral and ionic forms of the YFP chromophore can be shifted in favor of the latter form by the following two mutations: S65G, which prevents hydrogen bond formation between residues Gly65 and Glu222, and T203Y, which produces additional polarizability around the chromophore. Also, the π-π interaction between Tyr203 and the chromophore phenol ring reduces the excited state energy, thereby increasing the excitation and emission wavelengths (6Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). When compared with the green emission variants of GFP, the absorbance level of YFP and its derivatives display a strong environmental sensitivity. The ratio between the two absorbance peaks, and therefore fluorescence efficiency, are dependent upon pH and the halide ion concentration (10Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 11Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R628-R629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This sensitivity makes YFPs efficient pH and halide sensors (12Takahashi A. Zhang Y. Centonze E. Herman B. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Jayaraman S. Haggie P. Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), but for applications requiring stable fluorescence in a wide range of environment conditions, it is necessary to have proteins that are insensitive to pH and halides. Griesbeck and colleagues (14Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) developed a less sensitive variant of yellow fluorescent protein, citrine, which contained a Q69M mutation in addition to the four mutations used to create the original yellow variant EYFP(S65G/V68L/S72A/T203Y). This mutation helped decrease the pH and halide sensitivity and facilitated expression at 37 °C. With a relatively low value of pK a = 5.7, citrine is particularly applicable in systems of lower pH and in a wide range of Cl− concentration. More recently, Nagai et al. (15Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar) introduced a new variant of yellow emission protein, called Venus, with reduced pH and halide dependence and an improved maturation rate. These properties were achieved in Venus by various mutations, which differ from those used in citrine (14Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Instead of Q69M mutation used in citrine, Venus contains five other mutations (F46L, F64L, M153T, V163A, and S175G) in addition to the previously described four mutations characteristic to EYFP. The F46L mutation helps accelerate the oxidation step in chromophore formation, an effect which is specific to yellow emission proteins. The remaining four mutations are known to improve folding at 37 °C, and at least one was found to remove proton and chloride sensitivity (15Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar) (Table I). The aim of our work was to solve the three-dimensional structure of Venus, shedding light on the structural basis of the observed molecular properties. We compared this crystal structure of Venus at 2.2-Å resolution with previously published structures of wtGFP (7Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips G.N.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) and EYFP (10Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) to pinpoint mutation-dependent structural changes. Our ultimate goal is to use systematic structural analysis of GFP mutants to provide future guidelines for rational design of improved variants.Table IComparison of Venus, EYFP, and wtGFPResiduepK a1-apK a for EGFP, EYFP, and Venus measured at 30 mm Cl; 150 mm ionic strength, and 25 °C.K fold1-bS65T (24).K d, Cl466465687280153163175203s −1VenusCTGCTGGGCCTGGCCCAGACCGCCGGCTAC5.85.62 × 10−2>104LeuLeuGlyLeuAlaGlnThrAlaGlyTyrEYFPTTCTTCGGCCTGGCCCGCATGGTGAGCTAC6.93.87 × 10−32.53PhePheGlyLeuAlaArgMetValSerTyrwtGFPTTTTTCTCTGTTTCACAGATGGTGAGCACC6.22.45 × 10−2>104PhePheSerValSerGlnMetValSerThrDifferences in sequence, pKa, dissociation constant for chloride, and folding rate.1-a pK a for EGFP, EYFP, and Venus measured at 30 mm Cl; 150 mm ionic strength, and 25 °C.1-b S65T (24Reid B.G.

Venus was subcloned into a pRSETb plasmid and expressed in theEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)gold. Cells were grown using standard culture medium (LB broth) in a shaker incubator at 37 °C until the optical density of 0.7 was reached. Upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the temperature was lowered to 25 °C, and protein was expressed for 7–8 h. Protein containing the N-terminal polyhistidine tag was purified using nickel affinity chromatography. Subsequently, ion exchange and gel filtration were employed to achieve satisfactory levels of purity. The N-terminal His6 tag was cleaved using enterokinase. The protein solution was concentrated to 33 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.9), with 50 mm NaCl and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Yellow fluorescent rod-shaped crystals (P3112), with approximate dimensions of 0.5 × 0.08 × 0.08 mm, were grown in hanging drops containing 2 μl of protein and 2 μl of mother liquor at room temperature for 3–7 days. The mother liquor contained 2.1 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm Tris hydrochloride at a pH of 8.4 and 4% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400. The crystals were cryo-protected in 20% glycerol and 5% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, then flash-cooled to 100 K in a stream of N2 gas. Diffraction data from a single crystal were collected in-house on a Mar345 imaging plate detector using Rigaku RU200 rotating anode as a generator of CuKα x-rays. 0.5 degree oscillations were collected in 300-s exposures. Data were collected to 97.7% completeness at 2.2-Å resolution. Unit cell dimensions were: a = 82.704, b = 82.704, c = 72.555 Å. The EYFP coordinate file (10Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K.

The parameters for the anionic chromophore were obtained from the Hetero-compound Information Centre, Uppsala, Sweden (HIC-up). Rigid-body refinement was carried out using the CNS program (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Open table in a new tab Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell, 2.28–2.37 Å. Venus was crystallized as a dimer with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The refined structure of Venus shows an 11-strand (labeled A to K from the N terminus) β-barrel, typical of GFP-derived fluorescent proteins. Calculated for α-carbons of residues 5–60 and 70–225, the root mean square deviation of a single Venus β-barrel relative to wtGFP and EYFP β-barrels is 0.32 and 0.35 Å, respectively. In all three structures compared, the cross-section taken perpendicularly to the long axis of the barrel is not perfectly circular but rather oval in shape. While the longer diameter of the oval cross-section of all three proteins is identical (23.8 Å; measured from distances of four Cα pairs), the shorter diameter differs between EYFP (22.3 Å) and Venus (21.9 Å). The difference in the oval shape between these yellow variants is closely related to the packing of interior amino acid residues and influences the integrity of dimer interface, as discussed below. The residues surrounding the Venus chromophore are similar to those surrounding the chromophore of EYFP (Fig. 1 A). More specifically, there are no significant changes between Venus and EYFP in the distances between the chromophore and residues Thr62, Leu68, Gln69, Gln94, Arg96, Asn146, Arg168, Gln183, Tyr203, and Ser205. Electron density studies of Venus show an 11o angle between the planes of the chromophore and Tyr203, while the same angle measured in EYFP is 11.5–12.3o, making the plane of the Venus chromophore slightly more parallel than that of EYFP. This small difference may account for a minor change in the absorption spectrum of Venus relative to EYFP, as seen at a pH range of 4.6–8.6 and a 50 mm NaCl concentration. Although the position of the main absorption maximum remains unchanged (516 nm) in both Venus and EYFP, a smaller peak resulting from the neutral (protonated) chromophore is shifted in Venus by 20 nm producing a peak at 413 nmversus 393 nm in EYFP. The slightly more parallel orientation of the aromatic rings of Tyr66 and Tyr203 might also help improve the π-π interaction, thus reducing the excited state energy of the neutral chromophore. If this is the case, we can hypothesize that at lower pH, which is favorable to chromophore protonation, the angle between the rings would be smaller than 11°. One of the changes observed around the Venus chromophore is a 0.3-Å increase in the distance between the Cα–Cβ bond and the OE1 atom of the Glu222 side chain, compared with EYFP. A result of this increased distance is a 0.5-Å shift of the chromophore away from the protein surface and the Glu222 side chain. Following this shift, an increased rate of oxidation is observed, attributed to enhanced oxygen access to the oxidation site in Venus. Other factors facilitating this reaction will be discussed under “Venus-specific Mutations.” Another difference in the Venus chromophore area, when compared with that of EYFP, is the presence of a shorter hydrogen bond (by 0.2 Å) between the chromophore phenolate and His148. This may result from a slight rotation in the His148 imidazole, making it less parallel to the β-barrel surface. However, this effect may also be due to the higher pH at which the crystals were grown (pH 8.5 for Venus, pH 6.9 for EYFP). The previously observed pH effect on S65T suggests that at a lower pH this distance becomes larger and hydrogen bonds are broken, consistent with our observations of Venus as well as past studies of EYFP (20Elsliger M.-A. Wachter R.M. Hanson G.T. Kallio K. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The mutual position of the two chromophores within the Venus dimer differs from that of wtGFP and EYFP. The chromophore-chromophore distance in the Venus dimer is shorter than that of others by approximately 2 Å when measured using the phenol oxygens (Fig. 3 A). These differences may be attributed mainly to the different orientation of subunits in the dimeric structure, coupled with the overall closer intersubunit contact in Venus than in EYFP (Fig. 2 and TableIII).Figure 2A, ribbon diagramshowing relative comparison of Venus (cyan), EYFP (yellow), and wtGFP (green) dimer orientations. α-Carbons of residues 5–60 and 70–225 from one monomer of each protein are superimposed.

Open table in a new tab The subunit orientations in the Venus dimer (Fig. 1, Band C) are similar to those in the wtGFP dimer, but differ from those of EYFP. When the backbone chain of one Venus subunit is superimposed on that of wtGFP, the second subunits display a similar orientation with respect to the superimposed subunits. In contrast, following superimposition of the first subunit of Venus on that of EYFP, the second subunits display a significantly different orientation (Fig. 2 A). The root mean square deviation for the aforementioned second subunits is 1.15 Å between Venus and wtGFP and 4.97 Å between Venus and EYFP. By using the angular parameters described in Table III, we can quantitatively define the unique orientation of the two subunits within the dimeric fluorescent proteins. The “tilt” angle between two subunits of Venus is similar to that of wtGFP, but differs from that of EYFP (Table III). These differences and similarities in domain orientations, depicted in Fig. 2 A, clearly show the differences in the position of one subunit when the other subunit is superimposed. Comparison of the buried surface areas for wtGFP, EYFP, and Venus indicates that the dimerization interface differs significantly between the three proteins (Table III). While the residues involved in the dimer interactions are essentially identical between Venus and wtGFP, significant differences are observed between Venus and EYFP. In both Venus and wtGFP, Glu142, Tyr145, Asn146, Asn149, Arg168, Asn170, Glu172, Tyr200, and Ser202 lie within the buried surface between the two subunits, whereas the same EYFP residues are solvent-accessible (Fig. 2 B). These differences leave Venus with 5% more buried surface area relative to EYFP. In addition, the average intersubunit distance between atoms located within the buried surface of the Venus dimer is somewhat shorter than that of EYFP (Table III). These concurring results indicate that Venus has a larger dimerization interface than EYFP. Wachter et al. (10Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 18Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D.Y. Kallio K. Tsien R.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have shown that the fluorescence intensity of YFP is inversely related to the concentration of halide ions in solution. This group identified a halide-binding site proximal to the EYFP-H148Q chromophore, which suppresses chromophore fluorescence upon ion binding. The halide-binding cavity is adjacent to the backbone carbonyl groups of Tyr66 and Gly67(Fig. 4 B). Two mutations (T203Y and V68L) located at the buried halide ion-binding cavity of EYFP (Fig. 4 B) have been implicated in halide sensitivity (18Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D.Y. Kallio K. Tsien R.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The halide ion sensitivity of YFPs has led to their use as halide ion sensors (13Jayaraman S. Haggie P. Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of these mutations in Venus, no halide sensitivity has been observed. The introduction of H148Q into EYFP enhances the halide affinity due to a better access of the ion to its binding cavity via a solvent channel, formed at a β-bulge located close to the dimer interface (10Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 18Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D.Y. Kallio K. Tsien R.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Venus has a cavity essentially identical to that of EYFP-H148Q in both size and side chain configuration. However, analogous mutagenesis performed on Venus led to no changes in halide affinity. 2T. Nagai and A. Miyawaki, unpublished data. Supported by structural information available on Venus, these data indicate that the β-bulge is inaccessible to halide ions due to rearrangement of the intersubunit interface. This rearrangement centered at the β-bulge is most likely initiated by F64L, a mutation that induces a relocation of many β-strand residues at the dimer interface. Consistent with the aforementioned observation on the Venus β-bulge, the wtGFP β-bulge is also inaccessible to halide ions (7Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips G.N.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The β-bulge residues Tyr145, Asn149, and Arg168 participate in dimer contacts in both Venus and wtGFP, while the same residues are fully solvent exposed in EYFP (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the intersubunit interface could influence the chromophore environment, linking the dimerization mechanism to the fluorescence property of GFP and its variants (8Ward W.W. Chalfie M. Kain S. Green Fluorescent Protein. Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1998: 45-75Google Scholar). As stated previously, Venus contains five additional mutation sites relative to EYFP (Table I). Comparison of the corresponding crystal structures helped explain the effects of these mutations on Venus properties. M153T, V163A, and S175G were found to improve the rate of maturation, while mutations F46L and F64L induced a number of local and global structural changes. Here we describe the individual effect of each mutation in detail. In the EYFP structure, the Phe46 phenyl ring exhibits an antiparallel π-π stacking to the phenyl ring of Phe64 (Fig. 4 A). Substitution of each aromatic side chain with an alkyl side chain creates a vacancy at residue 46. This change in side chain orientation results in close hydrophobic contact between residue Leu46 and the neighboring residue Leu44 as well as an associated change in the Leu42 side chain. The F46L mutation was found to improve maturation at 37 °C (15Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar) by removing steric and energetic constraints, which may hinder folding of the polypeptide chain (TableI). Furthermore, the Venus F46L substitution accelerates the oxidation of the Cα–Cβ bond of Tyr66 during chromophore formation (15Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, major functional changes caused by the F46L mutation resemble those seen in GFP-S65T (6Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 21Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) and DsRed N42H/Q (22Bevis B.J. Glick B.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), which show an increased rate of oxidation relative to their “precursor” proteins, wtGFP and wild-type DsRed, respectively. In GFP-S65T, the introduction of the threonine side chain at chromophore position 65 repositions the Leu44 and Leu42side chain. In DsRed-N42H/Q, the more bulky side chain of His42 or Gln42 shifts toward a position similar to Leu42 in Venus, leading to a repositioning of Gln66, an equivalent to residue 65 in Venus and EYFP. In brief, the introduction of F46L causes a series of changes at residues 42, 44, and 65, facilitating an increased rate of maturation. In addition, a change concerning residue 65 (66 in DsRed) in the Venus chromophore may lead to an increased rate of oxidation. In EYFP, the V68L substitution reorients both the central helix and the chromophore toward the protein surface (8Ward W.W. Chalfie M. Kain S. Green Fluorescent Protein. Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1998: 45-75Google Scholar). In Venus, however, the substitution of phenylalanine with leucine at position 64 counteracts any change in orientation caused by V68L, and the central helix and the chromophore remain roughly in their wild-type positions. Therefore, when compared with EYFP, the Venus chromophore is shifted ∼0.5 Å toward the center of the molecule (Figs.3 B and4 A). A similar dislocation of neighboring residues Tyr145, Tyr203, Leu220, and Glu222 accompanies this slight movement of the central helix. Such structural changes also influence the position of β-barrel strands G, J, and K as well as part of strand H. The shifted β-strands contain residues involved in the dimer interface, such as N144, S147, and A206 (Fig. 4 A). Relocation of these residues causes a small decrease in the average diameter of the β-barrel and geometric “flattening” of the β-barrel itself, increasing the surface area buried between the two monomers relative to EYFP. The β-strand movement occurs in close parallel to the movement of the chromophore and the central helix, and hence the distances between the residues surrounding the chromophore remain essentially unchanged in Venus relative to EYFP. The implications of the F64L mutation may therefore involve a reduction in halide ion binding to Venus (as discussed above under “Dimeric Structure and Halide Sensitivity”). Both Thr153 and Ala163, commonly mutated to improve protein maturation, are located in the loop region between strands G and H. This region is situated in close proximity to the halide-binding site but away from the dimer interface in the EYFP (Fig. 4 B). There is no obvious difference in the orientation of side chains of residues 153 and 163 between Venus and EYFP, where the polar side chain of Thr153 remains exposed to the solvent, and the side chain of Ala163 continues to point toward the molecular interior. Based on its location near to the halide-binding site, the V163A mutation may also be involved in eliminating chloride sensitivity in Venus (18Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D.Y. Kallio K. Tsien R.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). The S175G mutation is located in a short turn between strands H and I. The removal of the hydroxyl group of serine drastically alters the backbone conformation of the region spanning residues 173–175. Such a change involves breaking the three-centered hydrogen bond found in EYFP between the side chain carboxyl oxygen atom of Asp173 and the amide nitrogens of Gly174 and Ser175. This is caused by ∼180° rotation of the carboxyl side chain of Asp173, which flips away from the backbone carbonyl of Gly174, resulting in its complete exposure to the solvent (Fig. 4 C). The S175G mutation in cycle-3 GFP (5Bastianutta R. Negro A. Zanotti G. Proteins. 2000; 41: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Venus (15Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar) has been shown to facilitate the protein folding process in vivo. S175G also enhances the fluorescence intensity of ECFP 2-fold in an in vitroexperiment.2 While the exact structural basis of this increased folding rate is unclear, it should be noted that a localized conformational change outside of the β-barrel (Fig. 4 C) significantly impacts the properties of the chromophore within the β-barrel, including maturation. The five mutations that distinguish Venus from EYFP increase the rate of maturation and abolish the sensitivity to halide ions (15Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). The 2.2-Å x-ray structure of Venus reveals several structural differences when compared with EYFP and wtGFP, thus helping to elucidate the structure-function relationship of this fluorescent protein. Among the five mutations, those known as “folding mutations” (4Yokoe M. Meyer T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar) seem to facilitate the maturation process by introducing highly flexible, smaller side chains within the loop regions located outside the β-barrel (M153T, V163A, S175G) or near the chromophore (F64L). The F46L mutation promotes a local structural change near the chromophore, which consequently accelerates oxidation, a rate-limiting step in chromophore maturation. In addition, we found that the F64L mutation is responsible for a major structural change inside the β-barrel, leading to an alteration of the intersubunit orientation, ultimately preventing halide ion access to the binding cavity near the chromophore. Two properties of Venus, however, remain to be explained, including the small red shift of the absorption peak attributed to a neutral chromophore and the increased resistance to low pH when compared with EYFP. This observed small red shift might be attributed to the fact that the aromatic rings of the Venus chromophore and Tyr203have a more parallel orientation, minimizing the energy interaction. Alternatively, the pH resistance may result from the slightly smaller distance between His148 and the chromophore, thus stabilizing the associated hydrogen bond and promoting the ionic chromophore form. As both properties are pH-dependent, a comparison of the present structure at pH 8.4, with a Venus structure obtained at lower pH is needed to address these questions.

Fidelity is quantified from the ratio of specificity constants (catalytic efficiencies) for alternate substrates (i.e. correct and incorrect dNTPs). An analysis of the efficiency of dNTP (correct and incorrect) insertion for a low fidelity mutant of DNA polymerase β (R283A) and exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases from five families derived from a variety of biological sources reveals that a strong correlation exists between the ability to synthesize DNA and the probability that the polymerase will make a mistake (i.e.base substitution error). Unexpectedly, this analysis indicates that the difference between low and high fidelity DNA polymerases is related to the efficiency of correct, but not incorrect, nucleotide insertion. In contrast to the loss of fidelity observed with the catalytically inefficient R283A mutant, the fidelity of another inefficient mutant of DNA polymerase β (G274P) is not altered. Thus, although all natural low fidelity DNA polymerases are inefficient, not every inefficient DNA polymerase has low fidelity. Low fidelity polymerases appear to be an evolutionary solution to how to replicate damaged DNA or DNA repair intermediates without burdening the genome with excessive polymerase-initiated errors.

Low fidelity polymerases appear to be an evolutionary solution to how to replicate damaged DNA or DNA repair intermediates without burdening the genome with excessive polymerase-initiated errors. The equilibrium between genome stability and instability is tightly regulated since mutations are central to aging, disease, and evolution. Thus, cellular strategies that modulate this equilibrium are of general and immense interest. The structure of DNA was proposed nearly 50 years ago and provided the first clue to how “genetic material” could be replicated faithfully (1Watson J.D. Crick F.H.C. Nature. 1953; 171: 737-738Google Scholar). It is now recognized that DNA polymerases play pivotal roles in both genome replication and maintenance (i.e. DNA repair). Polymerases copy the parental (template) strand to generate a new or repaired complementary daughter strand, and accurate DNA synthesis during replication and repair is essential in maintaining genomic integrity. Although DNA polymerases play a central role in these essential processes, the fundamental mechanism(s) by which they select the correct deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate (dNTP) 1The abbreviations used are: dNTP, 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate; pol, polymerase from a pool of structurally similar molecules to accomplish efficient and faithful polymerization is poorly understood. The intrinsic base substitution error frequency for DNA replication and repair polymerases is generally between 10−3 and 10−6 (2Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Google Scholar). These frequencies represent one error per thousand or million nucleotides synthesized, respectively. These levels of discrimination are far greater than predicted by free energy differences between matched and mismatched DNA termini (predicted error frequency of ∼0.4; one error per 3 nucleotides synthesized), indicating that DNA polymerases can enhance fidelity by a large factor (3Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sowers L.C. Cheong C. Tonoco J. Ignacio Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6252-6256Google Scholar). However, even this remarkable specificity is inadequate to faithfully replicate a genome of more than 109 nucleotides. Thus, replicative DNA polymerases often have an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease to remove misinserted nucleotides, and cells possess a postreplication DNA mismatch repair pathway that can correct misinserted nucleotides that escape proofreading. DNA polymerase (pol) fidelity, specificity, or discrimination represent relative kinetic terms used to describe the propensity of a polymerase to produce a base substitution error. Polymerase specificity may be quantified in vitro by measuring the insertion kinetics of a single nucleotide (correct or incorrect) opposite a defined templating base. The absolute rate or probability that a pol inserts a correct or incorrect nucleotide follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A steady-state kinetic approach defines substrate specificity as catalytic efficiency,k cat/K m,dNTP, for formation of a specific base pair. Substrate specificity determined by a pre-steady-state kinetic approach isk pol/K d whereK d is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the incoming dNTP and k pol is the kinetic step that limits insertion of the first nucleotide. This step may be either chemistry (i.e. nucleotidyl transfer) and/or conformational transitions of the ternary polymerase/substrate complex. Although these two kinetic approaches may measure different steps along the catalytic pathway, they measure the same specificity constant (i.e. k cat/K m =k pol/K d) (4Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). DNA polymerase specificity is typically quantified by comparing the ratio of catalytic efficiencies for correct and incorrect nucleotide insertion and typically expressed as relative misinsertion efficiency,f ins = (k cat/K m)incorrect/(k cat/K m)correct, or fidelity (1/f ins) (5Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Tsui W.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 37-51Google Scholar, 6Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). Since fidelity represents a ratio of catalytic efficiencies for correct and incorrect nucleotide insertion, differences in fidelity can be due to changes in one or both specificity constants. We had noted previously that a mutant of pol β had low fidelity and catalytic efficiency for correct insertion (7Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Google Scholar). By examining the catalytic efficiencies for correct and incorrect nucleotide insertion for wild-type and mutant forms of pol β and comparing them with those reported for other polymerases exhibiting divergent fidelities, we find that the fidelity of natural DNA polymerases is determined primarily by the efficiency for correct nucleotide insertion. Wild-type human pol β and mutant derivatives (R283A and G274P) were expressed and purified as described previously (7Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined by Coomassie dye binding using purified pol β as the standard. The concentration of purified pol β was determined by total amino acid analysis. A 34-mer oligonucleotide DNA substrate containing a single nucleotide gap was prepared by annealing 3 gel-purified oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR) to create a single-nucleotide gap at position 16. The sequence of the gapped DNA substrate was: primer, 5′-CTGCAGCTGATGCGC-3′; downstream oligonucleotide, 5′-GTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′; and template, 3′-GACGTCGACTACGCGGCATGCCTAGGGGCCCATG-5′. The resultant single-nucleotide gapped DNA has a templating G in the gap. The oligonucleotides were quantified, resuspended in a buffer, and annealed as described previously (4Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). The primer was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs), and radioactive ATP was removed with a MicroSpin G-25 column. Enzyme activities were determined using a standard reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (22 °C), 100 mm KCl, and 5 mmMgCl2. Steady-state or pre-steady-state kinetic parameters for single-nucleotide gap filling were determined as before (4Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). Quenched reaction samples were mixed with an equal volume of formamide dye, and the products were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) to quantify product formation. Rational or random mutagenesis of the pol active site generally results in mutant enzymes that have moderately reduced or improved specificity. However, alanine substitution for an arginine residue of pol β (R283A, Fig. 1), suggested to stabilize the templating base, results in a dramatic loss of catalytic efficiency for correct insertion and fidelity, implying that catalytic efficiency for correct nucleotide insertion and discrimination were coupled (7Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Google Scholar). Since those measurements were performed on dissimilar DNA substrates, we reexamined the catalytic efficiency for correct insertion and fidelity on the same single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate, a substrate preferred by pol β in base excision repair (8Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Google Scholar). A steady-state kinetic analysis of the R283A mutant of human pol β indicates that there is a 33,000-fold loss in catalytic efficiency for insertion of dCTP opposite a templating guanine within a single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate relative to the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the mutant enzyme inserts dTTP opposite guanine 15-fold less efficiently than wild-type enzyme. Since fidelity or relative misinsertion efficiency are relative ratios of catalytic efficiencies, the mutant enzyme has a 2,400-fold lower ability to discriminate against dTTP insertion relative to dCTP (Fig. 2 A). This loss in discrimination is entirely due to the loss of the ability to insert the correct nucleotide, dCTP, since dTTP insertion efficiency is reduced in the mutant enzyme.Figure 2Relative misinsertion efficiency for formation of the dG-dTTP mispair as a function of catalytic efficiency for nucleotide insertion. The reported catalytic efficiencies for dCTP or dTTP insertion opposite guanine were analyzed for exonuclease-deficient pols that span five pol families (Table I): ●, A-family; ▪, B-family; ▴, RT-family; ○, X-family; ■, Y-family. The DNA polymerases included are T7 pol (T7), Klenow fragment (Kf), pol ζ (ζ), RB69 pol (RB69), pol X (X), rat and human pol β (rβ andhβ, respectively) on non-gapped or gapped (g) DNA, R283A mutant of pol β (βR283A), pol η (η), pol ι (ι), and pol κ (κ). For some of these polymerases, several reported catalytic efficiencies are given. These represent alternate determinations from independent laboratories. The dotted line (f ins = 0.6) represents the calculated free energy difference determined for matched and mismatched terminal base pairs (ΔΔG ∼0.3 kcal/mol at 37 °C) (3Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sowers L.C. Cheong C. Tonoco J. Ignacio Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6252-6256Google Scholar). As shown in A, the efficiencies for correct nucleotide insertion (k cat/K m,dCTP) span 5 orders of magnitude for the DNA polymerases surveyed with a corresponding decrease in the relative misinsertion efficiencies (f ins). As shown in B, in contrast, the efficiencies for dTTP insertion occurred over a much narrower range for most polymerases and do not correlate with fidelity in a systematic way.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the loss of catalytic efficiency for the correct nucleotide generally leads to a loss in discrimination, as observed with the R283A mutant of pol β, we analyzed the reported insertion kinetics for 12 exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases from a variety of biological sources that span five pol families (TableI). Replicative and repair DNA polymerases have generally been reported to insert the correct nucleotide with a catalytic efficiency of about 1–10 μm−1 s−1 with corresponding relative misinsertion efficiencies of 10−3-10−6 for a G-T (template base-incoming nucleotide) base pair (Fig. 2 A). Since DNA polymerases can typically misinsert three common nucleotides opposite a templating guanine, albeit with low efficiency, the data points for these mispairs are spread vertically (Fig. 3).Table IDNA polymerases and kinetic studies included in the global analysis of polymerase specificityDNA polymeraseSourcePolymerase familyReferenceKlenow fragmentaThe intrinsic 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity of these pols was eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis.Escherichia coliA(30Carroll S.S.

In some instances,k cat could be calculated fromV max when the molecular concentration of the pol was given (k cat = V max/[pol]). More recently, a new family of DNA polymerases (i.e.Y-family, which includes pols η, ι, and κ) has been described (9Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Google Scholar). These polymerases lack an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease, exhibit low processivity, replicate DNA with low fidelity, and are believed to assist replication complexes stalled at DNA lesions (for a recent review, see Ref. 10Friedberg E.C. Fischhaber P.L. Kisker C. Cell. 2001; 107: 9-12Google Scholar). A survey of the catalytic efficiencies for nucleotide insertion by members of this family indicates that they generally insert dCTP opposite a templating guanine with low efficiency (<0.2 μm−1 s−1). DNA polymerase κ inserts dCTP with an efficiency of about 10−1 to 10−2 μm−1s−1 (11Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3838-3843Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Yuan F. Xin H. Wu X. Rajpal D.K. Yang D. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4147-4156Google Scholar), whereas the efficiency for pol ι for this base pair is about 10−3 μm−1s−1 (13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Google Scholar, 14Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R.

Thus, the efficiencies for insertion of dCTP opposite guanine can vary 5 orders of magnitude depending on the identity of the pol (Fig. 2 A). As observed for the R283A mutant of pol β, discrimination is coupled to the catalytic efficiency for correct insertion, but not for incorrect insertion (e.g. dTTP insertion opposite guanine; Fig. 2 B). The loss in the ability to insert the correct nucleotide results in the loss of discrimination (i.e. higherf ins). The trend in this analysis suggests that if the catalytic efficiency for correct insertion was reduced further, insertion of the incorrect nucleotide may be preferred over that of the correct ((k cat/K m)incorrect> (k cat/K m)correctso that f ins > 1). There are three examples where this has been observed (Fig. 3, C and D): pol ι has been reported to insert dTTP (13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7099-7108Google Scholar) and dGTP (13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Google Scholar, 14Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7099-7108Google Scholar) opposite a templating thymine with a higher efficiency than it inserts dATP. Additionally, pol X from the African swine fever virus inserts dGTP opposite a templating guanine with a greater efficiency than dCTP (16Showalter A.K. Tsai M.-D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1776-1777Google Scholar). As observed for the misinsertion of dTTP opposite a templating guanine (Fig. 2 A), the relative misinsertion efficiency for all 12 mispairs is controlled primarily by the efficiency for correct nucleotide insertion. In all cases, a loss in the ability to insert the correct nucleotide results in a loss of discrimination (higherf ins). More importantly, the slope of the lines in the log-log plots in Fig. 3 is equal to or greater than −1 for every mispair. These slopes range from −0.2 (dCTP insertion opposite adenine) to −1 (Fig.4 A). The slopes for most mispairs range from −0.6 to −1. This corresponds to little or no loss of catalytic efficiency for insertion of the incorrect nucleotide for a corresponding 10-fold loss of catalytic efficiency for correct insertion. However, the slope of the log-log plot for dCTP insertion opposite adenine is −0.2, corresponding to an 8-fold loss of catalytic efficiency for incorrect insertion with a 10-fold loss for correct insertion. Thus, the slope of these log-log plots may be a measure of the Watson-Crick geometry of each mispair, suggesting that in the confines of the pol active site, dCTP-dA has a geometry more similar to that of a Watson-Crick base pair than the reciprocal mispair (dATP-dC). When all of the mispairs are considered together, the overall slope is −0.78 ± 0.09, indicating that the catalytic efficiency for incorrect insertion is ∼1.7-fold lower than for a pol that exhibits a 10-fold higher catalytic efficiency for correct insertion. The catalytic efficiencies for correct insertion range from 56 μm−1 s−1, determined for pol γ (17Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Google Scholar), to 5 × 10−6μm−1 s−1, reported for pol ι (15Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7099-7108Google Scholar), for dATP insertion (Fig. 3). This represents a 10 million-fold range in catalytic efficiencies for correct insertion. Thus, although pol ι exhibits the lowest fidelity (greatestf ins) for the dT-dGTP mispair, it also inserts dATP opposite thymine with the lowest efficiency of any polymerase surveyed here. Whereas pol γ exhibits a 30,000-fold lowerf ins than pol ι (i.e. higher fidelity), its catalytic efficiency for insertion of dGTP opposite thymine is 300-fold greater than pol ι. Until recently, the “kinetic space” occupied by replicative and repair DNA polymerases indicated that these enzymes insert the correct nucleotide with an efficiency of about 1–10 μm−1 s−1. Iff ins is examined for the different mispairs at a catalytic efficiency of 1 μm−1s−1 (i.e. 100), then it is generally observed that pyrimidine-purine mispairs (transition intermediates) are easier to make than pyrimidine-pyrimidine or purine-purine mispairs (transversion intermediates) (Fig.4 B), an observation that has been noted previously (6Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Google Scholar). Although this generalization is pertinent for DNA polymerases with moderate catalytic efficiencies for correct insertion (i.e.∼1 μm−1 s−1), it would not pertain to the lower fidelity polymerases since the relationship between f ins and catalytic efficiency is moderately dependent on the specific mispair. In general, f ins is strongly correlated with the catalytic efficiency for correct nucleotide insertion. However, the correlation is not perfect, and there are examples where this is clearly not the case. For example, dTTP insertion opposite guanine by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase is more efficient (higher f ins;k cat/K m = 0.03 μm−1 s−1) than would be predicted by taking into account the efficiency that other DNA polymerases produce this mispair (k cat/K m ∼10−4μm−1 s−1; Fig. 2). This represents the most efficient misinsertion reported (18Zinnen S. Hsieh J.C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24195-24202Google Scholar) in the studies included in this survey. More interestingly, the efficient insertion of dTTP opposite guanine is consistent with the G → A hypermutation observed among retroviruses (19Pathak V.K. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6019-6023Google Scholar, 20Vartanian J.-P. Meyerhans Å. Asjo B. Wain-Hobson S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1779-1788Google Scholar) and represents an error that would be encouraged by the naturally low dCTP/dTTP pool imbalance (21Vartanian J.-P. Meyerhans A. Sala M. Wain-Hobson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3092-3096Google Scholar). As a first approximation, the correlation between correct nucleotide insertion efficiency and fidelity suggests that if the catalytic efficiency of a mutant pol were greatly diminished, then it may also exhibit a correspondingly low fidelity (e.g.R283A mutant of pol β). Traditionally, site-directed mutagenesis of the pol active site (e.g. metal-coordinating carboxylates) of the A, B, X, and RT families results in a 100–1000-fold loss in catalytic efficiency (22Larder B.A. Purifoy D.J.M. Powell K.L. Darby G. Nature. 1987; 327: 716-717Google Scholar, 23Date T. Yamamoto S. Tanihara K. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5286-5292Google Scholar, 24Polesky A.H. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Google Scholar, 25Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11028-11040Google Scholar). Due to this considerable loss of catalytic efficiency, fidelity was not assessed with these “inactive” mutant enzymes. During a steady-state kinetic-screen of site-directed mutants of pol β, a G274P mutant exhibited a 104-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency relative to wild-type enzyme. A rare cis-peptide bond is observed between Gly-274 and Ser-275 that creates a sharp turn between two α-helices that contribute significant interactions with the nascent base pair. Gly-274 interacts with the sugar of the incoming nucleotide (Fig. 1). Proline substitution for Gly-274 would be expected to sterically clash with the incoming nucleotide and alter helix interactions with the nascent base pair. The enormous loss of catalytic efficiency is consistent with this proposal. To discount the possibility that the mutant enzyme did not fold properly, resulting in a large fraction of inactive protein, we performed a single-turnover analysis (pol ≫ DNA substrate) to directly address the rate of insertion into a single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate with a templating guanine. Under these assay conditions, the rate of insertion was nearly identical to that determined when substrate concentration is in excess (i.e. steady-state assay), indicating that the poor efficiency was intrinsic to the mutant enzyme (data not shown). To address whether there was a corresponding decrease in fidelity, we attempted to measure dTTP insertion efficiency opposite the templating guanine. However, misinsertion efficiency was very weak, precluding an accurate determination but suggesting that the efficiency for formation of this mispair was reduced significantly relative to wild-type enzyme. By substituting Mn2+ for Mg2+ in the assay mixture, the catalytic efficiency for correct insertion was increased. Under this condition, the fidelity of wild-type enzyme was 16,600 ((k cat/K m)correct/(k cat/K m)incorrect), which is about 4-fold lower than in a reaction utilizing Mg2+ (4Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiencies for correct (dCTP-dG) and incorrect (dTTP-dG) insertion were diminished 4800- and 1300-fold, respectively, for the G274P mutant relative to wild-type enzyme. This translates to a less than 4-fold loss in fidelity for the mutant enzyme, which is far less than the 880-fold loss predicted from the survey of native DNA polymerases. Most importantly, this observation indicates that although low fidelity DNA polymerases insert the correct nucleotide inefficiently, not all polymerases that are inefficient have low fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the kinetic difference between low and high fidelity DNA polymerases originate primarily in the ability of the pol to insert the correct nucleotide rather than its ability to insert the incorrect nucleotide. Accordingly, the molecular basis for the divergent fidelities requires a kinetic and structural understanding of correct nucleotide insertion. Since naturally occurring DNA polymerases exhibiting divergent fidelities generally insert incorrect nucleotides with similar efficiencies, high fidelity polymerases discriminate against incorrect nucleotides by actively selecting correct nucleotides. A comparison of published crystallographic substrate complexes of DNA polymerases with a Watson-Crick base pair in the confines of their active site suggests that the coordination of the Pα of the incoming nucleotide has a strong influence on catalytic efficiency, whereas specific interactions with the bases of the nascent base pair do not. 2W. A. Beard and S. H. Wilson, unpublished observation. These structural observations are consistent with the similar binding affinities, but divergent insertion rates, reported for the correct nucleotide with DNA polymerases exhibiting different fidelities. Cells have solved the problem of how to replicate structural abnormalities in genomic DNA by evolving enzymes that have the ability to insert nucleotides opposite DNA lesions at the expense of fidelity. Thus, although low fidelity DNA polymerases would theoretically produce an inordinate number of errors per nucleotide synthesized, these polymerases are “kinetically controlled” by virtue of their catalytic efficiency for correct nucleotide insertion. However, the mutagenic threat of a low fidelity pol will be increased if its DNA synthesis capacity increases. This could be achieved through gene induction (increase in pol concentration), polymerase targeting (increase in local pol concentration), or an increase in catalytic efficiency through interaction with accessory proteins. All of these strategies appear to be utilized by the low fidelity Y-family DNA polymerases (for a recent review, see Ref. 26Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Google Scholar). We have conducted a comparative study of the insertion efficiency as it relates to fidelity. Equally important subsequent steps concern the fate of a mispair. A mispair can be proofread by either an intrinsic or extrinsic 3′–5′ exonuclease, or it could be extended by the same, or a different, DNA polymerase. Since extension of a mispair is a challenging kinetic event due to the aberrant DNA structure at the interface of the nascent base pair in the pol active site, it is not unexpected that DNA polymerases have also evolved to fulfill this specialized function.

Here, using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and in vivothioacetamide-induced liver failure, we showed that Me2SO failed to prevent any cleavage of initiator caspase-8 and -9 but constantly inhibited procaspase-3 maturation and apoptosis execution, pointing to an efficient inhibition of cleaved initiator caspase activities. Evidence was recently provided that apoptosis might require both caspase and ASK1/JNK-p38 activities. We demonstrated that this kinase pathway was strongly inhibited in the presence of Me2SO whereas overexpression of ASK1 was able to restore caspase-3 activity and apoptosis. Interestingly, we also found that GST Μ1/2 and GST Α1/2 dropped under apoptotic conditions; furthermore transfection of GST Μ1, A1, or P1 to cells overexpressing ASK1, abolished caspase-3 activity and restored viability. This role of GSTs was further assessed by showing that their high expression level was tightly associated with inhibition of ASK1 activity in Me2SO-protected hepatocytes. Together, these results demonstrate that Me2SO-mediated hepatoprotection involves a dual inhibition of cleaved initiator caspase and ASK1/JNK-p38 activities.

Furthermore, in highlighting the control of apoptosis by GSTs, these data provide new insights for analyzing the complex mechanisms of hepatoprotection. Control of apoptosis is essential to development and homeostasis in mammals. Progression of the apoptotic signal can be inhibited at different levels depending on death inducers and cell types. Thus, endogenous caspase inhibitors such as cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) (1Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin.

In addition, inactivation of caspases might even occur after their cleavage through AKT-dependent phosphorylation of caspase-9 (5Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F.

Moreover, nitric oxide (NO), generated by NO donors or NO synthases, has been reported to block activity of several members of the caspase family via S-nitrosylation of their catalytic site (7Mannick J.B.

All these mechanisms are aimed at preventing inappropriate procaspase maturation or inhibiting activity of matured caspases. In TNFα-induced apoptosis, upon TNFα binding, oligotrimerization of TNF receptors occurs and results in aggregation of death domain-containing proteins, allowing recruitment of TRADD (TNF receptor I-associated death domain protein). TRADD binds FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein) and TRAF-2 (TNF receptor I-associated protein 2) proteins, which in turn lead to activation of procaspase-8 and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), respectively (9Matsuzawa A. Ichijo H. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). ASK1 is a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), ubiquitously expressed, that activates the MKK4/MKK7-JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and MKK3/MKK6-p38 signaling cascades (10Ichijo H. Nishida E.

JNK and p38 MAP kinase are preferentially activated by stress agents such as UV radiation, osmotic shock, and proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα. The disruption of the ASK1 gene in mouse (11Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H.

In addition, overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active form of ASK1 induces apoptosis in various cell types (10Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M.

GST Μ1 is a member of the GST protein family that catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to a variety of electrophiles (22Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). In addition to this role, these proteins have also been shown to serve as nonenzymatic binding proteins interacting with various lipophilic compounds that include steroid and thyroid hormones (23Litwack G. Ketterer B. Arias I.M. Nature. 1971; 234: 466-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). GSTs have been grouped into eight classes, with the most abundant ones being the alpha, mu, and pi classes (22Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). In rat hepatocytes, GSTP1 have been associated to cell proliferation and decreased level of differentiation in contrast to GST A1/2, which is related to high level of differentiation. GST Μ1/2 seemed to be expressed under both situations (24Morel F. Vandenberghe Y. Pemble S. Taylor J.B. Ratanasavanh D. Rogiers V. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A.

In addition, GST Μ1 and P1 appear to act as direct inhibitors of ASK1 and JNK, respectively, independently of their catalytic detoxication activity and of cellular GSH level (21Cho S.G. Lee Y.H.

This strongly suggests that GSTs might be involved in cell protection against apoptotic signals, such as osmotic stress, TNFα, or UV radiation, through both detoxication and inhibition of the stress-signaling cascade ASK1-JNK. However, the contribution of GSTs, proteins highly expressed in liver parenchymal cells, to apoptosis of these cells has never been investigated. Liver injuries can be induced by a variety of apoptotic factors such as TNFα or Fas ligand (27Feldmann G. J. Hepatol. 1997; 26: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kaplowitz N. Semin.

Secott T. Georgoff I. Woodworth C. Mummaw J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3252-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNFα is known to induce apoptosis in Me2SO-treated hepatocyte cultures, but only after Me2SO removal (36Bour E.S. Ward L.K. Cornman G.A. Isom H.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 485-495PubMed Google Scholar). It has been then postulated that Me2SO might protect liver from hepatotoxin by scavenging hydroxyl radicals (31Bruck R. Aeed H. Shirin H. Matas Z. Zaidel L. Avni Y. Halpern Z. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but the mechanism by which Me2SO would inhibit apoptosis pathway in hepatocytes has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which liver protection is controlled using Me2SO as hepatoprotector by focusing our attention on the apoptotic transduction inhibition.In vivo, THA-induced liver failure known to induce hepatocyte apoptosis was chosen, and cultures of hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis were designed as an in vitro model. We provide evidence that hepatoprotection may result from both inhibition of caspase cascade, through an efficient inactivation of cleaved initiator caspases and prevention of ASK1-JNK activities via GST regulation. Male Lewis rats and BALB/c mice (Elevage Janvier) were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of thioacetamide (THA, Sigma), 100 mg/kg. In some experiments, Me2SO (2 ml/kg, Sigma) was also injected 1 h prior to THA, then at 12 and 24 h after the THA injection according to the protocol of Bruck et al. (31Bruck R. Aeed H. Shirin H. Matas Z. Zaidel L. Avni Y. Halpern Z. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed at different times after THA injection (for animals receiving only THA) and 30 h after THA administration when considering animals treated with both THA and Me2SO; this latter time corresponded to maximal DEVD-AMC caspase activity in THA-treated animals. Rabbit anti-GST mu1/2, alpha1/2 and pi1 antibodies were from Biotrin International (Ireland). Anti-ASK1 (DAV) was previously described (12Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). Anti-caspase-3, -MKP1 and -JNK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-caspase-8 (APP-108) and anti-caspase-9 were from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Tebu, France), and anti-P-JNK, -P-p38, and -p38MAPK from Cell Signaling Technology (Tebu, France). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from DAKO (DAKO SA, France). Fluorigenic substrates were from BACHEM (BACHEM) and prepared at 100 mmin the recommended solvent. The CasputinTM reagent, a specific inhibitor of caspases-3 and -7, corresponding to anEscherichia coli-expressed recombinant fusion protein, which comprises BIRs (baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein Repeats) 2 and 3 from human XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), was purchased from Biomol (Tebu, France). Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1, R&D Systems) and TNFα (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hepatocytes were isolated and purified from male Sprague-Dawley rats (Elevage Janvier, France) as described previously (37Guguen-Guillouzo C. Freshney R.I. Freshney M.G. Culture of Epithelial Cells. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York2002: 337-379Crossref Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were seeded at 7 × 104 cells/cm2 on plastic dishes in a mixture of 75% minimum essential medium and 25% medium 199, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and per ml: 100 IU of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μmol of l-glutamine, and 5 μg of bovine insulin. Four hours after plating, the medium was removed, and cultures were maintained in different media: 1) basal medium, corresponding to plating medium, deprived in fetal calf serum and supplemented with 1.4 × 10−7m hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (Roussel-UCLAF), 2) Me2SO medium, corresponding to basal medium supplemented with 2% Me2SO; 3) TGFβ1 or TNFα medium, TGFβ1 (1 or 2.5 ng/ml) or TNFα (20 ng/ml) was added to basal medium at 24 h after cell plating. Treatment was then performed for 2 days. Appropriate media were renewed every day. Freshly isolated hepatocytes and cultured cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored as pellets at −80 °C. Hepatocytes were lysed in a Western blot lysis buffer, and protein content was measured as previously described (38Desmots F. Rissel M. Gilot D. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Morel F. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Guillouzo A. Loyer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17892-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 100 μg of proteins were resolved on 7.5–12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF, Bio-Rad). Subsequently, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 4% bovine serum albumin, for 1 h at room temperature. Then, filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in TBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin. Filters were washed three times with TBS and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, for 1 h at room temperature. Following 4–5 washes with TBS, the proteins of interest were visualized with SupersignalTM (Pierce Chemical Co.). Adherent and non-adherent hepatocytes from 60-mm dishes were harvested and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. DNA was isolated from cultured cells or fresh biopsies with High Pure PCR template preparation kit (Roche Diagnostics). After purification, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and observed under UV light. Hepatocytes and liver biopsies were lysed in the caspase activity buffer (39Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). 100 μg of crude cell lysate were incubated with 80 μm substrate-AMC for 1 h at 37 °C. Caspase-mediated cleavage of peptide-AMC was measured by spectrofluorimetry (Molecular Devices) at the excitation/emission wavelength pair (ex/em) of 380/440 nm. The caspase activity was given in arbitrary units of fluorescence (per 100 μg of total protein). Caspase activity was measured after preincubation of cytosol with or without 10 mm DTT for 10 min at room temperature. In these experiments, caspase activity buffer did not contain DTT. 24 h after Me2SO addition, hepatocytes were transfected using GB12 as previously described (40Gilot D. Miramon M.L. Benvegnu T. Ferrieres V. Loreal O. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Plusquellec D. Loyer P. J. Gene Med. 2002; 4: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Per dish, a total of 4 μg of DNA plasmid was mixed with 10 μg of GB12. Human GST M1, A1, and P1 cDNAs were obtained by PCR from liver tissue RNA and subcloned in pClneo (Promega). pcDNA3.1 HA-ASK1 and HA-ASK1 (Km, kinase mutant) were previously described (21Cho S.G. Lee Y.H. Park H.S. Ryoo K. Kang K.W. Park J. Eom S.J. Kim M.J. Chang T.S. Choi S.Y. Shim J. Kim Y. Dong M.S. Lee M.J. Kim S.G. Ichijo H. Choi E.J. J. Biol.

The substrate of ASK1, 0.5 μg of GST-MKK4 per reaction was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Tebu, France). To investigate the mechanism by which free radical scavengers like Me2SO modulate the apoptotic process in hepatocytes, a study of such a process in basal primary culture of adult hepatocytes was first performed. A minimal medium composed of a mixture of MEM/M199 medium supplemented with insulin and a low concentration of glucocorticoids (10−7m) was chosen, limiting hepatocyte life-span to a few days. Apoptotic process undergone by hepatocytes under this condition was characterized (Fig. 1) and compared with that induced in the presence of TGFβ1 used as a potent apoptotic inducer in hepatocytes (41Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5408-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Cell viability loss, measured by the decrease in protein content per dish was approximately 50% as early as 3–4 days of culture (Fig.1 A) paralleled by a clear degradation of DNA into oligonucleosomes (Fig. 1 B). TGFβ1 treatment induced more rapid and extensive cell damages. Western blot analysis was next performed to look for expression of pro- and cleaved forms of the caspase-9, -8, and -3 (Fig.1 C). The proforms and cleaved forms of both caspase-9 and -3 were observed in freshly isolated hepatocytes. Then, from days 2 to 3, cleaved forms of caspase-9, -8, and -3 were detected and accumulated with time of culture. In addition, appearance of cleaved forms of caspases was concomitant with the proteolytic cleavage of the endogenous substrate poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). As in untreated cells, cleaved caspase-3 and -9 and PARP were found in TGFβ1-treated cells but no cleaved caspase-8 was detected (Fig. 1 C). To confirm that cleaved caspases were active, assays using fluorogenic substrates were carried out. They were based on the differential efficiency of each caspase at processing three fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrates: 1) DEVD-AMC known to be essentially cleaved by caspase-3 and to a lesser extent by caspase-7, 2) LEHD- and IETD-AMC, two main substrates of the initiator caspases, mainly caspase-9 and -8, respectively. DEVD-AMC caspase activity was very low in freshly isolated cells and increased thereafter, displaying a biphasic induction, moderate at 1, and sharp at 3 days after plating (Fig. 1 D). IETD- (Fig.1 D) and LEHD-AMC (data not shown) caspase activity values displayed a similar biphasic profile but always remained lower than DEVD-AMC caspase activities. Addition of TGFβ1, led to a dramatic induction of activity with both substrates, 24 and 48 h after treatment, reaching in the DEVD-AMC assay a 4–5-fold higher level than that measured in cells maintained in basal medium (Fig. 1 D, inset). Moreover, we have verified that the DEVD-AMC activity, in 3-day-old cultured cells, was strongly inhibited in the presence of the CasputinTM reagent, a recombinant protein of the endogenous caspase inhibitor XIAP, which specifically binds to and inhibits cleaved caspase-3 and -7 with negligible effects on other caspases (6Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This indicated that the cleavage of DEVD-AMC was essentially due to caspase-3 and/or -7 (Fig. 1 E) in contrast to IETD-AMC (Fig.1 E). These results demonstrated that the apoptotic process of hepatocytes cultured under basal conditions involved maturation and activities of caspase-9, -8, and -3. To determine the mechanism involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by Me2SO, 2% Me2SO was added to the basal medium 24 h after plating according to Isomet al. (35Isom H.C. Secott T. Georgoff I. Woodworth C. Mummaw J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3252-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar); then, cell morphology, DNA degradation, and expression and activation of the three caspases were studied (Fig.2). Typical differentiated hepatocyte morphology was maintained in Me2SO-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B), and no DNA ladder was observed under this condition (Fig. 2 D) compared with hepatocytes exhibiting characteristics of apoptosis under basal conditions (Fig. 2, A and C). DEVD-AMC caspase activity strongly decreased at day 2 and then remained very low for at least 6 days (Fig. 2 C) while no cleaved fragment of caspase-3 was detected by Western blotting (Fig.2 E). Surprisingly, the expression of the cleaved caspase-8 became detectable from 72 h and gradually accumulated from days 4–6 of culture (Fig. 2 F). Similarly, the cleaved form of caspase-9 was detected as early as 24 h and its level increased with time. These results indicated that Me2SO prevented hepatocyte apoptosis occurrence by inhibiting the caspase-3 maturation, indispensable to cell death although it failed to inhibit maturation of caspase-8 and -9. As observed above, maturation of procaspase-3 was constantly inhibited despite the presence of cleaved caspase-8 and -9. This prompted us to evaluate whether these cleaved caspase-8 and -9 were active. Caspase-8 and -9 activities (Fig.3 A) were thus measured from cell lysates using fluorogenic tetrapeptides IETD- and LEHD-AMC, respectively, in Me2SO-treated hepatocytes or not, 4 days after plating. For each activity, Me2SO-treated hepatocytes exhibited a weak activity in contrast to control cells, indicating that, in the presence of Me2SO, the cleaved caspase-8 and -9 were poorly active. To address the question as to whether the inhibition by Me2SO of cleaved initiator caspase activities and maturation of executioner caspases was a reversible phenomenon, hepatocytes were first cultured in the presence of 2% Me2SO between days 1 and 3 after plating and then without Me2SO for the 2 following days. IETD-AMC caspase activity was measured at days 3 and 4 (Fig. 3 B). This activity was very low in hepatocytes constantly stimulated by Me2SO but strongly increased at day 4 after Me2SO removal. We also tested whether or not Me2SO, per se, was capable of inhibiting active mature caspases in a cell extract. To this aim, both IETD- (data not shown) and LEHD-AMC (Fig. 3 C) caspase activities were estimated in hepatocyte extracts of 4-day-old cultures maintained under basal conditions, i.e. exhibiting high caspase activities, to which increasing concentrations (0.5–4%) of Me2SO were added. Caspase activities were not affected by the addition of Me2SO to the caspase activity assays, thus demonstrating that this molecule was not directly responsible for the inactivation of the enzymatic activity of active initiator caspases in cell extracts. To identify the mechanism underlying inhibition by Me2SO of initiator caspase activity, we determined whether initiator caspases were S-nitrosylated (42Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M.

https://openalex.org/W2002709418,"The activities of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II are regulated by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). Cleavage of IGFBP-4 by the metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) causes release of bound IGF and has been established in several biological systems including the human reproductive system. Using flow cytometry, we first demonstrate that PAPP-A reversibly binds to the cell surface of several cell types analyzed. Heparin and heparan sulfate, but not dermatan or chondroitin sulfate, effectively compete for PAPP-A surface binding, and because incubation of cells with heparinase abrogated PAPP-A adhesion, binding is probably mediated by a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Furthermore, the proteolytic activity of PAPP-A is preserved while bound to cells, suggesting that adhesion functions to target its activity to the vicinity of the IGF receptor, decreasing the probability that released IGF is captured by another IGFBP molecule before receptor binding. This mechanism potentially functions in both autocrine and paracrine regulation, as PAPP-A need not be synthesized in a cell to which it adheres. A truncated PAPP-A variant without the five short consensus repeats in the C-terminal third of the 1547-residue PAPP-A subunit, lacked surface binding. We also show that PAPP-A2, a recently discovered IGFBP-5 proteinase with homology to PAPP-A, does not bind cells. This finding allowed further mapping of the PAPP-A adhesion site to short consensus repeat modules 3 and 4 by the expression and analysis of nine PAPP-A/PAPP-A2 chimeras. Interestingly, the proteolytically inactive, disulfide-bound complex of PAPP-A and the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP), PAPP-A·proMBP, shows only weak surface binding, probably because the adhesion site of PAPP-A is occupied by heparan sulfate, known to be covalently bound to proMBP. This hypothesis was further substantiated by demonstrating that heparinase treatment of PAPP-A·proMBP restores surface binding. We finally propose a model in which IGF bioactivity is regulated by reversible cell surface binding of PAPP-A, which in turn is regulated by proMBP.

Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Google Scholar). Their biological activities are regulated by six different homologous IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6), which bind the IGFs with high affinities and, thus in some cases, prevent them from binding to the receptor (2Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Google Scholar). As a regulatory mechanism, proteolytic cleavage in the central region of the IGFBPs causes dissociation of bound IGF (3Fowlkes J.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 299-306Google Scholar).The identities of the proteinases responsible for cleavage in vitro of individual IGFBPs are often unknown. However, it has recently been established that the metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is responsible for cleavage of IGFBP-4 (4Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T.

Furthermore, it has been found that IGFBP-5 is also a PAPP-A substrate, but unlike the cleavage of IGFBP-4 by PAPP-A, which is dramatically increased by IGF, the cleavage of IGFBP-5 by PAPP-A is slightly inhibited by IGF (13Laursen L.S. Overgaard M.T. Søe R. Boldt H.B. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 36-40Google Scholar). Where and to what extent PAPP-A functions as an IGFBP-5 proteinase in vivo is currently not known. Interestingly, IGFBP-5, but not IGFBP-4, is known to interact with the cell surface (14Andress D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28289-28296Google Scholar).The metzincin superfamily of metalloproteinases is a diverse group of zinc endopeptidases that includes the astacins, the reprolysins, the serralysins, and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (15Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Google Scholar). The proteolytic domains of metzincins have common sequence elements, including an elongated zinc binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) (16Bode W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Stockler W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Google Scholar), and they share a common fold, but specific structural features distinguish families from one another (15Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Google Scholar). The proteolytic domain of PAPP-A fulfills the criteria of a metzincin but cannot be grouped into one of the mentioned four families. It rather belongs, as a founder member, to a fifth metzincin family, the pappalysins (17Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Google Scholar).In addition to the proteolytic domain of about 300 residues (17Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Google Scholar), the PAPP-A subunit contains three lin-notch modules (LNR-1–3, each of 26–27 residues), two of which are inserted into the proteolytic domain, and five short consensus repeats (SCR-1–5, each of 57–77 residues) located in the C terminus of the protein (18Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Møller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Google Scholar). The SCR module is also known as the complement control protein module. It occurs frequently in complement proteins, but within the metzincins it is unique to the pappalysins. PAPP-A shares its domain organization only with PAPP-A2, a recently discovered second member of the pappalysin family (19Overgaard M.T. Boldt H.B. Laursen L.S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C.

PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 are both synthesized as preproproteins of 1627 (21Haaning J. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Ebbesen P. Kristensen T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 159-163Google Scholar) and 1791 (19Overgaard M.T. Boldt H.B. Laursen L.S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol.

PAPP-A2 cleaves IGFBP-5 (and -3), not IGFBP-4, as determined by analysis of recombinant protein (19Overgaard M.T. Boldt H.B. Laursen L.S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol.

Sand O. Kristensen T. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12243-12246Google Scholar). In the PAPP-A·proMBP complex, proMBP functions as an inhibitor of PAPP-A enzymatic activity (5Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L.S. Christiansen M. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31128-31133Google Scholar). Measurable PAPP-A activity of pregnancy serum results from a minor fraction (<1%) of PAPP-A, which exists as a homodimer, not complexed to proMBP (5Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L.S. Christiansen M. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31128-31133Google Scholar), and possibly also from partially inhibited 2:1 complexes. In the human placenta, PAPP-A and proMBP mRNAs are primarily synthesized in different cell types, and therefore, the covalent PAPP-A·proMBP complex is formed in the extracellular compartment (23Bonno M. Oxvig C. Kephart G.M. Wagner J.M. Kristensen T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 560-566Google Scholar). Compared with other tissues, the placental levels of PAPP-A and proMBP mRNAs are relatively high (24Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Christiansen M. Lawrence J.B. Conover C.A. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Haaning J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1083-1089Google Scholar), in accordance with the circulating levels in pregnancy.Uncomplexed, native proMBP has never been isolated, but the proMBP subunit has been prepared from reduced and carboxymethylated PAPP-A·proMBP complex by denaturing gel filtration and found to be extensively substituted (39% (w/w)) with N- andO-linked carbohydrates (25Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Google Scholar). Of particular interest, Ser-62 of the 222-residue preproMBP is substituted with a heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (26Oxvig C. Haaning J. Hojrup P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 329-336Google Scholar).We here demonstrate and analyze cell surface interactions of PAPP-A. We find that PAPP-A, but not PAPP-A2, binds glycosaminoglycan on the surface of cells, and by using PAPP-A/PAPP-A2 chimeras, the binding site is located to SCR-3 and -4. A functional role of PAPP-A proteolytic activity in proximity to the cell surface is suggested. Furthermore, we propose a model in which the adhesion and the activity of PAPP-A are both regulated by proMBP.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated and analyzed the interaction between PAPP-A and the cellular surface. We have shown that 1) mature PAPP-A is capable of binding reversibly to the surface of all cell types analyzed and that it can adhere to cells in which it is not synthesized, 2) heparin and heparan sulfate effectively compete for the binding site on PAPP-A, and 3) heparinase treatment of cells abrogates their capacity to bind PAPP-A. We further 4) locate the binding site of PAPP-A to its C-terminal third by analysis of a truncated PAPP-A mutant and 5) narrow down the binding site to SCR modules 3 and 4 using chimeras of PAPP-A and PAPP-A2. The use of PAPP-A2 was made possible by our finding that PAPP-A2, unlike PAPP-A, is unable to adhere to cells. Finally, 6) we demonstrate that the PAPP-A·proMBP complex shows only weak surface binding, which can be restored by the treatment of the complex with heparinase.Proteolysis of IGFBP-4·IGF complexes in the interstitial fluid at a distance from the IGF receptor is likely ineffective in terms of promoting IGF actions; once released, IGF may be captured by an intact IGFBP molecule, effectively antagonizing the effect of proteolysis. In contrast, proteolysis of IGFBP-4·IGF complexes at the cell surface immediately brings released IGF in close proximity to the IGF receptor, decreasing the probability that IGF is captured and inactivated before it binds to the receptor.Therefore, our finding that PAPP-A binds to the surface of cells (Fig.1) suggests that this plays a part in targeting of its proteolytic activity. We demonstrated that PAPP-A is enzymatically active while bound to cells (Fig. 5) and that PAPP-A synthesized in one cell can adhere to another (Fig. 2). Importantly, this allows possible functions of PAPP-A in both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.Based on preliminary localization of the PAPP-A binding site to the C-terminal third of PAPP-A (Fig. 3), we speculated that GAG is implicated in the surface binding of PAPP-A. Indeed, we found that heparin effectively competes for the binding site on PAPP-A. The effect of heparan sulfate was very similar to that of heparin, but dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate both competed inefficiently (Fig. 4). These results suggests that a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, possibly a syndecan or glypican family member, is involved in binding of PAPP-A. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are particularly abundant on the surface of cells and are known to participate in binding of many different proteins (34Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Google Scholar, 35Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Google Scholar). In some cases, cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans function as co-receptors, efficiently increasing the interaction between a ligand, for example a growth factor, and its signaling receptor (36Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Google Scholar). Although heparan sulfate proteoglycan do not appear to function as a co-receptor for IGF, adhesion of PAPP-A indirectly increases the effective concentration of IGF in the vicinity of its receptor. However, the existence of a PAPP-A signaling receptor cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, an internalization receptor or a nonsignaling co-receptor for PAPP-A, providing binding energy and/or specificity, may also exist.We previously observed PAPP-A antigen in solubilized membranes of stimulated JAR cells (21Haaning J. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Ebbesen P. Kristensen T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 159-163Google Scholar), and other data indicate that PAPP-A associates with preparations of membrane made from human placenta (37Isaka K. Bischof P. Arch. Gynecol. 1986; 237: 117-126Google Scholar). Although these data were carried out with polyspecific PAPP-A antibodies known to recognize different antigens (22Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12243-12246Google Scholar, 38Kuhajda F.P. Katumuluwa A.I. Pasternack G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1188-1192Google Scholar), they are in agreement with our data. Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that PAPP-A antigen present in a preparation of solubilized membranes from human trophoblasts is proteolytically active (51Sun I.Y.C. Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Giudice L.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5235-5240Google Scholar).A functional role in vivo of surface adhesion of a soluble proteinase has been demonstrated for matrilysin (MMP-7). MMP-7 binding of heparan sulfate was first established (39Yu W.H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4183-4191Google Scholar), and it was then shown that CD44, a facultative cell surface proteoglycan, binds both MMP-7 and its substrate, the precursor of heparin binding epidermal growth factor. Within this assemblage, mature heparin binding epidermal growth factor is generated in close proximity to its receptor, ErbB4 (40Yu W.H. Woessner Jr., J.F. McNeish J.D. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 307-323Google Scholar). Another example, also with similarity to the system of IGF, IGFBP-4, and PAPP-A, is the activation of transforming growth factor-β by surface-bound MMP-9 (41Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176Google Scholar). Other nontransmembrane metzincins have been found to associate with the cell surface, although they do not appear to function in growth factor activation; MMP-2 binds integrin αvβ3, promoting cellular invasion (42Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Google Scholar), and MMP-2 binds a clearance receptor, proposed to regulate extracellular activity of this enzyme (43Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Google Scholar). Adhesion of MMP-19 has also been shown, although its function is not known (44Mauch S. Kolb C. Kolb B. Sadowski T. Sedlacek R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1244-1251Google Scholar). Furthermore, the serine proteinase plasmin, potentially activated at the cell surface, has been shown to be capable of degrading IGFBPs, independent of the presence of IGF (45Campbell P.G. Novak J.F. Yanosick T.B. McMaster J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1401-1412Google Scholar, 46Remacle-Bonnet M.M. Garrouste F.L. Pommier G.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 835-843Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of plasmin in the IGF system is not known.To further define the GAG binding site of PAPP-A, nine chimeras of PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 were constructed and analyzed (Fig. 6). We found that both SCR-3 and -4 are involved in PAPP-A surface binding. There may be a separate GAG binding site on each of these domains, or there may be a single site to which both SCR-3 and -4 make contributions. In either case, the residues of SCR-3 appear to be more important, because chim6, in which SCR-3 alone is substituted with PAPP-A2 sequence, did not bind, and because chim7, in which SCR-4 only is replaced, showed weak binding (Fig. 6). The true modularity of the SCR domain is debated (33Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Google Scholar), and we cannot exclude that inter-domain interactions are disturbed in some of the chimeras. It is therefore important that no result contradicts the above interpretation, which is based on both knock-out and knock-in experiments.SCR domains (also called complement control protein modules) are best known from their presence in complement control proteins such as factor H (fH), which is composed of 20 SCR modules alone (33Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Google Scholar); SCR domain 16 of fH was the first to have its three-dimensional structure solved (47Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Google Scholar). The SCR domain is a five-stranded β-sandwich structure, and individual domains are linked in a head-to-tail manner with varying angles between the axes of each domain (33Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Google Scholar).Factor H is known to bind heparin, and the heparin binding has been mapped to individual SCR domains (7, 13, and 20) (48Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Google Scholar). Complexes between the SCR domain(s) and GAG have not yet been studied at atomic resolution, but the binding of heparin to other proteins such as antithrombin and fibroblast growth factors has been studied in detail by x-ray crystallography (49Mulloy B. Linhardt R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 623-628Google Scholar). It is therefore known that residues with positively charged side chains interact with GAG sulfate groups. Vaccinia virus complement control protein contains four SCR domains and is also known to bind heparin. Its recently reported crystal structure (31Murthy K.H. Smith S.A. Ganesh V.K. Judge K.W. Mullin N. Barlow P.N. Ogata C.M. Kotwal G.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 301-311Google Scholar) reveals two patches of positive residues. Interestingly, one is at the end of domain 4, and the other straddles domains 1 and 2.SCR-3 of PAPP-A contains 13 residues with basic side chains (18Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Møller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Google Scholar), whereas SCR-3 of PAPP-A2 contains only six (19Overgaard M.T. Boldt H.B. Laursen L.S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21849-21853Google Scholar). The average number of basic residues in the 10 SCR modules of PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 is 5; PAPP-A SCR-4 has 5 basic residues. These figures clearly point at direct interactions between GAG and residues of PAPP-A SCR-3, but further mutagenesis focusing at single amino acids will be required to define the PAPP-A-GAG interactions in greater detail.Because proMBP is known to be substituted with a heparan sulfate GAG (26Oxvig C. Haaning J. Hojrup P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 329-336Google Scholar), we hypothesized that in the disulfide-bound PAPP-A·proMBP complex, this occupies the GAG binding site of PAPP-A and, therefore, antagonizes PAPP-A surface binding. Comparison of dimeric PAPP-A with heterotetrameric PAPP-A·proMBP complex indeed revealed compromised surface binding of the complex (Fig. 8). The weak binding observed may be caused by the presence of a small fraction of 2:1 complexes in the PAPP-A·proMBP preparation capable of surface binding because it has two GAG binding sites but only one proMBP GAG. A 2:1 complex, but not dimeric PAPP-A, would co-purify with the predominant 2:2 complex in chromatography (5Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L.S. Christiansen M. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31128-31133Google Scholar). Alternatively, the limited PAPP-A·proMBP binding can be explained by competition between cell surface GAG and proMBP GAG over binding to the binding site of the PAPP-A subunit. Of particular importance, demonstrating that the GAG of proMBP inhibits adhesion, treatment of the PAPP-A·proMBP complex with heparinase restored cell surface binding (Fig. 9 A), whereas binding of uncomplexed PAPP-A was not affected (Fig. 9 B). Thus, PAPP-A, still part of the disulfide-bound PAPP-A·proMBP complex, was able to bind to the cell surface after removal of the proMBP GAG.The activities of IGF are antagonized by IGFBP-4, whose effect is abrogated when cleaved by PAPP-A. This regulatory system appears to function in several tissues, including the ovary and the human placenta; recent data show that first trimester serum levels of PAPP-A correlate positively with birth weight (50Smith G.C. Stenhouse E.J. Crossley J.A. Aitken D.A. Cameron A.D. Connor J.M. Nature. 2002; 417: 916Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that proMBP in turn controls the enzymatic activity of PAPP-A as it functions as a proteinase inhibitor (5Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L.S. Christiansen M. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31128-31133Google Scholar). The levels of both PAPP-A and proMBP are relatively high in the human placenta, but all tissues analyzed synthesize mRNAs encoding both molecules (24Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Christiansen M. Lawrence J.B. Conover C.A. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Haaning J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1083-1089Google Scholar), suggesting that both the proteinase (PAPP-A) and its inhibitor (proMBP) function together.We have depicted the possible role of surface-bound PAPP-A in promoting IGF activity by cleaving IGFBP-4 in proximity to the IGF receptor (Fig.10 A) and, furthermore, the possible role of proMBP in effectively antagonizing this effect by both detachment and inhibition of PAPP-A (Fig. 10 B). This model comprises the components known to function with PAPP-A directly or indirectly. The elements of their dynamics, such as attachment, proteolytic activity, detachment, complex formation, and inhibition, are all supported by experimental data.

Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Google Scholar). Their biological activities are regulated by six different homologous IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6), which bind the IGFs with high affinities and, thus in some cases, prevent them from binding to the receptor (2Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Google Scholar). As a regulatory mechanism, proteolytic cleavage in the central region of the IGFBPs causes dissociation of bound IGF (3Fowlkes J.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 299-306Google Scholar). The identities of the proteinases responsible for cleavage in vitro of individual IGFBPs are often unknown. However, it has recently been established that the metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is responsible for cleavage of IGFBP-4 (4Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Google Scholar, 5Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L.S.

This was first found using conditioned medium from human fibroblasts and osteoblasts (4Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Google Scholar), but it has also been demonstrated that PAPP-A is the IGFBP-4 proteinase secreted from vascular smooth muscle cells (6Bayes-Genis A.

https://openalex.org/W2012460741,"The androgen receptor interacts with the p160 coactivators via two surfaces, one in the ligand binding domain and one in the amino-terminal domain. The ligand binding domain interacts with the nuclear receptor signature motifs, whereas the amino-terminal domain has a high affinity for a specific glutamine-rich region in the p160s. We here describe the implication of two conserved motifs in the latter interaction. The amino-terminal domain of the androgen receptor is a very strong activation domain constituent of Tau5, which is mainly active in the absence of the ligand binding domain, and Tau1, which is only active in the presence of the ligand binding domain. Both domains are, however, implicated in the recruitment of the p160s. Mutation analysis of the p160s has shown that the relative contribution of the two recruitment mechanisms via the signature motifs or via the glutamine-rich region depend on the nature of the enhancers tested. We propose, therefore, that the androgen receptor-coactivator complex has several alternative conformations, depending partially on the context of the enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1967396825,"Recombination promotes retrovirus evolution. It involves transferring a growing DNA primer from one genomic RNA template in the virus to the other. Strand transfer results in vitro suggested that pausing of the reverse transcriptase during synthesis allows enhanced RNase H cleavage of the initial, or donor, RNA template that facilitates primer interaction with the acceptor template. Hairpins are common structures in retrovirus RNAs that induce pausing. Analyzing primer transfers in hairpins by base substitution markers showed transfer sites well beyond the site of pausing. We developed methods to distinguish the initial site of primer-acceptor template interaction from the site of primer terminus transfer. The strand transfer mechanism was confirmed to involve two steps. In the first, the acceptor template invades the primer-donor complex. However, the primer terminus continues elongation on the donor RNA. The interacting primer and acceptor strands then propagate by branch migration to catch the advancing primer terminus. Some distance downstream of the invasion site the primer terminus transfers, marking the genetic shift from donor to acceptor. Nucleocapsid protein (NC) is known to influence primer elongation and strand exchange. The presence of NC increased the efficiency of transfers but did not appear to alter the fundamental transfer mechanism. Recombination promotes retrovirus evolution.

Recombination is an essential cellular process that is catalyzed by enzymes that are encoded and regulated by the cell. In addition to providing a basis for genetic variation, recombination is perhaps more important for repairing chemical and radiation damage to DNA, for altering the level of expression of certain genes, and for creating new protein coding regions (1Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Gene. Fourth Ed. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1987: 313-338Google Scholar).

Recombination serves as an effective mechanism for fixing damaged regions within the genome (2Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Google Scholar). It also serves as a way to exchange mutations that confer drug resistance (3Gu Z. Salomon H. Cherrington J.M. Mulato A.S. Chen M.S. Yarchoan R. Foli A. Sogocio K.M. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1888-1891Google Scholar, 4Kellam P. Larder B.A. J.

Retroviruses package their genomic information in the form of two single-stranded, positive sense RNA molecules. Retroviral recombination is dependent on the packaging of heterogeneous RNAs within a single virion, and it takes place during viral genome replication (7Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Google Scholar). During replication, reverse transcriptase (RT) converts the single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA. To carry out this process RT uses its polymerase as well as its RNase H catalytic activities, both of which reside within the same polypeptide chain (8Prasad V.R. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 135-162Google Scholar). Recombination occurs when RT transfers an elongating primer from one position to another within the same template or to another co-packaged RNA, a process known as strand transfer or template switching. Although two obligatory strand transfers take place from terminal sequences to complete genomic replication (2Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Google Scholar, 9Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Goff A.P. Skalka A.M. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 49-83Google Scholar), template switching has also been shown in vivo to take place from internal regions (7Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Google Scholar,10Vartanian J.P. Meyerhans A. Asjo B. Wain-Hobson S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1779-1788Google Scholar, 11Clavel F. Hoggan M.D. Willey R.L. Strebel K.

Retroviral recombination events are mostly homology-driven; however, non-homologous transfers have also been shown to take place 1/100 to 1/1000 times less commonly (13Zhang J. Temin H.M. Science. 1993; 259: 234-238Google Scholar). Although recombination has been proposed to occur both during minus and plus strand DNA synthesis (14Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Google Scholar, 15Skalka A.M. Boone L. Junghans R. Luk D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 19: 293-304Google Scholar), most transfers occur during minus strand DNA synthesis (16Hu W.S.

It has been suggested that RT makes a “forced copy choice” transfer when it encounters a break in the RNA template, thereby allowing completion of minus strand synthesis (14Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Google Scholar). This model was later modified to include transfers that take place in the absence of breaks in the RNA, by means of a “copy choice” (21Xu H. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8553-8557Google Scholar). Recombination during plus strand DNA synthesis is described by the “strand displacement-assimilation” mechanism (15Skalka A.M. Boone L. Junghans R. Luk D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 19: 293-304Google Scholar, 22Hunter E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1978; 79: 295-309Google Scholar). By this process information exchange would take place as a displaced cDNA fragment anneals and becomes incorporated into the co-packaged molecule. In vitro systems designed to study recombination using purified nucleic acids and enzymes indicated that RNase H cleavages are important for transfers from RNA substrates (23Luo G.X. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Google Scholar, 24Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Google Scholar). Subsequent work suggested that pausing of RT during primer extension on the donor template promoted strand transfer (25DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar, 26DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Google Scholar). Positions of transfer were found to correlate with sequences and structures that caused pausing (25DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar, 26DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Google Scholar, 27Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Google Scholar). It was proposed that stalling of RT at the pause site would allow the RNase H to make a group of adjacent cuts in the template. This donor template degradation would then facilitate interaction of the primer with the acceptor template behind the RT leading to the initiation of the transfer process. In vivo work using the deletion of direct repeat sequences to model template switching corroborate these early insights (28Brincat J.L. Pfeiffer J.K. Telesnitsky A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 88-95Google Scholar, 29Hwang C.K. Svarovskaia E.S. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12209-12214Google Scholar, 30Svarovskaia E.S. Delviks K.A. Hwang C.K. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7171-7178Google Scholar). The process of RT stalling and degradation of the template were found to be dynamic processes, in which an appropriate balance between the two catalytic activities lead to productive transfers (30Svarovskaia E.S. Delviks K.A. Hwang C.K. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7171-7178Google Scholar). Also, the presence of secondary structures between the repeated sequences appeared to increase the efficiency of the process (29Hwang C.K. Svarovskaia E.S. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12209-12214Google Scholar). Despite recent progress toward an understanding of the many factors that lead to a template switching event, the relationship between the location of pause sites induced by secondary structures and the point of genetic shift, where the primer transfers from donor to acceptor, remains unclear. The highly structured HIV-1 TAR hairpin causes RT to stall as synthesis reaches the base of the hairpin (31Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Google Scholar). Template switching on such a template yielded the paradoxical result that more transfers took place in the loop region than at the pause site at the base of the hairpin. A model where interactions between complementary regions of the hairpins in the donor and acceptor would determine the location of transfers was proposed. In a related manner, stimulation of strand transfers in vitro by the dimerization initiation sequence hairpin, which promotes template-template interaction, was also consistent with a role for hairpin interactions in promoting transfers (32Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Google Scholar). We set out to extend and clarify previous results by examining template switching in the context of a stable hairpin containing template. We also explored the role of nucleocapsid protein (NC) on the mechanism of transfer. NC functions as an RNA chaperone by promoting the formation of the more thermodynamically stable conformations of nucleic acids (33Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Google Scholar, 34Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Google Scholar, 35Tsuchihashi Z. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5863-5870Google Scholar). NC also reduces the amount of nonspecific priming during reverse transcription (36Li X. Quan Y. Arts E.J. Li Z. Preston B.D. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4996-5004Google Scholar, 37Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Google Scholar, 38Driscoll M.D. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8785-8792Google Scholar) as well as enhancing minus and plus strand transfers (37Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Google Scholar, 39Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Google Scholar, 40Guo J. Wu T. Anderson J. Kane B.F. Johnson D.G. Gorelick R.J. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8980-8988Google Scholar). NC has been found to influence primer elongation efficiency and processivity (41Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar, 42Klasens B.I. Huthoff H.T. Das A.T. Jeeninga R.E. Berkhout B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 355-370Google Scholar, 43Wu W. Henderson L.E. Copeland T.D. Gorelick R.J. Bosche W.J. Rein A. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7132-7142Google Scholar). Also, NC has been reported to affect the location of transfers without altering the pausing profile during reverse transcription, an observation primarily attributed to its effects on RNA secondary structure (44Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Google Scholar). We report evidence that during transfers from hairpin structures the point of invasion is separate from the point of primer terminus transfer. Our results are consistent with a model in which template switching proceeds through a two-step mechanism. We report evidence that during transfers from hairpin structures the point of invasion is separate from the point of primer terminus transfer. Transfers are initiated through cDNA-acceptor interactions well behind the primer terminus, followed by primer terminus transfer, which completes the process. NC protein, although it increased the efficiency of the transfer process, did not cause a redistribution of the location of transfers. Recombinant HIV-1 RT (p66-p51 heterodimer,40,000 units/mg) was provided by the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Chemically synthesized nucleocapsid protein (1–72) NCp7 was generously provided by Dr. Bernard P. Roques (45de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Google Scholar). NC was stored at −80 °C in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mmdithiothreitol. DH5α-competent cells, XbaI, andEcoRI were from Invitrogen. Radiolabeled compounds were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Micro Bio-Spin columns were from Bio-Rad. Plasmid purification kits were from Qiagen. All DNA primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The plasmids pBluescript II SK(+) and pGEM9zf(−) were obtained from Stratagene and Promega, respectively. All other products were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The donor construct pEIAV-Donor was created in the following manner. Oligonucleotides JK28 and JK30 (JK28, 5′-CGGCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCTACTCAGTCCCTGTCTCTAGTTTGTCTGTTCGAGATCCT; JK30, 5′-ACAGACAAACTAGAGACAGGGACTGAGTAGACCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGCCGACT; underlined regions correspond to complementary sequences) and JK29 and JK31 (JK29, 5′-ACAGTTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACCTGAGAGGCCCGCAGACCATACCTGA; JK31, 5′-AGCTTCAGGTATGGTCTGCGGGCCTCTCAGGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCAACTGTAGGATCTCGA), which were complementary to each other, were annealed to form the JK28/JK30 and JK29/JK31 double-stranded fragments. The JK28/JK30 and JK29/JK31 duplexes were ligated to each other and into pGEM9zf(−) between SfiI and HindIII using T4 DNA ligase, creating pEIAV-Donor. The ligated fragment contains the T7 promoter and the entire donor sequence derived from the EIAV PBS region. The pEIAV acceptor AI-2 construct was generated using a similar approach. JK24 and JK26 (JK24, 5′-ACAGTTGGCGCCCGTACAGGGACCTGAGTGGCCGGCAGACCTTACCTGA; JK26, 5′-AGCTTCAGGTAAGGTCTGCCGGCCACTCAGGTCCCTGTACGGGCGCCAACTGTAGGAACTCGA) and JK23 and JK25 (JK23, 5′-CGGCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATAAATATAACGGTCAACTCAGTCCCTGTCACTAGTTTGTCTGTTCGAGTTCCT; JK25, 5′-ACAGACAAACTAGTGACAGGGACTGAGTTGACCGTTATATTTATCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGCCGACT) were annealed to each other to create a double-stranded DNA fragments with sticky ends. The duplexes were ligated to each other and into theSfiI- and HindIII-digested pGEM-9Zf(−) plasmid. The pEIAV Acceptor-2 plasmid was modified to make an RNA product with point mutations. The point mutations were designed such that the secondary structure within the transcribed RNA was preserved. pAcceptor AI-1 was created by PCR mutagenesis of pEIAV acceptor AI-2. A first round of PCR was carried out using primers EIAVmt1#2 and EIAVmt1#3 (EIAVmt1#2, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATAAATATAAGGGTCAACTC; EIAVmt1#3, 5′-TAGTAAGCTTCAGGTATGGTCAGCGGGCCACTCAGG), followed by a second round of PCR using primers EIAVmt1 #1 and EIAVmt1 #3 (EIAV mt1 #3, 5′-TAGTAAGCTTCAGGTATGGTCAGCGGGCCACTCAGG). The fragments were purified and doubly digested and ligated into an SfiI- andHindIII-digested pGEM-9Zf(−) plasmid. RNA templates were generated by run-off transcription in vitro from linearized plasmids using T7 RNA polymerase, as per the manufacturer's protocol. The pEIAV-Donor was linearized withNotI and BstNI to generate DI and DL donor templates, respectively, whereas the pEIAV-A2 was linearized withNotI, HindIII, and HaeIII to generate the AL, AI-2, and AS acceptor templates, respectively. pEIAV-A1 was linearized with HindIII to generate the AI-2 acceptor. RNA substrates were gel-purified and integrity-tested. DNA primers or RNA templates (RNA templates first calf intestine phosphatase-treated) were labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Unincorporated nucleotides were separated using P-30 Micro Bio-Spin columns. 25 fmol of donor RNA (either labeled or unlabeled) and 50 fmol of primer (either labeled or unlabeled) were brought to a final volume of 10 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and slow cooled to room temperature. Donor DI was primed for reverse transcription with the DNA oligonucleotide SP6 (5′-TACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG) and donor DL with rr11 (5′-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGA). Donor extension, strand transfer, and RNase H assays were carried out in a final volume of 12 μl. Two units of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (50 ng) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 25/50 fmol (donor/primer) of hybridized substrate. Reactions were started through the addition of dNTPs and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mm and 50 μm, respectively. RNase H assays were performed with 5′-end donor RNA and unlabeled primer, whereas extension reactions were performed with labeled primer. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and stopped at the appropriate time by adding 1 volume of gel loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1% each of xylene cyanole and bromphenol blue). Strand transfer reactions were carried out under the same conditions as extension assays, except that acceptor was included in the annealing reactions. For blocking oligonucleotide EIAV-3 (5′-CAGACCATACCTGAAGCTTAC) containing a 3′-phosphate modification was added to the reaction mixture at the same time as the start mix. Reaction products were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide-urea gels, visualized using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). NC was added to the reactions prior to the addition of RT and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. A 100% NC coating was calculated by assuming that each NC molecule would cover seven nucleotides and that all nucleic acids would be completely covered. Titrations of NC as well as cloning and sequencing of transfer products were carried out using a 1:1 donor to acceptor ratio. To determine the transfer distribution, the transfer products were isolated, amplified, cloned, and sequenced as described previously (31Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Google Scholar). Primers JK32b/EcoRI (5′-GACTGGAATTCGTCGATATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′) and JK33/XbaI (5′-TGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAACTAGGGATAAATATAA-3′) were used in the PCR amplification. Amplified fragments were doubly digested, purified, and cloned into theEcoRI/XbaI sites of pBluescript II SK(+). Individual colonies were picked and sequenced by automated sequencing using the M13 Reverse (−27) primer from Integrated DNA Technologies. Each clone represented an individual transfer event, and its sequence was used to determine the point of crossover between donor and acceptor. Previous analyses of strand transfer from HIV-1 TAR RNA templatesin vitro demonstrated that, although the helix region of hairpins induced strong pausing, most transfers occurred 20–80 nucleotides beyond the observed pause site (31Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Google Scholar). In this study we set out to dissect the transfer reaction on a different hairpin containing RNA template and specifically determine the basis for the observed distribution of internal transfers. We employed a recombination assay similar to that of Kim et al. (31Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Google Scholar) in which synthesis is initiated at a primer annealed upstream of the hairpin on the donor template. The primer could transfer to a longer acceptor template, which was homologous to the donor template in the region of the hairpin. Periodic base substitutions on the acceptor were used as markers to determine the points of transfer. To extend our studies to other substrates that contain stable secondary structures, a sequence from the Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) genome was chosen based on its ability to form a stable hairpin structure. The viral sequence extended from nucleotide position +278 to +349 (46Kawakami T. Sherman L. Dahlberg J. Gazit A. Yaniv A. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Virology. 1987; 158: 300-312Google Scholar) and includes the primer binding site (PBS). The secondary structure for this region, shown in Fig.1 A, was predicted usingmfold (47Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 11-43Google Scholar, 48Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Google Scholar) in combination with RNase T1 probing (data not shown). The hairpin sequences of all donor and acceptor molecules shown in Fig. 1 B were predicted to fold in a similar manner. Primer extensions were carried out on the donor DI, in the absence of acceptor, to examine full-length (FL) and pause products (Fig.2 A). Full-length extension to the end of the donor gave rise to a 136-nucleotide-long product (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–6). In the presence of the acceptor template, a 149-nucleotide transfer product (TP) was also detected (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). Because the full-length cDNA contains complementary hairpin stem sequences that can fold back on itself, it can self-prime to produce a 194-nucleotide long fold back (FB) product. Extension products were numbered starting with +1 as the nucleotide complementary to the 5′ nucleotide of the donor and increasing in the direction of the primer. In addition to these major extension products, RT paused briefly at other positions as evidenced by primers partially extended to those positions at the time of sampling (Fig. 2 A). Two strong pause sites were seen corresponding to the cytosine residue at position +78 and the guanine at +79. The location of these two distinct pause products is consistent with slowing of synthesis caused by the need to strand displace the hairpin stem, an effect also seen by others (41Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar, 49DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 270-280Google Scholar, 50Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14778-14785Google Scholar, 51Harrison G.P. Mayo M.S. Hunter E. Lever A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3433-3442Google Scholar). Minor pause products were also seen at positions +57, +44, and +16. RNA folding predictions suggest that these pauses are at the bases of new hairpins that are formed transiently as the RNA refolds when RT opens up the original structure. Using a 5′-end-labeled DI substrate and unlabeled primer, we determined the relationship between pausing and RNase H cleavage during reverse transcription (Fig. 2 B). Two major sets of cleavage products were seen. The first set appeared as early as 1 min and was produced by cuts at positions +98, +94, and +91. The locations of these cuts are consistent with a concentration of RNase H-directed cleavages by RTs stalled with their polymerase active sites at +78 and +79. These products were eventually cleaved to smaller fragments, consistent with the progression of synthesis and periodic RNase H cuts. Later in the reaction, products appear from cleavages at positions +18, +13, and +11 and progressively increase in intensity (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5–7). These cuts are characteristic of those observed when the RT reaches the 5′-end of an RNA template (24Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Google Scholar). Although numerous other minor bands appear, the transient appearance of the pause-related products and the accrual of terminal products are the main features of the reaction. A strong pause site at the base of the hairpin and concomitant RNase H cleavages were also observed with the HIV-1 TAR hairpin (31Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Google Scholar), consistent with the general ability of stable hairpins to promote pause-specific RNase H cleavages. Transfer efficiency is a measure of how frequently switching is occurring between two templates. It is defined as the ratio of transfer product to the total amount of full-length products of reverse transcription, including fold-back product. An initial characterization of the transfer efficiency between DI and acceptor AI-1 yielded a value of 53% (Fig.3 A). To analyze the locations of template switching, the transfer products were gel-purified, PCR-amplified, and cloned. Individual colonies were sequenced and were assumed each to represent a single transfer event. Close to 70% of transfers took place after marker 7, and probably after RT synthesized to the end of the donor (Fig. 2 C, black bars). The remaining 30% of the transfers were internal; 25% occurred within the loop (between markers 4 and 6) and 4% at the base of the hairpin. These results demonstrated that transfer within the EIAV-derived hairpin templates behaved in a similar manner to those observed in HIV-1 TAR, where 70% of transfers occurred from the end of the template (31Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Google Scholar). The distance between markers is not equal throughout the template. Therefore, we found it informative to normalize our distribution to the number of nucleotides between markers. To do so, we divided the percentage of transfers in each segment by the number of nucleotides within that segment and then multiplied that value by 10. The normalized data show that the loop of the hairpin supported more transfers on a per nucleotide than the base (white bars in Fig. 2, C and D). To clearly distinguish end transfers from internal ones, the AI-2 acceptor was prepared (Fig. 1 B). Acceptor AI-2 did not contain marker 1a but had the two additional markers 2 and 8. They comprised the last nucleotide that is reverse-transcribed on the donor and its complementary nucleotide at the base of the hairpin (Fig.1 A). Thus, exclusion of this marker on any transfer product implies that template switching occurred after synthesis to the end of the donor. A maximum transfer efficiency of 20.4% was measured with the combination of AI-2 and DI (Fig. 3 A). This was less than half the value obtained with AI-1. We reasoned that the presence of marker 8 was interfering with the end transfers by creating a situation where the transferred primer when annealed to the acceptor presented RT with a mismatched primer terminus. Sequence analysis of the transfer products on AI-2 supported this conclusion, where only 8% of transfers had occurred from the end (Fig. 2 D, black bars). More importantly, the preferred sites of internal transfers remained similar to those of AI-1. Most transfers took place in the loop of the hairpin (43% from markers 4 through 6) and the base of the hairpin (20% from markers 1 through 3). Therefore, the marker allocation in acceptor AI-2 remained suitable for addressing the distribution and mechanisms of internal strand transfers. The normalized distribution showed marker segments 7–8 and 1–2 as preferred sites of transfer (Fig. 2 D, white bars). This indicates that the large number of transfers at the loop of the hairpin is partly due to the distance between the markers. However, even after normalizing for length, segment 4–5 was still 75% as effective as segment 1–2 at the base of the hairpin, in promoting transfers. Thus, although the strong pause"

All 11 enzymes that were active toward dinucleoside polyphosphates with 4 or more phosphate groups as substrates were also able to hydrolyze PRPP, whereas the 6 that could not and that have coenzyme A, NDP-sugars, or pyridine nucleotides as preferred substrates did not degrade PRPP. The products of hydrolysis were ribose 1,5-bisphosphate and Pi. Active PRPP pyrophosphatases included the diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase (DIPP) subfamily of Nudix hydrolases, which also degrade the non-nucleotide diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. K m andk cat values for PRPP hydrolysis for theDeinococcus radiodurans DR2356 (di)nucleoside polyphosphate hydrolase, the human diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, and human DIPP-1 (diadenosine hexaphosphate and diphosphoinositol polyphosphate hydrolase) were 1 mm and 1.5 s−1, 0.13 mm and 0.057 s−1, and 0.38 mm and 1.0 s−1, respectively. Active site mutants of theCaenorhabditis elegans diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase had no activity, confirming that the same active site is responsible for nucleotide and PRPP hydrolysis. Comparison of the specificity constants for nucleotide, diphosphoinositol polyphosphate, and PRPP hydrolysis suggests that PRPP is a significant substrate for theD. radiodurans DR2356 enzyme and for the DIPP subfamily. In the latter case, generation of the glycolytic activator ribose 1,5-bisphosphate may be a new function for these enzymes.

In the latter case, generation of the glycolytic activator ribose 1,5-bisphosphate may be a new function for these enzymes. The Nudix hydrolases are members of an enzyme family that was named after their ability to hydrolyze predominantly the pyrophosphate linkage in a variety of compounds having the general structure of a nucleoside diphosphate (Npp) linked to another moiety, X, with varying degrees of specificity (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Google Scholar, 2McLennan A.G. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 79-89Google Scholar). Thus, nucleoside triphosphates (Npp-p), dinucleoside polyphosphates (Npp-pnN), nucleotide sugars (Npp-sugar), NADH, and coenzyme A are examples of Nudix hydrolase substrates that fall into this category. In general terms, the members of this protein family are believed to rid the cell of potentially deleterious endogenous nucleotide metabolites and to modulate the accumulation of metabolic intermediates by diverting them into alternative pathways in response to biochemical need, although specific regulatory functions may also be associated with individual members (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Google Scholar). Recently, a subfamily of Nudix hydrolases has been described that hydrolyze the long chain dinucleoside and nucleoside polyphosphates, including diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1The abbreviations used are: Ap6A, diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1,P 6-hexaphosphate; Ap4A, diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1,P 4-tetraphosphate; Ap5A, diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1,P 5-pentaphosphate; ApnA, diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1,P n-polyphosphate; DIPP, diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase; NUDT, Nudix-type gene; PP-InsP5, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate; [PP]2-InsP4, bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate; Rib-1-P, ribose 1-phosphate; Rib-5-P, ribose 5-phosphate; Rib-1, 5-P2, ribose 1,5-bisphosphate ,P 6-hexaphosphate (Ap6A), 1diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1,P 5-pentaphosphate (Ap5A), and adenosine 5′-pentaphosphate (p5A) but which have relatively low activity with diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1,P 4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A). Most interestingly, these enzymes also act as phosphohydrolases toward the non-nucleotide substrates, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-InsP5) and bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate ([PP]2-InsP4), with varying degrees of efficiency relative to the nucleotide substrates. Structurally and mechanistically, they are closely related within the Nudix family to the well studied Ap4A hydrolases (3Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Google Scholar, 4Guranowski A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 117-139Google Scholar), although the latter enzymes do not appear to utilize PP-InsP5 or [PP]2-InsP4 as substrates (5Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Google Scholar). So far, four distinct genes (excluding pseudogenes) and five distinct gene products in this Ap6A hydrolase/diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase (DIPP) subfamily have been described in mammalian cells, DIPP-1 (NUDT3) (6Safrany S.T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3649-3655Google Scholar) appear to have one each. PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 are also substrates for the g5R Nudix hydrolase encoded by African Swine Fever virus (13Cartwright J.L. Safrany S.T. Dixon L.K. Darzynkiewicz E. Stepinski J. Burke R. McLennan A.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1415-1421Google Scholar). Several of these enzymes have high affinities and highk cat/K m ratios for the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, suggesting that these compounds may be important substrates in vivo. They may be involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking (14Ye W.L. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Google Scholar), apoptosis (15Morrison B.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23755-23763Google Scholar); hence, the DIPP Nudix hydrolases have also been implicated in these processes. The ability of this subset of Nudix hydrolases to utilize a sugar pyrophosphate as a substrate prompted us to test another such compound of known biological importance, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). PRPP is both a substrate and regulator of purine, pyrimidine, and pyridine nucleotide synthesis (18Bagnara A.S. Letter A.A. Henderson J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 374: 259-270Google Scholar, 19Holmes E.W. Wyngaarden J.B. Kelley W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6035-6040Google Scholar, 20Becker M.A. Kim M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a potential product of pyrophosphatase activity acting upon PRPP is ribose 1,5-bisphosphate (Rib-1,5-P2), which has recently been shown to be a physiological regulator of glycolysis and the fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphosphate cycle (26Kawaguchi T.

Here, we show that Nudix hydrolases of the DIPP subfamily and the related Ap4A hydrolases all exhibit PRPP pyrophosphatase activity, whereas Nudix hydrolases previously shown to be specific for NDP-sugars, pyridine nucleotides, and coenzyme A are unable to hydrolyze PRPP.

Recombinant human Ap4A hydrolase, Deinococcus radioduranscoenzyme A pyrophosphatase (DR1184 gene product), and D. radiodurans ApnA hydrolase (DR2356 gene product) were prepared by procedures similar to those used for the C. elegans Ap4A hydrolase. 5D. I. Fisher, J. L. Cartwright, and A. G. McLennan, unpublished data. PRPP and all nucleotides were from Sigma. The EnzChek® phosphate assay kit was from Molecular Probes. Initial screening of enzyme preparations for their ability to release Pi from PRPP was carried out using a phosphomolybdate colorimetric assay (33Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Google Scholar). Purified enzymes (5 μg) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm Mg acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm PRPP in a total volume of 200 μl and the reactions stopped by the addition of the molybdate detection reagent. Enzymes testing negative in an initial screen were retested with up to 12 μg of protein per assay. Kinetic constants for PRPP hydrolysis by selected enzymes were calculated from initial rates determined using a sensitive continuous spectrophotometric assay based on the phosphate-dependent conversion of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside to 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose-1-phosphate catalyzed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (34Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Google Scholar). For this, the EnzChek® assay kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications: reactions were preincubated for 5 min without substrate at 37 °C in 50 mm BisTrisPropane buffer, pH 8.5, 5 mm Mg acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then incubated with substrate for up to 2 min. Final enzyme concentrations were 75 μg/ml (human Ap4A hydrolase), 15.2 μg/ml (DIPP-1), and 7 μg/ml (D. radioduransApnA hydrolase). In each case, controls lacking substrate or enzyme were performed. The products of PRPP hydrolysis by the D. radiodurans ApnA hydrolase were generated by incubation of 0.2 mm PRPP with 7 μg of enzyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm Mg acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions (200 μl) were stopped by freezing and then applied to a 1-ml Resource-Q column (Pharmacia) at 2 ml/min in 35 mm NH4HCO3, pH 9.6. The elution system consisted of a gradient of 5–100% buffer A (0.7 mNH4HCO3, pH 9.6) in water over 10 min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and the presence of products determined by colorimetric determination of phosphate released after incubation with alkaline phosphatase or inorganic pyrophosphatase as required (33Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Google Scholar, 35Canales J. Pinto R.M. Costas M.J. Hernández M.T. Miró A. Bernet D. Fernández A. Cameselle J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 167-177Google Scholar). Ap4A hydrolase activity was determined luminometrically as previously described (3Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the Coomassie Blue binding method (36Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Google Scholar). Positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry was performed as previously described (11Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8604-8610Google Scholar). A total of 17 different Nudix hydrolases were tested for their ability to hydrolyze PRPP. The assay employed measures the release of inorganic phosphate. As can be seen from Table I, all 11 enzymes that can utilize dinucleoside polyphosphates with 4 or more phosphate groups as substrates are also able to hydrolyze PRPP, whereas the 6 that cannot and that have coenzyme A, NDP-sugars, or pyridine nucleotides as preferred substrates do not degrade PRPP. It should be stressed that the rates quoted of micromoles of Pi produced min−1·micromoles protein−1 are not directly convertible to true k cat values because a standard set of conditions, including a fixed PRPP concentration of 200 μm, was employed for all assays and so is not necessarily optimal for each enzyme. Therefore, the rank order of PRPP hydrolase activity should only be taken as a guide. Because PRPP is known to undergo spontaneous, Mg2+-dependent non-enzymic hydrolysis (37Dennis A.L. Puskas M. Stasaitis S. Sandwick R.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 73-80Google Scholar, 38Trembacz H. Jezewska M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 621-625Google Scholar), it was important to establish that the observed activity was enzyme-catalyzed. This is clearly demonstrated by the lack of degradation by two active site mutants of the C. elegansAp4A hydrolase (Table I). In common with other Nudix hydrolases, substitution of Glu residues in the Nudix motif by Gln dramatically reduced activity of this enzyme toward Ap4A. Compared with the wild type value of 23 s−1, the C. elegans E52Q and E56Q mutants have k catvalues for Ap4A of 0.0052 and 0.00024 s−1, respectively.2 They are also completely inactive with PRPP. This establishes that the same active site is responsible for Ap4A and PRPP hydrolysis. The same is assumed to hold true for the other enzymes.Table IUtilization of PRPP as a substrate by several Nudix hydrolasesEnzymeActivity (μmol of Pi produced/min−1 · μmol protein−1)D. radioduransApnA hydrolase8.8Human DIPP-13.9Human Ap4A hydrolase2.1Human DIPP-2α1.8Human Aps1 (DIPP-3β)1.5C. elegans Ap4A hydrolase (wild type)0.64C. elegans Ap4A hydrolase (E52Q)0C. elegans Ap4A hydrolase (E56Q)0S. typhimurium YgdP Ap4A hydrolase0.60Human Aps2 (DIPP-3α)0.56Human DIPP-2β0.44S. cerevisiae Ddp1p Ap6A hydrolase0.29African Swine Fever virus g5R protein+aTested positive in an initial screen but was not quantified because of lack of material.D. radiodurans DR1184 coenzyme A pyrophosphatase0S. cerevisiae Pcd1p coenzyme A pyrophosphatase0Mouse Nudt7 coenzyme A pyrophosphatase0S. cerevisiae Npy1p NADH pyrophosphatase0Human NUDT5 ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase0Human NUDT9 ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase0The sources of the enzymes listed are shown in “Experimental Procedures.”a Tested positive in an initial screen but was not quantified because of lack of material.

D. radiodurans DR2356 ApnA hydrolase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes a variety of nucleoside and dinucleoside polyphosphates, including p4A, p5A, Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A.5It has no activity toward diphosphoinositol polyphosphates4; however, it readily hydrolyzes PRPP with aK m of 1 mm and ak cat of 1.5 s−1 (TableII). For comparison,K m and k cat values for Ap4A were determined to be 30 μm and 0.035 s−1, respectively, resulting in similar specificity constants (k cat /K m) for both substrates (Table II). Human Ap4A hydrolase also hydrolyzed PRPP with a k cat of 0.057 s−1 and aK m of 0.13 mm (Table II). In this case, however, the specificity constant with PRPP was some 20,000-fold lower than that found with Ap4A as substrate. Finally, human DIPP-1 was the most efficient of the three enzymes at PRPP hydrolysisin vitro with a k cat of 1.0 s−1 and a K m of 0.38 mm(Table II). The specificity constant with PRPP of 2,600 was 325- and 18,000-fold lower than those previously measured with Ap6A and PP-InsP5, respectively (5Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R.

Values quoted for substrate concentrations in vivo are typical literature values but may vary by one order of magnitude in either direction depending on physiological conditions. Because all Nudix hydrolases cleave pyrophosphate linkages, it was anticipated that they would remove the β-phosphate from the pyrophosphate moiety attached to the ribose C1. Using theD. radiodurans DR2356 ApnA hydrolase as an example enzyme, the products of hydrolysis were first separated by anion-exchange HPLC, fractions collected and incubated with alkaline phosphatase, and the Pi released determined colorimetrically. Two products, A and B, were observed that co-chromatographed with Pi and PPi, respectively (Fig. 1). Peak area integration showed the ratio of phosphate released from PRPP, B, and A to be exactly 3:2:1. Because A did not co-chromatograph with ribose-1-phosphate (Rib-1-P) or ribose 5-phosphate (Rib-5-P) it must be Pi. Product B could be Rib-1,5-P2, ribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, 5-phosphoribosyl 1,2-(cyclic) phosphate (37Dennis A.L. Puskas M. Stasaitis S. Sandwick R.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 73-80Google Scholar, 38Trembacz H. Jezewska M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 621-625Google Scholar), or, less likely, PPi itself. Therefore, a sample of product B was subjected to TLC before and after acid treatment. Acid removes phosphate from the anomeric C1 but not from C5, and ribose and derivatives with an unesterified C1 hydroxyl can be detected after TLC by AgNO3 treatment (38Trembacz H. Jezewska M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 621-625Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the TLC plate after AgNO3 treatment. It can clearly be seen that product B was not detected by AgNO3 before acid treatment because it has an esterified C1-OH (lane C); however, after acid treatment, product B generated a visible spot that co-chromatographed with Rib-5-P and acid-treated PRPP (lane F). This indicates that product B must be Rib-1,5-P2. This identification was confirmed by positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. B had a mass of 333 Da, corresponding to the monosodium salt of Rib-1,5-P2 (not shown). A cyclic phosphate product would have had a mass 17 Da less. Therefore it can be concluded that the D. radiodurans DR2356 ApnA hydrolase is a PRPP pyrophosphatase producing Rib-1,5-P2 and Pi from PRPP. The products of PRPP hydrolysis generated by the human Ap4A hydrolase had the same HPLC retention times as those produced by the D. radiodurans DR2356 Ap4A hydrolase. Therefore, given the conserved reaction mechanism employed by all Nudix hydrolases, it seems highly likely that Rib-1,5-P2 and Pi are the products in all cases.Figure 2TLC analysis of the ribose-containing product of PRPP hydrolysis by the D. radiodurans DR2356 ApnA hydrolase. A, cellulose TLC plate (Merck, 0.1 mm) was spotted with five 200-nl aliquots each of 10 mm Rib-1-P (lane A), PRPP (lane B), ribose (lane D), and Rib-5-P (lane E), and also samples of the same compounds previously treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 25 mm HCl: PRPP (lane G), Rib-1-P (lane H), ribose (lane I), and Rib-5-P (lane J). The peak fraction of product B from Fig. 1 was freeze-dried, dissolved in 20 μl of H2O; 10 μl of this was treated with HCl as above. Five 200-nl aliquots of untreated (lane C) and acid-treated (lane F) product were applied to the TLC plate. The plate was developed and spots located as described in Ref. 38Trembacz H. Jezewska M.M.

First, they have implications for the specificity and physiological function(s) of Nudix hydrolases, particularly the DIPP/ApnA hydrolases, and secondly, they impact on the metabolism of PRPP and the generation from it of the regulatory molecule Rib-1,5-P2. Regarding the enzymes themselves, the surprising ability of the active sites of the DIPPs to accommodate two seemingly unrelated sets of substrates, the diadenosine and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates, has already been highlighted (5Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W. Cartwright J.L. Falck J.R. McLennan A.G. Barnes L.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21735-21740Google Scholar). The use of PRPP as a substrate by these enzymes makes this easier to understand. Modeling of PRPP onto the crystal structure of the C. elegans Ap4A hydrolase (39Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Google Scholar) shows that it can fit readily into the substrate-binding cleft with its 5-phosphate located in the exact position occupied by the P 1 phosphate of Ap4A and the α-phosphate of the pyrophosphate moiety located where the attacked P4phosphate of Ap4A lies (Fig.3). The same water (or hydroxyl) responsible for nucleophilic attack at P4 could attack this α-phosphate. This model is consistent with the requirement for the catalytic residues Glu52 and Glu56 in theC. elegans Ap4A hydrolase. The β-phosphate of the pyrophosphate group can readily occupy the position of the ribose moiety of the ‘AMP product’ of Ap4A because this is already known to accommodate the P5 phosphate of Ap5A and to lie outside the protein structure. The ribose ring of PRPP occupies the same position as the P2 and P3 phosphates of Ap4A. The substrate-binding cleft is wide at this point, and the residue side chains in this region are either small (Ala5, Ala25, Thr33, and Gly37) or are highly mobile and lack electron density in the crystal structure of theC. elegans hydrolase (Tyr27); therefore, a variety of structures may be accommodated in this region because it appears to provide few, if any, phosphate-specific contacts. A major determinant of the stability of the C. elegansAp4A hydrolase-PRPP complex is probably the binding of the 5-phosphate by salt bridges/H-bonds to His31, Lys36, Tyr76, and Lys83. These residues are important for binding the P 1 phosphate of Ap4A (39Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Google Scholar). Stacking of the adenosine moiety attached to P 1 between the aromatic rings of Tyr76 and Tyr121 does not seem to be as critical for Ap4A binding as was predicted from the crystal structure. We have found that mutation of both Tyr residues to Ala still yields active Ap4A hydrolase with a 20-fold lowerk cat (1.1 s−1) and only a 4-fold higher K m (33 μm) for Ap4A.2 Thus, the binding of the PRPP phosphates on C5 and C1 as in Ap4A and the accommodation of the ribose in a relatively nonspecific region of the binding cleft appear to be sufficient to allow PRPP to behave as a substrate for the C. elegans Ap4A hydrolase. Similar arguments presumably apply to the other Ap4A hydrolases and DIPPs and to the ability of the DIPPs to bind diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. This model also explains why the Nudix hydrolases with specificities for NADH, NDP-sugars, and coenzyme A do not accept PRPP as a substrate. These enzymes do not have a second phosphate binding site (like P 1) located the required distance away from the catalytic binding site (like P4). Only enzymes able to hydrolyze nucleotide substrates with four or more phosphates in the polyphosphate chain should bind PRPP. These results emphasize the point that certain Nudix hydrolases can also accept non-nucleotide substrates and should prompt the search for other such substrates that satisfy these minimal binding requirements. Is PRPP a physiologically relevant substrate for any of the enzyme studies here? According to the measured specificity constants, at least for the eukaryotic enzymes, the diadenosine and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates appear to be highly favored over PRPP. However, this does not take into account the relative substrate concentrationsin vivo. Literature values for the intracellular concentration of PRPP vary considerably and have been reported in different units. However, taking various measurements for prokaryotes (25Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1148-1152Google Scholar, 40Petersen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5348-5356Google Scholar, 41Stuer-Lauridsen B. Nygaard P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 457-463Google Scholar) and eukaryotes (20Becker M.A. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14531-14537Google Scholar, 26Kawaguchi T. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28554-28561Google Scholar, 42Hisata T. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 68: 448-457Google Scholar, 43May S.R. Krooth R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 389-401Google Scholar, 44Peters G.J. Veerkamp J.H. Int. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 885-888Google Scholar) and applying the unit conversion factors of Traut (45Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Google Scholar) suggests that prokaryotes typically have a PRPP steady-state concentration of around 1 mm,whereas in eukaryotes (excluding erythrocytes) it is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower, although it can be as high as 0.4 mm in mouse fibroblasts deficient in adenine and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferases (43May S.R. Krooth R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 389-401Google Scholar, 45Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Google Scholar). The measured K mvalues for PRPP for all three enzymes are, therefore, within acceptable ranges if PRPP were to be considered a physiologically relevant substrate. The intracellular concentration of Ap4A in unstressed cells is typically 0.1–1.0 μm (46Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fl1992: 29-61Google Scholar), whereas PP-InsP5 may be in the low micromolar range (47Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Google Scholar). There are no measurements of cytoplasmic Ap6A in mammalian cells; an estimate of 32 nm in platelets is an intracellular average because the Ap6A is concentrated in the dense granules (48Jankowski J. Potthoff W. vanderGiet M. Tepel M. Zidek W. Schlüter H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 72-78Google Scholar). Indeed, it is likely to be even lower than the sole measured value for Ap5A of 4 nm inSchizosaccharomyces pombe (52Ingram S.W. Safrany S.T. Barnes L.D. Biochem. J. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Taking the product of the specificity constant and substrate concentration as a better indication of potential substrate utilization in vivo shows that PRPP hydrolysis is likely to be a much more significant reaction in vivo for the D. radiodurans ApnA hydrolase than is Ap4A hydrolysis (Table II). In contrast, the human Ap4A hydrolase is more likely to act upon Ap4A than on PRPP. For DIPP-1, PP-InsP5 still appears to be the favored substrate by virtue of its extremely low K mfor this compound. Nevertheless, the combined activities of members of the DIPP subfamily could still have a significant impact on PRPP hydrolysis in vivo in tissues where more than one is expressed. PRPP pyrophosphatase activity in cell extracts has been detected before. Divalent ion-dependent (49Tax W.J. Veerkamp J.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1978; 59: 219-222Google Scholar) and -independent (50Fox I.H. Marchant P.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 1162-1166Google Scholar) activities were ascribed to acid and alkaline phosphatase, respectively. Like the spontaneous degradation of PRPP, these reactions are believed to proceed via 1,2 and 1,5 cyclic derivatives to Rib-1-P and -5-P and ultimately to ribose with Rib-1,5-P2 as a possible minor intermediate in one pathway (37Dennis A.L. Puskas M. Stasaitis S. Sandwick R.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 73-80Google Scholar, 38Trembacz H. Jezewska M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 621-625Google Scholar). In view of the established mechanisms of Nudix hydrolases and the fact that Ap4A hydrolysis is known to proceed by direct in-line attack of water (51Guranowski A. Brown P. Ashton P.A. Blackburn G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 235-240Google Scholar), a cyclic intermediate is unlikely; generation of Rib-1,5-P2 most probably occurs directly by nucleophilic attack of water on the C1 α-phosphate rather than via a complex route involving the initial internal attack of a ribose hydroxyl. Recently, it has been clearly demonstrated (26Kawaguchi T. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28554-28561Google Scholar) that the rapid rise in Rib-1,5-P2 that occurs in macrophages under hypoxic conditions in parallel with the switch to anaerobic glycolysis is due to a rise in PRPP accompanied by the activation of an unidentified PRPP pyrophosphatase. This activity appears to be divalent ion-independent and may be activated by protein kinase C. Its possible relationship to any of the mammalian Nudix PRPP pyrophosphatases described here is unknown. Nevertheless, it is clear that, at least in mammalian cells, several Nudix hydrolases exist that have the ability to generate Rib-1,5-P2 from PRPP. Like fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, this molecule is a potent activator of phosphofructokinase, is also an inhibitor of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and is believed to be an important regulator of glycolysis (26Kawaguchi T. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28554-28561Google Scholar, 27Sawada M. Mitsui Y. Sugiya H. Furuyama S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 447-454Google Scholar, 28Ogushi S. Lawson J.W.R. Dobson G.P. Veech R.L. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10943-10949Google Scholar). The Nudix PRPP pyrophosphatases must be considered potential generators of Rib-1,5-P2 in vivo and, therefore, regulators of glucose metabolism. Verification of this possibility will require measurements of PRPP and Rib-1,5-P2 in cells in which the relevant Nudix hydrolase activities have been reduced by gene disruption or knockdown.

Recent evidence has indicated that these proteins produce a novel metabolite O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) during deacetylation. Cellular studies have demonstrated that this metabolite exhibits biological effects when microinjected in living cells. However, the molecular targets ofOAADPr remain to be identified. Here we have analyzed the ADP-ribose-specific Nudix family of hydrolases as potential in vivo metabolizing enzymes of OAADPr. In vitro, we found that the ADP-ribose hydrolases (yeast YSA1, mouse NudT5, and human NUDT9) cleaved OAADPr to the products AMP and acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate. Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that YSA1 and NudT5 hydrolyzed OAADPr with similar kinetic constants to those obtained with ADP-ribose as substrate. In dramatic contrast, human NUDT9 was 500-fold less efficient (k cat/K m values) at hydrolyzing OAADPr compared with ADP-ribose. The inability of OAADPr to inhibit the reaction of NUDT9 with ADP-ribose suggests that NUDT9 binds OAADPr with low affinity, likely due to steric considerations of the additional acetylated-ribose moiety. We next explored whether Nudix hydrolytic activities against OAADPr could be observed in cell extracts from yeast and human. Using a detailed analysis of the products generated during the consumption of OAADPr in extracts, we identified two robust enzymatic activities that were not consistent with the known Nudix hydrolases. Instead, we identified cytoplasmic esterase activities that hydrolyze OAADPr to acetate and ADP-ribose, whereas a distinct activity residing in the nucleus is consistent with an OAADPr-specific acetyltransferase. These findings establish for the first time that select members of the ADP-ribose hydrolases are potential targets ofOAADPr metabolism.

The Silent Information Regulator 2 (Sir2) family is a highly conserved group of genes present in the genomes of organisms ranging from archaebacteria to eukaryotes (1Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Google Scholar). The encoded Sir2 proteins are involved in diverse processes ranging from regulation of gene silencing to DNA repair and lifespan extension. The best characterized of these is the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2 gene, which is involved in silencing at telomeres (2Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E.

Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Google Scholar). Besides its role in silencing, Sir2 has been implicated in other cellular processes, including the repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks through non-homologous end-joining (10Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda H. Nature. 1997; 388: 900-903Google Scholar), cell cycle progression, and chromosome stability (11Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Google Scholar). The molecular function of Sir2, which results in the above silencing and cellular processes, has only recently been explored (reviewed in Refs.12Guarente L.

Initial examination of Sir2 molecular function reported a weak ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (16Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Google Scholar, 17Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J. Hilz H. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed Sir2 possesses an intrinsic NAD+-dependent protein and histone deacetylation activity (18Imai S.

More recently it has been shown that Sir2 couples deacetylation to the hydrolysis of a high energy bond in NAD+ and transfers the acetyl group from its protein substrate to ADPr to generate a novel compound,O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) 1The abbreviations used are: OAADPr, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose; Sir2, silent information regulator 2; ADPr, ADP-ribose; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; AP, alkaline phosphatase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; RT, room temperature(22Tanner K.G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Google Scholar). Evidence that OAADPr production is evolutionarily conserved among Sir2 homologs, and that this metabolite may perform a critical function for this class of enzymes has recently been explored (26Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Google Scholar). Furthermore, a quantitative microinjection assay into starfish oocytes and blastomeres demonstrated that OAADPr can cause a delay/block in oocyte maturation and embryo cell division in blastomeres, proposing that OAADPr may posses a unique bioactivity that may be linked to reported physiological effects/functions of Sir2 (26Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Google Scholar). Thus OAADPr could act as a second messenger or metabolite in which other enzymes/proteins may utilize OAADPr to elicit the observed cellular response. Therefore, to clearly understand the biological functions ofOAADPr, the proteins and enzymes that utilize/bindOAADPr should be identified and characterized. A class of enzymes that are capable of hydrolyzing compounds of ADPr and possibly OAADPr include the Nudix Family of hydrolases. This family of enzymes catalyzes the hydrolysis of anucleoside diphosphate linked to another moietyx, hence the acronym “Nudix” (27, reviewed in Ref. 28McLennan A.G. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 79-89Google Scholar). They are found in archaea, eubacteria, animal, plant, and fungi and are characterized by the highly conserved array of amino acids GX 5EX 7REUXEEXGU, where U represents a bulky, hydrophobic amino acid, usually Ile, Leu, or Val and X represents any amino acid (27Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Google Scholar). Based on predictive (29Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4847Google Scholar) and structural studies (30Abeygunawardana C. Weber D.J. Gittis A.G. Frick D.N. Lin J. Miller A.-F. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14997-15005Google Scholar), the Nudix box designates a unique loop-helix-loop motif, involved in the binding of the substrate (31Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Google Scholar) and in catalysis (32Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Google Scholar, 33Mejean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 11: 323-330Google Scholar). The nucleoside diphosphate linkage is the common feature of the wide range of substrates for the family, which include NADH, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide sugars, and (deoxy)ribonucleoside triphosphates. These substrates are thought to be either potentially deleterious compounds, cell signaling molecules, regulators, or metabolic intermediates whose concentrations require modulation during fluctuations of the cellular environment (34O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Google Scholar). Hence, proposed physiological functions of these enzymes are to eliminate potentially toxic nucleotide metabolites from the cell (35Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Google Scholar, 36O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5421-5426Google Scholar) and to regulate the concentrations of nucleotide cofactors and signaling molecules for optimal cell growth and survival (37AbdelRaheim S.R. McLennan A.G. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 5Google Scholar). The purpose of the current study is to investigate the Nudix hydrolase family of enzymes as viable targets of OAADPr metabolism. To explore this idea, we examined the ability of Nudix enzymes, specifically the ADP-ribose (ADPr) hydrolases, to catalyze the hydrolysis of OAADPr. We found that select members of the ADP-ribose hydrolases are capable of efficient hydrolysis ofOAADPr, suggesting that certain members may be crucial in regulating in vivo levels of OAADPr. To examine this possibility, we analyzed endogenous enzymatic activities towardOAADPr from a variety of cellular sources. We show that human HeLa, mouse 3T3 fibroblast, and yeast cell extracts harbor robust enzymatic activities toward OAADPr. However, we demonstrate that the products generated from these cellular activities are not consistent with known Nudix hydrolase activities. This finding raises important biological questions concerning the physiological functions of OAADPr metabolizing enzymes detected in cellular extracts as well as the observed diverse catalytic efficiency of ADPr hydrolases on OAADPr. HeLa S3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 μg/ml l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 3T3 fibroblast cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 μg/mll-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and removed from the culture dish by scraping. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation using a clinical centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and the resulting suspension was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were repelleted in a microcentrifuge by spinning at 14,000 rpm (16,000 × g) for 20 s at 4 °C, then lysed by the addition of ice-cold hypotonic solution (buffer A) consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin and incubating the suspension on ice for 5 min. The suspension was recentrifuged, and the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was collected and stored and −80 °C. The pellet representing the nuclei were lysed in an ice-cold solution (buffer C), consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the DNA binding proteins was combined with an equal volume of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. Yeast cells were cultured to mid-log phase in YPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) with vigorous shaking at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 rpm (1,600 ×g). The net weight of the yeast cells was determined. This weight was said to be equal to the packed cell volume (in milliliters), and for all subsequent steps was considered as 1 volume. Cells were resuspended in 4 volumes if ice-cold water and immediately centrifuged for 5 min at 3,500 rpm (2,170 × g) and 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of glass bead disruption buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, 1 mm PMSF), and a cell paste was created. Four volumes of chilled acid-washed beads (Sigma) were added to the cell paste, the suspension was vortexed at maximum speed for 30 s, and the tubes were placed on ice for 4 min. Vortexing was repeated three times. The glass beads were allowed to settle, and the supernatant was decanted. To remove insoluble protein, the supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 12,000 rpm (15,800 × g). The supernatant, which represents the crude extract, was collected and stored at −80 °C. The presence of an enzymatic activity in HeLa cells that can metabolizeOAADPr was quantitated by incubatingO-[3H]AADPr with HeLa cell nuclear extract and monitoring the loss of radioactivity in theO-[3H]AADPr peak when resolved by reverse-phase HPLC. The standard incubation mixture (100 μl) contained 1.35 mm O-[3H]AADPr and 500 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract. After 0 and 60 min the reaction was terminated by removing 20-μl aliquots of this reaction and added them to 480 μl of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O. All samples were injected onto a Beckman Biosys 510 HPLC system and a Vydac C18 (1.0 × 25 mm) small pore preparative column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Products from the enzymatic conversion of OAADPr were separated using a gradient system comprising solvent A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/H20) and solvent B (0.02% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) and using a constant flow rate of 4 ml/min. Upon injection of the sample, the HPLC was run isocratically in solvent A for 5.0 min followed by a linear gradient of 0–8% B over a 20-min period. TheA 260 absorbing product derived fromOAADPr had a retention time of 6 min and was collected directly from the HPLC after passage through the detector, frozen at −80 °C, lyophilized, and then resuspended in the appropriate buffer for product analysis and identification. In verification of the HeLa cell A 260 absorbing product derived fromOAADPr, either 50 μm ADPr or ADP were co-injected with the OAADPr and HeLa cell reaction mixture. The standard incubation mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.2, 16 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm OAADPr, 1 μg of YSA1 enzyme. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA buffer. Control reactions were incubated without any Nudix enzyme. All reactions were analyzed by HPLC as described above. To determine the elution position of AMP, 50 μm of AMP standard was used. The generation and purification ofOAADPr was performed as described previously (26Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetics were measured by converting substrates, OAADPr or ADPr, to products AMP and acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate or AMP and ribose 5′-phosphate, respectively. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) liberated inorganic phosphate, which was then detected by the colorimetric procedures of Ames and Dubin (38Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture was quenched with 850 μl of an ascorbic-molybdate solution. This solution, prepared fresh daily, contained 1 part of 10% ascorbic acid to 6 parts of 0.42% ammonium molybdate·4H2O in 1n H2SO4. The mixture was then incubated for 20 min at 45 °C, and absorbance was read at 820 nm. A standard curve was generated each day. Two mol of phosphate was liberated for each mole of substrate hydrolyzed. The reaction mixture (150 μl) for Nudix kinetic experiments contained 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.010–2.0 mm substrate, and 5 units of AP. In the assays, YSA1 ranged from 9.8 to 19.6 ng, mNudT5 ranged from 100 to 300 ng, and NUDT9 ranged from 100 to 200 ng for ADPr assays or from 900 to 1800 ng forOAADPr assays. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1–15 min and quenched with the ascorbic-molybdate solution. Linearity of rates (i.e. initial velocities) was verified by measuring activities at various enzyme concentrations and by monitoring the reaction time course for up to 15 min. Product formation was linear with respect to enzyme concentrations and time. Typical assays were run between 3 and 7 min, where 5–20% substrate was converted to product. Substrate saturation curves were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v 0 = (k cat * [S])/(K m + [S]), using non-linear least squares analysis (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Due to the inability to saturate, thek cat/K m for NUDT9 withOAADPr was determined from the slope of the line fitted by linear-least squares regression. TheA 260 absorbing product of HeLa cell activity was collected from the HPLC and used as a substrate in subsequent reactions with AP and/or NUDT9. The standard reaction mixture (150 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 7 mmMgCl2, 50 or 100 μm substrate (concentration determined by extinction coefficient ε259 nm = 15.4 mm−1 cm−1), 5 units of AP and either the presence or absence of 2.0 μg of NUDT9. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and free phosphate was detected by quenching with the ascorbic-molybdate solution (as described above). The standard reaction mixture as described above was scaled up, quenched with trifluoroacetic acid (1% final concentration), and injected onto the HPLC as described above. Two products were collected: anA 260 absorbing species and a species containing the acetate that was detected by usingO-[3H]AADPr as the substrate. Each product, to a final concentration of 50 μm, was introduced to separate reaction mixtures (150 μl) containing 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of AP. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and free phosphate was detected by quenching with the ascorbic-molybdate solution (as described above). MALDI mass spectrometry was performed at the Environmental Health Sciences Center, Oregon State University, as described previously (22Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Google Scholar). We performed initial literature searches to identify enzymes capable of metabolizing the closest known metabolite ofOAADPr, ADPr. The most promising finding was the Nudix hydrolase family of enzymes, which consists of a group of phosphoanhydrases present in organisms ranging in complexity from viruses to humans (34O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Google Scholar). The substrates of this enzyme family include nucleoside triphosphates, co-enzymes, sugar nucleotides, and dinucleoside polyphosphates (34O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Google Scholar). Interestingly, ADPr is a favored substrate for several members of the Nudix hydrolase family (Refs. 34O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Google Scholar,39Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Google Scholar, 40Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N.

We have demonstrated that echinoderm oocytes (26Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Google Scholar), human (Fig. 1) and S. cerevisiae cell extracts (data not shown) possess robust enzymatic activities that metabolize OAADPr, although the products of these reactions had not been elucidated. It was therefore logical to screen a number of Nudix ADPr hydrolases as potential enzymes responsible for the robust metabolism ofOAADPr observed in these cellular extracts. To explore the idea that OAADPr may be a substrate for these hydrolases, we assayed the ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase, YSA1, from S. cerevisiae (YSA1) (40Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Google Scholar), the murine ADP-sugar diphosphatase mNudT5 (42Yang H. Slupska M.M. Wei Y.F. Tai J.H. Luther W.M. Xia Y.R. Shih D.M. Chiang J.H. Baikalov C. Fitz-Gibbon S. Phan I.T. Conrad A. Miller J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8844-8853Google Scholar), and the human ADPr diphosphatase NUDT9 (44Perraud A.-L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.-P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Google Scholar). These enzymes were chosen because their preferred substrates are ADP-sugars with preference for ADPr (44Perraud A.-L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.-P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Google Scholar, 45Lin S. Gasmi L. Xie Y. Ying K. Gu S. Wang Z. Jin H. Chao Y. Wu C. Zhou Z. Tang R. Mao Y. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 127-135Google Scholar). A common mechanism of virtually all members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily is a nucleophilic attack by water on a pyrophosphate linkage in the substrate (43Xu W. Gauss P. Shen J.Y. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23181-23185Google Scholar). This nucleophilic attack occurs on the alpha or beta phosphorus producing a reaction product corresponding to the nucleoside 5′-monophosphate (43Xu W. Gauss P. Shen J.Y. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23181-23185Google Scholar). Because the products generated from ADPr hydrolysis are AMP and ribose 5′-phosphate (39Sheikh S. O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20924-20928Google Scholar, 45Lin S. Gasmi L. Xie Y. Ying K. Gu S. Wang Z. Jin H. Chao Y. Wu C. Zhou Z. Tang R. Mao Y. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 127-135Google Scholar, 46Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Bessman M.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 467-472Google Scholar), the reaction products predicted from the conversion of OAADPr would be AMP and acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate. To provide evidence for this prediction, YSA1 was incubated with either OAADPr or ADPr and the products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and a colorimetric phosphatase assay. Reverse-phase HPLC of this reaction indicated that the disappearance of substrate ADPr or OAADPr was coincident with the appearance of AMP (Fig. 2, A andB, respectively). To confirm the elution position of AMP, 100 μm of an authentic AMP standard was co-injected onto the HPLC, and the elution profile was monitored (Fig. 2 C). As expected, UV absorption at 260 nm demonstrated that AMP co-eluted with the A 260 peak seen with YSA1 enzymatic turnover of OAADPr (Fig. 2 B). To detect the cleavage of OAADPr, we generated radiolabeledO-[3H]AADPr using the Sir2 homolog HST2 and the synthetic, acetylated histone H3 peptide, [3H]AcH3, where the radioactivity resides on the methyl position of the acetyl group. Cleavage of OAADPr by the ADPr hydrolase YSA1 between the α and β phosphates would be expected to generate acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate as the other reaction product. UponO-[3H]AADPr conversion by YSA1, we found a single tritium-labeled product eluting at fraction 6 in reverse-phase HPLC analysis (Fig. 2 D). Next, we attempted to verify this tritiated product as acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate. To accomplish this, YSA1 was incubated with O-[3H]AADPr, and the reaction products were collected after separation by HPLC. If the product is acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate then we would expect to retrieve equal moles of acetyl-ribose to phosphate. The acetate-containing species was quantitated by using the specific activity of O-[3H]AADPr (1.6 cpm/pmol) in the initial reaction. Using the phosphatase assay, a fraction containing 55 μm acetylated product yielded 44.8 ± 0.6 μm free phosphate, indicating that this enzymatic product harbors a molar equivalent of phosphoryl and acetyl groups and is consistent with acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate as the cleaved product. To confirm that the other product contained the second molar equivalent of phosphate, the A 260 species predicted to be AMP yielded 40.8 ± 2.1 μm free phosphate. Combined, these results indicate that each product of the ADPr hydrolase reaction contains approximately equivalent molar amounts of phosphate, indicating cleavage of OAADPr between the α and β phosphates, producing reaction products in accordance with AMP and acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate. These findings reveal the capacity of the ADPr hydrolase YSA1 to metabolize OAADPr to the reaction products AMP and acetylated ribose 5′-phosphate. To further characterizeOAADPr as a substrate for the ADPr hydrolase family of enzymes, we next determined the steady-state kinetic constants of YSA1, mNudt5, and NUDT9 for OAADPr. For these assays, enzyme was incubated with varying concentrations of substrate, and the initial velocities were measured using a colorimetric phosphate assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Saturation curves were constructed and kinetic constants calculated from fits using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The activities toward OAADPr were compared with ADPr (Table I). Our results with ADPr were similar to those reported previously (Table I) (40Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

Until recently, all CCA-adding enzymes from all three kingdoms appeared to be composed of a single kind of polypeptide with dual specificity for adding both CTP and ATP; however, we recently found that in Aquifex aeolicus, which lies near the deepest root of the eubacterial 16 S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree, CCA addition represents a collaboration between closely related CC-adding and A-adding enzymes (Tomita, K. and Weiner, A.

The 3′-terminal CCA sequence (positions 74–76 in the standard cloverleaf representation) is universally present in the tRNAs of all organisms (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Google Scholar) and is important for many aspects of gene expression. The CCA terminus is required for the aminoacylation of tRNA (2Sprinzl M. Cramer F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1979; 22: 1-69Google Scholar, 3Tamura K. Nameki N. Hasegawa T. Shimizu M. Himeno H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22173-22177Google Scholar) and for translation on the ribosome where the CCA sequences of the aminoacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA pair with the large ribosomal RNA near the peptidyltransferase center (4Nissen P.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Google Scholar). In eubacteria, the CCA sequence is required for the efficient maturation of the 5′-end of tRNA by RNase P (7Guerrier-Takada C. McClain W.H. Altman S. Cell. 1984; 38: 219-224Google Scholar, 8Oh B.K. Pace N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4087-4094Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the CCA sequence serves as an antideterminant to block 3′-exonuclease activity (9Mohan A. Whyte S. Wang X. Nashimoto M. Levinger L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 245-256Google Scholar), and it is essential for the export of mature tRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (10Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Google Scholar, 11Feng W. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5412-5417Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme (ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase) builds and repairs the 3′-terminal CCA sequence of all tRNAs (12Deutscher M.P. Jacob S.T. tRNA Nucleotidyltransferase: Enzymes of Nucleic Acid Synthesis and Modification, Part II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983: 159-183Google Scholar). CCA-adding activity has been identified in all three kingdoms, suggesting conservation of function and perhaps structure throughout evolution (13Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908Google Scholar). CCA-adding activity is essential in some eubacteria as well as in all archaea and eukaryotes where some or all tRNA genes do not encode CCA (14Aebi M. Kirchner G. Chen J.Y. Vijayraghavan U. Jacobson A. Martin N.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16216-16220Google Scholar). Yet, even in organisms such as Escherichia coliwhere all tRNA genes do encode CCA, CCA-adding activity confers a substantial selective advantage, probably by repairing tRNAs that have been subject to errant nucleolytic attack (15Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme belongs to the nucleotidyltransferase (NTR) 1The abbreviations used are: NTR, nucleotidyltransferase; Aa.S, shorter Aquifex aeolicusCC-adding polypeptide; Aa.L, longer A. aeolicus A-adding polypeptide; Sy.S, shorter Synechocystis sp.

Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908Google Scholar, 16Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Google Scholar, 17Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme is unique among these NTRs because, unlike other the other DNA and RNA polymerases in the superfamily, it does not use a nucleic acid template, yet it faithfully constructs a defined nucleotide sequence by the addition of mononucleotides. Several models have been proposed to explain how the CCA addition could be templated by protein alone or by a tRNA/protein complex (18Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 459-468Google Scholar, 19Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Google Scholar, 20Yue D. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol.

Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanism of the CCA addition remains unknown. Until recently, all CCA-adding enzymes characterized from all three kingdoms were composed of a single kind of polypeptide with dual specificity for the 3′-terminal addition of CTP and ATP to tRNA primers. However, we found that CCA-adding activity in Aquifex aeolicus reflects a collaboration between two closely related nucleotidyltransferases (24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar). The smaller polypeptide (Aa.S) is a CC-adding enzyme that adds CTP at positions 74 and 75 of a tRNA primer. The larger polypeptide (Aa.L) is an A-adding enzyme that adds a single ATP at position 76 of a tRNA primer. Remarkably, the A. aeolicus Aa.S and Aa.L polypeptides do not appear to bind to each other or to work in concert. We also found that Thermatoga maritima encodes a polypeptide that is homologous to Aa.L over its entire length, yet it has CCA- instead of A-adding activity; moreover, the homologous N-terminal halves of the T. maritimaCCA-adding enzyme and the Aa.L A-adding enzyme are dispensible for NTR activity. Here we show that the addition of CCA to tRNA is the joint responsibility of homologous CC- and A-adding enzymes in two other eubacteria, Synechocystis sp. and Deinococcus radiodurans, just as it is in A. aeolicus. A phylogenetic analysis of eubacterial CCA-, CC-, and A-adding enzymes, as well as of poly(A) polymerases, places the CC- and A-adding enzymes in distinct groups from CCA-adding enzymes and poly(A) polymerases. We discuss several different evolutionary scenarios that could explain these data. As shown in Fig. 1A,Synechocystis sp. encodes two nucleotidyltransferase homologs, designated Sy.S and Sy.L for short and long polypeptides, with accession numbers NP_442458 and NP_441479 respectively (25Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Google Scholar). The coding regions were amplified from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genomic DNA (generous gift from T. Kaneko of the Kazusa DNA Research Institute) using PCR primer pairs Sy.SF (5′-GGGCATATGCTTTGTCCTGTGAGCCACCTG-3′) and Sy.SR (5′-CCCCTCGAGAGATTTTCCCAGTTCTTGAGCATA-3′) for Sy.S and Sy.LCF (5′-GGGCATATGCGGACCGATGTGTTACGGCAATTATTG-3′) and Sy.LCR (5′-CCCCTCGAGAACTTTGTTCGGTAAAGGATAATG-3′) for the C-terminal half of Sy.L (residues 399–942). To allow cloning of the coding region between the NdeI andXhoI sites of the pET22b(+) expression vector (Novagen), the Sy.SF and Sy.LCF primers contained an NdeI site (underlined) overlapping the start codon, and the Sy.SR and Sy.LCR primers contained a XhoI site (underlined and italicized) overlapping the natural stop codon, which was changed to a serine TCG codon. The resulting plasmids expressing Sy.S and Sy.LC are pETSy.S and pETSy.LC, respectively. Note that Sy.LC contains about 50 additional N-terminal residues beyond the region of homology with Aa.LC and Tm.C (Fig. 1 and Ref. 24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar); without these N-terminal residues, Sy.LC was insoluble whether it had an N-terminal or a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. As shown in Fig. 1A, Deinococcus radioduransencodes two NTR homologs, designated DR.1 and DR.2, with accession numbers NP_294707 and NP_294915 (26White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K.

Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Daly M.J. Fraser C.M. et al.Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Google Scholar). The coding regions were amplified from genomic DNA (generous gift from S. Wolin of Yale University) using PCR primer pairs DR.1F (5′-TTTCATATGTTTCGTCGCCGTCCGCCCCTGCCGCCGTTTCCT-3′) and DR.1R (5′-TTCGGATCCGAACTTCCCGGCGTTTCCTCCGCCCA-3′) for DR.1 and DR.2F (5′-TTTCATATGGCGACCCCAGACGGCGAGCAGGTCTGG-3′) and DR.2R (5′-TTCGGATCCGAGGTCGCCTTGGGGTTTGCGCCGAGGTA3′) for DR.2. As in the Synechocystis protocol, the DR.1F and DR.1R primers contain an NdeI site (underlined) overlapping the start codon, and the DR.1R and DR.2R primers contain aBamHI site (underlined and italicized) overlapping the natural stop codon, which was changed to a serine TCG codon. PCR failed using Taq and Pfu polymerase, presumably due to the high G+C content of D. radiodurans DNA, but was successful with Herculase Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and Me2SO. The 50-μl PCR reaction contained 1 × Herculase DNA polymerase buffer, 200 μm dNTP, 25 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of polymerase, and 6% Me2SO. The PCR reaction conditions were one cycle at 98 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles consisting of 98 °C, 65 °C, and 72 °C for 45 s, 45 s, and 1 min 45 s, respectively. The PCR fragments were purified by gel electrophoresis and cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the sequences were verified by sequencing. TheNdeI-BamHI DNA fragment of DR.1 and a partialNdeI and BamHI digest of DR.2 (which contains anNdeI site within the open reading frame) were cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET22b(+) expression vector. The resulting plasmids expressing DR.1 and DR.2 are pETDR.1 and pETDR.2, respectively. The expression vectors were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying a plasmid encoding the minor tRNAArg(argU). Transformants were grown in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.8, and expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 8 h at 25 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m KCl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C at 10,000 × g. The cleared lysates were passed over nickel nitrilotriacetic agarose columns (Qiagen), washed extensively with buffer A plus 20 mm imidazole, and the histidine-tagged proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer A containing 200 mm KCl and 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were assayed with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The purity of the histidine-tagged proteins was about 90% as judged by SDS-PAGE. A. aeolicus A-adding and CC-adding enzymes were prepared as described (24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar). tRNA transcripts lacking CA and A (tRNA-DC and tRNA-DCC, where D is a discriminator nucleotide at position 73) were prepared by in vitrotranscription of the pmBSCCA plasmid (a kind gift of N. R. Pace) (8Oh B.K. Pace N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4087-4094Google Scholar) linearized with FokI and BbsI, respectively, as described (27Cazenave C. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6972-6976Google Scholar). For tRNA lacking CCA (tRNA-D), the plasmid was mutated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described (24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar) and digested with FokI prior to in vitrotranscription. Transcripts were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with one nucleotide resolution, excised after UV shadowing, and then eluted, ethanol precipitated, washed with cold 70% ethanol, and dried. Uniformly labeled tRNAs were prepared identically using 800 nm [α-32P]UTP (AmershamBiosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol), 25 μm UTP, and 500 μm CTP, ATP, and GTP. The desired products were located by autoradiography and then excised, eluted, and concentrated as for unlabeled products. CCA-adding assays were carried out in 50 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μm tRNA, 15 nm enzyme, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, and 150 nm[α-32P]ATP or [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (9 murea, 0.02% xylene cyanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) and resolved by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 7 m urea. The A. aeolicus CC-adding enzyme (Aa.S) and A-adding enzyme (A.aLC) were assayed identically, but at 60 °C. The following eubacterial CCA-adding, A-adding, CC-adding enzymes and poly(A) polymerase were used for the phylogenetic analysis: the eubacteria CCA-adding enzymes of E. coli (28Blattner F.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar), the alignment of the conserved 25 kDa core of the class II nucleotidyltransferase family (13Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908Google Scholar) was edited manually, and insertions were omitted. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method (36Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425Google Scholar) based on a distance matrix with 1000 bootstrap trials. We recently found that the addition of CCA to tRNA in A. aeolicus reflects a collaborative effort between two different but closely related polypeptides, one that adds CC at positions 74 and 75 and another that adds A at position 76 (24). A BLAST search (37Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) using the A. aeolicus CC-adding and A-adding enzyme sequences revealed that Synechocystis sp. (25Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Google Scholar) encodes two NTRs designated Sy.S and Sy.L (accession numbers NP_442458 and NP_441479 respectively). Sy.S is homologous to the A. aeolicusCC-adding enzyme (Aa.S), and Sy.L is homologous to the A. aeolicus A-adding enzyme (Aa.S). Sy.L also possesses the same N-terminal 44-kDa extension of unknown function seen in the A. aeolicus A-adding enzyme (Aa.L) and T. maritimaCCA-adding enzyme (Tm) (Fig. 1). A BLAST search using the A. aeolicus CC-adding polypeptide (Aa.S) revealed that the genome of D. radiodurans (26White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P. McDonald L. Utterback T. Zalewski C. Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Daly M.J. Fraser C.M. et al.Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Google Scholar) encodes an A.aS homolog designated DR.1 (accession number NP_294915). Amino acid identity between DR.1 and Aa.S is high over the entire length of the proteins. A BLAST search for homologs of the A. aeolicus A-adding enzyme (Aa.L) did not reveal any full-length homologs in D. radiodurans, but rather a smaller homolog, designated DR.2, corresponding to the C-terminal half of Aa.L (Aa.LC) (accession number NP_294707). Thus, three eubacteria (Synechocystis sp., A. aeolicus, and T. maritima) have NTR homologs with homologous N-terminal extensions of unknown function (Sy.L, Aa.L, and Tm), but D. radiodurans does not. These data indicate that the Synechocystis Sy.S andDeinococcus DR.1 polypeptides are most closely related toA. aeolicus CC-adding enzyme, and theSynechocystis Sy.L and Deinococcus DR.2 polypeptides most closely related to the A. aeolicusA-adding enzyme. The implication is that CCA-adding activity inSynechocystis sp. and D. radiodurans, as inA. aeolicus, may be the joint responsibility of two distinct but related polypeptides, although the N-terminal extension found in the Aa.L and Tm homologs is absent from DR.2. Synechocyctis Sy.S and the C-terminal half of Sy.L (Sy.LC; amino acid residues 399–942, where Thr-399 is changed to Met) were expressed in E. coli as hexahistidine-tagged proteins (Fig. 2A). The recombinant polypeptides were assayed in the presence of both ATP and CTP using tRNA substrates lacking CCA, CA, or A (tRNA-D, tRNA-DC, and tRNA-DCC, respectively, where D is discriminator base at position 73). Sy.S adds one or more CMPs to tRNA-D and tRNA-DC, but not to tRNA-DCC, and does not add AMP to any tRNA substrate (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). Sy.LC adds AMP to tRNA-DCC, but not to tRNA-D or tRNA-DC, and does not add CMP to any tRNA substrate (Fig. 2B,lanes 4–6). These data suggest that Sy.S and Sy.LC are likely to be CC-adding and A-adding enzymes, respectively. Indeed, reconstitution of the CCA-adding activity was observed when Sy.S and Sy.LC were combined (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–9), as demonstrated previously for the A. aeolicus polypeptides A.aLC and Aa.S (ref. 24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2C). When the assays were performed in the presence of all four ribonucleotide triphosphates, only one of which was labeled, Sy.S added only CMP to tRNA-D and tRNA-DC, Sy.LC added only AMP to tRNA-DCC, and neither Sy.S nor Sy.LC added GMP or UMP to any tRNA substrate (Fig. 2D). We conclude that CCA-adding activity in Synechocystis is divided between two closely related polypeptides with different activity and specificity, just as in A. aeolicus. TheD. radiodurans DR.1 and DR.2 polypeptides were expressed as C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged polypeptides in E. coli(Fig. 3A) and assayed using the same three tRNA substrates as for the Synechocystispolypeptides. DR.1 adds one or more CMPs to tRNA-D and tRNA-DC, but not to tRNA-DCC, and does not add AMP to any tRNA substrate (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–3). DR.2 adds AMP to tRNA-DCC, but not to tRNA-D or tRNA-DC, and does not add CMP to any tRNA substrate (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6). Thus DR.1 and DR.2 are likely to be CC-adding and A-adding enzymes, respectively. Moreover, as expected, CCA adding activity could be reconstituted when DR.1 and DR.2 were combined (Fig. 3B, lanes 7–9). The D. radiodurans DR.2 polypeptide lacks the N-terminal extension of unknown function found in the homologous Aa.L, Sy.L, and Tm polypeptides (Fig. 1). When the assays were performed using uniformly labeled tRNA substrates in the presence of all of four nucleotides, DR. 1 added one nucleotide to tRNA-D and two nucleotides to tRNA-DCC, DR.2 added only one nucleotide to tRNA-DCC, and together DR. 1 and DR.2 added three nucleotides to tRNA-D (Fig. 3C). DR.1 incorporates only CMP into tRNA lacking CCA and CA, whereas DR.2 incorporates only AMP into tRNA lacking 3′-terminal A (Fig. 3D). These are the same results obtained for the A. aeolicus Aa.S and Aa.LC polypeptides (24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar) and theSynechocystis Sy.S and Sy.LC polypeptides (Fig. 2,B–D). We conclude that the D. radiodurans CCA-adding activity is also divided between two closely related polypeptides of different activity and specificity as in A. aeolicus and Synechocystis sp. Having found that CCA-adding activity inSynechocystis sp. and D. radiodurans represents a collaboration between two distinct but related polypeptides (Figs. 2and 3) just as in A. aeolicus (24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar), we wanted to understand the phylogenetic relationship between eubacterial CCA-, CC-, and A-adding enzymes, as well as the related eubacterial poly(A) polymerases. All known CCA-adding enzymes belong to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, which can be divided into Class I and Class II enzymes (13Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908Google Scholar). The archaeal CCA-adding enzymes (Class I) share a highly homologous 45-kDa core, and the eubacterial and eukaryotic CCA-adding enzymes (Class II) share a highly homologous 25-kDa core; however, Class I and Class II enzymes exhibit little obvious homology with each other outside of the immediate vicinity of the nucleotidyltransferase active site signature (17Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Google Scholar). The prokaryotic poly(A) polymerases belong to Class II and share the 25-kDa core of the CCA-adding enzymes (13Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908Google Scholar); the eukaryotic poly(A) polymerases belong to Class I (13Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908Google Scholar) and exhibit very modest homology with the archaeal CCA-adding enzymes over roughly 25 kDa of the 45-kDa core. 2H.-D. Cho, C. Verlinde, and A. M. Weiner, manuscript in preparation. To avoid needless complication, we compared only Class II enzymes. Because it is not yet possible to distinguish Class II CCA-adding enzymes from poly(A) polymerases based solely on sequence analysis (38Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6276-6282Google Scholar), we included only those enzymes whose enzymatic activities had been experimentally demonstrated or could be confidently assumed. These are the H. influenzae CCA-adding enzyme and poly(A) polymerase, both of which are almost identical to their experimentally characterized E. coli counterparts (21Hou Y.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1031-1043Google Scholar, 23Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Google Scholar,39Kalapos M.P. Cao G.J. Kushner S.R. Sarkar N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 459-465Google Scholar), the B. subtilis and M. leprae CCA-adding enzymes (38Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6276-6282Google Scholar), and the CCA-adding enzyme from M. tuberculosis, which is almost identical to M. lepraeenzyme (31Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honore N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Mungall K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R.M. Devlin K. Duthoy S. Feltwell T. Fraser A. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Lacroix C. Maclean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rutherford K.M. Rutter S. Seeger K. Simon S. Simmonds M. Skelton J. Squares R. Squares S. Stevens K. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Woodward J.R. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 1007-1011Google Scholar). A multiple alignment of the 25-kDa core regions of these Class II enzymes, including the active site signature, is shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 5, eubacterial nucleotidyltransferases are divided into four main groups (Groups 1–4) and two subgroups (Group 4a and 4b). The Gram-negative eubacterialE. coli and H. influenzae CCA-adding enzymes (EC-CCA and HI-CCA) form a distinct group (Group 2) from the corresponding poly(A) polymerases and Gram-positive eubacterial CCA-adding enzymes (Group 4). The Gram-positive B. subtilis,M. leprae and M. tuberculosisCCA-adding enzymes (Group 4b; BS-CCA, ML-CCA and MT-CCA) are more closely related to the Gram-negative poly(A) polymerases (Group 4a; EC-PA and HI-PA) than to the CCA-adding enzymes from Gram-negativeE. coli and H. influenzae (Group 2). Among Group 4 enzymes, the B. subtilis CCA-adding enzyme is most closely related to Gram-negative poly(A) polymerases (Group 4a), consistent with a recent biochemical study showing that the B. subtilis nucleotidyltransferase, originally predicted to be poly(A) polymerase, is in fact a CCA-adding enzyme (38Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6276-6282Google Scholar). The CC-adding enzymes (AA-CC, SY-CC, and DR-CC; Group 1) and A-adding enzymes (AA-A, SY-A, and DR-A; Group 3) group separately except for one CCA-adding enzyme (TM-CCA) that groups anomalously with the A-adding enzymes (see below for discussion). Interestingly, although the three CC-adding enzymes group with each other, as do the three A-adding enzymes, the CC- and A-adding enzymes from each organism do not group together. This suggests that CC- and A-adding enzymes do not reflect gene duplication and diversification within each lineage. Instead, the division of CCA-adding activity between CC- and A-adding enzymes may have been the primitive state, consistent with placement of A. aeolicus, D. radiodurans, and T. maritima near the deepest root of the 16 S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree (40Pace N.R. Science. 1997; 276: 734-740Google Scholar, 41Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8392-8396Google Scholar). This could also explain why the T. maritima CCA-adding enzyme groups with A-adding enzymes (Group 3) rather than with other CCA- or CC-adding enzymes; the progenitor T. maritima A-adding enzyme could have acquired CC-adding activity to become a CCA-adding enzyme, thus rendering the CC-adding enzyme redundant and subject to loss. Synechocystis does not branch as early as A. aeolicus, T. maritima, and D. radioduransin the phylogenetic tree based on rRNA (40Pace N.R. Science. 1997; 276: 734-740Google Scholar, 41Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8392-8396Google Scholar). Yet, theSynechocystis CC-adding enzyme (SY-CC in Group 1) and A-adding enzyme (SY-A in Group 3) both group with the corresponding CC- and A-adding enzymes from A. aeolicus, D. radiodurans, and T. maritima. One possible explanation is that phylogenetic analysis based on proteins including DnaJ/K, EF-Tu, and DNA polymerase I revealed a close relationship between theDeinococcus-Thermus group and cyanobacteria (42Gupta R.S. Bustard K. Falah M. Singh D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 345-357Google Scholar, 43Gupta R.S. Johari V. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 716-720Google Scholar). Thus, cyanobacterial CC- and A-adding activities may also represent the primitive state. Alternatively, A. aeolicus, D. radiodurans, and Synechocystis sp. may have independently acquired the CC- and A-adding enzymes by horizontal transfer; however, this would not explain why horizontal transfer was mainly or exclusively restricted to deeply rooted eubacteria. The CCA-adding enzymes build a defined nucleic acid sequence without using a nucleic acid template. A variety of models have been proposed to explain this remarkable behavior (18Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 459-468Google Scholar, 19Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Google Scholar, 20Yue D. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol.

Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Google Scholar), but the mechanism of CCA addition remains mysterious. Moreover, although eubacterial CCA-adding enzymes and poly(A) polymerases are closely related in sequence (13Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 895-908Google Scholar,38Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6276-6282Google Scholar, 44Masters M. March J.B. Oliver I.R. Collins J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 341-344Google Scholar), it is still difficult to predict the activity from sequence alone (38Raynal L.C. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. J.

We have now found that CCA-adding activity is divided between two closely related nucleotidyltransferases inSynechocystis sp. and D. radiodurans (this paper) as well as in A. aeolicus (24Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1334-1336Google Scholar). At least in A. aeolicus these two nucleotidyltransferases recognize the same face of tRNA 3K. Tomita and A. M. Weiner, unpublished observations. and work independently. Comparative biochemical and structural analysis of the related eubacterial CCA-, CC-, and A-adding enzymes, as well as eubacterial poly(A) polymerases, may help to explain the specificity of these unique enzymes and the evolutionary relationships among them.

The two-protein complex was able to catalyze electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome c with high catalytic efficiency. The redox potential of the flavin cofactor (FAD/FADH−) of the reductase was shown to be more positive than that of the NADP+/NADPH couple, thus favoring electron transfer from NADPH to yield reduced ferredoxin. The complex formation between the reductase and ferredoxins from various sources was studied bothin vitro by several approaches (enzymatic activity, cross-linking, protein fluorescence quenching, affinity chromatography) and in vivo by the yeast two-hybrid system. Our data show that the two proteins yield an active complex with high affinity, strongly suggesting that the two proteins of T. gondiiform a physiological redox couple that transfers electrons from NADPH to ferredoxin, which in turn is used by some reductive biosynthetic pathway(s) of the apicoplast. These data provide the basis for the exploration of this redox couple as a drug target in apicomplexan parasites.

Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is a protozoan parasite belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa (1Wong S.Y. Remington J.S. AIDS. 1993; 7: 299-316Google Scholar). This phylum comprises several other pathogens of humans or economically important animals, e.g. Plasmodium sp. (causative agent of malaria),Cryptosporidium parvum (cryptosporidiosis), andEimeria sp. Nearly all Apicomplexa possess an unique organelle called apicoplast (for reviews see Refs. 2Wilson R.J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 257-274Google Scholar, 3Marechal E. Cesbron-Delauw M.F.

Recent studies have established that it is related evolutionarily to plastids of photosynthetic red algae and that it was acquired by the ancestor of extant Apicomplexa by an endosymbiotic event (5Köhler S.

Evol. 2001; 18: 418-426Google Scholar). The circular apicoplast genomes (35 kb in size) of both T. gondii andPlasmodium falciparum have been sequenced completely (7.Toxoplasma gondii 35kb plastid DNA annotation on World Wide Web: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Entrez/framik?db=genome&gi=12164.Google Scholar, 8Wilson R.J.M.

Their reduced size with respect to those of plant and algal plastids suggests that loss of genes encoding apicoplast proteins or their progressive transfer to the nucleus has taken place. Proteins to be imported into the organelle possess a characteristic N-terminal bipartite targeting sequence, which is both necessary and sufficient to transport these proteins into the apicoplast (4Roos D.S.

Recently, both a ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) 1The abbreviations used are: FNR, ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.18.1.2); TgFNR, T. gondii FNR; 6H-L/TgFNR, His-tagged longer form of TgFNR; S/TgFNR, shorter form of TgFNR; SoFNR, S. oleracea leaf FNR; ZmFNR, Z. mays root FNR; Fd, ferredoxin; TgFd, T. gondii Fd; PfFd, P. falciparum Fd; SoFdI, S. oleracea Fd I; Fdox, oxidized Fd; Fdred, reduced Fd; NLS, nuclear localization signal; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. of T. gondii and a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (Fd) of P. falciparum have been cloned (16Vollmer M. Thomsen N. Wiek S. Seeber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5483-5490Google Scholar). They both contain a putative N-terminal apicoplast targeting signal that was shown in the case ofT. gondii FNR (TgFNR) to be sufficient to target a reporter protein into the apicoplast (17Striepen B. Crawford M.J. Shaw M.K. Tilney L.G. Seeber F. Roos D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1423-1434Google Scholar). TgFNR starting from residue 150 of the whole coding sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme was shown to be active as an NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase (16Vollmer M. Thomsen N. Wiek S. Seeber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5483-5490Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TgFNR is more similar to the isoforms present in non-photosynthetic plastids than to those of cyanobacteria or chloroplasts. In the latter cases, FNR is responsible for the electron transfer from photosystem I to NADP+, according to Equation1. 2Fdred+NADP++H+↔2Fdox+NADPHEquation 1 NADPH is used subsequently in the Calvin cycle (18Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Google Scholar). In non-photosynthetic plastids electrons flow in the reverse direction, from NADPH to Fdox yielding Fdred (19Bowsher C.G. Hucklesby D.P. Emes M.J. Plant J. 1993; 3: 463-467Google Scholar), which then serves as a reductant for various enzymes, i.e. nitrite reductase, glutamate synthase, sulfite reductase, and lipid desaturases (20Neuhaus H.E. Emes M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 111-140Google Scholar, 21Knaff D.B. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 333-361Google Scholar). By analogy, the redox system NADPH/FNR/Fd of the apicoplast would be predicted to provide reducing power to biosynthetic pathways yet to be identified. It is assumed that the apicoplast has retained a number of parasite-specific metabolic tasks, and because the vertebrate hosts of Apicomplexa do not possess a homolog of this organelle, these metabolic pathways are therefore prime targets for efficient and specific anti-infection drugs (22McFadden G.I. Roos D.S. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 328-333Google Scholar). In this respect the FNR/Fd redox system is a promising candidate, because it is presumably present in the apicoplast of most, if not all, apicomplexan parasites (23Seeber F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 1207-1217Google Scholar). A detailed knowledge of the biochemical properties of apicomplexan FNR and its specific interaction with Fd is a prerequisite for the development of inhibitory substances of this redox couple. Here we report on the overproduction and purification of TgFNR, as well as T. gondii Fd (TgFd). Their subsequent biochemical characterization allowed us to highlight several distinctive differences of the parasite FNR/Fd redox couple compared with their plant counterparts, especially with regard to the FAD cofactor redox potential, the catalytic efficiency, and the protein-protein interactions. All chemicals and pyridine nucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chromatographic columns and media were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, with the exception of Ni-NTA-agarose, which was from Qiagen. Cytochrome c (C2506; Sigma) was purified further by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose. Restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase, and DNA modifying enzymes were supplied by Amersham Biosciences or New England Biolabs. Recombinant spinach (Spinacia oleracea) ferredoxin I (SoFdI), spinach FNR (SoFNR), and maize (Zea mays) root FNR (ZmFNR) were purified as reported previously (24Piubelli L. Aliverti A. Bellintani F. Zanetti G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 298-304Google Scholar, 25Aliverti A. Corrado M.E. Zanetti G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 247-250Google Scholar, 26Aliverti A. Faber R. Finnerty C.M. Ferioli C. Pandini V. Negri A. Karplus P.A. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14501-14508Google Scholar). For expression of TgFNR and TgFd, their mature coding sequence was placed under the control of the T5-based, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible hybrid promoter PN25/03/04 in vector pDS56/RBSII (27Bujard H. Gentz R. Lanzer M. Stueber D. Mueller M. Ibrahimi I. Haeuptle M.T. Dobberstein B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 416-433Google Scholar), yielding plasmids pS1-S/TgFNR and pS1-TgFd, respectively (see Fig. 1). A commercial version of the above vector, pQE31 (Qiagen) served as recipient for a longer version of the coding sequence of TgFNR starting at Leu-121 (yielding pQE-L/TgFNR; see Fig. 1). The coding sequence of TgFd was taken from expressed sequence tag clone BG659097 (which is derived from mRNA of the VEG strain), and its insert was sequenced further and shown to encode all of the mature TgFd and to possess a long N-terminal extension but without an initiator AUG. A lexA-based yeast two-hybrid system was used for the detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo (28Fashena S.J. Serebriiskii I.G. Golemis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 14-26Google Scholar). The shorter TgFNR was cloned as an EcoRI fragment into pB42AD (Origene), and the different ferredoxins were cloned into the EcoRI site of pGILDA (Clontech). Plasmids pTUK-PfFd (16Vollmer M. Thomsen N. Wiek S. Seeber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5483-5490Google Scholar), pETFdI (24Piubelli L. Aliverti A. Bellintani F. Zanetti G. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 298-304Google Scholar), and pS1-TgFd (see above) served as source for the ferredoxins. In both two-hybrid plasmids expression is driven by a galactose-dependent promoter (see Fig. 1). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing in the newly assembled parts of the vector. Sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX and optimized by visual inspection (29Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Google Scholar). E. coliRRIΔM15 cells transformed with expression plasmids (pTUK-TgFNR, pS1-S/TgFNR, pQE-L/TgFNR, pS1-TgFd) were grown in flasks under vigorous shaking in 2× YT medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin. For protein purification, E. coli cells were grown at 30 °C (for TgFNRs) or 37 °C (for TgFd) in a New Brunswick 12-liter fermentor to midlog phase (A600 = 1.2–1.5). Then the culture was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were harvested after 4 h (for TgFNR) or 2 h (for TgFd) of further growth. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C except for FPLC, which was carried out at room temperature. E. coli cell paste was resuspended in 2.5 ml/g of Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 43,000 × gfor 1 h, the soluble fraction was loaded on an Ni-NTA-agarose column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The molarity of imidazole in Buffer A was brought to 20 mm and then used for extensive washing. Elution of recombinant proteins was then performed with 250 mm imidazole in Buffer A. In the case of TgFNR, the pooled enzyme-containing fractions were supplemented with 5 mmEDTA and dialyzed against 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol. TgFNR was then loaded on a HiLoad SP-Sepharose high performance column and eluted with 10 column volumes of a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. The purified TgFNR was stored at −20 °C in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. In the case of TgFd, the protein eluted from the Ni-NTA-agarose column was concentrated by ultrafiltration and gel-filtered on a Superdex 75 column equilibrated in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 10% glycerol. The purified TgFd was stored at −80 °C under nitrogen in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Analytical gel-filtration analyses were performed on an ÄKTA FPLC apparatus equipped with a Superose 12 column in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Absorption spectra were recorded with an Agilent 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficient of the protein-bound flavin was determined spectrophotometrically by quantitating the FAD released from the apoprotein following SDS treatment (30Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer at 15 °C. The identity of the enzyme-bound flavin was assessed fluorimetrically by treating with phosphodiesterase the flavin released after thermal denaturation at 100 °C of the TgFNR (30Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23Google Scholar). Enzyme-catalyzed reactions were monitored continuously on an Agilent 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer. Standard diaphorase activity was measured in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, at 25 °C with K3Fe(CN)6 as electron acceptor and NADPH or NADH as reductants. Standard cytochrome creductase activity was assayed in the same buffer as above with either 7 or 9 μm SoFdI or TgFd, using 40 μmpurified cytochrome c as the terminal electron acceptor. The NADPH concentration was kept constant by regeneration with 2.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate and 2 μg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the Fd-dependent cytochrome c reductase activity were determined by varying the concentrations of both NADPH and Fd. Initial rate data (v) were fitted by non-linear regression using Grafit 4.0 software (Erythacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom) to a Michaelis-Menten equation. All reduction experiments were carried out in an anaerobic cuvette at 15 °C. Solutions were made anaerobic by successive cycles of equilibration with O2-free nitrogen and evacuation. Photoreduction of TgFNR using EDTA/light (31Massey V. Hemmerich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5612-5614Google Scholar) were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 15 mm EDTA and 1.5 μm 5-carba-5-deazariboflavin. To monitor the in vivo interactions between TgFNR and various Fds the protocol of Fashena et al. (28Fashena S.J. Serebriiskii I.G. Golemis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 14-26Google Scholar) was followed. Yeast strain EGY48 (MATα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2::6 LexAop-LEU2; Origene) containing the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 was used as recipient for all plasmids. As negative, non-interactive proteins two control plasmids from the supplier (Origene) were used. Interaction-dependent growth was assessed by plating the transformed cells onto His/Trp/Leu drop-out medium containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed in 96-well plates using Y-PER yeast lysis solution (Pierce) ando-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as enzyme substrate, following the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Protein cross-linking was performed as described previously (32Zanetti G. Morelli D. Ronchi S. Negri A. Aliverti A. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3753-3759Google Scholar). FNR and Fd (8 and 40 μm, respectively) were cross-linked by treatment with 5 mm N-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Affinity chromatography of FNRs was performed on Fd-Sepharose 4B. Immobilized SoFdI was obtained by coupling 250 nmol of SoFdI to 350 mg of CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B following the manufacturer's directions. SoFdI-conjugated resin (1 ml) was packed and used as an affinity column in an FPLC apparatus. FNRs (∼10 nmol) were loaded on the affinity column, equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After washing with the same buffer, FNRs were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl. A second type of experiment was performed under the same conditions except for the presence of 2 m urea in all the buffers and samples. Several constructs were designed and utilized for the production of TgFNR inE. coli. The originally described plasmid pTUK-TgFNR, which allows expression of TgFNR as a fusion protein with His6-tagged yeast ubiquitin, starting at Ser-150 of the cDNA-derived FNR sequence (16Vollmer M. Thomsen N. Wiek S. Seeber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5483-5490Google Scholar), was found unsuitable for high level purification. A second plasmid was constructed in which the above coding sequence contained only an N-terminal His6 tag for purification (Fig. 1). Although for both plasmids the recombinant TgFNR was found soluble and active, the purified enzymes thus obtained were nevertheless prone to precipitation and underwent proteolysis during storage. Furthermore, a small percentage (∼4%) of the enzyme contained a modified flavin cofactor, which was identified as 6-OH-FAD (33Pandini V. Caprini G. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Chapman S. Perham R. Scrutton N. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Rudolf Weber, Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin2002: 899-904Google Scholar). With the aim of stabilizing the protein, Leu-121 of TgFNR, which encompasses a region well conserved in non-photosynthetic FNRs (16Vollmer M. Thomsen N. Wiek S. Seeber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5483-5490Google Scholar), was chosen as the starting point for the longer mature form (Fig. 1). Again an N-terminal His6 tag was added to facilitate purification of the protein, resulting in plasmid pQE-L/TgFNR. Notwithstanding the low expression level obtained for this protein, a two-step procedure (affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose followed by ionic-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose) led to the production of 2 mg of purified enzyme/liter of culture (named 6H-L/TgFNR). 6H-L/TgFNR migrates in SDS-PAGE as a band of ∼43 kDa (see Fig. 6, lane 5). The molecular mass value of the native enzyme as analyzed by FPLC on a Superdex 75 column was 43 kDa ± 2, well in keeping with that calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (43.4 kDa, including the His6 tag). The gel filtration conditions were chosen to avoid possible aggregation phenomena, i.e. 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol were added to the buffer. In fact, there are eight cysteines present in the deduced sequence of TgFNR. By treatment of the enzyme with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) under denaturing conditions, all the cysteines were titrated, indicating that no disulfide bonds are present, whereas modification of 6H-L/TgFNR under non-denaturing conditions yielded only three readily titratable cysteines. This suggests that these latter residues are exposed to solvent and hence they could possibly form intermolecular disulfide bonds by oxidation, resulting in protein aggregation. The absorption spectrum of the purified protein is that typical of a flavoprotein, with bands centered at 395 and 454 nm (33Pandini V. Caprini G. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Chapman S. Perham R. Scrutton N. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Rudolf Weber, Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin2002: 899-904Google Scholar). Maximal absorbance in the UV region was at 272 nm. A value of 6.4 for theA272/A454 ratio was calculated from the spectrum. Flavin fluorescence was quenched almost completely. The non-covalently-bound flavin in 6H-L/TgFNR was shown to be FAD. The extinction coefficient of the enzyme at 454 nm was calculated to be 10.1 mm−1 cm−1from the amount of FAD released after protein denaturation by SDS. We explored the anaerobic reduction of the flavin cofactor bound to the enzyme to obtain information about its redox potential and the intermediate species formed during reduction. Stepwise anaerobic photoreductions of 6H-L/TgFNR were performed for the free enzyme (Fig. 2A) and in the presence of an equimolar amount of NADP+ (Fig. 2B). During reduction, the neutral blue semiquinone accumulated, as is the case for the plant FNRs. When NADP+ was present in the anaerobic cuvette, long wavelength bands absorbing well beyond 700 nm, which are ascribed to charge transfer species between NADP(H) and FAD(H−), were formed. Data obtained in this latter type of experiments were used to calculate the concentrations of NADPH and fully reduced flavin at several photoreduction times. These results are plotted in Fig. 3, and data obtained in the same type of experiments for the spinach leaf and the maize root enzymes are added for comparison. The course of reduction in the case of 6H-L/TgFNR highlighted that nearly full reduction of the FAD cofactor ensued before NADPH started to accumulate significantly. This indicates that the value of the enzyme redox potential is more positive than that of the NADP+/NADPH couple. Furthermore, comparison with the data obtained in the case of the two plant FNRs shows that 6H-L/TgFNR has a quite distinctive behavior; its pattern was nearly exactly specular with respect to that of the photosynthetic FNR, whereas the non-photosynthetic plant FNR showed an intermediate behavior. Shifting of the curve from left to right in this type of plot indicates that the redox potential of the enzyme FAD cofactor becomes less negative going from the photosynthetic to the non-photosynthetic isoform and to TgFNR. This is in keeping with the different physiological roles of the different isoforms.Figure 3Photoreduction of different FNR forms in the presence of NADP+: relationship between NADP+and FAD reduction. Absorbance at 340 nm, which is practically an isosbestic point for the various reduction forms of FNR, is used to monitor NADPH formation. At each time of irradiation, the ΔA340, as a fraction of the maximal ΔA340, was plotted against the ratio of fully reduced enzyme FAD to the sum of fully reduced and oxidized enzyme flavin. The data were corrected for the presence of the FAD semiquinone. ●, SoFNR; ■, ZmFNR; ○, 6H-L/TgFNR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The physiological activity of the plant homologs of TgFNR is to catalyze electron transfer between NADP(H) and a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. To test for such activity we initially used FdI of spinach chloroplasts (photosynthetic isoform, SoFdI) because of difficulties in the production of substantial amounts of recombinant P. falciparum Fd described earlier (16Vollmer M. Thomsen N. Wiek S. Seeber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5483-5490Google Scholar). More recently, however, we could identify a single expressed sequence tag clone in the T. gondiiexpressed sequence tag database that encoded the whole mature TgFd sequence, evidenced by its high sequence identity to other plant-type Fds (Fig. 4, A andB) and part of the N-terminal apicoplast targeting domain (data not shown). The latest release of ToxoDB 2.0 (ToxoDB.org) contains a genomic contig (TGG_640), which encompasses the wholeT. gondii Fd sequence including its complete N terminus with a predicted signal peptide (data not shown). The putative mature form of TgFd was expressed as an His6 tag fusion protein (see Fig. 1). Analysis of E. coli cell extracts revealed that only part of the synthesized TgFd was recovered as the holoprotein in the soluble fraction. The purification procedure required a second step after the Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Gel filtration on Superdex 75 yielded a homogeneous holoprotein as judged by native PAGE and with a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 6, lane 5). The procedure led to the production of 1 mg of purified protein/liter of culture. TgFd showed the typical spectrum of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin with peaks at 277, 333, 424, and 464 nm (data not shown). A value of 0.60 for theA424/A277 ratio was determined. As expected, 6H-L/TgFNR was very active as an NADPH-dependent diaphorase. Kinetic parameters for the ferricyanide reductase reaction were determined; values for kcat andKmNADPH were 700 ± 5 e− eq/s and 34 μm ± 1, respectively. 6H-L/TgFNR differentiates strongly between NADPH and NADH, showing very low ferricyanide reduction activity even with 2 mm NADH. An approximate value for NADPH preference over NADH was 180,000-fold. The kinetic parameters for the NADPH-cytochrome creductase activity of 6H-L/TgFNR with both SoFdI and TgFd are compared in Table I. Clearly, there is a preference of 6H-L/TgFNR for the parasite iron-sulfur protein. We also determined the kinetic parameters of plant FNR isoforms using TgFd as the protein substrate to evaluate the specificity of the protein-protein interactions in these various redox couples (Table II). Apparently, 6H-L/TgFNR showed a kcat value half of that of the plant enzymes when TgFd was used as electron acceptor and even lower when SoFdI was used. On the other hand, the Kmvalue of 6H-L/TgFNR for TgFd was ∼3-fold lower than that for leaf SoFdI (Table I). Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the T. gondii couple was twice that of the leaf homolog (32 e− eq/s μm; see Ref. 34Piubelli L. Aliverti A. Bellintani F. Zanetti G. Eur J Biochem. 1996; 236: 465-469Google Scholar) or of the heterologous couples (Table II). SoFNR showed the same efficiency with both ferredoxins in this type of reaction.Table IKinetic parameters for the Fd-dependent NADPH-cytochrome c reductase reaction catalysed by 6H-L/TgFNRFd formkcatK Fdmkcat/Kme− eq s−1μme− eq s−1μm−1SoFdI32 ± 15 ± 0.56.4 ± 0.8TgFd115 ± 51.9 ± 0.261 ± 9 Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic parameters for the TgFd-dependent NADPH-cytochrome c reductase reaction catalysed by different FNR formsFNR formkcatK TgFdmkcat/Kme− eq s−1μme− eq s−1μm−1SoFNR180 ± 155 ± 0.336 ± 5ZmFNR227 ± 67 ± 0.432 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Because electron transfer to Fd relies absolutely on the physical interaction between Fd and FNR, we wished to investigate this aspect in more detail. To date all protein-protein interaction studies between Fds and FNRs in any system have only been performed in vitro. To extend the experimental possibilities to the in vivo situation we established a yeast two-hybrid system consisting of S/TgFNR (note that this is the shorter version; see Fig. 1) and either SoFdI or the two apicomplexan Fds (Fig. 1). In the used two-hybrid format both genes are under control of a galactose-inducible promoter so that a potential interaction can only be observed under inducing conditions. Using this system and leucine auxothrophy as marker for a positive protein-protein interaction we observed that S/TgFNR can interact with all three Fds invivo, although seemingly to a different extent as judged by the difference in cell mass on selective medium (Fig. 5A). According to this experiment, SoFdI bound better to S/TgFNR than did TgFd, and PfFd reproducibly interacted only weekly. Using a second reporter as a measurement for interaction strength we determined the β-galactosidase activity of individual yeast clones after cross-mating them to a strain containing a lexA-driven lacZ reporter plasmid. Again SoFdI appeared to be more efficient in interacting with S/TgFNR than did TgFd or PfFd (Fig. 5B). This was"
https://openalex.org/W2076800542,"The specific action of serine proteinases on protein substrates is a hallmark of blood coagulation and numerous other physiological processes. Enzymic recognition of substrate sequences preceding the scissile bond is considered to contribute dominantly to specificity and function. We have investigated the contribution of active site docking by unique substrate residues preceding the scissile bond to the function of prothrombinase. Mutagenesis of the authentic P(1)-P(3) sequence in prethrombin 2/fragment 1.2 yielded substrate variants that could be converted to thrombin by prothrombinase. Proteolytic activation was also observed with a substrate variant containing the P(1)-P(3) sequence found in a coagulation zymogen not known to be activated by prothrombinase. Lower rates of activation of the variants derived from a decrease in maximum catalytic rate but not in substrate affinity. Replacement of the P(1) residue with Gln yielded an uncleavable derivative that retained the affinity of the wild type substrate for prothrombinase but did not engage the active site of the enzyme. Thus, active site docking of the substrate contributes to catalytic efficiency, but it is does not determine substrate affinity nor does it fully explain the specificity of prothrombinase. Therefore, extended interactions between prothrombinase and substrate regions removed from the cleavage site drive substrate affinity and enforce the substrate specificity of this enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1979576891,"The precursors of most surface proteins on Gram-positive bacteria have a C-terminal hydrophobic domain and charged tail, preceded by a conserved LPXTG motif that signals the anchoring process. This motif is the substrate for an enzyme, termed sortase, which has transpeptidation activity resulting in the cleavage of the LPXTG sequence and ultimate attachment of the protein to the peptidoglycan. While screening a group A streptococcal membrane extract for cleavage activity of the LPXTG motif, we identified an enzyme (which we term “LPXTGase”) that differs significantly from sortase but also cleaves this motif. The enzyme is heavily glycosylated, which is required for its activity. Amino acid composition and sequence analysis revealed that LPXTGase differs from other enzymes, in that the molecule, which is about 14 kDa in size, has no aromatic amino acids, is rich in alanine, and is 30% composed of uncommon amino acids, suggesting a nonribosomal construction. A similar enzyme found in the membrane extract of Staphylococcus aureus, indicates that this unusual molecule may be common among Gram-positive bacteria. Whereas peptide antibiotics have been reported from bacillus species that also contain unusual amino acids and are synthesized non-ribosomally on amino acid-activating polyenzyme templates, this would be the first reported enzyme that may be similarly synthesized.

A large group of cell surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria are covalently anchored through their C termini to the cell wall peptidoglycan. Most of these proteins are essential for pathogenic bacteria to establish successful infection of host tissues, and hence they are considered virulence factors. Functionally, these surface proteins may be divided into three major groups: viz. 1) those with adhesin or invasion function (1–27); 2) those with antiphagocytic activities (28–40); and 3) those that are enzymes that degrade surface components of host cells, thereby facilitating spread, and enzymes that hydrolyze large molecules in the surroundings into utilizable nutrients (29Igarashi T.

A striking feature of all of these functionally and structurally diverse surface proteins is that they all possess a carboxyl-terminal LPXTG sequence (49Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1603-1605Google Scholar), which is cleaved during surface translocation at the septum (50Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-762Google Scholar), resulting in a covalent linkage to cell wall peptidoglycan. In all cases, the genes for these proteins contain additional nucleotide sequences following that which encodes the LPXTG. These additional sequences encode a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids and positively charged C-terminal amino acids. Pancholi and Fischetti (51Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2618-2624Google Scholar) observed that the hydrophobic and positively charged amino acid sequences are missing in the cell wall-linked M protein, indicating that the precursor of M protein was cleaved at a site within or immediately C-terminal to the LPXTG sequence. These findings strongly indicated that surface proteins become anchored to the cell wall by a common mechanism (49Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1603-1605Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that deletion of either the LPXTG or hydrophobic amino acid sequence or charged terminal amino acid from the precursor of protein A of S. aureusresults in failure of protein A anchoring to the cell wall (52Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Google Scholar), indicating that these sequences were essential for the cell wall-anchoring process of these proteins. Collectively, these sequences are considered to be a cell wall sorting signal, which has now been shown to be present in over 100 surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria (53Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Google Scholar, 54Pallen M.J. Lam A.C. Antonio M. Dunbar K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 97-102Google Scholar). Through a series of elegant experiments, Schneewind et al.(55Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Google Scholar) have shown that the peptide bond between threonine and glycine of the LPXTG sequence of protein A becomes cleaved by an enzyme termed sortase, after which the carboxyl terminus of threonine becomes covalently attached to the amino group of one of the glycines of the pentaglycine cross-bridge of the S. aureus cell wall. Recently, they have shown that S. aureus mutants defective in the anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall carry a mutation in srt gene (50Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-762Google Scholar). Subsequently, they cloned thesrtA gene in Escherichia coli and purified recombinant sortase. In vitro, the purified sortase cleaved the LPXTG sequence after threonine (56Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Google Scholar) and also covalently attached the surface protein with C-terminal LPXT to a triglycine substrate (57Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 7447-7452Google Scholar). These results indicate that sortase possesses two functions, a specific endopeptidase and a transpeptidase. In addition, they showed that S. aureus mutants lacking sortase are unable to display surface proteins and are defective in establishing infection (58Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Jensen E.R. Lenoy E. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5510-5515Google Scholar). An analysis of the genome of several Gram-positive bacteria revealed that there is more than one sortase gene per bacterial genome (54Pallen M.J. Lam A.C. Antonio M. Dunbar K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 97-102Google Scholar). In the present report, we have identified and purified an enzyme fromStreptococcus pyogenes that actively cleaves the LPXTG anchor motif but is very different from the sortase ofS. aureus in its glycosylation and presence of uncommon amino acids. We here describe the physical and biochemical properties of this enzyme, which we term LPXTGase. N-Glycosidase F (catalog no. 1,365,193) and O-glycosidase (catalog no. 1,347,101) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. β-N-Acetylhexosaminidase (A7708) and β-glucosidase (G6906) were purchased from Sigma. Group C streptococcal C1 phage lysin was prepared by the method described by Nelson et al.(59Nelson D. Loomis L. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4107-4112Google Scholar). Silica gel TLC plates (catalog no. M 5729-6), solvents, and other chemicals were purchased from Fisher. Carboxymethyl glass beads (G-3910) and 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (E-1769) and buffers were purchased from Sigma.125I was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. S. pyogenes strain D471 was grown in 50 liters of Todd-Hewitt medium supplemented with 1% yeast extract in a fermenter. Cells were harvested when the OD at 650 nm reached 1.0. To harvest the cells, the culture was concentrated to about 2 liters by means of a Millipore Corp. Procon filtration apparatus, and the concentrated culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 rpm using a GSA rotor. Cell pellets (about 120 g total wet weight) were suspended in 1.5 liters of 30 mmMES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin buffer, pH 6.2, and the cells were pelleted again by centrifugation. The washed cell pellets described above were suspended in 1.2 liters of 30 mm MES buffer, pH 6.2, and cell clumps were gently dispersed with a Dounce homogenizer. To the cell suspension 10,000 units of lysin, a muralytic enzyme of a group C phage origin (60Fischetti V.A. Gotschlich E.C. Bernheimer A.W. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 133: 1105-1117Google Scholar), were added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at 37 °C. Treatment with a low concentration of lysin resulted in localized digestion of cell wall peptidoglycan, creating holes in the cell wall. Cell membrane and cytosol exuded through these holes, releasing cytosol and part of the cell membrane as vesicles (59Nelson D. Loomis L. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4107-4112Google Scholar, 61Loeffler J.M. Nelson D. Fischetti V.A. Science. 2001; 294: 2170-2172Google Scholar). The cell ghosts were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 rpm with a GSA rotor, and the supernatant containing cytosol and membrane vesicles was collected. The cell ghosts were then resuspended in 600 ml of the MES buffer, the suspension was centrifuged again, and the supernatant was collected. The combined supernatant, termed the cytosol fraction, was used as a starting material for enzyme purification. The cell ghosts, which retained the remainder of the cell membrane, were suspended in 800 ml of the MES buffer, and after adding Brij 35 to a final concentration of 0.2%, the mixture was stirred overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 rpm, and the resulting supernatant, termed the membrane extract, was also used as a starting material for enzyme preparation. An LPXTG-containing peptide, KRQLPSTGETANPFY from the streptococcal M6 protein, was synthesized by the Rockefeller University Peptide Synthesis Laboratory. The C-terminal tyrosine was added to allow the peptide to be labeled with 125I using IODOBEADs. Generally, 2 mg of the peptide was labeled with 1 mCi of125I. The N terminus of the labeled peptide was then linked to carboxymethyl glass beads by carbodiimide catalysis according to the manufacturer's instructions. To achieve the linkage, the peptide (1.2 μmol) was incubated for 7 h at 37 °C with 200 mg of the glass beads (59 μmol of carboxyl termini) and 30 μmol of 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide with gentle shaking in 2 ml of 100 mm MES buffer, pH 4.9. The reaction mixture was placed in a small column, and unreacted peptide was removed by washing the column with 300 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, containing 1% SDS, and then with 1 liter of distilled water. Similar bead-bound peptides in which the LPSTGE was reversed (EGTSPL) or randomly placed (TEPGSL) were synthesized, labeled, and purified in the same way. To about 1.8 liters of the cytosol fraction, Brij 35 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the fraction was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (16 × 4.3 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. About 500 ml of clear solution absorbing UV at 280 nm eluted first, followed by turbid UV-absorbing solution. After all of the applied cytosol fraction entered the column, the column was washed with 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35. The wash step eluted additional turbid solution and then eluted a clear UV-absorbing solution. Generally, 500 ml of wash buffer was required until UV absorbance returned to base line. The column was then eluted with 0.1m KCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Brij 35 and finally with 0.1 n NaOH. The clear fall-through eluant was collected and saved while the turbid fall-through eluant was reapplied to a second DEAE-cellulose column of similar dimensions, and the clear eluant was collected. The turbid eluant that followed was applied to a third DEAE-cellulose column, and the column was eluted in the same manner. The pool of clear eluants amounting to about 3 liters was concentrated to 30 ml using an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus fitted with a YM3 membrane with a 3-kDa molecular mass cut limit. One-half of the concentrated solution was applied to a Sephadex G50 column (60 × 4.3 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35; the column was then eluted with the same buffer solution, and 20-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed from the column fractions and added to 1.5-ml Microfuge tubes. To each tube was added 30 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35, followed by a 10-μl suspension of bead-bound LPXTG peptide substrate (0.5–0.8 μg, 100,000–200,000 cpm). The reaction mixture was incubated with vigorous shaking for 60 min at 37 °C. After this time, 100 μl of water was added to each tube, and after vortex mixing, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the beads. 100 μl of the supernatant was withdrawn, and radioactivity was counted with a γ counter. To determine the pH optimum of enzyme activity, enzyme reactions were carried out under various pH conditions using the following buffers: MES-NaOH (pH 5, 6, 6.5, and 7), Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, and 9), NH4OH-HCl (pH 10), and triethylamine HCl (pH 11 and 12). To determine the effect of detergents on enzyme activity, enzyme reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.05–0.5% of Brij 35 or Triton X-100. To determine the optimal duration of reaction time, the amount of radioactive peptide released from the beads was measured at 10-min intervals up to 2 h. About 2 μg of bead-bound or free KRQLPSTGETANPFY, in which the terminal tyrosine was labeled with 125I, was incubated with purified LPXTGase in 50 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij in separate Microfuge tubes for a varying length of time at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. For reactions with bead-bound peptide, the tubes were centrifuged at designated times in order to pellet unreacted bead-bound peptide, and 30-μl aliquots of the supernatant were spotted onto a silica gel TLC plate. For reaction with free peptide, 30-μl aliquots from each tube at designated times were directly spotted on a silica gel TLC plate. The plates were developed with a solvent mixture consisting of ethyl acetate/pyridine/acetic acid/water (60:30:9:24), and the reaction products were located by autoradiography. Reaction products were eluted from the plate, and amino acid sequences were determined with an Applied Biosystems AB1 Procise 494 instrument by the Rockefeller University protein chemistry laboratory. Various concentrations of LPXTGase or trypsin (as control) was added to 50 μg of bovine serum albumin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) under conditions described above and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A sample of the reaction mixtures was analyzed by SDS-PAGE for degradation. Varying concentrations of125I-labeled KRQLPSTGETANPFY peptide, ranging from 20 to 240 μm were incubated with 2.4 μm of the purified enzyme in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35 at 37 °C for 30 min. At the end of the reaction time, 30 μl of the reaction mixtures were spotted on silica gel TLC plates, and the plates were developed with ethyl acetate/pyridine/acetic acid/water (60:30:9:24). The plates were then autoradiographed, and substrate and reaction products were scraped off the plate and counted for radioactivity. The fractions with enzyme activity eluting from the Sephadex G50 column were combined, and the enzyme solution, amounting to about 150 ml, was concentrated to about 10 ml by YM3 ultrafiltration, after which an aliquot of 2–3 ml was lyophilized. The lyophilized enzyme was dissolved in 200 μl of distilled water, and the concentrated enzyme solution was divided into two preweighed Microfuge tubes. To each tube 300 μl each of ethanol and ethyl acetate was added. The tubes were kept at −20 °C, precipitating the enzyme, leaving most of the Brij 35 and buffer salts in the supernatant. The precipitated enzyme was pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellets were dissolved in a small volume of distilled water. This enzyme solution was used as the starting material for various chemical analyses. For dry weight determination, the precipitate was dissolved in 200 μl of distilled water and the ethanol/ethyl acetate precipitation step was repeated two more times in order to remove residual detergent and salts, the final precipitate was dried in vacuo, and the tubes were weighed. The amino acid and sugar composition of the LPXTGase were determined by the Rockefeller University Protein Chemistry Laboratory using a Waters 490 HPLC system. The concentrated enzyme in distilled water described above was used as starting material for these analyses. To remove covalently bound carbohydrate from the protein backbone of the LPXTGase, 1.2 mg of the enzyme was incubated for 36 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking with 10 units ofN-glycosidase F and 10 milliunits ofO-glycosidase in 600 μl of 30 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35 in a Microfuge tube. The incubation mixture was then banded on silica gel plates, and the plates were developed twice with 80% ethanol. The deglycosylated protein band was visualized by exposing the plate to iodine vapor. The protein band was eluted with 80% ethanol and concentrated to about 200 μl in a Speedvac (Savant). To the concentrated protein solution, 400 μl of 30 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35, and 5 μg of trypsin were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. To prepare phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-labeled tryptic fragments, 3 μl of phenylisothiocyanate, and 300 μl of pyridine were added to the trypsinized enzyme, after which a small volume of 1n NaOH was added to raise the pH to 9, and the mixture was shaken at 37 °C for 6 h. The reaction mixture was then banded on a silica gel plate and developed with a solvent mixture consisting of n-butyl alcohol, hexane, acetic acid, and water (40:40:9:1). UV-absorbing, PTH-labeled tryptic fragments were located, and the fragments were eluted with 95% ethanol. The slow moving fragment was then subjected to Edman degradation as follows. After hydrolysis of the PTH-peptide by a 30-min exposure to 30% trifluoroacetic acid at 50 °C, the PTH-derivative and residual peptide were separated on a silica gel TLC plate using the same running solvent. The PTH-derivative was located under a UV light, and the residual peptide was located by exposure of the plate to iodine vapor. In this manner, seven PTH-derivatives were prepared. The Rockefeller University Protein Chemistry Laboratory identified the PTH-derivatives. Of the seven PTH-derivatives, four exhibited unusual masses. To help identify them, these derivatives were acid-hydrolyzed, and the Protein Chemistry Service Laboratory again analyzed the resulting products. LPXTGase was preincubated with glycosidases in 40 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35, for 1 h at 37 °C, after which a 10-μl suspension of bead-bound,125I-labeled KRQLPSTGETANPFY peptide was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, peptide cleavage was determined as described above. To label the LPXTGase directly for visualization on SDS gels, 125I-tyramine was linked to the enzyme. Tyramine (1 μmol) was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with 20 μCi of 125I in the presence of IODOBEADs in 200 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. 30 μl of the125I-labeled tyramine solution was transferred to a Microfuge tube, to which were added about 60 μg of concentrated LPXTGase and 50 μg of 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, both in 50 μl of distilled water, and then 20 μl of 1 mMES buffer, pH 4.9, and 2 μl of 10% Brij 35 were added. Finally, distilled water was added to bring the volume of the incubation mixture to 200 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 7 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. At the end of the incubation, the volume of the incubation mixture was reduced to 50 μl by means of a Speedvac, and the enzyme was precipitated with ethanol and ethyl acetate as described above. Using the bead-bound125I-labeled KRQLPSTGETANPFY peptide from S. pyogenes, which contains the LPXTG motif, we attempted to identify an endopeptidase in the streptococcal cell extract. In numerous initial trials, no LPXTG cleavage activity was detected in any crude fraction or in fractions from chromatography columns. Eventually, we discovered that ultrafiltrates of the crude extract using a YM3 filter removed a low molecular weight substance that inhibited the cleavage activity. After removing this inhibitor by ultrafiltration, active enzyme could be prepared from both cytosol and membrane extracts. The enzyme activity in the cytosol is entirely attributable to membrane vesicles released into the cytosol rather than a soluble cytosol fraction. For example, lysin treatment of S. pyogenes results in localized digestion of the cell wall, producing holes in the cell wall. Through these holes, segments of cell membrane exude externally, which become pinched off as vesicles (59Nelson D. Loomis L. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4107-4112Google Scholar). When the turbid cytosol was centrifuged for 1 h at 30,000 rpm, membrane vesicles along with all of the enzyme activity were pelleted. A large part of the cell membrane still remained associated with the cell ghosts, and more cleavage activity could be extracted from the ghost-associated membranes. Preliminary experiments revealed that LPXTG cleavage activity does not bind to DEAE-cellulose, whereas most proteins did. Thus, the cytosol fraction containing membrane vesicles or the membrane extract of the cell ghost was directly applied to a DEAE-cellulose column as the first step of enzyme preparation. Free enzyme released from the membrane eluted first in the clear fall-through fraction, which was followed by the vesicle-containing turbid fraction. However, neither the clear nor turbid fall-through fractions showed an LPXTG cleavage activity initially (Fig.1). Thus, when the volume of the clear fall-through fraction was reduced by ultrafiltration using a 3-kDa cut-off YM3 membrane, the retentate exhibited enzyme activity. This suggests that a low molecular weight inhibitor eluted from the DEAE column together with the enzyme in the fall-through fraction, and the inhibitor passed through the membrane during ultrafiltration. As the concentration of Brij 35 in the fall-through fraction increased during concentration, it formed micelles, which could not pass through YM3 membrane, and as a consequence the retentate became very viscous. Therefore, to remove Brij 35, a large volume of detergent-free Tris-HCl buffer was added to the retentate, and the ultrafiltration process was continued. During this procedure, more of the enzyme inhibitor passed through the YM3 membrane along with monomeric Brij 35, increasing the activity of the enzyme in the retentate. When the concentrated enzyme solution was subjected to gel filtration using Sephadex G50, an active enzyme peak eluted soon after the void volume (Fig. 2). The activity peak did not absorb UV at 280 nm, indicating that the enzyme does not contain aromatic amino acids. Comparison with the elution profiles of proteins of known molecular weights indicates that the apparent molecular weight of the cleavage enzyme is about 14,000. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed no protein bands stained with either Coomassie Blue or silver, even when over 100 μg of the purified enzyme was applied to a 16% gel (not shown). However, the lack of protein bands verified the purity of the enzyme preparation. Thus, in order to detect the enzyme in polyacrylamide gels,125I-labeled tyramine was linked to the carboxyl groups of the enzyme by means of carbodiimide catalysis, and the radioactive enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography of dried gels showed that most of the labeled enzyme was retained in the stacking gel, and only a small amount entered the running gel (Fig.3). When the enzyme was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and subjected to SDS-PAGE, most of the fluorescent enzyme was located in the stacking gel, with a small amount entering the running gel as a series of faint bands, forming a ladder (not shown) with no fluorescent material at the 14-kDa region. These observations strongly suggest that the enzyme forms large aggregates in the presence of SDS. To determine where in the LPXTG motif cleavage occurred, purified endopeptidase was used to cleave a bead-bound form of the KRQLPSTGETANPFY peptide, and the cleaved fragment was subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Results revealed that the enzyme cleaved after glutamic acid within the LPSTGE sequence, releasing the TANPFY peptide fragment (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, the enzyme cleaved the free KRQLPSTGETANPFY peptide at two sites, after the serine and the glutamic acid of LPSTGE, yielding TGETANPFY and TANPFY, respectively (Fig. 4 B). The fact that only these products were observed indicates that the trypsin (KR) and chymotrypsin (FY) substrates found at either end of the peptide were not cleaved by the endopeptidase. When the enzyme was reacted with similar bead-bound peptides in which the LPSTGE was reversed (EGTSPL) or randomly placed (TEPGSL), no cleavage was observed (not shown). No cleavage was also observed when native bovine serum albumin was reacted in a similar way. The small amount of radioactive materials observed at the solvent front originated from the impurities in the synthetic peptide. These impurities were not reactive to enzyme action. Based on its ability to specifically cleave within the LPXTG anchor motif of surface proteins, we have termed this endopeptidase “LPXTGase.” Since the enzyme does not contain any aromatic amino acid, neither the Lowry nor Bradford methods could be used to determine protein concentration. Thus, the enzyme concentration was determined on the basis of its estimated molecular mass (14 kDa) and dry weight. Using this, a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the kinetics of the LPXTGase was determined (Fig. 5), resulting in a K m of 0.26 mm and aV max of 67 μm in 30 min when 2.4 μm enzyme was used in the assay. As shown in Fig.6, the LPXTGase exhibited a broad pH optimum between 7.5 and 10. Below pH 5 or above 10, the enzyme activity could not be measured. In most enzyme assays, pH 7.6 was used, because background activity was higher at higher pH. Enzyme activity was highest when 0.1–0.2% of both Brij 35 and Triton X-100 was incorporated. The maximal initial enzyme velocity was maintained up to the first 20 min, and after 1 h only small additional cleavage of the peptide occurred. The LPXTGase was exposed to a variety of salts, and its activity was tested for cleavage of the LPXTG-containing peptide. As seen in TableI, the enzyme was found to be rather sensitive to exposure to a number of certain salts.Table IEffect of salts on LPXTGase activitySaltsConcentrationPeptide cleavedPercentage of controlmMcpm%Sodium chloride1006,72016Potassium chloride1008,60820Hydroxylamine HCl10011,20027Magnesium chloride208,61520Calcium chloride209,70623Putrescene chloride208,71021Sodium phosphate2020,64649Sodium sulfate2023,45457EDTA202,1475.2Control (no salt)41,530100Reaction mixtures contained, in 50 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Brij 35, a fixed amount of LPXTGase,125I-labeled LPXTG-peptide (about 180,000 cpm), and the indicated concentrations of various salts.

https://openalex.org/W1970302490,"The mammalian hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) is an endocytic recycling receptor that mediates the internalization of desialylated glycoproteins and their delivery to lysosomes where they are degraded. The human ASGP-R is a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of two subunits designated H1 and H2. Both subunits are palmitoylated at the cytoplasmic Cys residues near their transmembrane domains (TMD). The cytoplasmic Cys36 in H1 is located at a position that is five amino acids from the transmembrane junction. Because the sequences of subunits in all mammalian ASGP-R species are highly conserved especially at the region near the palmitoylated Cys, we sought to identify a recognition signal for the palmitoylation of H1. Various types of H1 mutants were created by site-directed or deletion mutagenesis including alteration of the amino acids surrounding Cys36, replacing portions of the TMD with that of a different protein and partial deletion of the cytoplasmic domain as well as transposing the palmitoylated Cys to positions further away from the TMD. Mutant H1 cDNAs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the H1 proteins were analyzed after metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitate. The results indicate that neither the native amino acid sequence surrounding Cys36 nor the majority of the cytoplasmic domain sequence is critical for palmitoylation. Palmitoylation was also not dependent on the native TMD of H1. In contrast, the attachment of palmitate was abolished if the Cys residue was transposed to a position that was 30 amino acids away from the transmembrane border. We conclude that the spacing of a Cys residue relative to the TMD in the primary protein sequence of H1 is the major determinant for successful palmitoylation.

We conclude that the spacing of a Cys residue relative to the TMD in the primary protein sequence of H1 is the major determinant for successful palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is a post-translational modification in which the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate is covalently attached to a protein, usually via a thioester linkage (1Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Google Scholar, 2Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Google Scholar, 3James G. Olsen E.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2623-2634Google Scholar). The attachment of palmitate to integral membrane proteins occurs at Cys residue(s) located in the cytoplasmic region near the membrane or within the transmembrane domain (TMD) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; ASOR, asialo-orosomucoid; ASGP-R, asialoglycoprotein receptor itself. A wide variety of proteins are palmitoylated. Some of these are soluble proteins such as Ras (4Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. MacDonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 7: 4722-4730Google Scholar) and G protein (5Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of these soluble proteins enhances their membrane binding ability and targets them to specific membrane domains (1Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Google Scholar). Many palmitoylated proteins are also integral membrane proteins that are already anchored to the lipid bilayer through their membrane-spanning regions. These proteins include the β2-adrenergic receptor (6O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Google Scholar), the transferrin receptor (7Alvarez E. Girones N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16644-16655Google Scholar), the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (8Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Google Scholar), and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (9Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Google Scholar, 10Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32454-32460Google Scholar). It is probable that palmitoylation plays a role other than membrane anchoring in these transmembrane proteins. For example, because of its close proximity to Ser345 and Ser346, the palmitoylation of Cys341 inhibits phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor by restricting the access of these phosphorylation sites to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (11Moffett S. Adam L. Bonin H. Loisel T.P. Bouvier M. Mouillac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21490-21497Google Scholar). The endocytic rate of a palmitoylation-defective transferrin receptor increased ∼2-fold compared with that of the wild-type receptor (7Alvarez E. Girones N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16644-16655Google Scholar), indicating that palmitoylation might regulate transferrin receptor trafficking. Palmitoylation is also important for the normal trafficking and lysosomal enzyme-sorting functions of the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (8Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Google Scholar). Therefore, palmitate modifications can have important physiological functions in addition to serving as a membrane localization signal. The human ASGP-R is an endocytic receptor found predominantly in hepatocytes (12Stockert R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 591-609Google Scholar, 13Geffen I. Spiess M. Int. Rev.

Although its function remains unknown and no endogenous ligands have been identified (16Weigel P.H. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 519-524Google Scholar, 17Tozawa R. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yamamoto K. Yagyu H.

Harford J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 531-554Google Scholar). The human ASGP-R is a hetero-oligomer composed of two homologous subunits designated H1 and H2. H1 is a type II single-pass transmembrane protein with a 40-amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, an extracellular stalk, and an ∼130-amino acid C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (12Stockert R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 591-609Google Scholar, 13Geffen I. Spiess M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 181-219Google Scholar, 14Weigel P.H. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 19: 125-161Google Scholar, 15Weigel P.H. Yik J.H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 341-363Google Scholar). H1 is palmitoylated at Cys36 in the cytoplasmic domain (10Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32454-32460Google Scholar), whereas H2 is palmitoylated at the analogous cytoplasmic domain residue Cys54 as well as the juxtamembrane Cys58 (20Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40844-40852Google Scholar). The two subunits in all mammalian species are highly homologous, especially at the region surrounding the cytoplasmic Cys. Therefore, this region could potentially contain a recognition motif for palmitoylation. To determine whether H1 contains a sequence motif for palmitoylation, we constructed a variety of cytoplasmic or TMD mutants of H1 and determined their ability to be metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate. [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid (30–60 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human orosomucoid was obtained from Sigma and desialylated to generate ASOR as described previously (21Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 258: 5089-5094Google Scholar). ASOR-Sepharose 4B was prepared as described previously (9Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21388-21395Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-H1 antibody was made against a peptide corresponding to the H1 C-terminal sequence as described previously (22Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Google Scholar). Buffer 1 contains 10 mm N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (Research Organics, Inc.), pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 6.7 mm KCl. Phosphate-buffered saline contains 137 mm NaCl, 8 mm sodium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Restriction enzymes were from Promega. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry by Midland Certified Reagent Company. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. H1 and H1(C36S) cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32454-32460Google Scholar). The cDNAs for mutants H1(Δ4–11), H1(Δ4–33)A, H1(Δ12–33), and H1(Δ26–40) were generously provided by Dr. Martin Spiess (University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) atHindIII and EcoRI restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic oligonucleotides and H1-derived templates used to generate all constructs are shown in Table I. The mutant H1(5A) in which amino acid residues Gln33 to Ser37 were mutated to Ala was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Fallon (Indiana University).

COS-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured in complete medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All plasmid DNAs used for transfections were purified from Escherichia coli Top10F′ or XL1 Blue cells using Plasmid Maxi kits (Qiagen). Transfections of COS-7 cells were performed using the calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of plasmid DNA was transfected into ∼60–70% confluent cells in a 60-mm dish. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 16 h post-transfection and then cultured in completed medium, usually overnight, before being used. At ∼40 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved for 1 h and then metabolically labeled with 400 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml delipidated bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 3–4 h. Cells were washed three times with Buffer 1 and then lysed with Buffer 1 containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). H1 was isolated by affinity chromatography using ASOR-Sepharose 4B and eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm acetic acid, pH 5.0, 10 mm EGTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100 as described previously (20Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40844-40852Google Scholar). The eluted samples were neutralized with 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Samples were heated at 55 °C for 5 min, split into two portions, and subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting or fluorography in parallel. For fluorography, the gel was soaked in Fluoro-Hance solution at room temperature for 30 min, dried at ∼75 °C, and exposed to Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −85 °C for 3–7 days. H1 was detected in Western blots using a rabbit polyclonal IgG specific for the H1 C-terminal peptide (22Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Google Scholar). Images of the Western blots and fluorographs were captured digitally and quantified using a Fluorchem 8000® Imaging System from Alpha Innotech Corporation. The normalized values for the palmitoylation of various H1 subunits were calculated based on the ratio of the densities of the bands in the parallel fluorography and Western analysis. The experiments shown in each figure were repeated 3 or 4 times. For each individual experiment, the 100% palmitoylation value was determined by its own internal wild-type control and the value for each mutant was then determined relative to that internal control value. Finally, the mean value ± S.E. (n = 3 or 4) for each mutant H1 is shown in the bar graphs. Because the wild-type values within each experiment are set at 100%, these are not shown in every experiment. However, to show the variation between experiments, Fig. 1 displays the mean value (set at 100%) ± S.E. for the palmitoylation of wild-type H1 calculated using the combined internal wild-type controls from all experiments. Some values apparently greater than 100% may reflect the error in determining the mean normalized palmitoylation value of the wild-type H1 as well as the comparative ratios. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Western blotting procedures were performed essentially as described by Burnette (24Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxynucleotide method of Sanger et al. (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) by the Department of Microbiology & Immunology Sequencing Facility (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center) using Applied Biosystems model 377 automated DNA sequencers. The regions immediately adjacent to the palmitoylated Cys are highly conserved in all mammalian ASGP-R subunits (e.g. the sequences among both subunits from mouse, human, and rat are all QRLCSG). Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to alter one or more of the amino acid residues in this region to identify a possible palmitoylation recognition motif. First, the three amino acids upstream or downstream of Cys36 in H1 were mutated individually to Ala (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–3 and5–7). The wild-type and six-mutant H1 variants were expressed in COS-7 cells and tested for their ability to be palmitoylated. The results showed that all six of these single-point mutations in H1 had minimal or no effect on the palmitoylation of Cys36 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–7). Next, we generated mutant H1(4A+C) by substituting residues Gln33, Arg34, Leu35, and Ser37 of H1 with four Ala residues (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). These multiple mutations in the region surrounding Cys36 reduced but did not prevent palmitoylation (Fig. 1 B, lane 8). Taken together, these data indicate that the native amino acid sequence immediately surrounding Cys36 is not critical for H1 palmitoylation. The H1 bands detected by Western analysis appeared at more than one position and were diffuse; however, this finding is consistent with observations made in HepG2 or HuH-7 cells, which are human hepatoma cell lines that express the native ASGP-R. These multiple or diffuse bands are caused by the heterogeneity of N-linked glycosylation. After deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F, the multiple H1 protein bands migrated as a single discrete band in SDS-PAGE with a M r value matching the predicted size of the nascent peptide (data not shown). We next determined whether the cytoplasmic region upstream of Cys36 is required for palmitoylation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the H1 cytoplasmic residues from Glu4 to Leu11 (lane 1), Glu4 to Gln33 (lane 2), Glu12 to Gln33 (lane 3), or Pro26 to Arg40 (lane 4) were deleted. The mutant cDNAs were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the H1 subunits were analyzed for their ability to be labeled with [3H]palmitate as described above. All of the deletion mutants with the exception of the mutant in which the Cys was also deleted were labeled with [3H]palmitate (Fig.2 B, lanes 1–4). In fact, the palmitoylation of the H1(Δ12–33) variant was enhanced (lane 3). These data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic region spanning the residues from Glu4 to Gln33 is not required for palmitoylation of H1. We next determined whether the sequence within the H1 TMD contains a recognition signal for palmitoylation. Chimeric constructs of H1 were generated by replacing the H1 transmembrane sequence with that of the non-palmitoylated fusogenic spike protein (F protein) of Sendai virus. F protein is a non-palmitoylated protein (26Veit M. Schmidt M.F.G. Rott R. Virology. 1989; 168: 173-176Google Scholar), because it does not contain Cys in its transmembrane or cytoplasmic region. Ponimaskin and Schmidt (27Ponimaskin E. Schmidt F.G. Virology. 1998; 249: 325-335Google Scholar) found that the introduction of Cys residues into the cytoplasmic domain of the F protein is also not sufficient to induce palmitoylation. Palmitate modification only occurs if part of the transmembrane sequence or cytoplasmic sequence of a palmitoylated protein is introduced along with a Cys residue into the F protein. As shown in Fig.3 A, cDNA constructs in which one-third (lane 1), two-thirds (lane 2), or the whole TMD of H1 (lane 3) was replaced with that of the Sendai virus F protein were transfected into COS-7 cells and analyzed for their [3H]palmitate labeling. The H1 transmembrane mutant with the whole transmembrane region replaced with the corresponding F protein sequence (lane 3) was not expressed or was degraded completely before it reached maturity in transfected COS-7 cells, possibly because of incorrect folding or instability of H1 in the absence of its native TMD. As a result, the palmitoylation status of this mutant could not be assessed. However, the H1 mutants with one-third or two-thirds of the TMD replaced were still palmitoylated (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the native sequence of at least the first 15 amino acids of the TMD is not important for palmitoylation of H1. We next analyzed the importance of the spacing between Cys36 and the TMD for H1 palmitoylation. A series of mutant cDNAs was constructed by inserting one, two, or three Ala residues immediately after Pro39 in H1, thus presumably increasing the relative distance between Cys36and the TMD (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1–3). The results showed that insertion of up to three Ala residues between the palmitoylated Cys residue and the TMD had minimal effects on H1 palmitoylation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. To investigate further the relationship of palmitoylation and the spacing between the Cys and the TMD, we generated another series of H1 mutants. The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the native amino acid sequence surrounding Cys36 was not critical for palmitoylation. Therefore, instead of increasing the spacing between Cys and the TMD by inserting increasingly more Ala residues until palmitoylation might be inhibited, we replaced Cys36 with a Ser residue and then reintroduced a new Cys residue further upstream from its original position. This strategy effectively increased the spacing between the TMD and the target Cys but at the same time kept the length and most of the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain constant. As shown in Fig.5 A, a Cys residue was transposed to a position that was either 10 (lane 1), 20 (lane 2), or 30 (lane 3) residues away from the TMD. Results from [3H]palmitate-labeling experiments showed that H1 was still palmitoylated when the Cys was transposed to a position 10 residues away from the TMD (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). However, palmitoylation no longer occurred when the Cys residue was relocated to a position 20 or 30 residues away from the TMD (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that H1 palmitoylation occurs only if the position of Cys is within a certain distance from the transmembrane junction. As a control to show that palmitoylation is independent of the amino acid sequence surrounding the target Cys residue, the amino acids from Pro26 to Arg40 of mutant H1(L21C) (Fig.5 A, lane 2) were deleted to generate mutant H1(L21C,Δ26–40) (Fig. 5 A, lane 4) so that the position of Cys was restored to within five residues from the TMD as in the wild-type H1. The palmitoylation defect was rescued in this deletion mutant (Fig. 5 B, lane 4), indicating that the spacing of Cys relative to the TMD rather than the native amino acid sequence near the target Cys is the major determinant for palmitoylation. In the non-palmitoylated mutants H1(L21C) and H1(L11C) (Fig.5 A, lanes 2 and 3) in which the Cys was transposed to a position 20 or 30 residues from the TMD border, the target Cys residue was now upstream of the four consecutive prolines (Pro26–29). Because the proximity of a Cys to the membrane surface may be important for its palmitoylation (28Ten Brinke A. Vaandrager A.B. Haagsman H.P. Ridder A.N. van Golde L.M. Batenburg J.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 663-671Google Scholar), the proline string in H1 thus could introduce structural constraints that may prevent an upstream Cys residue from reaching a position close enough to the membrane bilayer. To test this hypothesis, residues from Pro26 to Pro29 in H1(L21C) and H1(L11C) were substituted with four Ala residues, resulting in the generation of mutants H1[L21C,P(26–29)A] and H1[L11C,P(26–29)A], respectively (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 6). Metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitate showed that the non-palmitoylated H1(L21C) mutant (Fig. 5 B, lane 2) was converted to a palmitoylated form (Fig. 5 B,lane 5) by replacing the stretch of four Pro residues with four Ala residues, indicating that these Pro residues were inhibiting palmitoylation. However, the palmitoylation defect in the H1(L11C) mutant (Fig. 5 B, lane 3) was not rescued by the same replacement of Pro4 with Ala4 (Fig.5 B, lane 6). Our previous studies showed that the two subunits of the human ASGP-R, H1 and H2, are palmitoylated at their cytoplasmic Cys residues (10Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32454-32460Google Scholar, 20Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40844-40852Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence in the region surrounding the palmitoylated Cys residue is highly conserved between both ASGP-R subunits in all mammals. In this study, we attempted to determine a recognition signal in the H1 cytoplasmic domain or TMD for targeting the palmitoylation of Cys. Our results indicate that neither the native amino acid sequences surrounding the Cys nor those within the TMD are essential for palmitoylation of H1. In contrast, the relative distance between the palmitoylated Cys and the transmembrane border in the primary protein sequence is a major determinant for successful H1 palmitoylation. Other investigators have attempted to determine a structural requirement for palmitoylation of various integral membrane proteins. However, the comparison of the cytoplasmic tails of 12 different palmitoylated transmembrane proteins failed to reveal a consensus sequence for palmitate modification (27Ponimaskin E. Schmidt F.G. Virology. 1998; 249: 325-335Google Scholar). Hansen et al. (29Hansen S.G. Grosenbach D.W. Hruby D.E. Virology. 1999; 254: 124-137Google Scholar) and Grosenbach et al. (30Grosenbach D.W. Ulaeto D.O. Hruby D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1956-1964Google Scholar) identified a loosely conserved palmitoylation motif (TMDX 1–12AAC[C]A) among 20 different integral membrane proteins where TMD represents the transmembrane domain, “X ” represents a stretch of any amino acids up to 12 residues in length, and “A” represents aliphatic amino acids. However, numerous other palmitoylated transmembrane proteins including the mutant H1(L21C,P26–29A) generated here have Cys residues that are >14 residues away from the TMD or contain positively charged residues immediately adjacent to the Cys residue. Therefore, this putative palmitoylation motif can not be applied to all transmembrane proteins that are palmitoylated. Schweizer et al. (8Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Google Scholar) investigated the structural requirement for palmitoylation of an endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane protein, p63, and concluded that the majority of the cytoplasmic domain and the native amino acid sequence surrounding the palmitoylated Cys100 as well as that in the TMD were not critical for p63 palmitoylation. ten Brinke et al. (28Ten Brinke A. Vaandrager A.B. Haagsman H.P. Ridder A.N. van Golde L.M. Batenburg J.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 663-671Google Scholar) also found that the native amino acid sequence near the palmitoylated Cys residue or within the TMD was not critical for palmitoylation of the pulmonary surfactant protein C precursor. These above findings are in agreement with our present results on the sequence requirements for H1 palmitoylation. On the other hand, the palmitoylation of p63 is drastically reduced if the spacing between the Cys residue and the TMD is either increased or decreased by only five residues (8Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Google Scholar). The same is true for the palmitoylation of surfactant protein C precursor, which is reduced ∼ 3-fold if eight Ala residues are inserted between the Cys and the TMD. These results are in contrast to our finding that Cys transposed to a position 20 residues away from the TMD can still be palmitoylated to roughly the same extent (Fig. 5, lane 5) compared with the Cys residue in wild-type H1, which is five residues removed from the TMD. The hydrophobic tail of the fatty acid in a palmitoylated protein is probably intercalated into the membrane bilayer. The study of the palmitoylation of surfactant protein C precursor (28Ten Brinke A. Vaandrager A.B. Haagsman H.P. Ridder A.N. van Golde L.M. Batenburg J.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 663-671Google Scholar) as well as the present results on the palmitoylation of H1 suggests that for Cys palmitoylation to occur, a Cys residue has to be physically in close proximity to the inner membrane surface. However, palmitoylation may still be possible even when there are a large number of spacer residues between the Cys and the TMD if the region encoded by the spacer sequence is folded into a favorable conformation that allows the Cys to be situated in the vicinity of the lipid bilayer. Several palmitoylated transmembrane proteins such as the transforming growth factor-α (31Shum L. Turck C.W. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28502-28508Google Scholar) and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (8Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Google Scholar) contain Cys residues that are located at a position >30 residues distal to the transmembrane border. Presumably, the region between the Cys and the transmembrane junction in these proteins could form a looplike structure to bring the Cys residue closer toward the plasma membrane (8Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Google Scholar). The H1 cytoplasmic domain contains a region in which 5 of 6 residues are Pro (Pro25–28 and Pro30). Palmitoylation of H1 mutants appeared to be inhibited when the original Cys was transposed to positions upstream of this proline stretch (Fig. 5,lanes 2 and 3), which could introduce a structural constraint in the H1 cytoplasmic domain that prevents the transposed Cys residue from approaching the membrane bilayer. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that the palmitoylation defect was rescued by replacing residues Pro26-Pro29 with four Ala residues in the H1(L21C) mutant (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 5). However, this same strategy of replacing the proline stretch failed to revert the palmitoylation defect in the H1(L11C) mutant (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). A possible explanation for this latter result is that the region to which the Cys is transposed in the H1[L11C,P(26–29)A] mutant may be in a conformation such that the Cys residue is buried within the tertiary structure and is inaccessible for palmitoylation or is not in a favorable position near the membrane bilayer. Another possible scenario is that the region to which the Cys was transposed may interact with other proteins or other H1 subunits, thus blocking the interaction between the Cys residue and a palmitoyltransferase. For example, the location of the transposed Cys residue in mutant H1[L11C,P(26–29)A] is relatively close to the consensus signaling sequence for endocytosis YQDL8, which interacts with adaptin to target receptor internalization through clathrin-coated pits (32Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Leitinger B. Weiss M. Huggel K. Griffiths G. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20772-20777Google Scholar). Furthermore, the position of the Cys residue in this mutant is also near the phosphorylated Tyr5 and Ser16 residues (33Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8425-8429Google Scholar, 34Haynes P.A. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33146-33151Google Scholar). Therefore, this region of the cytoplasmic domain is probably in association with adaptin or protein kinase(s), which may compete for the binding of the palmitoyltransferase. The presence of nearby phosphorylated residues might also interfere with the recognition of a Cys residue by a palmitoyltransferase, as is the case with CD4 (35Crise B. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13593-13597Google Scholar). The C terminus of CD4 is located in the cytoplasm and contains several Cys residues; however, only Cys394 and Cys397, which are near the border of the TMD, are palmitoylated. Mutating both of these Cys residues to Ser abolishes palmitoylation of CD4, although Cys420 and Cys422, which are located further downstream from the TMD, are still available as potential palmitoylation acceptor sites. In fact, Cys420 and Cys422 of CD4 are part of an 8-amino acid motif that is involved in binding a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase p56lck(36Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Google Scholar, 37Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of p56lck to this motif or its phosphorylation could limit the accessibility of Cys420and Cys422 to the palmitoyltransferase, and this situation could be analogous to that of the transposed Cys residue in the non-palmitoylated mutant H1[L11C,P(26–29)A]. Other types of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, or N-myristoylation have well defined consensus sequences or motifs for targeting the specific modification. Many scientists were surprised that a well characterized recognition motif common among palmitoylated integral membrane proteins could not be established. In fact, there is still debate regarding whether protein palmitoylation occurs enzymatically, catalyzed by palmitoyltransferases, or non-enzymatically by the reaction of compounds containing “high energy” thioacyl bonds with free thiols of proteins (38Veit M. Sachs K. Heckelmann M. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Schmidt M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 90-98Google Scholar). However, based on the cloning and characterization of two protein thioesterases (39Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Google Scholar, 40Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Google Scholar), which catalyze the removal of palmitate from proteins, and the preliminary report of a protein palmitoyltransferase cloned from yeast (41Lobo S. Deschenes R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12 (Suppl.): 6aGoogle Scholar), we believe that most protein palmitoylation reactions are enzyme-mediated. In summary, we find no evidence for a recognition motif for palmitoylation in the cytoplasmic domain or TMD of the ASGP-R major subunit H1. In contrast, palmitoylation of H1 is abolished if the Cys residue is transposed to a position that is 30 residues away from the TMD. This could be attributed to the masking of the region near the transposed Cys by other proteins, thus denying the accessibility of the palmitoyltransferase, or the result of the positioning of the transposed Cys in an unfavorable tertiary structure that does not allow membrane proximity. We have recently shown (20Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40844-40852Google Scholar, 42Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 980-986Google Scholar) that palmitoylation of the human ASGP-R is required for efficient endocytosis of ligand.2Palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs bind ASOR with the same affinity and show the same sensitivity in vitro for dissociation of ASOR·ASGP-R complexes at low pH as wild-type receptor. Despite these normal properties, ASGP-Rs that contain any combination of palmitoylation-defective H1 and H2 subunits are unable to uncouple efficiently from ligand so that receptor-mediated endocytosis, ligand delivery to lysosomes, and degradation are substantially decreased. Regardless of how the ASGP-R palmitoylation process occursin vivo, it is critical for the normal function of the receptor. We thank Dr. Robert Fallon for the kind gift of the H1(5A) plasmid, Dr. Martin Spiess for the generous gift of plasmids containing various H1 mutant cDNAs, and Dr. Fu-Yue Zeng for the subcloning of these H1 cDNAs."

The p16INK4a member of the INK4 protein family is altered in a variety of cancers and structure-function studies of the INK4 proteins reveal that the vast majority of missense tumor-derived p16INK4a mutations reduce protein thermodynamic stability. Based on this observation, we used p18INK4c as a model to test the proposal that INK4 proteins with increased stability might have enhanced cell cycle inhibitory activity. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to prepare p18INK4c mutant proteins with a predicted increase in stability. Using this approach, we report the generation of three mutant p18INK4C proteins, F71N, F82Q, and F92N, with increased stability toward thermal denaturation of which the F71N mutant also showed an increased stability to chemical denaturation. The x-ray crystal structures of the F71N, F82Q, and F92N p18INK4C mutant proteins were determined to reveal the structural basis for their increased stability properties. Significantly, the F71N mutant also showed enhanced CDK6 interaction and cell cycle inhibitory activity in vivo, as measured using co-immunoprecipitation and transient transfection assays, respectively. These studies show that a structure-based approach to increase the thermodynamic stability of INK4 proteins can be exploited to prepare more biologically active molecules with potential applications for the development of molecules to treat p16INK4a-mediated cancers. p18INK4c is a member of the INK4 family of proteins that regulate the G1 to S cell cycle transition by binding to and inhibiting the pRb kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6.

Progression through the cell cycle is monitored at the G1-S phase checkpoint by active complexes between cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; INK4, inhibitors of CDK4. 4 and 6 and thed-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3). The INK4 family of proteins plays a key role in inhibiting the G1-S phase cell cycle transition by specifically inhibiting the kinase activity of CDK4-Cyclin D and CDK6-Cyclin D complexes. The INK4 (inhibitors of CDK4) family of proteins consists of four known members: p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d, which share 40% sequence identity overall and structural homology (1Guan K.-L.

The INK4 family members have indistinguishable CDK/cyclin inhibitory activity when assayed in vitro (6Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.Y. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Google Scholar), but appear to have distinct functions in vivo. For example, the locus on 9p21 (MTS1) expressing p16INK4a is a frequent target of genetic alterations in cancer, while the genes encoding the other INK4 proteins are much less commonly mutated in cancer. Specifically, gene deletions in MTS1 and promoter methylation often lead to transcriptional silencing, and point mutations are frequently associated with several different types of cancer (7Smith-Sorensen B. Hovig E. Human Mutat. 1996; 7: 294-303Google Scholar, 8Kamb A. Shattuck-Eidens D. Eeles R. Liu Q. Gruis N.A. Ding W. Hussey C. Tran T. Miki Y. Weaver-Feldhaus J. McClure M. Aitken J.F. Anderson D.E.

Blood. 1995; 85: 2321-2330Google Scholar). Nearly 55 different residues are targeted in missense mutations of p16INK4a (7Smith-Sorensen B. Hovig E. Human Mutat. 1996; 7: 294-303Google Scholar). Homozygous deletions of p15INK4b have also been identified in a more limited number of cancer cell lines (11Gemma A. Takenoshita S. Hagiwara K. Okamoto A. Spillare E.A. Mcmemamin M.G. Hussain S.P. Forrester K. Zariwala M. Xiong Y. Harris C.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 605-611Google Scholar), and point mutations of p18INK4c have been associated with some breast carcinomas (12Lapointe J. Lachance Y. Labrie Y. Labrie C. Cancer Research. 1996; 56: 4586-4589Google Scholar). Homozygous deletions of the p18INK4c are also observed in oligodendrogliomas (13Pohl U. Cairncross J.G. Louis D.N. Brain Pathology. 1999; 9: 639-643Google Scholar); however, these deletions are rare. Polymorphisms of the p19INK4d gene are found in a small percentage of osteosarcomas (14Miller C.W. Yeon C. Aslo A. Mendoza S. Aytac U. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 231-235Google Scholar). Together, the data on tumor-derived mutations suggest tissue-specific, and/or non-redundant activities for the INK4 proteins (15Roussel M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5311-5317Google Scholar). Significant insights into the mechanism of INK4-mediated inhibition of cyclin-CDK complexes and the deleterious effects of tumor-derived mutations on their kinase inhibitory properties come from structural analyses of the INK4 proteins. The INK4 proteins contain four or five ankyrin repeat motifs that contain a β-strand helix-turn-helix β-strand segment that associates with neighboring motifs through β-sheet and helical bundle interactions. The ankyrin repeats stack on top of each other to form an elongated overall structure in which the helical region is along one side of the protein and the β-sheet region is along the opposite side (16Luh F.Y. Archer S.J. Domaille P.J. Smith B.O. Owen D. Brotherton D.H. Raine A.R.C. Xu X. Brizuela L. Brenner S.L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 999-1003Google Scholar, 17Venkataramani R. Swaminathan K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 74-81Google Scholar). A mapping of p16INK4a tumor-derived mutations onto the INK4 protein structures reveal that most of these mutations localize to residues involved in ankyrin repeat conformation or interrepeat interactions (17Venkataramani R. Swaminathan K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 74-81Google Scholar), suggesting that a large percentage of p16INK4amutations decrease the stability of the protein. Indeed, several of these mutations lead to the decreased stability of p16INK4aand p18INK4c proteins when studied in vitro(18Yang R. Gombart A.F. Serrano M. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2503-2506Google Scholar, 19Ruas M. Brookes S. McDonald N.Q. Peters G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5423-5434Google Scholar, 20Tevelev A. Byeon I.-J.L. Selby T. Ericson K. Kim H.-J.

Together, these studies suggest that the decreased thermostability of p16INK4a correlate with its loss of function and tumorigenic properties. The structure of INK4 proteins in binary complex with CDK6 (22Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.-O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Google Scholar, 23Brotherton D. Dhanaraj V. Wick S. Brizuela L. Domaille P.J. Volyanik E. Xu X. Parisini E. Smith B.O. Archer S.J. Serrano M. Brennen S.L. Blundell T.L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 244-250Google Scholar) and in ternary complex with CDK6 and a d-type viral cyclin (24Jeffrey P.D. Tong L. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3115-3125Google Scholar) reveal that the INK4 protein binds next to the ATP binding site of the CDK. The resulting distortion of the kinase catalytic cleft prevents ATP binding and thereby inhibits catalysis (25Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Google Scholar). While, each of the first 4 ankyrin-repeat units of the INK4 proteins participate in CDK4 interaction, most of the interactions are mediated by the 2nd and 3rd ankyrin repeat units. In addition, comparison of the INK4 structures in the presence or absence of CDK reveals that the INK4 protein does not undergo significant structural rearrangement for CDK binding with an overall RMS deviation of less than 1.3 Å. Based on the structure-function studies described above for the INK4 proteins, we hypothesized that we may be able to use a structure-based approach to prepare mutant INK4 proteins with increased stability and increased CDK4/6 and cell cycle inhibitory activity. The preparation of INK4 proteins with increased CDK4 inhibitory properties would potentially be useful for targeting p16INK4a-mediated cancers and would provide a proof-of-principle for the design of “biophysical drugs” (small molecule compounds that may reactivate tumor derived p16INK4a mutants by modifying the biophysical properties of the protein such as stability). Indeed, the design of such compounds for the reactivation of tumor-derived mutants of the p53 tumor suppressor has already been described (26Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Google Scholar). As both the native and complexed structures of p18INK4chave been described (17Venkataramani R. Swaminathan K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 74-81Google Scholar, 24Jeffrey P.D. Tong L. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3115-3125Google Scholar), we used p18INK4c as the INK4 model of choice to carry out the initial structure-function studies. Since the INK4 proteins are highly homologous, we expect that the results of our studies with p18INK4c would be transferable to other INK4 proteins such as p16INK4a. In this report we describe the preparation, and functional and structural characterization of single-site mutant p18INK4c proteins that are designed for increased stability. Through this study, we have identified at least one mutant, the F71N p18INK4c mutant that has significantly increased stability in vitro and enhanced CDK4/6 and cell cycle inhibitory activity in vivo. We discuss the implications of these findings for improving the thermodynamic stability of the INK4 proteins as a means to increase their cell cycle inhibitory activities, and for the development of compounds for the treatment of p16INK4a-mediated cancers. Single amino acid substitutions in p18INK4c were produced using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the pRSETA-p18INK4c vector (17Venkataramani R. Swaminathan K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 74-81Google Scholar) as a template, and sequence changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant native and mutant p18INK4c proteins were prepared by growing and inducing pRSETA-p18INK4c (native or mutant) transformed BL21 (DE3) cells at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and purified in a low salt buffer (LSB) containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg ml−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Except for the F71N p18INK4c mutant, all other recombinant proteins (including the native protein) were isolated by renaturing the protein found in the inclusion bodies with 6 m urea denaturation and renaturation by stepwise dialysis to remove urea. The soluble fraction from renaturation was further purified by cation exchange with a Q-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration using a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) (17Venkataramani R. Swaminathan K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 74-81Google Scholar). The F71N p18INK4c mutant was the only protein that was found exclusively in the soluble protein fraction, and the supernatant was directly purified using cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography (17Venkataramani R. Swaminathan K. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 74-81Google Scholar). Protein aliquots were flash-frozen at −70 °C and thawed as needed for biophysical studies or crystallization. Circular dichroism data for the thermal denaturation studies was collected on an AVIV circular dichroism spectrophotometer (Model 62A-DS) equipped with a thermoelectric unit and using a 1-mm pathlength cell. Thermal protein denaturation was monitored at 222 nm and was shown to be irreversible. Data was collected every 2 °C with an equilibrium time of 4 min and an averaging time of 10 s. Protein samples were analyzed at a concentration of 2 mg ml−1 (∼20 μm) in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined using UV spectrophotometry. However, concentration of the W5R mutant, which had a low extinction coefficient, was determined using a Bradford assay using the native protein as a standard. The melting temperature, Tm and error estimates were calculated by fitting the denaturation data (molar ellipticities) to a non-linear dose-response logistical transition {y = a0 + a1/(1 + x/a2)a3)} using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm within the SlideWrite software package, where the a2 coefficient is Tm. Circular dichroism data for the urea denaturation studies was collected on a Jasco J-720 spectopolarimeter at 25 °C. The CD signal at 222 nm was recorded using a 100-μl cell containing a 0.2-mm pathlength. Protein samples were at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and urea concentrations from 0–6 m in increments of 0.5 m. Samples were equilibrated for 4 h (equilibration was shown to be complete after 3 h, data not shown) prior to analysis by CD, and all samples were prepared and recorded in duplicate yielding an average CD value that was used for all subsequent analysis. The fraction of unfolded protein (fu) as a function of urea concentration was calculated with the equation fu = ([θ222]obs − [θ222]f)/([θ222]u− [θ222]f), where [θ222]obs is the molar helical ellipticity at a particular urea concentration and [θ222]f and [θ222]u are the helical ellipticities of the fully folded protein (in the absence of denaturant) and the fully unfolded protein (in the presence of high urea concentrations), respectively. [θ222]f and [θ222]u were determined at the base lines of the transition curves at which [θ222]obsbecame relatively invariant at changing urea concentrations. The free energy of unfolding, ΔGD, for each of the partially unfolded states were calculated assuming a two sate unfolding transition using the equation ΔGD = −RT ln(Ku), where Ku = ([θ222]obs − [θ222]f)/([θ222]u− [θ222]), and ΔGD(H20) and m (change in free energy of unfolding with urea concentration) was calculated by fitting the data to a straight line with the equation ΔGD = ΔGD(H20) + m[urea] (27Pace Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar). Crystallization of the F71N, F82Q, and F92N p18INK4c mutants were carried out by vapor diffusion at room temperature, using 2-μl hanging drops containing 5 mg ml−1 protein, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 7% PEG 6000 (polyethylene glycol, average molecular mass 6000 Mr), and 1m NaCl equilibrated over a reservoir containing 14% PEG 6000 and 2 m NaCl. These conditions are similar to those used to crystallize the native protein. Crystals grew to a typical size of 100–200 μm × 75–150 μm × 50–100 μm in the space group P21212, with cell dimensions that are isomorphous with the native p18INK4c crystals (a = 55.6 Å, b = 151.6 Å, c = 40.5 Å and α = β = γ = 90°). Crystals were transferred to a harvest solution (HS) containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 15% PEG 6000 and 2m NaCl, transferred stepwise to HS supplemented with 25% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled liquid propane prior to data collection. Diffraction data was collected at 110 K using a Rigaku Raxis IV image plate detector with CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-300 generator, and the data was processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Gewirth D. Otwinowski Z. Minor W. The HKL Version 1.0 manual. 3rd, Ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The structural coordinates of native p18INK4c were used as a starting model for the mutant proteins. The position and orientation of these coordinates was initially adjusted using rigid body refinement with the program CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 905-921Google Scholar). Model building was carried out using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowen S.W. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Google Scholar) using omit maps and sigma A weighted 2 Fo − Fc and Fo − Fcdifference Fourier maps created with the program CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 905-921Google Scholar). Iterative rounds of model building followed by positional refinement, simulated annealing (31Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; A46: 585-593Google Scholar), and torsion angle dynamic (32Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Google Scholar) refinement protocols were carried out at successively higher resolution shells. At the final resolution shell, solvent molecules were added, and the final model was checked for errors with simulated annealing omit maps, omitting 10 residues at a time (33Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Google Scholar). The resulting protein structures have excellent refinement statistics and geometry (Table IV).Table IVSummary of crystallographic data and refinement parametersF71NF82QF92NData statisticsResolution range50.0–2.2550.0–2.050–2.0Unique reflections22,63822,81822,869Rsym(%)8.53.96.2I/ς15.1923.8710.10Completeness (%)92.797.796.6Refinement statisticsProtein atoms237624042376Water atoms192179174RfactorsRfree25.426.026.3Rworking21.423.123.7Model statisticsRoot mean square valuesBond length0.0040.0050.006Bond angles1.191.241.34NCS molecules0.8190.7560.745Average Bfactors19.5125.6926.61 Open table in a new tab Table IProperties of p18INK4c residues targeted for mutagenesisResidueRationale for mutationMutationPredicted change in thermostabilityInteraction with residues in CDK6aBased on p18INK4cinteractions with CDK6 as reported in the ternary complex with viral cyclin (24).Conservation among INK4 proteinsTrp-5Exposed hydrophobicArgIncreaseNoNoPhe-37Exposed hydrophobicHisIncreaseYes, non-polar side chain contactsYesArg-55Buried hydrophilicValIncreaseNoNoPhe-71Exposed hydrophobic, possible inter-repeat contactsAsnIncreaseYes, non-polar side chain contactsNoHis-75Buried polarPheDecreaseNoYesPhe-82Exposed hydrophobic, possible inter-repeat contactsGlnIncreaseYes, non-polar side chain contactsYesThr-85Buried polarPheDecreaseNoYesPhe-92Exposed hydrophobic, possible inter-repeat contactsAsnIncreaseNoNoHis-108Buried polarLeuDecreaseNoYesa Based on p18INK4cinteractions with CDK6 as reported in the ternary complex with viral cyclin (24Jeffrey P.D.

Open table in a new tab DNA encoding wild-type and mutant p18INK4c proteins were subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector creating a set of pCDNA- p18INK4c vectors (T85F was not tested due to complications in the subcloning). The cell culture conditions of the U2OS cells were essentially as described (34Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Google Scholar). A total of 1 × 106 U2OS cells were transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with 0.5 μg of green fluorescent protein reporter and 1.5 μg of pCDNA-p18INK4c (native or mutant), pCDNA-p21, or vector alone. After 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed, and the proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter paper and probed with anti-p18INK4c antiserum (Oncogene Research), followed by horseradish-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The reacting p18INK4c bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent for direct comparison of the in vivo stability of wild-type and mutant p18INK4cproteins. The relative amount of wild-type and mutant p18INK4cprotein that is associated with CDK4/6 in vivo was determined using CDK6 co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The p18INK4c-transfected U2OS cells were lysed and endogenous CDK6 was immunoprecipitated with CDK6 antiserum (BD PharMingen). These immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were blotted and probed with anti-p18INK4c antiserum, followed by horseradish-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The cell lysis was carried out in the presence of two different salt concentrations (150 mm and 250 mm) prior to immunoprecipitation to optimize the discrimination between the differing binding affinities of the p18INK4c mutants for CDK6. For cell cycle analysis, p18INK4c-transfected cells were prepared in 1% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis after 24 h. Preparation of cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed essentially as described (35van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Google Scholar). Cell sorting was performed on a Coulter Epics Elite counter. DNA content analysis was performed using MacCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). The high-resolution crystal structure of p18INK4c, was used to identify candidate residues for mutation. The strategy for the mutagenesis was to increase the hydrophobicity of the protein interior or to increase the hydrophilicity of the protein exterior. Accordingly, buried hydrophilic residues were changed to hydrophobic residues or exposed hydrophobic residues were changed to hydrophilic residues. In mutating hydrophobic residues to hydrophilic residues, mutations were selected to facilitate interactions with residues in neighboring repeats. Moreover, buried hydrophilic residues were mutated to hydrophobic residues of similar size that were predicted to facilitate favorable interactions with other hydrophobic residues in its vicinity. With the aid of the program O (36Jones T.A. Kjeldguard M. Manual for O, Version 6.1. Aarhus University Press, Uppsula, Sweden1996Google Scholar), we modeled several mutations choosing the ones that best fit the criteria described above. The nine mutations that were made, along with their corresponding degree of conservation and structural properties, are listed in TableI and illustrated on a schematic of the overall p18INK4c structure in Fig. 1. 5 of the 9 mutations selected are conserved among the INK4 proteins (Phe-37, His-75, Phe-82, Thr-85, and His-108). Six of the mutations were designed to increase the thermodynamic stability of p18INK4c, and a subset of these residues are also predicted to be at the INK4-CDK interface based on the INK4 co-crystal structures (Phe-37 (F37H), Phe-71 (F71N), and Phe-82 (F82Q)) (22Russo A.A. Tong L. Lee J.-O. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 237-243Google Scholar, 23Brotherton D. Dhanaraj V. Wick S. Brizuela L. Domaille P.J. Volyanik E. Xu X. Parisini E. Smith B.O.

Therefore, while one set of mutations are predicted to have effects only on the thermodynamic stability of p18INK4c, another subset are predicted to have effects on both the thermodynamic stability of p18INK4c and interaction with CDK. As negative controls, 3 of 9 mutations were also prepared that were predicted to decrease the thermodynamic stability of p18INK4c, these include His-75 (H75F), His-108 (H108L), and Thr-85 (T85F). When expressed in bacteria, some mutants behave significantly differently than the native protein. These mutants include F71N, F82Q, and F92N. Bacterial growths prepared at 37 °C revealed that these mutants are found in the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate whereas the native protein is found exclusively in the insoluble fraction when the bacteria are grown at 37 °C. Surprisingly, F71N is found exclusively in the soluble fraction, while about 25% of F82Q and F92N are found in the soluble fraction (TableII). Each of the proteins were purified essentially as described for the native protein and eluted from gel filtration in monomeric form. Following protein purification, all three of these proteins crystallize at room temperature (at 20 °C), while the native protein precipitates when crystal trials are carried out at the same temperature. Despite the different crystal growth temperature, crystals of the three mutant proteins are isomorphous with crystals of the native protein that are obtained from the same crystallization condition, but at 4 °C (Table II and TableIII). The increased solubility properties of the F71N, F82Q, and F92N mutant proteins suggested that they might also be more thermostable than the native protein.Table IIBiochemical characterization of p18INK4c mutantsConstructSolubility of protein from bacterial lysatesaThe solubility of the protein refers to the presence of the protein in either the soluble or insoluble fractions of the bacterial lysate when the protein is overexpressed at 37 °C.Ability to renature proteinbThe ability to renature the protein refers to whether the protein can be isolated in the soluble fraction after denaturation by 6 m urea followed by stepwise dialysis to remove urea.Oligomerization statecMolecular size is judged by size exclusion chromatography of the renatured protein.CrystallizationdCrystallization was only carried out with a few mutants; the crystals so obtained were isomorphous to the crystals of the native protein.NativeInsolubleYesMonomerYes at 4 °CW5RInsolubleYesMonomerN.D.eNot determined.F37HInsolubleYesMonomerN.D.R55VInsolubleYesMonomerN.D.F71N100% solubleNTfNot tested.MonomerYes at 20 °CH75FInsolubleYesAggregatedN.D.F82Q∼25% solubleYesMonomerYes at 20 °CT85FInsolubleYesMixture of aggregates and monomerN.D.F92N∼25% solubleYesMonomerYes at 20 °CH108LInsolubleYesMixture of aggregates and monomerN.D.a The solubility of the protein refers to the presence of the protein in either the soluble or insoluble fractions of the bacterial lysate when the protein is overexpressed at 37 °C.b The ability to renature the protein refers to whether the protein can be isolated in the soluble fraction after denaturation by 6 m urea followed by stepwise dialysis to remove urea.c Molecular size is judged by size exclusion chromatography of the renatured protein.d Crystallization was only carried out with a few mutants; the crystals so obtained were isomorphous to the crystals of the native protein.e Not determined.f Not tested.

https://openalex.org/W2075615729,"Upstream activating sequences of the rat aldolase C gene are shown here to confer brain-specific expression in transgenic mice. In addition to binding sites described previously for the brain-expressed POU proteins Brn-1 and Brn-2 (Skala, H., Porteu, A., Thomas, M., Szajnert, M. F., Okazawa, H., Kahn, A., and Phan-Dinh-Tuy, F. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 31806–31814), we have identified two novel DNA elements critical for an interaction with a brain-specific, high affinity DNA-binding protein. Characterization of this binding protein showed it to be sensitive to thiol oxidation and stable to heat at 100 °C. This protein was purified on the basis of its thermostability and its selective adsorption to streptavidin magnetic particles via a biotinylated multimer of its target DNA binding site. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry analysis, binding competition with consensus oligonucleotides, and antibody supershift assays led to its identification as the homeodomain paired protein Pax-6. This result suggests that the brain-specific aldolase C gene could constitute a new target for the transcription factor Pax-6, which is implicated increasingly in neurogenesis. Upstream activating sequences of the rat aldolase C gene are shown here to confer brain-specific expression in transgenic mice.

This result suggests that the brain-specific aldolase C gene could constitute a new target for the transcription factor Pax-6, which is implicated increasingly in neurogenesis. Regulation of gene transcription in active chromatin is dependent upon the interaction of discrete DNA motifs with regulatory proteins. These proteins either represent basal, ubiquitous elements of the transcriptional machinery or can be themselves expressed in a tissue-, development-, or stimulus-specific manner. Cell-type diversity in the different organs can be considered as the result of multiple DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions leading to the controlled expression of a very large number of genes. The central nervous system is one of the most complex structures and consequently the one for which such regulatory mechanisms are probably still the least elucidated. In light of this, identification of DNA binding sites for transcription factors involved in brain development will help to define their candidate target genes and to elucidate the complex gene regulatory network at play in the central nervous system. The aldolase C gene encodes a brain-specific glycolytic enzyme, the fructose-1,6 diphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13). In a previous paper (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31806-31814Google Scholar), we reported that the transcriptional activation of the brain-specific promoter (115 bp) of the rat aldolase C gene in vivo requires a cooperation between distal and proximal upstream sequences. We identified in vitro in a 0.6-kb proximal activating fragment several POU/WH motifs (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31806-31814Google Scholar) exhibiting overlapping binding sites for the brain-restricted class III Brn-1 and Brn-2 POU proteins (2Ryan A. Rosenfeld M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Google Scholar) and for the protein HNF3β, a member of the WH (winged helix) factor family, which has been shown to be involved in the early brain development (3Ang S.-L. Rossant J. Cell. 1994; 78: 561-574Google Scholar, 4Weinstein D.C. Altaba A.R.I. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Prezioso V.R. Jessell T.M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 575-588Google Scholar). In this paper, we first show that the distal and proximal regulatory sequences are also able to ensure the activation of the ubiquitous thymidine kinase (tk) 1The abbreviations used are: tk, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; nt, nucleotide promoter specifically in the brain of transgenic mice. We also report that, in addition to the POU/WH motifs, these regions contain two strong in vitro binding sites for a brain-specific, thermostable protein, one located in the 0.6-kb proximal fragment and the other in the distal activating region. The sequence of these DNA motifs shared no significant homology to binding sites for known transcription factors. We therefore undertook the purification of this brain-specific binding protein. Mass spectrometry analysis of the final protein fraction identified the transcription factor Pax-6. Competition experiments with consensus binding sites and supershift experiments with specific antibodies confirmed this identification. The protein Pax-6 is a member of the Paired family. It contains a 128-amino acid paired domain described initially in the prd (paired) gene of Drosophila melanogaster (5Bopp D. Burri M. Baumgartner S. Frigerio G. Noll M. Cell. 1986; 47: 1033-1040Google Scholar) and a paired-type homeodomain (6Gruss P. Walther C. Cell. 1992; 69: 719-722Google Scholar). Pax-6 has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of the central nervous system and the eye and olfactory system (7Walther C. Gruss P. Development. 1991; 113: 1435-1449Google Scholar, 8Hogan B. Horsburgh G. Cohen J. Hetherington C. Fisher G. Lyon M. J. Embryol. 1986; 97: 95-110Google Scholar, 9Ashery-Padan R. Gruss P. Curr. Opin.

It is also implicated in the development of pancreatic and gastrointestinal endocrine cells (13Larsson L. St-Onge L. Hougaard D. Sosa-Pineda B. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 153-159Google Scholar, 14Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H. Martin G. German M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Google Scholar). More recently, it has been implicated in neurogenesis, with Pax-6 mutant mice showing reduced numbers of cortical neurons (15Heins N. Malatesta P. Cecconi F. Nakafuku M. Tucker K. Hack M. Chapouton P. Barde Y. Gotz M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 308-315Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the aldolase C gene represents a new candidate target for this important transcription factor. The construct 3.8/tk/CAT includes the 3.8-kb distal activating fragment of the rat aldolase C gene (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol.

Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Google Scholar) ligated to the CAT coding sequence. The 3.8 + 0.6/tk/CAT construct was prepared by inserting the 0.6-kb proximal activating fragment of the rat aldolase C gene (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A.

Further details on the plasmid constructs are available on request. The purified DNA fragments (5–10 ng) were microinjected into fertilized B6D2 mouse eggs (17Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar). Transgenic founders and offspring were identified by Southern blot using a random-primed CAT probe (18Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Google Scholar). CAT activities generated by transgene expression were assayed on 0.5–100 μg of extracted proteins (19Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell.

The recombinant GST-Brn-1 POU domain and GST-Brn-2 POU domain fusion proteins were obtained as described (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31806-31814Google Scholar). The footprinting reactions were carried out as described (24Cereghini S. Raymondjean M. Carranca A. Herbomel P. Yaniv M. Cell. 1987; 50: 627-638Google Scholar). A PCR fragment representing nucleotides −914 to −713 of the 0.6-kb activating sequence was radiolabeled by filling in with [α-32P]dCTP using the DNA polymerase 1 Klenow fragment and purified on polyacrylamide gels. Gel shift and methylation interference assays were carried out as described (25Garner M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Google Scholar, 26Raymondjean M. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Google Scholar, 27Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Google Scholar). Standard binding mixtures included 50,000 cpm of a T4 kinase radiolabeled double-stranded probe, 0.5 to 1 μg of rat brain nuclear extract proteins, and 300 ng of poly(dI-dC) or poly(dA-dT) in 20 μl of a 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 17.5% (v/v) glycerol. For supershift assays, 2 μl of polyclonal anti-Pax-6 antibody (BAbCO, Richmond, CA) were added after completion of the binding reactions and incubated 45 min further at room temperature. Brain nuclear proteins (15–25 μg) or DNA affinity-purified ThBF were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted and renatured from gel slices as described (29Ossipow V. Laemmli U. Schibler U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 6040-6041Google Scholar). The eluates were then assayed for DNA binding activity. Biotinylated multimers of oligonucleotide ThBFsite (average size 150 bp, that is 5 ThBFsite motifs/molecule) were coupled to streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer (10 pmols of biotinylated molecules/mg of beads, that is ∼50 pmols of ThBFsite motifs/mg of beads). Magnetic beads were equilibrated by three washes in the DNA/protein binding buffer (see below) just before use. ThBF was purified from 35 mg of brain nuclear proteins extracted from 115 adult rats, using a magnetic DNA affinity purification procedure (30Kadonaga J. Tjian R. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Google Scholar, 31Gabrielsen O. Huet J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 508-525Google Scholar). The activity and specificity of ThBF were monitored at each stage by gel shift assay using the oligonucleotide ThBFsite as positive probe and the 28bp oligonucleotide and an AP-1 binding site (32Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Google Scholar) as negative probes. After a 30% (w/v) ammonium sulfate precipitation, nuclear proteins were spun down, dissolved in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 1 mm benzamidine and 1/200 vol of antiproteolytic mixture (Sigma) and dialyzed against Buffer A for 4 h with four buffer changes. A typical DNA affinity separation procedure was as follows: 4 mg of dialyzed proteins were preincubated during 15 min at 4 °C in 1.2 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1/200 vol of antiproteolytic mixture in the presence of 2 mg of magnetic beads not coated with DNA, 2.4 nmols of double-stranded ThBFmut oligonucleotide, and 2.4 nmols of double-stranded 28bp oligonucleotide. After magnetic separation, the supernatant was mixed with 4 mg of DNA-coated beads (0.2 nmols of ThBFsite motif) and rotated during 1 h. Beads were then subjected to four 1.2-ml washes: a first wash in modified Buffer A (containing only 0.01 m KCl and no Nonidet P-40), two successive washes in Buffer A supplemented with 20 μg poly(dA-dT), and a last wash in Buffer A. Bound proteins were then eluted in a total volume of 0.10 to 0.12 ml elution buffer (Buffer A containing 0.7 m KCl, plus benzamidine and antiproteolytics as above) added in three successive incubations over 45 min. The eluate was then brought at 100 °C for 7 min, cooled on ice for 5 min, and subjected to a microcentrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.1 m KCl by addition of 6 vol of Buffer A without KCl, in the presence of bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml), and submitted to a second cycle of DNA affinity chromatography with slight modifications; the preincubation step included the ThBFmut and 28bp oligonucleotides (1.2 nmols each) but no uncoated beads, only 2 mg of DNA-coated beads were used, 5 μg poly(dA-dT) instead of 20 μg were added in the second and third washes, and the elution volume was 40 to 60 μl. The final eluate was desalted/concentrated using a Centricon (YM-10; Amicon) and further concentrated in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. The affinity-purified sample and a crude brain nuclear extract were then run parallely on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The crude extract lane was sliced for elution/renaturation of proteins without staining. The purified sample lane was submitted to silver nitrate staining according to the Bio-Rad kit protocol with omission of glutaraldehyde in the fixative bath. The stained gel slice corresponding to the mobility of the ThBFsite binding activity was cut out, and the proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested by in-gel tryptic proteolysis (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). The tryptic digest was analyzed by nanoscale capillary LC-MS/MS. An UltiMate capillary liquid chromatography system (LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands) was used on-line with a hybrid nanoESI quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF2; Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). Chromatographic separations were conducted on a reverse-phase capillary column (Pepmap C18; 75-μm inner diameter, 15-cm length; LC Packings) with a 200 nL/min flow. The gradient profile used consisted of a linear gradient from 100% A (H2O/acetonitrile/formic acid, 96/4/0.1) (v/v) to 45% B (H2O/acetonitrile/FA, 10/90/0.085) (v/v) in 50 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 10 min. Mass data collected during an LC-MS/MS analysis were submitted to the search software Mascot (www.matrixscience.com/). Protein identifications were obtained by comparison of experimental data to the NCBI database. We reported previously (34Thomas M. Makeh I. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 143-151Google Scholar) that the 115-bp promoter fragment-(−199 to −84) of the rat aldolase C gene (Fig.1) was sufficient to ensure the brain-specific expression of the CAT reporter gene in transgenic mice. However, the high level activation of this short promoter required the cooperation in vivo of a distal fragment of 3.8 kb and a more proximal fragment of 0.6 kb (each fragment alone was found unable to activate the 115-bp promoter) (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31806-31814Google Scholar). To determine whether these activating sequences themselves confer a tissue-specificity, we cloned the distal 3.8-kb fragment alone or both activating regions upstream of the ubiquitous tk promoter fused to the CAT coding sequence. The CAT activities measured in transgenic mice are presented in TableI. The control construct tk/CAT and the 3.8-kb fragment alone (transgene 3.8/tk/CAT) led to undetectable activities in all tissues tested. From the seven transgenic animals obtained for the 3.8 + 0.6/tk/CAT construct, two were negative in all tissues, and five exhibited a brain-specific CAT expression. In founders 26, 16, and 2, CAT levels were similar to those observed previously (34Thomas M. Makeh I. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 143-151Google Scholar, 35Makeh I. Thomas M. Hardelin J.P. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 6: 4194-4200Google Scholar) with the 115-bp aldolase C promoter without upstream sequences added whereas in founders 18 and 27, significantly higher levels were measured. Variation of the CAT values reflects the already described dependence upon the integration site of the transgene in chromatin (36Wilson W. Bellen H. Gehring W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 679-714Google Scholar). From these results, we can conclude that 1) the combination of the 3.8- and 0.6-kb upstream sequences activating the aldolase C brain-specific 115-bp promoter is also able to activate the heterologous ubiquitous tk promoter, and 2) the activation occurs only in brain, and hence these sequences behave as a tissue-specific activator. It is thus likely they contain DNA elements interacting with brain-specific proteins.Table IBrain specificity of the aldolase C gene activating regionsCAT activities are expressed in cpm/min/μg of proteins. Open table in a new tab CAT activities are expressed in cpm/min/μg of proteins. We thus screened the proximal 0.6-kb fragment by in vitro DNase I footprinting of overlapping PCR fragments. Probes covering nucleotides −745 to −194 did not allow brain-specific protection from DNase 1 digestion. A more 5′ probe (nt −914 to −713) encompassed two already described motifs, the 28bp element, conserved between the rat and human aldolase C genes, and the site 824 (Fig. 1), both able to bind ubiquitous and brain-restricted proteins of the POU family (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31806-31814Google Scholar). Indeed, using the recombinant GST-Brn-2 POU domain fusion protein, three protected regions (numbered 1 to 3) were detected on the coding strand (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3and 4). The footprints 1 (nt −864 to −844) and 3 (nt −820 to −802) corresponded to the POU binding sites of the 28bp element and of the site 824, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The AT-rich sequence in the intermediate footprint 2 (nt −840 to −829) is also compatible with the binding of POU factors (Fig. 2 B). According to our previous results, these three protections were abolished specifically by the oligonucleotide competitors 28bp (Fig.2 A, lane 2) and site 824 (not shown). Exactly the same protection and competition patterns were observed with the recombinant protein GST-Brn-1 POU domain (not shown). Using brain nuclear extracts, two further protected regions, numbered 4 and 5, were detected on the same PCR product (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5). The strong footprint 5 spanned from nt −832 to nt −811 and was limited at its 5′ boundary by a hypersensitive site at nt −834. The fainter footprint 4 extended from nt −851 to nt −836. A competitor PCR fragment extending from nt −864 to nt −802 completely abolished footprint 5 and hypersensitive site but only attenuated footprint 4, which seems to represent a weak interaction (not shown). In contrast, the 28bp oligonucleotide was unable to prevent protein binding at both of these sites (lane 7). No footprint was detected with liver nuclear extracts (lanes 8and 9). Thus, this DNase I footprinting analysis, summarized in Fig. 2 B, enabled us to define in the aldolase C proximal activating region a novel DNA element, corresponding to footprint 5, overlapping with the POU binding sites but interacting strongly with a brain-specific protein different from Brn-1 and Brn-2. Because this protein was further shown to be stable at 100 °C (see below), we called it ThBF (thermostable brainfactor). Further characterization of the footprint 5 DNA-protein interaction was performed by gel shift experiments. When the radiolabeled PCR probe (−864 to −802) was incubated with brain nuclear extracts, a single, very strong, fast-migrating complex was detected within only 1 h of autoradiography (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 and 2). A much longer exposure allowed the detection of Oct-1 and Brn-1 binding on this probe (not shown) specifically on the 28bp element as described previously (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31806-31814Google Scholar). The Brn-2 complex was not detectable in this experiment, because it migrated approximately at the same level as the major band. The major retarded complex was not competed by the 28bp oligonucleotide but was abolished by the unlabeled (−864 to −802) PCR fragment itself (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and 4) and by an oligonucleotide competitor, ThBFsite, which encompasses the limits of footprint 5 (see Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 6). When used as a labeled probe, the ThBFsite oligonucleotide interacted specifically with a protein of the same electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7 and8), and this binding was competed reciprocally by the unlabeled PCR fragment (lane 9). In DNase I experiments, the oligonucleotide ThBFsite abolished specifically the footprint 5 and the hypersensitive site produced by brain nuclear extracts (Fig.2 A, lane 6) but did not suppress the GST-Brn-2 footprints 1–3 (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). It thus seems likely that the strong DNA binding activity observed by gel shift experiments is ThBF, responsible for footprint 5. To delineate more precisely the DNA bases involved in this interaction, we performed a methylation interference experiment using the PCR (−864 to −802) probe. Methylation at nucleotides −819 and −816 on the upper strand and −827, −826, −825, and −822 on the lower strand (Fig. 2 B) interfered with protein binding (Fig.3 B). A mutated version of the ThBFsite oligonucleotide, ThBFmut, where nucleotides −816, −819, −825, and −826 were substituted, was indeed unable to compete for ThBF binding (Fig.3 A, lane 10). Fortuitously, we found that ThBF was also able to interact in vitro with a DNA motif including a sequence conserved perfectly between the rat and human aldolase C genes over 27 nucleotides (nt −4424 to nt −4390 of the rat gene), located in the subfragment A of the 3.8-kb distal activating region (Fig. 1), and termed ThBFdist. In competition experiments, the protein ThBF exhibited comparable in vitroaffinities for the probes ThBFsite and ThBFdist (Fig. 3 A,lanes 11–17). We next tested for ThBF binding in different tissue and cell extracts by further gel shift assays. It was found present approximately at the same level in fetal and adult brain extracts (not shown). In extracts from several other tissues (liver, kidney, muscle, spleen, pancreas) and cell lines (HeLa, B cell, adipocyte 3T3L1), the ThBF band was undetectable (not shown). Thus, ThBF appears to be an essentially brain-restricted protein interacting strongly with at least two binding sites in the aldolase C gene activating sequences. Computer analysis of ThBFsite and ThBFdist sequences (MatInspector, TESS, TFSearch, and PatSearch programs) failed to reveal overt homologies with binding sites for known transcription factors, and screening of a rat brain cDNA expression library using the multimerized ThBFsite as a probe did not identify positive clones. We therefore decided to characterize the biochemical properties of the protein ThBF and to undertake its purification. The size of ThBF was estimated by elution/renaturation of brain nuclear extract proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Gel shift assays of the eluted fractions showed that ThBF binding was recovered from a gel slice corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 48 to 50 kDa (not shown). Testing ThBF thermostability, we found that significant binding was retained after a 7-min incubation of crude brain nuclear extracts at 100 °C (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and2). In addition, after a differential ammonium sulfate precipitation (not shown) or one round of DNA affinity chromatography (see below) to remove protease(s), the binding of ThBF was found to be completely unaffected by this heating step (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3 and 4). The strong binding of ThBF to its DNA sequence target was detected in the presence of 1 mm of the chelating agent EDTA in brain nuclear extracts and was insensitive to a further EDTA concentration increase up to 25 mm (not shown). Therefore, ThBF does not resemble a zinc finger domain DNA-binding protein (37Berg J. Yigong S. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence of 1 mmdithiothreitol, most likely rendering the ThBF molecules in a reduced state. We thus examined the sensitivity of ThBF to redox conditions by assaying the DNA binding activity of a semipurified fraction (obtained after one cycle of DNA affinity chromatography) in the presence of various thiol-reactive metal ions. A strong inhibition of DNA binding was observed after preincubation in the presence of Zn(OAc)2 or CdCl2 (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1–7). The retarded complex was abolished almost completely by 500 μm Zn2+ or 50 μm Cd2+ ions. In contrast, ThBF binding to DNA was found unaffected by the presence of 2 mmMnCl2 (Fig. 4 B, lane 8) and 5 mm MgCl2 (in the standard binding reaction), two metal ions with lower oxidation potentials. Finally, preincubation of the protein fraction in the presence of 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl alkylating agent, resulted in a complete inhibition of ThBF binding (Fig. 4 B, lane 9). These results suggest that at least one critical thiol group is required for ThBF binding to DNA. ThBF was purified from adult rat brains as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two cycles of DNA affinity chromatography were performed using streptavidin-magnetic particles coated with biotinylated multimers of the ThBFsite motif. Taking advantage of the thermostability of ThBF, we included a 100 °C incubation step after the first elution from the DNA beads. Streptavidin-binding proteins were removed by the addition of non-DNA-coated beads in the preincubation step. As multimerization of the ThBFsite oligonucleotide resulted in the creation of AT-rich junction motifs able to bind POU proteins such as Oct-1, Brn-1, and Brn-2 (not shown), we added a 12 molar excess of the oligonucleotide 28bp, which represents a good binding site for these factors (1Skala H. Porteu A. Thomas M. Szajnert M.F. Okazawa H. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31806-31814Google Scholar), in the preincubation mixtures. A 12 molar excess of the oligonucleotide ThBFmut was also included to remove nonspecific DNA-binding proteins. The second eluate from DNA-coated beads displayed a strong binding activity toward the ThBFsite probe, which was abolished specifically by the unlabeled ThBFsite competitor but not by the mutated ThBFmut oligonucleotide (not shown). Binding activities toward the 28bp probe or toward an unrelated AP-1 consensus binding site were no longer detectable (not shown). Quantification of ThBF binding by gel shift assays was not reliable, because the amount of probe·ThBF complex depended not only on the amount of active ThBF but also on parameters varying along the course of purification such as the concentration of poly(dA-dT) and of other DNA-interacting molecules in the assay. Therefore, accurate determination of the % recovery and purification fold was not possible. The last step of purification involved SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis where a crude brain nuclear extract and the purified ThBF fraction were run in parallel. The ThBFsite binding activity of the crude extract was recovered from the unstained gel slice corresponding to the apparent molecular mass of 48 to 50 kDa as described above. A silver nitrat"

The other subunits share between 49.8 and 67.9% sequence identity and thus are derived from different genes.

The transmembrane topology of KBPs, however, was shown to be identical to that of other GluRs receptors (6Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7154-7158Google Scholar). The pore domains of all five known KBPs have been investigated for intrinsic ion channel function by domain transplantation and were proven to be capable of conducting cations (11Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Google Scholar). Because KBPs bind agonists with high affinity and possess functional ion channels, we speculated that inefficient “gating,”i.e. inefficient or interrupted signal transduction between the ligand-binding site and the ion pore, might be responsible for the observed lack of ion channel function of KBPs. The sequences linking the ligand-binding domains to the three transmembrane domains (linkers A–C; see Fig. 1A) were considered prime candidates for such gating domains. Because the kainate receptor GluR6 is fully functional and 41% identical at the amino acid level to frog KBP (see Fig. 1B), we chose GluR6 as the donor for gating domains of proven functionality and transplanted putative GluR6 gating domains into frog KBP. This approach for the first time succeeded in generating a mutant kainate-binding protein with demonstrable ligand-gated ion channel function. Rat GluR6(Q) and frog KBP wild type cDNAs were used for construction of chimeras between KBP and GluR6. In the present study, we define the connecting stretches of sequence between transmembrane domain (TMD) A and the S1 domain, between TMD B and the S2 domain, and between the S2 domain and TMD C as linkers A, B, and C, respectively (see Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequences of these three linker domains are GTNPGVFSFLNPLSPD (linker A, GluR6), AAESSYMFGFLNPFSKE (linker A, KBP), NLAAFLTVERMES (linker B, GluR6), SFASYINSNTNQT (linker B, KBP), EESKEASALGVQN (linker C, GluR6), and GWVPVQPHT (linker C, KBP) (see Fig. 1B). The chimeras KBP-(linkerA)GluR6 (frog KBP with the linker A derived from GluR6; see Fig. 2), KBP-(linkerB)GluR6 (frog KBP with the linker B derived from GluR6; see Fig. 2), and KBP-(linkerC)GluR6 (frog KBP subunit with the linker C derived from GluR6; see Fig. 2) were generated by PCR. They do not contain any amino acid alterations except for the respective inserted native GluR6 linker sequences (see Fig. 1B). We furthermore engineered KBP constructs containing combinations of two or all three linker domains of GluR6, resulting in the constructs KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6, KBP-(linkerA+C)GluR6, KBP-(linkerB+C)GluR6, and KBP-(linkerA+B+C)GluR6. For a graphic representation of the various linker transplantation constructs see Fig. 2. All of the mutated clones were sequenced across the PCR-amplified regions. In preliminary experiments we had generated KBP-(linkerA)GluR6 and KBP-(linkerB)GluR6 constructs using a different approach that made use of intermediary constructs we had available from previous pore domain transplantation studies (11Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Google Scholar, 13Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Google Scholar). In that approach, we used four introduced restriction sites at homologous positions in KBP and GluR6 to allow easy construction of chimeras between these two receptors (see Fig. 1A): KpnI and NdeI sites N-terminal of TMD A flanking linker A in KBP at amino acids 130–132 (AAE) and 146–148 (ELW), respectively, and in GluR6 at amino acids 516–518 (GTN) and 531–533 (DIW), respectively; furthermore, in KBPNruI and EcoRV sites C-terminal of TMD B flanking linker B at amino acids 235–237 (YIN) and 241–243 (NQT), respectively, and in GluR6 at amino acids 627–629 (FLT) and 633–635 (MES), respectively. Numbering in each case starts with the first codon of the mature protein. The mutant GluR6, which contains all four newly introduced restriction sites KpnI, NdeI, NruI, andEcoRV was named GluR6-PCL-PXL, and the equivalent KBP mutant was named KBP-PCL-PXL. These names are in keeping with our previously established nomenclature for mutants designed for ion pore exchange (13Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Google Scholar). They indicate that the constructs allow exchange of a “large” pore domain (a PCL, between sites NdeI and NruI) as well as an “extra large” domain (a PXL, between sitesKpnI and EcoRV). These constructs, in addition to facilitating the exchange of ion pores, allow for easy exchange of linkers A and/or B, albeit at the expense of a few additional amino acid changes caused by the introduction of the four restriction sites (see Fig. 1B). Two additional KBP mutants were generated from KBP-PCL-PXL, which contain only the N-terminal linker A exchange sites KpnI and NdeI (KBP-PCL-PXL/N) or the C-terminal linker B exchange sites NruI and EcoRV (KBP-PCL-PXL/C). To enable the exchange of PXL, KpnI and EcoRV restriction sites (see above) were introduced into KBP and GluR6, resulting in the constructs KBP-PXL and GluR6-PXL. These constructs were then used as parent clones to create KBP-PXLGluR6 (frog KBP with the extra large pore cassette derived from GluR6) and GluR6-PXLKBP (rat GluR6 with the extra large pore cassette derived from frog KBP), respectively (see Fig. 1B). cRNA synthesis was performed as described earlier (14Strutz N. Villmann C. Thalhammer A. Kizelsztein P. Eisenstein M. Teichberg V.I. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 401-411Google Scholar). Briefly, template DNA was linearized with a suitable restriction enzyme. cRNA was synthesized from 1 μg of linearized DNA using an in vitro transcription kit (Stratagene) with a modified protocol that employs 800 μmm7GpppG (Pharmacia Corp.) for capping and an extended reaction time of 3 h with T7 polymerase. Trace labeling was performed with [32P]UTP to allow calculation of yields and evaluation of transcript quality by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocytes of stages V and VI were surgically removed from the ovaries of X. laevis as described elsewhere (15Everts I. Villmann C. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 861-873Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected with 10 ng of cRNA using a 10-μl Drummond (Broomall, PA) microdispenser. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed 4–8 days after cRNA injection with a TurboTec 10CD amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany) by superfusion of the oocyte with glutamatergic agonists (300 μm) prepared in normal frog Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, and 10 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2). Current electrodes were filled with 3m CsCl and had resistances of ≈0.5–1.5 mΩ. Voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of ≈ 4 mΩ. The oocytes were held at −70 mV, and agonists (kainate and glutamate) were applied for 10 s at a flow rate of 10–14 ml/min. To minimize receptor desensitization, bath pretreatment of oocytes with concanavalin A (ConA, 10 μm for 8 min) preceded agonist application (15Everts I. Villmann C. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 861-873Google Scholar). To identify the fraction of receptor protein inserted in the plasma membrane, surface proteins were tagged with biotinylated ConA and isolated by streptavidin/Sepharose-mediated precipitation of the biotinyl-ConA-protein complex. Briefly, intact oocytes were incubated in 10 μm biotinyl-ConA (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After five 10-min washes in normal frog Ringer, intact oocytes were homogenized with a Teflon pestle in H buffer (20 μl/oocyte; 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (CompleteTMtablets; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and were kept at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating rod. After centrifugation for 60 s at 16 000 × g, the supernatants were supplemented with 20 μl of washed streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on the rotating rod. The streptavidin-Sepharose beads were then pelleted by a 120-s spin at 1600 × gand washed three times in H buffer. The final pellets were boiled in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.8 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated on 20-cm SDS-PAGE gels (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The gels were blotted (17Towbin H. Stähelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). For development of the blots, a previously described protocol was followed (11Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Google Scholar). Because antibodies directed against KBPs are not commercially available, we used a polyclonal anti-KBP antiserum directed against the C terminus of KBP, which had been generated in the laboratory of Robert J. Wenthold. That antiserum showed stronger reactivity to KBP on Western blots than the monoclonal antibody that had been produced previously in our laboratory and that had been successfully used in the cloning of the frog KBP cDNA (18Hampson D.R. Wheaton K.D. Dechesne C.J. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13329-13335Google Scholar). HEK cells 293 (ATCC number CRL 1573) were transfected with recombinant vector DNA using a modified Ca3(PO4)2 precipitation technique (19Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2751Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells in 3-cm dishes with four coverslips (polylysine-coated) were transfected with 1 μg of DNA. For precipitation, a mixture of 1 μl of glutamate receptor DNA (1 μg/μl), 1 μl of green fluorescent protein DNA (1 μg/μl), 5 μl of CaCl2 (2.5 mm), 50 μl of 2× BBS (50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2 HPO4 × 2× H2O, pH 6.95), and 43 μl of H2O were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Droplets of calcium phosphate-DNA were added to the growing HEK cells while gently shaking. The dishes were then incubated for 15–20 h at 35 °C with 3% CO2. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml of medium (500 ml of minimum essential medium with Earle's salts from Invitrogen, plus 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1.4 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 0.1 mg of streptomycin) at 37 °C. After transfection, HEK 293 cells were allowed to express receptor for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Whole cell recordings were performed using a HEKA EPC9 amplifier (HEKA Electronics) controlled by Pulse software (HEKA). Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (WPI) using a Sutter P-97 horizontal puller. Ligand was applied using a U-tube that bathed the suspended cell in a laminar flow of solution, giving a time resolution for equilibration of 10–30 ms (20Hess G.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 989-1000Google Scholar, 21Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Google Scholar). The external buffer consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm Hepes, pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH; the internal buffer was 120 mm CsCl, 20 mmN(Et)4Cl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The current responses were measured at room temperature (21–23 °C) at a holding potential of −60 mV. Desensitization time constants were estimated from monoexponential fits of individual traces using the Microcal Origin program. HEK 293 cells transfected with KBP or KBP mutants were harvested into ice-cold 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μm4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 4000 × g, the pelleted cells (from 10–30 plates 10 cm in diameter) were homogenized with a Teflon glass homogenizer in ice-cold 50 mm Tris acetate buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, 100 μm4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and centrifuged at 8000 × g. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 60 min at 10,000 × g. The latter step was repeated twice more in NaCl-free 50 mm Tris acetate buffer at pH 7.3. After suspension and homogenization of the pellets in NaCl-free 50 mm Tris acetate buffer at pH 7.3, the membranes were frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen until use for the [3H]kainate binding assay. The displacement curves were constructed by incubating on ice membranes (50–150 μg of protein) with 80 nm [3H]kainate (58 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 250 μl of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer at pH 7.3 in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled kainate (10 nm, 30 nm, 100 nm, 300 nm, 1 μm, 3 μm, and 10 μm). After 60 min, the membranes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5 m NaOH. After a 1-h incubation, 75 μl of 12% acetic acid were applied for neutralization. The samples were counted with scintillation fluid (Lumax-xylene). The specific binding of [3H]kainate was defined as the total binding minus the binding obtained in the presence of 1 mm kainate. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. The binding data were analyzed using the PRISM program (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). To determine the role of the linker regions (Fig. 1A) in KBP ion channel function, we transplanted linker sequences from the functional rat kainate receptor subunit GluR6(Q) into frog KBP (Fig. 2). We initially exchanged each linker region separately, generating the chimeras KBP-(linkerA)GluR6, KBP-(linkerB)GluR6, and KBP-(linkerC)GluR6, where the respective linker domains (in parentheses) were derived from GluR6 (Figs.1B and 2). We also engineered KBP constructs containing combinations of two, or all three, linker domains of GluR6. Those constructs were named KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6, KBP-(linkerA+C)GluR6, KBP-(linkerB+C)GluR6, and KBP-(linkerA+B+C)GluR6, respectively (Fig. 2). All of the chimeras were expressed in both Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells for electrophysiological analysis. Because it was not clear which agonist would evoke the largest current amplitude, we chose two agonists that were known to bind to KBPs (4Gregor P. Mano I. Maoz I. McKeown M. Teichberg V.I.

All three single linker transplantation constructs, KBP-(linkerA)GluR6, KBP-(linkerB)GluR6, and KBP-(linkerC)GluR6, were nonfunctional in Xenopusoocytes (n = 12, 16, and 10, respectively) as well as in HEK cells (n = 28, 22, and 25, respectively; Table I). We then tested constructs with the linker combination KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 (n = 12), KBP-(linkerA+C)GluR6 (n = 12), and KBP-(linkerB+C)GluR6 (n = 10). Of these, only KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 was functional in oocytes, showing current amplitudes of 8.4–8.7 nA (n = 12; Table I). Unfortunately, it was not possible to record dose-response curves of KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 in oocytes because of the small current amplitudes. In HEK 293 cells somewhat unexpectedly no significant currents could be detected in any of the three linker combination constructs KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 (n = 30), KBP-(linkerA+C)GluR6 (n = 28), and KBP-(linkerB+C)GluR6 (n = 32). Interestingly, the substitution of linker C along with linker A and B from GluR6 (KBP-(linkerA+B+C)GluR6) resulted in loss of function compared with KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 (n = 11; Table I), suggesting that amino acids in linker C influence the structure of linkers A and B.Table ICurrent amplitudes of chimeras between KBP and GluR6 linker domainsConstructOocytesHEK 293 cellsKA currentGlu currentnKA currentnnApAKBP wild type0.0 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.0200.0 ± 0.020KBP-PCL-PXL5.2 ± 2.0aCurrent amplitudes listed represent the mean current amplitudes of oocytes of batches where currents were measured for KBP-(linkerA + B) GluR6 or KBP-PCL-PXL; not included are oocytes of batches that did not show any currents for those receptors.2.8 ± 1.2aCurrent amplitudes listed represent the mean current amplitudes of oocytes of batches where currents were measured for KBP-(linkerA + B) GluR6 or KBP-PCL-PXL; not included are oocytes of batches that did not show any currents for those receptors.18107.0 ± 42.0bCurrent amplitude listed represents mean current amplitude of five HEK cells that gave currents out of 39 tested cells.

For an explanation of the constructs, see Figs. 1 and 2 and “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, the construct KBP-PCL-PXL, which carries four introduced restriction sites and which was used in preliminary experiments as an intermediary construct to enable the quick exchange of linkers A and B between KBP and GluR6, also gave small currents, of 2.8–5.2 nA (n = 18), in Xenopus oocytes after application of glutamate or kainate (Fig. 3 and Table I). This result was verified by expression of KBP-PCL-PXL in HEK 293 cells where the mutant also expressed functional ion channels. In these cells the construct showed current amplitudes of 107 ± 42 pA (n = 5 responding cells, of 39 tested). Steady state current amplitudes could be recorded without application of inhibitors of desensitization such as cyclothiazide or ConA. Treatment with ConA did not lead to any potentiation of current amplitudes, unlike what is observed for kainate receptors. The desensitization time constant for the construct KBP-PCL-PXL was 827 ± 332 ms (n = 8 traces averaged from three cells, S.D. given) and thus was significantly larger than in GluR6(Q) wild type receptors (19 ± 13 ms,n = 12 traces from four cells, S.D. given). KBP-PCL-PXL contains a total of eight amino acid point mutations in linker domains A (three amino acids mutated) and B (five amino acids mutated), caused by the introduction of the four restriction sites in the cDNA to prepare this cDNA for domain transplantations (see “Experimental Procedures”). The currents observed with KBP-PCL-PXL support the finding with KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 that a combination of amino acids in the linker domains A and B is indeed critical for gating. We found that the separation of the mutated amino acids in linker A of KBP-PCL-PXL from the mutated amino acids in linker B leads to loss of ion channel function; chimeras KBP-PCL-PXL/N and KBP-PCL-PXL/C, which contain only the three amino acid mutations in linker A and the five amino acid mutations in linker B, respectively, could not be activated by kainate or glutamate (data not shown). This parallels the finding that in KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 both linkers are required for function and supports our conclusion that linkers A and B interact directly or indirectly with each other. It also demonstrates that the linker domains are sensitive regions that indeed influence the gating mechanism. The mutants KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 and KBP-PCL-PXL showed clear responses in only two of five batches of oocytes tested. However, nonfunctional chimeras never gave any measurable current. A similarly inconsistent expression of functional receptors was observed in HEK 293 cells, where only 25 of 55 cells for wild type GluR6 and 5 of 39 cells for KBP-PCL-PXL gave currents in response to stimulation by kainate or glutamate. Western blot data demonstrated that all mutants and chimeras, functional as well as nonfunctional ones, were expressed and incorporated into the oocyte plasma membrane. Expression levels of chimeras were generally comparable with those of the wild type KBP receptor subunit (Fig. 4). To rule out the possibility that the limited reproducibility of ionic currents depended on varying expression levels of an endogenous glutamate receptor subunit, Xenopus KBP, also called XenU1, that is known to be expressed in Xenopus oocytes (7Ishimaru H. Kamboj R. Ambrosini A. Henley J.M. Soloviev M.M. Sudan H. Rossier J. Abutidze K. Rampersad V. Usherwood P.N.R. Bateson A.N. Barnard E.A. Recept. Chann. 1996; 4: 31-49Google Scholar, 24Soloviev M.M. Barnard E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 14-18Google Scholar), we coexpressed each of the functional chimeras KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 and KBP-PCL-PXL with recombinantXenopus KBP (11Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Google Scholar) in Xenopus oocytes. However, no currents could be measured under these conditions. This control experiment was repeated with the same result in a different batch of oocytes. For KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 and KBP-PCL-PXL, the observed gain of function might potentially be explained by a simple change in agonist affinities. To test for this possibility, we performed ligand binding experiments with tritiated kainate to determine theKd values for the chimeras analyzed here and compared those Kd values with Kdvalues of wild type KBP. The Kd value for kainate binding to wild type frog KBP was determined to be 20 ± 6 nm. Except for KBP-(linkerB)GluR6 (Kd = 178 ± 49 nm) and KBP-(linkerC)GluR6 (Kd = 104 ± 12 nm), theKd values for kainate of all mutants were comparable with wild type KBP. The binding data for KBP-(linkerB)GluR6 and KBP-(linkerC)GluR6 are interesting results in themselves, because they show that regions other than the well established ligand-binding domains (25Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Google Scholar) can influence agonist affinities. TheKd values of the functional chimeras KBP-(linkerA+B)GluR6 and of KBP-PC"
