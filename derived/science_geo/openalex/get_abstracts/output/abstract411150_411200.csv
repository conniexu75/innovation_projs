https://openalex.org/W2170319274,"Alum adjuvants have been in continuous clinical use for more than 80 yr. While the prevailing theory has been that depot formation and the associated slow release of antigen and/or inflammation are responsible for alum enhancement of antigen presentation and subsequent T- and B-cell responses, this has never been formally proven. To examine antigen persistence, we used the chimeric fluorescent protein EαGFP, which allows assessment of antigen presentation in situ, using the Y-Ae antibody. We demonstrate that alum and/or CpG adjuvants induced similar uptake of antigen, and in all cases, GFP signal did not persist beyond 24 h in draining lymph node antigen-presenting cells. Antigen presentation was first detectable on B cells within 6-12 h of antigen administration, followed by conventional dendritic cells (DCs) at 12-24 h, then finally plasmacytoid DCs at 48 h or later. Again, alum and/or CpG adjuvants did not have an effect on the magnitude or sequence of this response; furthermore, they induced similar antigen-specific T-cell activation in vivo. Notably, removal of the injection site and associated alum depot, as early as 2 h after administration, had no appreciable effect on antigen-specific T-and B-cell responses. This study clearly rules out a role for depot formation in alum adjuvant activity.—Hutchison, S., Benson, R. A., Gibson, V. B., Pollock, A. H., Garside, P., Brewer, J. M.

https://openalex.org/W2068348383,"p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that acts as a transcription factor to regulate (either positively or negatively) a plethora of downstream target genes. Although its ability to induce protein coding genes is well documented, recent studies have implicated p53 in the regulation of non-coding RNAs, including both microRNAs (e.g. miR-34a) and long non-coding RNAs (e.g. lincRNA-p21). We have identified the non-protein coding locus PVT1 as a p53-inducible target gene. PVT1, a very large (>300 kb) locus located downstream of c-myc on chromosome 8q24, produces a wide variety of spliced non-coding RNAs as well as a cluster of six annotated microRNAs: miR-1204, miR-1205, miR-1206, miR-1207-5p, miR-1207-3p, and miR-1208. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and luciferase assays reveal that p53 binds and activates a canonical response element within the vicinity of miR-1204. Consistently, we demonstrate the p53-dependent induction of endogenous PVT1 transcripts and consequent up-regulation of mature miR-1204. Finally, we have shown that ectopic expression of miR-1204 leads to increased p53 levels and causes cell death in a partially p53-dependent manner. p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that acts as a transcription factor to regulate (either positively or negatively) a plethora of downstream target genes.

Mutat. 2007; 28: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Several functions of p53 have been shown to contribute to its tumor-suppressive function. For example, the ability of p53 to cause cell cycle arrest, senescence, and cell death affords protection against carcinogenesis (3Lozano G. Mouse models of p53 functions.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001115Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the Light. The Growing Complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). To achieve such cellular programs, p53 predominantly acts as a sequence-specific transcription factor. In response to cellular stress, various signaling pathways converge to both stabilize p53 levels and direct its transcriptional activity toward specific target genes (4Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the Light. The Growing Complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). The protein products of many such target genes directly participate in processes that arrest cell cycle proliferation or result in apoptosis. For example, p21/CDKN1A halts progression through the cell cycle (5Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

PUMA and Noxa, on the other hand, are p53-inducible targets that facilitate apoptosis (8Yu J. Zhang L. The transcriptional targets of p53 in apoptosis control.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition to genes encoding protein products, p53 also induces transcription from non-protein-coding genomic loci, including both microRNAs and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). 2The abbreviations used are: lincRNAlong intergenic non-coding RNAncRNAnon-coding RNAqPCR and qRT-PCRquantitative PCR and RT-PCR, respectivelyREresponse element. Accordingly, the regulation of such non-protein coding genes by p53 is also thought to contribute to the ability of p53 to modulate various cellular processes. For example, p53-inducible miR-34a participates in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis (9Chang T.C. Wentzel E.A. Kent O.A. Ramachandran K. Mullendore M. Lee K.H. Feldmann G. Yamakuchi M.

PVT1 represents a non-protein coding locus that yields a wide variety of non-coding RNAs, including a cluster of six microRNAs. In addition, extensive alternative splicing produces a complex array of mature transcripts that may function independently of the PVT1-encoded microRNAs. Despite the complex regulation of PVT1 RNAs, no protein product has yet been identified (23Beck-Engeser G.B. Lum A.M. Huppi K. Caplen N.J. Wang B.B. Wabl M.

Many studies have implicated the PVT1 genomic region in cancer biology. PVT1 is a large (>300 kb) locus located adjacent to the c-myc locus on human chromosome 8q24 (mouse chromosome 15). Translocation breakpoints within either the c-myc or PVT1 locus are the characteristic lesions associated with Burkitt lymphoma and mouse plasmacytomas (23Beck-Engeser G.B. Lum A.M. Huppi K.

Furthermore, global analysis of copy number alterations and gene expression changes in human tumors has identified PVT1 as a candidate oncogene. PVT1 copy number gain (e.g. double minutes, amplifications) or overexpression of PVT1 has been demonstrated in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pediatric malignant astrocytomas, acute myeloid leukemia, and Hodgkin lymphoma (25Haverty P.M.

The characterization of these microRNAs may provide otherwise elusive mechanistic insights into biological functions of PVT1. The six annotated microRNAs of the PVT1 locus are as follows: miR-1204, miR-1205, miR-1206, miR-1207-5p, miR-1207-3p, and miR-1208 (23Beck-Engeser G.B. Lum A.M. Huppi K. Caplen N.J. Wang B.B. Wabl M.

Given the frequency of alterations and contribution of PVT1 to human cancer and the ability of p53 to transcriptionally regulate non-coding RNAs, we have explored the potential relationship between the tumor suppressor p53 and the PVT1 locus. Although PVT1 protumorigenic roles have been described, surprisingly, we have found that p53 acts to positively regulate transcription of this locus through a canonical p53-binding site.

HCT116, HCT116 p53−/−, SK-HEP1, RKO, WI38, and EW36 cells were treated with daunorubicin (0.22 μm; Sigma) or nutlin-3a (10 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h unless otherwise noted. MicroRNA mimics purchased from Qiagen were used individually at 20 nm (unless otherwise noted) and transfected into cells using Dharmafect 1 reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control microRNA (Qiagen All-Stars) represents a negative control microRNA mimic. The microRNA inhibitor to miR-1204 was purchased from Qiagen (miScript inhibitors) and used at 50 nm and transfected into cells using Dharmafect 1 reagent (Dharmacon). Cell extracts were analyzed according to standard Western blotting procedures through use of the Odyssey system (LI-COR). The monoclonal antibodies DO1 or 1801 were used to detect p53. Polyclonal antibodies were purchased from either Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (sc-502, anti-p21; C-19) or Sigma (anti-actin; A2066). To quantify relative changes in PVT1 ncRNA and primary microRNA expression, RNA was isolated from cell cultures using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. cDNA was synthesized by the use of the Qiagen QuantiTect reverse transcription kit. PCR was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus instrument using the SYBR Green dye (Applied Biosystems). RNA expression was assayed in at least three experiments and normalized to RPL32 mRNA expression. Relative levels were calculated by the comparative Ct method (ΔΔCT method).

HCT116 cells were plated to ∼50% confluence (24 h) in 6-well plates with at least three replicates per sample. At 24 h, cells were left untreated or were treated with 0.22 μm daunorubicin (Sigma). After the addition of daunorubicin, cells were harvested for RNA at 24 h using the mirVana miRNA isolation protocol (Ambion, catalog no. 1560). Mature miRNA was assayed by synthesis of cDNA using the miScript PCR system protocol (Qiagen) at a 20-μl final volume (37 °C, 1 h). miRNA-specific real-time fluorescence amplification was carried out with 5′ gene-specific primers and a 3′ universal primer annealing to the synthetic oligo(dT) sequence (denaturation, 15 s at 94 °C; annealing, 30 s at 55 °C; extension for 30 s at 70 °C) for 35 cycles. Data points used are the average of 3–4 values and are normalized to Hs_RNU6B_3 (Qiagen, catalog no. MS00029204).

Cell pellets were washed with PBS and fixed/permeabilized with 50% ice-cold ethanol. Pellets were washed and resuspended in 50 μg/ml ribonuclease A and 62.5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. The percentages of cells in various phases of the cell cycle were quantified using the ModFit LT, version 3.0, program. Error bars are derived from the S.D. values of multiple experiments. Levels of significance were calculated using a two-sided paired Student's t test. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) is denoted with an asterisk. ChIP analysis was carried out as described previously (36Beckerman R. Donner A.J. Mattia M. Peart M.J. Manley J.L. Espinosa J.M. Prives C. A role for Chk1 in blocking transcriptional elongation of p21 RNA during the S-phase checkpoint.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1364-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, p53 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies DO1 and 1801. A no-antibody control was also included to confirm the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. ChIP DNA was isolated with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Subsequent qPCR using 1/ 50 fraction of ChIP-enriched DNA and 100 nm primers in a total volume of 20 μl was conducted to assess the amount of DNA that had been precipitated. Standard curves from 0.1–100 ng of sonicated genomic DNA were also amplified by qPCR as a reference. The following primers were used for qPCR: PVT1 RE forward, TGCATACTGGCAGCGACAAG; PVT1 RE reverse, TTCGCTATGACCACAGGACTGT; PVT1 −398 forward, GGTAAGAGGGCTCAGGGAAAGA; PVT1 −398 reverse, GTGATGCCAGCTCGCTTGT; PVT1 exon 8 forward, CGGGCTCCCAGATTCACA; PVT1 exon 8 reverse, TCAGCCTCCAAGCGTTCCT; p21 3′ RE forward, CTGTCCTCCCCGAGGTCA; p21 3′ RE reverse, ACATCTCAGGCTGCTCAGAGTCT; p21 + 11kb forward, TCTGTCTCGGCAGCTGACAT; p21 + 11kb reverse, ACCACAAAAGATCAAGGTGAGTGA. The following 70-nucleotide oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT, annealed, and cloned into the KpnI-XhoI sites of the luciferase reporter PGL2 (Promega): wild-type PVT1 RE top strand, CTCAGACCTATTTTGCATACTGGCAGCGACAAGTTGAGACTTGTTCAACTTGACACAGTCCTGTGGTCATAC; wild-type PVT1 RE bottom strand, TCGAGTATGACCACAGGACTGTGTCAAGTTGAACAAGTCTCAACTTGTCGCTGCCAGTATGCAAAATAGGTCTGAGGTAC; mutant PVT1 RE top strand, CTCAGACCTATTTTGCATACTGGCAGCGAAAAATTGAGAATTATTCAACTTGACACAGTCCTGTGGTCATAC; mutant PVT1 RE bottom strand, TCGAGTATGACCACAGGACTGTGTCAAGTTGAATAATTCTCAATTTTTCGCTGCCAGTATGCAAAATAGGTCTGAGGTAC. Cells were transfected with such constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Renilla luciferase was co-transfected for the purposes of normalization. Luminescence was analyzed on the 20/20n luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Error bars are derived from the S.D. values of multiple experiments. Levels of significance were calculated using a two-sided paired Student's t test. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) is denoted with an asterisk. The following DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT and used to generate EMSA probes. The top and bottom strands were annealed to create double-stranded DNA. PVT1 RE wild-type probes were labeled with IRDye800 at the 5′-end of both top and bottom DNA strands. The region in boldface type denotes the p53-response element (PVT1 RE). Italicized nucleotides indicate mutations introduced in the invariant region of the PVT1 RE. Wild-type PVT1 RE (44 bp) was as follows: top strand, GCATACTGGCAGCGACAAGTTGAGACTTGTTCAACTTGACACAG; bottom strand, CTGTGTCAAGTTGAACAAGTCTCAACTTGTCGCTGCCAGTATGC. Mutant PVT1 RE (44 bp) was as follows: top, GCATACTGGCAGCGAAAAATTGAGAATTATTCAACTTGACACAG; bottom, CTGTGTCAAGTTGAATAATTCTCAATTTTTCGCTGCCAGTATGC. FLAG-tagged p53 protein was purified as described previously (37Laptenko O. Beckerman R. Freulich E. Prives C. p53 binding to nucleosomes within the p21 promoter in vivo leads to nucleosome loss and transcriptional activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 10385-10390Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged p53 (0–50 ng) was incubated with 10 ng of labeled wild-type PVT1 RE probe. Reaction mixtures were then run on 4% native acrylamide gels to assess the formation of p53-DNA complexes (upshifted products). The labeled probe was visualized with fluorescence detection through use of the Odyssey system (LI-COR). In competition assays, unlabeled competitor probe was added in a range of 0–250 ng. To investigate the potential link between the tumor suppressor p53 and the PVT1 locus, we employed the isogenic colon carcinoma HCT116 and HCT116 p53−/− cell lines (38Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C.

Requirement for p53 and p21 to sustain G2 arrest after DNA damage.Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells harbor wild-type p53, whose levels can be stabilized by a variety of mechanisms, including cellular stress (e.g. DNA damage) or nutlin (39Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E.A. In vivo activation of the p53 pathway by small-molecule antagonists of MDM2.Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3825) Google Scholar), which specifically inhibits p53 binding to MDM2, the major negative regulator of p53 stability (Fig. 1A). In HCT116 cells, activation of p53 by one such compound, nutlin-3a, led to increased RNA levels of the PVT1 non-coding RNA (PVT1 ncRNA) (Fig. 1B). The DNA-damaging agent daunorubicin also caused an up-regulation of PVT1 ncRNA, to an even greater extent than observed after nutlin. Both nutlin and daunorubicin caused p53-dependent induction of PVT1 ncRNA, because HCT116 p53−/− cells either failed to induce or showed only partial induction of PVT1 ncRNA. Notably, the basal steady-state levels of PVT1 ncRNA are also reduced in HCT116 p53−/− cells. As mentioned previously, PVT1 ncRNA undergoes extensive alternative splicing to produce a wide variety of mature transcripts (23Beck-Engeser G.B. Lum A.M. Huppi K. Caplen N.J. Wang B.B. Wabl M.

https://openalex.org/W2112318373,"Activating mutations in the RAS family or BRAF frequently occur in many types of human cancers but are rarely detected in breast tumors. However, activation of the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK MAPK pathway is commonly observed in human breast cancers, suggesting that other genetic alterations lead to activation of this signaling pathway. To identify breast cancer oncogenes that activate the MAPK pathway, we screened a library of human kinases for their ability to induce anchorage-independent growth in a derivative of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE). We identified p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) as a kinase that permitted HMLE cells to form anchorage-independent colonies. PAK1 is amplified in several human cancer types, including 30--33% of breast tumor samples and cancer cell lines. The kinase activity of PAK1 is necessary for PAK1-induced transformation. Moreover, we show that PAK1 simultaneously activates MAPK and MET signaling; the latter via inhibition of merlin. Disruption of these activities inhibits PAK1-driven anchorage-independent growth. These observations establish PAK1 amplification as an alternative mechanism for MAPK activation in human breast cancer and credential PAK1 as a breast cancer oncogene that coordinately regulates multiple signaling pathways, the cooperation of which leads to malignant transformation."

We analyzed several amino acids, located in the vicinity of this niche, by site-directed mutagenesis of the [FeFe]-hydrogenases from Clostridium pasteurianum (CpI) and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1). These amino acids are highly conserved and predicted to be involved in H-cluster coordination. Characterization of two hydrogenase variants confirmed this hypothesis. The exchange of residues CrHydA1Met415 and CrHydA1Lys228 resulted in inactive proteins, which, according to EPR and FTIR analyses, contain no intact H-cluster. However, [FeFe]-hydrogenases in which CpIMet353 (CrHydA1Met223) and CpICys299 (CrHydA1Cys169) were exchanged to leucine and serine, respectively, showed a structurally intact H-cluster with catalytic activity either absent (CpIC299S) or strongly diminished (CpIM353L). In the case of CrHydA1C169S, the H-cluster was trapped in an inactive state exhibiting g values and vibrational frequencies that resembled the Htrans state of DdH from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. This cysteine residue, interacting with the bridge head nitrogen of the di(methyl)amine ligand, seems therefore to represent an essential contribution of the immediate protein environment to the reaction mechanism. Exchanging methionine CpIM353 (CrHydA1M223) to leucine led to a strong decrease in turnover without affecting the Km value of the electron donor.

Depending on the metal content of the cofactor, hydrogenases are assigned to three main classes, namely [FeFe]-, [NiFe]-, and [Fe]-hydrogenases (also known as Hmd) (2Shima S. Thauer R.K.

This prosthetic group, the so called H-cluster, consists of a [4Fe-4S] subcluster and a [2Fe-2S] subcluster, which are connected by a cysteine-sulfur from the protein environment. Each iron ion of the [2Fe] subcluster is coordinated by one CN and one CO ligand. A third CO group is in a bridging position between both iron ions.

Depending on their position relative to the [4Fe] subcluster, the iron ions of the [2Fe] subcluster are referred to as being “proximal” or “distal.” The proximal iron is connected to the [4Fe] subcluster by a cysteine, whereas the distal iron harbors an open coordination site. The activity of the H-cluster is inhibited in the presence of free CO in the solution. In this case, an additional CO ligand occupies the open coordination site at the distal iron, forming an EPR-active CO-inhibited state (Hox-CO) (12Albracht S.P. Roseboom W. Hatchikian E.C.

Having this structural information available, chemical model molecules resembling the H-cluster framework have been synthesized with the aim of creating catalysts able to perform H2 generation without the need for noble metals like platinum. Although several chemical mimics catalyze electrochemical reduction of protons, none of them works as fast and at a similarly mild potential as their natural counterparts (23Krassen H. Ott S. Heberle J. In vitro hydrogen production: using energy from the sun.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2011; 13: 47-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast they require an input of energy well beyond the thermodynamic minimum; thus they operate only at large overpotentials; furthermore, they are stable only in certain nonaqueous solvents such as CH3CN, whereupon H2 evolution takes place upon the addition of an acid (24Barton B.E. Olsen M.T. Rauchfuss T.B. Artificial hydrogenases.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2010; 21: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These differences can be explained taking into account a catalytic mechanism of hydrogenases, in which a proton binds to the [2Fe] subcluster and has to be reduced to an intermediate hydride. In a 2Fe unit, this hydride could in principle be formed in a terminal position at one iron atom or in a position bridging both iron atoms, calculated to be thermodynamically more stable (16Bruschi M.

For synthetic [FeFe] analogs it has been shown that to promote terminal protonation, the center should be in a thermodynamically unfavored “rotated” conformation (24Barton B.E. Olsen M.T.

In the enzyme this configuration is probably stabilized by a number of first and second sphere interactions (15Barton B.E. Olsen M.T. Rauchfuss T.B.

The H-cluster is located in a conserved hydrophobic pocket within the protein structure. This pocket (so called H-domain) is the most conserved part of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, as observed in multiple amino acid sequence alignments (supplemental Fig. S2). The [4Fe] subcluster is covalently bound to the peptide chain by four cysteines, and one of these connects it to the [2Fe] subcluster. Furthermore, a number of conserved amino acids are located close to the different ligands of the H-cluster and may stabilize its unique geometry. Herein we have analyzed the importance of four of these conserved amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis of two different [FeFe]-hydrogenases and characterized the resulting eight variants by subsequent biochemical and biophysical techniques. We show that C299S and C169S exchanges in the [FeFe]-hydrogenases from Clostridium pasteurianum (termed CpI 2The abbreviations used are: CpIClostridium pasteurianum hydrogenase IHydhydrogenaseCrChlamydomonas reinhardtiiDdHDesulfovibrio desulfuricans hydrogenaseMSAmultiple sequence alignmentNaDTsodium dithioniteSHEstandard hydrogen electrode. in the following text) and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1), respectively, modulate the electronic properties of the H-cluster while leaving it structurally intact.

We used BLAST to identify homologous proteins to CpI in different species and created a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using COBALT (35Papadopoulos J.S. Agarwala R.

Affinity chromatography on a 2-ml Strep-Tactin Superflow® (IBA Göttingen, Germany) was carried out using 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, as buffer, 2 mm dithionite as reducing agent, and 2.5 mm desthiobiotin for elution of the protein. H2-evolving activity was determined by in vitro assays with 10 mm methyl viologen as the electron donor as described previously (44Happe T. Naber J.D.

The gas mixture was injected into a gas chromatograph (GC-2010; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a PLOT fused silica coating Molsieve column (5 Å, 10 m × 0.32 mm) from Varian (Palo Alto, CA). The specific activity of the hydrogenase was calculated from the detected amount of produced H2. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (45Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal.

Kinetic parameters Vmax and Km were calculated via Lineweaver-Burk plots of the H2 production rate with methyl viologen concentrations varying from 0.5 to 20 mm. H2 oxidation activity was determined by a method based on that described by Adams and Mortenson (46Adams M.W. Mortenson L.E.

The assay mixture contained 0.05 mm methylene blue in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, under 2% H2 at 30 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 ng to 6.4 μg of hydrogenase, and oxidation of methylene blue was followed with a Beckman Coulter PARADIGMTM absorbance detection cartridge at 604 nm. Q-band EPR spectra of all samples were measured by using the 2-pulse electron spin echo-detected EPR technique (47Schweiger A. Jeschke A. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance.

If not specified, the temperature was set at 200 K. The interferograms were accumulated in the double-sided, forward-backward mode with 2000 or more scans.

Thionine treatment was carried out by small additions of a highly concentrated anaerobic solution of thionine to a final concentration of about 2 mm. The oxidation was controlled by monitoring the disappearance of the blue color (reduction of thionine). After oxidation, the solution was transferred to an EPR tube and frozen within 2 min in liquid nitrogen (77 K). Protein film electrochemistry experiments were carried out in an anaerobic glove box as described previously (49Wait A.F. Brandmayr C. Stripp S.T. Cavazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Happe T.

Potentials are quoted relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) using the correction ESHE = ESCE + 0.242 mV at 298 K, where SCE is saturated calomel electrode. Mass flow controllers were used to prepare precise gas mixtures and to impose constant gas flow rates into the electrochemical cell during experiments. Efficient mixing and gas-solution equilibration were achieved through rapid electrode rotation (3000 rpm), which also ensured an efficient supply of substrate and removal of product. Enzyme films were prepared using the method described by Wait et al. (49Wait A.F. Brandmayr C. Stripp S.T. Cavazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Happe T. Armstrong F.A.

https://openalex.org/W1963992968,"A number of genes involved in tumorigenesis have been known to be controlled by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-κB, either synergistically or individually. In starved cancer cells, we found that NF-κB was activated through endoplasmic reticulum stress signals, which depend on reactive oxygen species, cytosolic calcium and preserved translation of NF-κB p65 subunit, but independent of IκBα serine phosphorylation, thereby resulting in IL6 induction. STAT3 was required for proper induction of IL6 by NF-κB. They existed as identical nuclear complexes in proximal IL6 promoters, and STAT3 had critical roles in binding to IL6 promoters as well as nuclear retention of NF-κB. The conditioned media from starved cancer cells contained various secretory factors, such as IL6, IL9, VWF (von Willebrand factor), FREM1 (FRAS1 related extracellular matrix 1), SAA1 (serum amyloid A1), SDK1 (sidekick homolog 1) and ADAM12 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 12), induced by NF-κB and STAT3 and promoted clonogenic capacities of cancer cells, and proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These results suggest novel survival strategies of cancer cells by which two oncogenic transcriptional factors, NF-κB and STAT3, are activated simultaneously by an intrinsic mechanism during stressful conditions of cancer cells, and they cooperatively induce various survival factors."
https://openalex.org/W1972645639,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. Emerging evidence indicates that deregulation of miRNAs contributes to the hepatocarcinogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the levels of miR-520e were dramatically decreased in examined hepatoma cell lines and clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Moreover, we found that DNA hypermethylation in the upstream region of miR-520e resulted in the downregulation of miR-520e. Next, we demonstrated that introduction of miR-520e dramatically suppressed the growth of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas silencing the expression of miR-520e by anti-miR-520e resulted in a promoted cell proliferation, suggesting that miR-520e may be a novel tumor suppressor. Further studies revealed that NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) was one of the direct target genes of miR-520e, as miR-520e directly bound to the 3′untranslated region of NIK, which reduced the expression of NIK at the levels of mRNA and protein. Moreover, silencing of NIK was able to inhibit the growth of hepatoma cells, similar to the effect of miR-520e overexpression on growth of hepatoma cells. Meanwhile, the knockdown of NIK expression reversed the enhanced proliferation mediated by anti-miR-520e. In addition, miR-520e significantly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and depressed the transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (p65). These results suggest that miR-520e suppresses the growth of hepatoma cells by targeting NIK involving the NIK/p-ERK1/2/NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, we showed that the intratumoral injection with miR-520e was able to directly repress the growth of hepatoma cells in the nude mice. Thus, our finding provides new insight into the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating a therapeutic potential of miR-520e in the treatment of HCC."

Accordingly, this study explored the putative involvement of NF-κB subunits p65 (RELA), p50 (NFKB1), and p52 (NFKB2) in the regulation of Orai1 and STIM1 expression. HEK293 cells were transfected with the constitutively active mutant SGK1S422D (hSGK1SD in pIRES-EGFP), the inactive mutant SGK1K127N (hSGK1KN in pIRES-EGFP) (23Lang F. Klingel K. Wagner C.A.

For luciferase assay, pGL3-Luciferase Enhancer constructs were cotransfected with 50 ng of pRL-TK (Promega) and p65 using FuGENE HD transfection reagent. Where indicated, NF-κB was inhibited by treatment of the cells for 24 h with 100 μm Wogonin (25Fas S.C. Baumann S. Zhu J.Y. Giaisi M. Treiber M.K. Mahlknecht U. Krammer P.H. Li-Weber M.

Additionally, knockdown of NF-κB subunits p65, p50, and p52 was performed with 10 nm siRNA (Life Technology Inc., Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions using Polyplus Interferin (PeqLab, Germany). Mast cells were transfected with 2 μg of S276Dp65 according to the manufacturer's instructions using solution V and an Amaxa nucleofector device (Köln, Germany; set to program T-020). To introduce an aspartic acid for a serine at position 276, QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies) was utilized using the following primer pair (5′-3′ orientation, the mutation is in bold): forward (CAGCTACGGCGGCCTGATGATCGCGAGCTCAGT) and reverse (ACTGAGCTCGCGATCATCAGGCCGCCGTAGCTG). Sequencing was performed to verify the mutation. To determine STIM1/Orai1 mRNA abundance in HEK293 cells, RNA was extracted using Trifast reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamer primers (0.1 mm, Roche Diagnostics), 1st strand buffer (Invitrogen), DTT (10 mm, Invitrogen), and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 units, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 42 °C. For inactivation, the samples were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C. Quantitative real-time PCR was applied on the CFX96 Real-Time System® C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) using the following primer pairs (5′-3′ orientation): STIM1 forward (CCTGTGGAAGGCATGGAAGT), STIM1 reverse (CTGAGGCAGCTCCACATATGT), Orai1 forward (CACCTGTTTGCGCTCATGAT), and Orai1 reverse (GGGACTCCTTGACCGAGTTG). The transcript levels of the housekeeping gene TBP were determined for each sample using the following primers (5′-3′ orientation): forward (GCCCGAAACGCCGAATAT) and reverse (CCGTGGTTCGTGGCTCTCT). Amplification of the housekeeping gene TBP was performed to standardize the amount of sample RNA. Knockdown or up-regulation of NF-κB subunits after transfection was examined using the following primer pairs (5′-3′ orientation): p65 forward (ATACCACCAAGACCCACCCC), p65 reverse (TGAGGAGGGTCCTTGGTGAC), p50 forward (ATAATGCCTTCCGGCTGAGTC), p50 reverse (TTGTCTCAGGGCCTCCACC), p52 forward (GAAGGGCCGAAAGACCTATCC), and p52 reverse (GAGCACGAGGTGGGTCACTG). Bone marrow-derived mast cells from sgk1−/− and wild type mice were analyzed as described above using the following primer pairs (5′-3′ orientation): STIM1 forward (GGAAGGCGTGGAAGTCATCA), STIM1 reverse (TCATACTGTGGCAGCTCCACA), Orai1 forward (GCCAAGCTCAAAGCTTCCA), Orai1 reverse (CATGGTCTGTGTCCAGCTGG), SGK1 forward (GGCTATCTGCACTCCCTAAACA), SGK1 reverse (CCAAAGTCAGTGAGGACGATGT), TBP forward (CACTCCTGCCACACCAGCTT), and TBP reverse (TGGTCTTTAGGTCAAGTTTACAGCC). Primer pairs were designed binding to two different exons, creating a product of about 90 bp. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the 2−ΔΔct method as described earlier (27Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). The genomic sequences of STIM1 and Orai1 promoter were checked for the 5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′ κB-consensus sequence. DNA sequence of the promoter region (3000 bp upstream of transcription start) was used from ensemble.org, and each possible consensus sequence was tested by self-made sequence alignment. Sequences containing putative κB-binding sites in the STIM1 and Orai1 promoter region were amplified by PCR from genomic template DNA. PCR was performed using MaximaTM Hot Start TaqDNA polymerase (Fermentas, Germany) with primers containing a KpnI site 5′ and a HindIII site 3′: O1 forward (GTAGGTACCGGAAACAAAGCCAGTAG), O1 reverse (CGTAAGCTTTTCCAGACCAGCCTA), O2 forward (CGTAGGTACCCCAGAGACTTCTTGGG), O2 reverse (GCTAAGCTTCAGGACGGCGAGG), S1 forward (CCTCGGTACCATCCATGTTGTAGCA), and S1 reverse (GCGAAAGCTTACGCTAAAATGGTGTCT). The separate STIM1/Orai1 promoter fragments were cloned into the pGL3-Luciferase Enhancer Vector (Promega). To ensure that the fragments were inserted in the correct orientation and to confirm the correctness of the sequence control restrictions and DNA sequencing was performed (Delphi Test). Forty-eight hours after transfection, Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assays (Promega) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity. Renilla luciferase was constitutively expressed by the cotransfected vector pRL-TK and thus served as an internal control for the transfection rate. Bone marrow was obtained from 6–8-week-old female and male SGK1 knock-out (sgk1−/−) mice and their wild type (sgk1+/+) littermates. Generation, breeding, and genotyping of the mice has been described earlier (28Wulff P. Vallon V. Huang D.Y. Völkl H. Yu F. Richter K. Jansen M. Schlünz M. Klingel K. Loffing J. Kauselmann G.

Animal experiments were conducted according to German law for the welfare of animals and were approved by local authorities. Femoral bone marrow cells from 6–8-week-old sgk1+/+ and sgk1−/− mice were cultured for 4 weeks in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (both from Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 20 ng/ml interleukin-3 (RD Systems), and 100 ng/ml concentrations of the c-kit ligand stem cell factor (SCF, Peprotech, Tebu-bio). BMMC maturation was confirmed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) (29Shumilina E. Lam R.S. Wölbing F. Matzner N. Zemtsova I.M. Sobiesiak M. Mahmud H. Sausbier U. Biedermann T. Ruth P.

Mast cells were plated in 24-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well). The cells were either treated with Wogonin (100 μm) for 24 h or incubated in the medium deprived of growth factors (SCF, IL-3) in the presence or in the absence of Wogonin (100 μm) for 20 h and after that treated with SCF (100 μg/ml) in the presence or in the absence of Wogonin, respectively, for a further 4 h. Then the cells were collected and washed with PBS. HEK293 cells transfected with p65/p50 or p65/p52, respectively, were cultured in 24-well plates with a coverslip inside, washed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For blocking, unspecific binding HEK293 cells were incubated with 5% normal goat serum, 1× PBS, 0.1% Triton for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were exposed to rabbit anti-Orai1 (1:100, Millipore) or rabbit anti-STIM1 (1:100, Abnova) at 4 °C overnight. The cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary FITC goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen) or with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After three washing steps the nuclei were stained with DRAQ-5 dye (1:1000; Biostatus) for 10 min at room temperature. The slides and coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were taken on a LSM 5 EXCITER confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with a water-immersion Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 NA differential interference contrast and analyzed with the instrument's software. Nuclear translocation of p65 was analyzed by incubating HEK293 cells transfected with either SGK1S422D or SGK1K127N or EGFP-containing empty vector or BMMCs derived from sgk1−/− and sgk1+/+ mice with anti-p65 (1:200, Santa Cruz) and Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Millipore). For a positive control, the translocation of NF-κB subunit p65 in BMMCs was induced by treatment of the HEK293 cells with TNFα (100 ng/ml, 1h, R&D Systems). For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), HEK293 cells (80–90% confluent) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 1% paraformaldehyde and PBS. The reaction was stopped by adding 125 mm glycine for 5 min. After washing 3 times the cells were incubated with swelling buffer containing 25 m HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics) for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed with 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and sonicated 3 times for 30 s at 30% (Sonifer 250, Branson) to shear DNA. Preclearing was performed in 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics) using salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose slurry. After centrifugation, 20 μl (1%) of the supernatant were removed and saved. Precleared cell lysates were incubated with the following antibodies at 4 °C overnight; 2 μg of anti-p65 (C20, Santa Cruz) was used for pull down, and anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000, Abcam) was used as the negative control. Immune complexes were recovered with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry. After washing and elution in 1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3 overnight at 65 °C, genomic DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and PCR was performed with the following primer pairs (5′-3′ orientation): O1 forward (GTAGGTACCGGAAACAAAGCCAGTAG), O1 reverse (CGTAAGCTTTTCCAGACCAGCCTA), O2 forward (CGTAGGTACCCCAGAGACTTCTTGGG), O2 reverse (GCTAAGCTTCAGGACGGCGAGG), STIM1 forward (CCTCGGTACCATCCATGTTGTAGCA), and STIM1 reverse (GCGAAAGCTTACGCTAAAATGGTGTCT). For total protein analysis cells were harvested with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol, Proteinase-Inhibitor Mixture, Roche Diagnostics) 48–72 h after transfection. Clarified protein lysate was applied to a polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot. 100 μg of protein of whole cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis and incubated with primary antibody against Orai1 (1:500, ProteinTech Group), STIM1 (1:500, Abnova, Taiwan), NF-κB p65 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), NF-κB p50 (E-10, 1:500, Santa Cruz), NF-κB p100/p52 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), or tubulin (1:1000, Cell Signaling). For detection, a secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:3000, Cell Signaling) or secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with HRP (1:3000, Amersham Biosciences) was used. The blots were stripped and reprobed with tubulin to verify equal loading. Antibody binding was detected with ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified with ImageJ Software. Fura-2/AM fluorescence was utilized to determine intracellular Ca2+ (29Shumilina E. Lam R.S. Wölbing F. Matzner N. Zemtsova I.M. Sobiesiak M. Mahmud H. Sausbier U. Biedermann T. Ruth P. Sausbier M.

Cells were excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm through an objective (Fluar 40×/1.30 oil) built in an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Axiovert 100, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Emitted fluorescence intensity was recorded at 505 nm. Data were acquired using specialized computer software (Metafluor, Universal Imaging). Cytosolic Ca2+ activity was estimated from the 340/380-nm ratio. HEK293 cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM (2.5 μm, Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. SOCE was determined by extracellular Ca2+ removal and subsequent Ca2+ readdition in the presence of thapsigargin (1 μm) (30Bird G.S. DeHaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Putney Jr., J.W. Methods for studying store-operated calcium entry.Methods. 2008; 46: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For quantification of the Ca2+ entry, slope (Δ ratio/s) and peak (Δ ratio) were calculated after readdition of Ca2+. Experiments were performed with Ringer solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 32 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. To reach nominally Ca2+-free conditions, experiments were performed using Ca2+-free Ringer solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 32 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. For migration assays, transwell inserts (BD Falcon 353097) and BD BioCoatTM MatrigelTM Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences 354480) were used with a pore diameter size of 8 μm. The transwells were placed in a 24-well cell culture plate containing cell culture medium (750 μl). The upper chambers were filled with 500 μl of cell culture medium containing HEK293 cells in a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml. After an incubation time of 24 h at 37 °C, migrated cells were analyzed by staining the cell nuclei with DAPI. Before that non-migrated cells were removed by scrubbing with a cotton-tipped swab two times and washing with PBS. After a 15 min fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, the membrane was removed with a scalpel. After removal from the inserts, membranes were mounted on slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). To determine the total number of migrated cells, the slides were then viewed under the microscope, and the number of cells/field in representative areas was counted. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Data are provided as the mean ± S.E.; n represents the number of independent experiments. All data were tested for significance using Student's unpaired two-tailed t test or ANOVA (Tukey's test or Dunnett's test), where applicable. Results with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. As illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B, transfection of HEK293 with the constitutively active mutant S422DSGK1 but not with the inactive mutant K127NSGK1 was followed by a significant increase of mRNA encoding STIM1 and Orai1. Accordingly, the transcript levels of both genes were enhanced by SGK1. Previous studies revealed that SGK1 activates NF-κB (20BelAiba R.S. Djordjevic T. Bonello S. Artunc F. Lang F. Hess J.

Thus, S422DSGK1-transfected and non-transfected HEK293 cells were treated with the NF-κB inhibitor Wogonin (100 μm). The treatment significantly reduced the mRNA levels of STIM1 and Orai1 in both S422DSGK1-overexpressing and non-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Transfection of HEK293 cells with S422DSGK1 but not with K127NSGK1 led to nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 (Fig. 1C). Again, the effect of S224DSGK could be reversed by treatment of the cells with Wogonin. For the positive control for p65 translocation, HEK293 cells were incubated with TNFα (100 ng/ml, 1 h). Το elucidate whether the stimulating effect of SGK1 is apparent under endogenous levels of SGK1, the transcript levels of Orai1 and STIM1 were determined in BMMCs isolated from gene targeted mice lacking functional SGK1 (sgk1−/−) and their wild type (sgk1+/+) littermates. As shown in Fig. 2, the Orai1 and STIM1 transcript levels were both significantly higher in sgk1+/+ BMMCs compared with sgk1−/− BMMCs. Stimulation of sgk1+/+, but not of sgk1−/− BMMCs, with SCF (20 ng/ml, 4 h) resulted in a translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 to the nucleus (Fig. 2A) and accordingly led to significant increase of the STIM1 and Orai1 transcript levels in sgk1+/+ BMMCs but not in sgk1−/− BMMCs (Fig. 2B), an effect abrogated by treatment of sgk1+/+ cells with Wogonin (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2150237496,"Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) belong to the family of large GTPases that are induced in response to interferons. GBPs contain an N-terminal globular GTPase domain and a C-terminal α-helical regulatory domain that are connected by a short middle domain. Antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus has been shown for hGBP-1; however, no anti-influenza virus properties for GBPs have been described to date. Here we show that hGBP-1 and hGBP-3 possess anti-influenza viral activity. Furthermore, we have identified a novel splice variant of hGBP-3, named hGBP-3ΔC, with a largely modified C-terminal α-helical domain. While all three GBP isoforms were up-regulated on influenza virus infection, hGBP-3ΔC showed the most prominent antiviral activity in epithelial cells. Mutational analysis of hGBPs revealed that the globular domain is the principal antiviral effector domain, and GTP-binding, but not hydrolysis, is necessary for antiviral action. Furthermore, we showed that hGBP-3ΔC strongly represses the activity of the viral polymerase complex, which results in decreased synthesis of viral vRNA, cRNA, mRNA, and viral proteins, as well."
https://openalex.org/W1994811165,"Acetyl-CoA assimilation was extensively studied in organisms harboring the glyoxylate cycle. In this study, we analyzed the metabolism of the facultative methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, which lacks isocitrate lyase, the key enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle, during growth on acetate. MS/MS-based proteomic analysis revealed that the protein repertoire of M. extorquens AM1 grown on acetate is similar to that of cells grown on methanol and includes enzymes of the ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMC) pathway that were recently shown to operate during growth on methanol. Dynamic 13C labeling experiments indicate the presence of distinct entry points for acetate: the EMC pathway and the TCA cycle. 13C steady-state metabolic flux analysis showed that oxidation of acetyl-CoA occurs predominantly via the TCA cycle and that assimilation occurs via the EMC pathway. Furthermore, acetyl-CoA condenses with the EMC pathway product glyoxylate, resulting in malate formation. The latter, also formed by the TCA cycle, is converted to phosphoglycerate by a reaction sequence that is reversed with respect to the serine cycle. Thus, the results obtained in this study reveal the utilization of common pathways during the growth of M. extorquens AM1 on C1 and C2 compounds, but with a major redirection of flux within the central metabolism. Furthermore, our results indicate that the metabolic flux distribution is highly complex in this model methylotroph during growth on acetate and is fundamentally different from organisms using the glyoxylate cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2063395861,"Osterix (Osx) is an osteoblast-specific transcription factor required for bone formation and osteoblast differentiation. The critical step in bone formation is to replace the avascular cartilage template with vascularized bone. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are associated with each other, sharing some essential regulators. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in both angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of VEGF expression is not well known in osteoblasts. In this study, quantitative real-time RT-PCR results revealed that VEGF expression was down-regulated in Osx-null calvarial cells and that osteoblast marker osteocalcin expression was absent. Overexpression of Osx in stable C2C12 mesenchymal cells using a Tet-off system resulted in up-regulation of both osteocalcin and VEGF expression. The inhibition of Osx by siRNA led to repression of VEGF expression in osteoblasts. These results suggest that Osx controls VEGF expression. Transfection assays demonstrated that Osx activated VEGF promoter activity. A series of VEGF promoter deletion mutants were examined and the minimal Osx-responsive region was defined to the proximal 140-bp region of the VEGF promoter. Additional point mutants were used to identify two GC-rich regions that were responsible for VEGF promoter activation by Osx. Gel shift assay showed that Osx bound to the VEGF promoter sequence directly. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that endogenous Osx associated with the native VEGF promoter in primary osteoblasts. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed decreased VEGF protein levels in the tibiae of Osx conditional knock-out mice. We provide the first evidence that Osx controlled VEGF expression, suggesting a potential role of Osx in coordinating osteogenesis and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2064936324,"Correct function of spermatogonia is critical for the maintenance of spermatogenesis throughout life, but the cellular pathways regulating undifferentiated spermatogonia proliferation, differentiation, and survival are only partially known. We show here that long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (L-GILZ) is highly expressed in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes and controls spermatogenesis. Gilz deficiency in knock-out (gilz KO) mice leads to a complete loss of germ cell lineage within first cycles of spermatogenesis, resulting in male sterility. Spermatogenesis failure is intrinsic to germ cells and is associated with increased proliferation and aberrant differentiation of undifferentiated spermatogonia and with hyperactivity of Ras signaling pathway as indicated by an increase of ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Spermatogonia differentiation does not proceed beyond the prophase of the first meiotic division due to massive apoptosis associated with accumulation of unrepaired chromosomal damage. These results identify L-GILZ as a novel important factor for undifferentiated spermatogonia function and spermatogenesis."

In PDE2 and PDE5, the GAF domains mediate cGMP stimulation; however, their function in PDE10 and PDE11 remains controversial. Although the GAF domains of PDE10 mediate cAMP-induced stimulation of chimeric adenylyl cyclases, cAMP binding did not stimulate the PDE10 holoenzyme. Comparable data about cGMP and the PDE11 GAF domains exist. Here, we identified synthetic ligands for the GAF domains of PDE10 and PDE11 to reduce interference of the GAF ligand with the catalytic reaction of PDE. With these ligands, GAF-mediated stimulation of the PDE10 and PDE11 holoenzymes is demonstrated for the first time. Furthermore, PDE10 is shown to be activated by cAMP, which paradoxically results in potent competitive inhibition of cGMP turnover by cAMP. PDE11, albeit susceptible to GAF-dependent stimulation, is not activated by the native cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP. In summary, PDE11 can be stimulated by GAF domain ligands, but its native ligand remains to be identified, and PDE10 is the only PDE activated by cAMP.

PDE11 has been suggested to be prominent in skeletal muscle and prostate; however, because of the lack of appropriate antibodies against PDE11, the tissue distribution of this isoform is a matter of debate (7Fawcett L.

GAF domains are small ligand binding domains identified in many, mostly bacterial proteins (18Aravind L. Ponting C.P.

The acronym GAF is deduced from the proteins in which GAF domains were first discovered (cGMP-specific and -stimulated phosphodiesterases, Anabaena adenylyl cyclases, and Escherichia coli FhlA). In mammals, PDEs are the only proteins containing GAF domains. PDE2 and -5 are stimulated by binding of cGMP to their GAF domains (23Beavo J.A. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W.

PDE10 and PDE11 also contain tandem GAF domains. However, stimulation of PDE10 and PDE11 by cAMP or cGMP has not been demonstrated yet. Moreover, a recent publication claimed that binding of cyclic nucleotides to the PDE10 and PDE11 GAF domains does not stimulate catalytic activity (27Matthiesen K. Nielsen J. Binding of cyclic nucleotides to phosphodiesterase 10A and 11A GAF domains does not stimulate catalytic activity.Biochem. J. 2009; 423: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In another experimental approach, the PDE10 and -11 GAF domains fused to the catalytic domain of a bacterial adenylyl cyclase were studied. In these chimeric constructs, cAMP increased adenylyl cyclase activity of the PDE10 GAF fusion protein, whereas the PDE11 GAF-containing construct was responsive to cGMP (28Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. cAMP is a ligand for the tandem GAF domain of human phosphodiesterase 10 and cGMP for the tandem GAF domain of phosphodiesterase 11.J. Biol.

Here, we used fluorophore-tagged tandem GAF domains of PDE10 and PDE11 to identify synthetic GAF ligands. Using these ligands, GAF-mediated stimulation of PDE10 and PDE11 is demonstrated. Moreover, our results show that cAMP activation of PDE10 enhances competitive inhibition of cGMP turnover by cAMP and that PDE11, despite its activation by synthetic GAF ligands, is not stimulated by the physiological cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP.

Using these constructs, fragments encoding the tandem GAF domains of PDE10 (Lys61–Tyr428) and PDE11 (Ala174–Val580) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3 between the open reading frames of CFP and YFP as described previously (29Russwurm M.

Activation of PDE2 and PDE5 by specific GAF ligands: delayed activation of PDE5.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 161: 1645-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two or 3 days post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed by sonication (Branson) in 500 μl of buffer (either 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 for expression of PDE holoenzymes or 25 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 for FRET constructs with both buffers containing 2 mm DTT and mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C), and protein contents were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). FRET constructs of PDE10 tandem GAF domains obtained as described above (5 μl of cleared lysates) were analyzed in a total volume of 100 μl (25 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 containing 2 mm DTT and 10 mm MgCl2) in white half-area 96-well plates (Greiner) using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer and a microplate accessory (Varian). For screening, nucleotides were added at a 100 μm concentration, and fluorescence was recorded for 30 min (excitation, 436 nm; emissions, 475 and 525 nm corresponding to CFP and YFP, respectively; excitation and emission slits, 5 nm). Subsequently, 0.5 μm cAMP was added to identify potential GAF domain antagonists, and fluorescence was again recorded for 30 min. Values of a water-containing well were subtracted for background correction, and ratios of emissions at 525 and 475 nm were calculated. EC50 values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained by recording nucleotide effects at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μm. Smaller FRET changes of the PDE11 tandem GAF domain FRET constructs necessitated analysis in more sensitive cuvettes instead of microplates; moreover, the larger volume of the cuvettes required reduction of the nucleotide concentrations because of limited availability. Cleared lysates (30 μl) containing the FRET constructs of the PDE11 GAF domains were analyzed in a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian) in cuvettes containing a total volume of 800 μl (25 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 containing 2 mm DTT and 10 mm MgCl2). Fluorescence was continuously recorded (values as above); after establishing a base line, nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 10 μm, fluorescence was recorded for at least 5 min, and subsequently 0.1 and 1 μm cGMP were added to identify potential GAF domain antagonists followed by further recording for 5 min. EC50 values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained by recording cumulative concentration response curves between 0.1 and 100 μm nucleotides. Cleared lysates of HEK cells expressing either PDE10A1 or PDE11A4 (0.1–16 μg; enzyme amount adjusted to obtain maximally 20% substrate conversion) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of either [32P]cGMP or [32P]cAMP (approximately 3 kBq), 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 containing 0.5 g × liter−1 bovine serum albumin and 3 mm DTT. Incubations were stopped by addition of 900 μl of charcoal suspension (30% (v/v) in 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 2.3), and following centrifugation, formed 32P was determined as Čerenkov radiation in the supernatant. PCR-amplified fragments encoding the PDE10 and PDE11 tandem GAF domains (see above; without the fluorophores) were subcloned into pPR-IBA (IBA, Göttingen Germany) for bacterial expression of N-terminally Strep-tagged GAF domains. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) were transformed with the respective plasmid and grown to an A600 of 0.6 (12 × 250 ml). Expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and carried out for 20 h at 20 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, frozen at −70 °C or in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended after thawing in 0.25 g × liter−1 lysozyme (Boehringer) in 100 ml of 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 8.5 containing 1 mm EDTA and 2 mm DTT. After lysis, DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and MgCl2 (final concentrations, 0.02 g × liter−1 and 100 mm, respectively) were added, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C) and applied to 10 ml of Strep-Tactin-Sepharose (IBA). After elution with desthiobiotin, size exclusion chromatography was performed (Hiload 26/60 Superdex, 200 pg, Amersham Biosciences; running buffer, 25 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4), and fractions containing the GAF domains were concentrated (Amicon centrifugal filter units, 10 kDa, Millipore) and stored at −70 °C. Polyclonal antisera were obtained by immunizing rabbits with purified GAF domains using standard protocols. Mouse organs and brain regions were homogenized in 4–10 volumes (w/v) of 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 containing mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) using a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After centrifugation to remove nuclei (800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 20 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA-85, Schleicher & Schuell/Whatman). After blocking (Roti-Block, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), PDE10 and PDE11 antisera (see above) were applied in a 1:10,000 dilution and detected by secondary peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies (Pierce). Chemiluminescence detection was performed using SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera-based detection system (GDS 8000, UVP). The specificity of signals was checked by addition of purified antigen (4 μg/ml) to the primary antibody solution. Adult mice were sacrificed, and testes were removed and stripped from connective tissue (tunica albuginea). Tissue was suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and mechanically disrupted by aspirating three times into a 50-ml syringe. Seminiferous tubes and non-disrupted cells were allowed to settle for 10 min followed by centrifugation of the remaining supernatant (10 min at 250 × g at room temperature). The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer L (10 mm HEPES, 154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4), layered onto 1 ml of Percoll (1.124 g × ml−1; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), and centrifuged (15 min at 900 × g at room temperature). The Leydig cell layer remaining on top of the Percoll layer was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer L, and cell number (usually ∼4 × 107 cells/mouse) was determined using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer. Testosterone release was measured by incubating 106 Leydig cells in 400 μl of buffer L for 3 h at 34 °C with agitation (1000 rpm; Thermomixer 5436, Eppendorf) with luteinizing hormone (National Hormone and Peptide Program) and TP-10 (Pfizer) as indicated. Subsequently, cells were removed (900 × g for 15 min), and testosterone was measured in the supernatant by radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). Striata of two mice were isolated and immediately homogenized by 15 strokes with a glass/glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer using 10 volumes of ice cold buffer (50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, Sigma mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and nuclei. Of the resulting supernatant, 0.05 μl was used for PDE assays. Hippocampi of 10 mice were homogenized in 3 ml of buffer A (25 mm NaCl, 25 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, and 1 μm pepstatin A) using 20 strokes of a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After centrifugation (100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C), the cytosolic fraction was applied to an anion exchange column (0.5-cm inner diameter × 5 cm = 1-ml column volume; Source Q, GE Healthcare) and eluted using a 40-ml gradient to 300 mm NaCl in 2-ml fractions. 20 μl of each fraction and the cytosol were applied to Western blots; 10 μl/incubation were used for phosphodiesterase assays performed as described above. Five of the 11 PDE families contain a tandem of regulatory so-called GAF domains. The GAF-containing PDE2 and PDE5 are allosterically activated by cGMP. In contrast, GAF-dependent activation of PDE10 and PDE11 has not been demonstrated; this may be partially due to the fact that the nucleotide serving as the GAF ligand is also degraded as a substrate. Therefore, we decided to screen for synthetic GAF ligands using FRET constructs in which the respective tandem of GAF domains is sandwiched between CFP and YFP. Fig. 1 depicts the cAMP and cGMP binding properties of the FRET constructs containing the tandem GAF domains of PDE10 or PDE11. The PDE10 GAF domains bound cAMP with an EC50 of ∼0.3 μm but displayed a much lower affinity for cGMP (∼30 μm). The PDE11 GAF domains almost exclusively bound cGMP (EC50 ∼ 0.1 μm); cAMP only elicited an ∼30% response even at a concentration of 1 mm. Because of the clear preference of the PDE10 FRET construct for cAMP, 33 cAMP analogues (100 μm; Table 1) were tested for their ability to elicit cAMP-like FRET changes indicating agonistic properties. Subsequently, potential antagonistic properties of the analogues were analyzed by adding a half-maximally effective cAMP concentration (0.5 μm). However, none of the tested substances blocked or reduced the cAMP-induced changes, and therefore, no antagonists were identified. Of the identified agonists, two displayed an EC50 of less than 1 μm; for three further analogues, an EC50 of less than 10 μm was determined.TABLE 1Characteristics of cAMP analogues as tested on isolated PDE10 GAF domains as FRET constructAnalogueEC50μmcAMP0.28 (0.14–0.58)1-NO-cAMP17 (11–28)2-DMA-cAMP>100Rp-cAMPS40 (25–64)Sp-cAMPS40 (23–71)8-N3-cAMP—2-Aza-ϵ-cAMP—2-AHA-cAMP>100Ara-cAMP4.0 (2.0–7.7)8-N3-ϵ-cAMP—2′-NH2-cAMP37 (27–50)8-Br-cAMP54 (32–93)6-Bn-cAMP—6-Bnz-cAMP>1008-BT-cAMP—cCMP—6-Cl-cPuMP10 (6–18)8-Cl-cAMP41 (30–57)8-CPT-cAMP—2-Cl-cAMP1.1 (0.6–2.0)2-Cl-MA-cAMP—2′-dcAMP0.95 (0.51–1.77)7-CH-cAMP0.59 (0.22–1.5)2′-F-cAMP—ϵ-cAMP5.5 (3.4–9.0)8-OH-cAMP—8-MA-cAMP—6-MB-cAMP10 (5–20)2′-O-Me-cAMP—6-DMA-cPuMP—6-MA-cPuMP—6-Phe-cAMP—cTMP—cUMP>100 Open table in a new tab The PDE11 tandem GAF construct displayed smaller FRET changes than the PDE10 construct. Therefore, the screen had to be performed in cuvettes instead of microplates, which required 10-fold higher assay volumes. Because of limited availability, the analogue concentration was therefore reduced to 10 μm. Of the 31 cGMP analogues tested for agonistic properties, eight elicited cGMP-like FRET changes with EC50 values between 1 and 10 μm. None of the analogues displayed antagonistic features (tested in the presence of 0.1 and 1 μm cGMP). Next, we used the identified GAF ligands to study activation of PDE10 recombinantly expressed in HEK cells. Measurements were performed with freshly prepared cytosolic fractions because cGMP stimulation of PDE5 has been reported to be impaired after storage or purification (24Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G.

First, 7-CH-cAMP was chosen as the most promising agonist for PDE10 as it displayed the lowest EC50 value in the FRET analyses. The PDE10 GAF domains bind cAMP with high affinity (see above). To avoid an effect of the substrate on the GAF domains, we first analyzed cGMP-hydrolyzing PDE activity. At 0.1 and 1 μm cGMP, 7-CH-cAMP activated PDE10 3-fold (Fig. 2A). At higher cGMP concentrations of 10 and 100 μm, stimulation by 7-CH-cAMP was reduced or abolished, respectively, indicating that cGMP in high concentrations also binds to the GAF domains, thereby prestimulating the enzyme and reducing the maximally achievable stimulation factor. Next, the stimulatory effect of 7-CH-cAMP on cAMP-hydrolyzing activity was analyzed. At a substrate concentration of 0.03 μm cAMP, the analogue stimulated PDE10 ∼3-fold (Fig. 2B), which is comparable with the maximal stimulation observed with cGMP as substrate and demonstrates that cAMP binding to the GAF domains was negligible at the lowest cAMP concentration. However, already at 0.1 μm cAMP, the 7-CH-cAMP-induced activation was reduced (to 1."

The Jmj family was identified as histone demethylases, indicating epigenetic regulation by Jmj proteins. Deletion of Jarid2 in mice resulted in cardiac malformation and increased endocardial Notch1 expression during development. Although Jarid2 has been shown to occupy the Notch1 locus in the developing heart, the precise molecular role of Jarid2 remains unknown. Here we show that deletion of Jarid2 results in reduced methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9) at the Notch1 genomic locus in embryonic hearts. Interestingly, SETDB1, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, was identified as a putative cofactor of Jarid2 by yeast two-hybrid screening, and the physical interaction between Jarid2 and SETDB1 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Concurrently, accumulation of SETDB1 at the site of Jarid2 occupancy was significantly reduced in Jarid2 knock out (KO) hearts. Employing genome-wide approaches, putative Jarid2 target genes regulated by SETDB1 via H3K9 methylation were identified in the developing heart by ChIP-chip. These targets are involved in biological processes that, when dysregulated, could manifest in the phenotypic defects observed in Jarid2 KO mice. Our data demonstrate that Jarid2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of target genes, including Notch1, through a novel process involving the modification of H3K9 methylation via specific interaction with SETDB1 during heart development. Therefore, our study provides new mechanistic insights into epigenetic regulation by Jarid2, which will enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of other organ development and biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2058133347,"The family of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) proteins has been implicated in tumor initiation and progression. ADAM17/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-converting enzyme (TACE) has been initially recognized to release TNFα as well as its receptors (TNFRs) from the membrane. ADAM17, TNFα and TNFR have been found upregulated in cancer patients, although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. As hypoxia is a hallmark of cancer that can lead to severe stress conditions accumulating in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), we investigated the role of these stress conditions in the regulation of ADAM17 and release of TNFR1.We found that severe hypoxia induced ADAM17 expression and activity. Although hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) was important to maintain basal ADAM17 mRNA levels during moderate hypoxia, it was not sufficient to induce ADAM17 levels under severe hypoxia. Instead, we found that ADAM17 induction by severe hypoxia can be mimicked by ER stressors such as Thapsigargin and occurs as a consequence of the activation of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) arms of UPR in several tumor cell lines. ADAM17 expression was also increased in xenografts displaying ER stress because of treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitory antibody Bevacizumab. Additionally, severe hypoxia and ER stress activated ADAM17 and ectodomain shedding of TNFR1 involving mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, these results show that ADAM17 is a novel UPR-regulated gene in response to severe hypoxia and ER stress, which is actively involved in the release of TNFR1 under these conditions. These data provide a novel link between severe hypoxic stress conditions and inflammation in the tumor environment."
https://openalex.org/W1973101424,"Parainfluenza viruses enter host cells by fusing the viral and target cell membranes via concerted action of their two envelope glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion protein (F). Receptor-bound HN triggers F to undergo conformational changes that render it fusion-competent. To address the role of receptor engagement and to elucidate how HN and F interact during the fusion process, we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to follow the dynamics of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) HN/F pairs in living cells. We show that HN and F associate before receptor engagement. HN drives the formation of HN-F clusters at the site of fusion, and alterations in HN-F interaction determine the fusogenicity of the glycoprotein pair. An interactive site, at the HN dimer interface modulates HN fusion activation property, which is critical for infection of the natural host. This first evidence for the sequence of initial events that lead to viral entry may indicate a new paradigm for understanding Paramyxovirus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2076569856,"For insulin synthesis, the proinsulin precursor is translated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), folds to include its three native disulfide bonds, and is exported to secretory granules for processing and secretion. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has long been assumed to assist proinsulin in this process. Herein we have examined the effect of PDI knockdown (PDI-KD) in β-cells. The data establish that upon PDI-KD, oxidation of proinsulin to form native disulfide bonds is unimpaired and in fact enhanced. This is accompanied by improved proinsulin exit from the ER and increased total insulin secretion, with no evidence of ER stress. We provide evidence for direct physical interaction between PDI and proinsulin in the ER of pancreatic β-cells, in a manner requiring the catalytic activity of PDI. In β-cells after PDI-KD, enhanced export is selective for proinsulin over other secretory proteins, but the same effect is observed for recombinant proinsulin trafficking upon PDI-KD in heterologous cells. We hypothesize that PDI exhibits unfoldase activity for proinsulin, increasing retention of proinsulin within the ER of pancreatic β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998623995,"Identification and characterization of virus-host interactions are very important steps toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression and pathogenesis. To date, very few cellular factors involved in the life cycle of flaviviruses, which are important human pathogens, have been described. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for class II Arf proteins (Arf4 and Arf5) in the dengue flavivirus life cycle. We show that simultaneous depletion of Arf4 and Arf5 blocks recombinant subviral particle secretion for all four dengue serotypes. Immunostaining analysis suggests that class II Arf proteins are required at an early pre-Golgi step for dengue virus secretion. Using a horseradish peroxidase protein fused to a signal peptide, we show that class II Arfs act specifically on dengue virus secretion without altering the secretion of proteins through the constitutive secretory pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that the dengue prM glycoprotein interacts with class II Arf proteins but not through its C-terminal VXPX motif. Finally, experiments performed with replication-competent dengue and yellow fever viruses demonstrate that the depletion of class II Arfs inhibits virus secretion, thus confirming their implication in the virus life cycle, although data obtained with West Nile virus pointed out the differences in virus-host interactions among flaviviruses. Our findings shed new light on a molecular mechanism used by dengue viruses during the late stages of the life cycle and demonstrate a novel function for class II Arf proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2014438209,"Despite recent progress in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the prognosis of this rather heterogeneous disease remains poor and novel chemotherapeutics that specifically target leukemic cells must be developed. To address this need at the preclinical level, we implemented a high content imaging-based screen for the identification of small agents that induce AML cell death in vitro. Among a panel of 1040 Food and Drug Administration-approved agents, we identified pyrithione zinc (PZ) and ouabain (OUA) as potential antileukemic compounds. Both PZ and OUA efficiently induced cell death associated with apoptotic chromatin condensation and inhibition of nuclear factor-κB survival signaling, leading to reduced expression of antiapoptotic proteins, in several AML cell lines. PZ- and OUA-induced cell death was associated with the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and led to the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase activation. Both PZ and OUA exerted significant anticancer effects in vivo, on human AML cells xenografts as well as ex vivo, on CD34+ (but not CD34−) malignant myeloblasts from AML patients. Altogether, our results suggest that PZ and OUA may exhibit antileukemic effects by inducing the apoptotic demise of AML cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085521719,"MUC4 is a large transmembrane type I glycoprotein that is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer (PC) and has been shown to be associated with its progression and metastasis. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanism(s) through which MUC4 promotes metastasis of PC cells has been sparsely studied. Here we showed that the nidogen-like (NIDO) domain of MUC4, which is similar to the G1-domain present in the nidogen or entactin (an extracellular matrix protein), contributes to the protein–protein interaction property of MUC4. By this interaction, MUC4 promotes breaching of basement membrane (BM) integrity, and spreading of cancer cells. These observations are corroborated with the data from our study using an engineered MUC4 protein without the NIDO domain, which was ectopically expressed in the MiaPaCa PC cells, lacking endogenous MUC4 and nidogen protein. The in vitro studies demonstrated an enhanced invasiveness of MiaPaCa cells expressing MUC4 (MiaPaCa–MUC4) compared with vector-transfected cells (MiaPaCa–Vec; P=0.003) or cells expressing MUC4 without the NIDO domain (MiaPaCa–MUC4–NIDOΔ; P=0.03). However, the absence of NIDO-domain has no significant role on cell growth and motility (P=0.93). In the in vivo studies, all the mice orthotopically implanted with MiPaCa-MUC4 cells developed metastasis to the liver as compared with MiaPaCa–Vec or the MiaPaCa–MUC4–NIDOΔ group, hence, supporting our in vitro observations. Additionally, a reduced binding (P=0.0004) of MiaPaCa–MUC4–NIDOΔ cells to the fibulin-2 coated plates compared with MiaPaCa–MUC4 cells indicated a possible interaction between the MUC4–NIDO domain and fibulin-2, a nidogen-interacting protein. Furthermore, in PC tissue samples, MUC4 colocalized with the fibulin-2 present in the BM. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the MUC4–NIDO domain significantly contributes to the MUC4-mediated metastasis of PC cells. This may be partly due to the interaction between the MUC4–NIDO domain and fibulin-2."
https://openalex.org/W2114657082,"Recent event-related potential studies have shown that the occipitotemporal N170 component - best known for its sensitivity to faces - is also sensitive to perception of human bodies. Considering that in the timescale of evolution clothing is a relatively new invention that hides the bodily features relevant for sexual selection and arousal, we investigated whether the early N170 brain response would be enhanced to nude over clothed bodies. In two experiments, we measured N170 responses to nude bodies, bodies wearing swimsuits, clothed bodies, faces, and control stimuli (cars). We found that the N170 amplitude was larger to opposite and same-sex nude vs. clothed bodies. Moreover, the N170 amplitude increased linearly as the amount of clothing decreased from full clothing via swimsuits to nude bodies. Strikingly, the N170 response to nude bodies was even greater than that to faces, and the N170 amplitude to bodies was independent of whether the face of the bodies was visible or not. All human stimuli evoked greater N170 responses than did the control stimulus. Autonomic measurements and self-evaluations showed that nude bodies were affectively more arousing compared to the other stimulus categories. We conclude that the early visual processing of human bodies is sensitive to the visibility of the sex-related features of human bodies and that the visual processing of other people's nude bodies is enhanced in the brain. This enhancement is likely to reflect affective arousal elicited by nude bodies. Such facilitated visual processing of other people's nude bodies is possibly beneficial in identifying potential mating partners and competitors, and for triggering sexual behavior."

The initial kinetics of endo-glucanases (EGs) is far less investigated, partly due to a limited availability of quantitative assay technologies. We have used isothermal calorimetry to monitor the early time course of the hydrolysis of insoluble cellulose by the three main EGs from Trichoderma reesei (Tr): TrCel7B (formerly EG I), TrCel5A (EG II), and TrCel12A (EG III). These endo-glucanases show a distinctive initial burst with a maximal rate that is about 5-fold higher than the rate after 5 min of hydrolysis. The burst is particularly conspicuous for TrCel7B, which reaches a maximal turnover of about 20 s−1 at 30 °C and conducts about 1200 catalytic cycles per enzyme molecule in the initial fast phase. For TrCel5A and TrCel12A the extent of the burst is 2–300 cycles per enzyme molecule. The availability of continuous data on EG activity allows an analysis of the mechanisms underlying the initial kinetics, and it is suggested that the slowdown is linked to transient inactivation of enzyme on the cellulose surface.

Although previous studies show that the mitotic kinesin CENP-E forms a link between attachment of the spindle microtubule to the kinetochore and the mitotic checkpoint signaling cascade, the molecular mechanism underlying dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interactions in mammalian cells remains elusive. Here, we identify a novel interaction between CENP-E and SKAP that functions synergistically in governing dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interactions. SKAP binds to the C-terminal tail of CENP-E in vitro and is essential for an accurate kinetochore-microtubule attachment in vivo. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis indicates that SKAP is a constituent of the kinetochore corona fibers of mammalian centromeres. Depletion of SKAP or CENP-E by RNA interference results in a dramatic reduction of inter-kinetochore tension, which causes chromosome mis-segregation with a prolonged delay in achieving metaphase alignment.

Based on these findings, we propose that SKAP cooperates with CENP-E to orchestrate dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interaction for faithful chromosome segregation. The inheritance of genetic material depends on the consistent segregation of chromosomes in mitosis. The physical connection between the centromeres and spindle microtubules is orchestrated by the kinetochore, a protein supercomplex assembled onto the centromere (1Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Centromeres and kinetochores: from epigenetics to mitotic checkpoint signaling.Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The stochastic nature by which highly dynamic spindle microtubules attach to the chromosome requires that the centromere-kinetochore protein machine be able to capture microtubules and ensure the quality of the kinetochore-microtubule interaction (2Cheeseman I.M. Desai A. Molecular architecture of the kinetochore-microtubule interface.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Once all chromosomes achieved bipolar attachment and alignment at the equator of the spindle, the spindle assembly checkpoint was satisfied and resulted in subsequent equal segregation of parental genomes into two daughter cells (3Kops G.J.

Briefly, a CENP-E bait containing amino acids 2131–2701 was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGBKT7 individually to create a fusion with amino acids 1–147 of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The resultant pGBKT7/CENP-E C termini were transformed into strain AH109 along with the GAL4 reporter plasmid pCL and the negative control plasmid pGBKT7-Lam. Protein expression was validated by Western blotting using Gal4 and an anti-CENP-E antibody. Specificity of the interaction was independently verified by retransforming the candidate cDNAs back into AH109 along with BD-CENP-E(2131–2701). Those cDNAs that can form colonies grown from Leu−, Trp−, His−, Ade− SD plates were sequenced. From the candidate-positive clones, we selected SKAP to perform further analyses.

HeLa cells were grown to near-confluence on 150-mm2 culture flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO2; mitotic cells were selected by mitotic shake-off. Two hours after replating into 6-well plates with or without coverslips, cells (now in early G1) were transfected with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) premixed with various siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes as described previously (22Lou Y.

For immunofluorescence, cells synchronized by mitotic shake-off were seeded onto sterile, acid-treated 18-mm coverslips in 6-well plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY). Two hours after replating, synchronized HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg/ml Lipofectamine premixed with various oligonucleotides as described previously (6Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F.

Extracted cells were then fixed in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PHEM and rinsed three times in PBS. Coverslips were blocked with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS) with 1% BSA (Sigma). Cells were incubated with various primary antibodies in a humidified chamber for 1 h and then washed three times in TPBS. To visualize CENP-E and SKAP simultaneously, cells were incubated with mouse anti-SKAP antibody in a humidified chamber for 1 h and then washed three times in TPBS. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies bound to CENP-E were visualized using rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG), and binding of anti-SKAP antibody was visualized using fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma). Slides were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert-200 fluorescence microscope, and images were collected and analyzed with Image-5 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Deconvolution images were collected using a Deltavision wide field deconvolution microscope system built on an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope base. For imaging, a 100 × 1.35 NA lens was used, and optical sections were taken at intervals of 0.2 μm. Images for display were generated by projecting single optical sections as described previously (3Kops G.J. Dividing the goods: coordination of chromosome biorientation and mitotic checkpoint signaling by mitotic kinases.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The distance between sister kinetochores was measured using LSM-5 imaging (Carl Zeiss), ACA 4The abbreviation used is: ACAanti-centromere auto-antibody.-marked centromeres, and a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope as described previously (6Yao X.

Only sister kinetochores that were in the same focal plane were measured. anti-centromere auto-antibody. For immunoelectron microscopic assay, HeLa cells were seeded onto sterile, acid-treated 18-mm coverslips for 12 h, pre-extracted, and fixed using a common protocol (7Yao X. Anderson K.L.

The ultrastructural localization of SKAP was carried out as described previously (7Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W.

Thin serial sections (silver-gold) were then cut, placed on copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined by a JEOL 1200 EM (Peabody, MA). Transient transfection and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (6Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. CENP-E forms a link between attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores and the mitotic checkpoint.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with appropriate antibodies, and detected with the ECL system (22Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H. Hu J.

Microtubule assembly and measurement of polymeric tubulin concentrations were performed as described previously (24Evans L. Mitchison T. Kirschner M.

Mitotic phosphorylation of PRC1 at Thr-470 is required for PRC1 oligomerization and proper central spindle organization.Cell Res. 2007; 17: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For microtubule-binding reactions, purified recombinant GST-SKAP and MBP-CENP-E(2132–2701) proteins were incubated with various concentrations of taxol-stabilized microtubules at room temperature for 10 min followed by sedimentation for 10 min at 80,000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor at 25 °C. For visualization and quantification of SKAP, pellets and supernatants were solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis. Some gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried between sheets of cellulose for visualization and quantitative scanning. Others were transblotted to nitrocellulose and probed with SKAP antibodies. Cells were maintained at 35–37 °C using a heated stage. Images of cells expressing GFP-histone H2B and GFP-CENP-A were collected on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-70) and a 60×NA 1.4 PlanApo objective. 0.2-μm step sections were acquired using a 100×NA 1.3 U-PlanApo objective (Olympus) with 1 × 1 binning. Acquisition parameters, including exposure, focus, and illumination, were controlled by SoftWorks (Applied Precision). Z stack projection, subsequent analysis, and processing of images were performed using SoftWorks (Applied Precision). For analysis of microtubule attachments, images were deconvolved using the DeltaVision software (Applied Precision). Measurements of the intensity of kinetochore localization were conducted on nondeconvolved images. All images for a specific experiment used identical exposure settings and scaling. For live cell imaging, medium was replaced with CO2-independent medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) was covered with mineral oil with a 60×NA 1.40 PlanApo objective lens together with a filter wheel. Images were analyzed with DeltaVision deconvolution system (Applied Precision). All distance and fluorescence intensity measurements were made using MetaMorph software. Analysis of kinetochore movements was performed by measuring the distance from the center of sister kinetochores to a point on the spindle equator along the trajectory of chromosome movement. The bulk of metaphase-aligned chromosomes was used as a reference point for the spindle equator, which occasionally shifted during our analysis. Inter-kinetochore distances were measured using the centers of the paired CENP-A dots. Kinetochore fluorescence intensities were determined by measuring the integrated fluorescence intensity within a 7 × 7-pixel square positioned over a single kinetochore and subtracting the background intensity of a 7 × 7-pixel square positioned in a region of cytoplasm lacking kinetochores. Maximal projected images were used for these measurements. To determine significant differences between means, unpaired t tests assuming unequal variance were performed; differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. To study the molecular association of CENP-E with other kinetochore proteins, we carried out an affinity isolation of a CENP-E-containing protein complex followed by mass spectrometric identification of tryptic peptides derived from the complex as described previously (26Fang Z.

As shown in Fig. 1A, anti-CENP-E affinity beads coupled to an anti-CENP-E antibody isolated a major polypeptide of 330 kDa in addition to two visible bands of polypeptides with an approximate mass of 125 and 32 kDa, respectively. The 330-kDa polypeptide is CENP-E based on the analyses of mass spectrometry and Western blotting. Our mass spectrometric analyses identified the 125-kDa polypeptide as BubR1, a characterized mitotic kinase interacting with CENP-E in mitosis (6Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2091191080,"In vertebrates, skeletal muscle myofibers display different contractile and metabolic properties associated with different mitochondrial content and activity. We have previously identified a mitochondrial triiodothyronine receptor (p43) regulating mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial biogenesis. When overexpressed in skeletal muscle, it increases mitochondrial DNA content, stimulates mitochondrial respiration, and induces a shift in the metabolic and contractile features of muscle fibers toward a slower and more oxidative phenotype. Here we show that a p43 depletion in mice decreases mitochondrial DNA replication and respiratory chain activity in skeletal muscle in association with the induction of a more glycolytic muscle phenotype and a decrease of capillary density. In addition, p43-/- mice displayed a significant increase in muscle mass relative to control animals and had an improved ability to use lipids. Our findings establish that the p43 mitochondrial receptor strongly affects muscle mass and the metabolic and contractile features of myofibers and provides evidence that this receptor mediates, in part, the influence of thyroid hormone in skeletal muscle.—Pessemesse, L., Schlernitzauer, A., Sar, C., Levin, J., Grandemange, S., Seyer, P., Favier, F.

https://openalex.org/W2005092840,"Soluble oligomers of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) are emerging as the primary neurotoxic species in Alzheimer disease, however, whether the membrane is among their direct targets that mediate the downstream adverse effects remains elusive. Herein, we show that multiple soluble oligomeric Aβ preparations, including Aβ-derived diffusible ligand, protofibril, and zinc-induced Aβ oligomer, exhibit much weaker capability to insert into the membrane than Aβ monomer. Aβ monomers prefer incorporating into membrane rather than oligomerizing in solution, and such preference can be reversed by the aggregation-boosting factor, zinc ion. Further analyses indicate that the membrane-embedded oligomers of Aβ are derived from rapid assembly of inserted monomers but not due to the insertion of soluble Aβ oligomers. By comparing the behavior of a panel of Aβ truncation variants, we demonstrate that the intra- and extra-membrane oligomerization are mutually exclusive processes that proceed through distinct motif interplay, both of which require the action of amino acids 37-40/42 to overcome the auto-inhibitory interaction between amino acids 29-36 and the N-terminal portion albeit via different mechanisms. These results indicate that intra- and extra-membrane oligomerization of Aβ are competing processes and emphasize a critical regulation of membrane on the behavior of Aβ monomer and soluble oligomers, which may determine distinct neurotoxic mechanisms."

Recently, we and others reported that ectopic expression of Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) protein strongly inhibits retrovirus replication.

Here, we report critical determinants for MOV10 virion packaging and antiviral activity. MOV10 has 1,003 amino acids and seven helicase motifs. We found that MOV10 packaging requires the NC basic linker, and Gag binds to the N-terminal amino acids 261–305 region of MOV10. Our predicted MOV10 three-dimensional structure model indicates that the Gag binding region is located in a structurally exposed domain, which spans amino acids 93–305 and is Cys-His-rich. Simultaneous mutation of residues Cys-188, Cys-195, His-199, His-201, and His-202 in this domain significantly compromised MOV10 anti-HIV-1 activity. Notably, although MOV10-Gag interaction is required, it is not sufficient for MOV10 packaging, which also requires its C-terminal all but one of seven helicase motifs.

https://openalex.org/W2082125616,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most hazardous DNA lesions, may result in genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer cells. The main DSB repair pathways are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). In mammalian cells, NHEJ, which can lead to inaccurate repair, predominates. HR repair (HRR) is considered accurate and is restricted to S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Despite its importance, many aspects regarding HRR remain unknown. Here, we developed a novel inducible on/off switch cell system that enables, for the first time, to induce a DSB in a rapid and reversible manner in human cells. By limiting the duration of DSB induction, we found that non-persistent endonuclease-induced DSBs are rarely repaired by HR, whereas persistent DSBs result in the published HRR frequencies (non-significant HR frequency versus frequency of ∼10%, respectively). We demonstrate that these DSBs are repaired by an accurate repair mechanism, which is distinguished from HRR (most likely, error-free NHEJ). Notably, our data reveal that HRR frequencies of endonuclease-induced DSBs in human cells are >10-fold lower than what was previously estimated by prevailing methods, which resulted in recurrent DSB formation. Our findings suggest a role for HRR mainly in repairing challenging DSBs, in contrast to uncomplicated lesions that are frequently repaired by NHEJ. Preventing HR from repairing DSBs in the complex and repetitive human genome probably has an essential role in maintaining genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W1984776549,"Synaptic inputs received at dendrites are converted into digital outputs encoded by action potentials generated at the axon initial segment in most neurons. Here, we report that alternative splicing regulates polarized targeting of Kv3.1 voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels to adjust the input-output relationship. The spiking frequency of cultured hippocampal neurons correlated with the level of endogenous Kv3 channels. Expression of axonal Kv3.1b, the longer form of Kv3.1 splice variants, effectively converted slow-spiking young neurons to fast-spiking ones; this was not the case for Kv1.2 or Kv4.2 channel constructs. Despite having identical biophysical properties as Kv3.1b, dendritic Kv3.1a was significantly less effective at increasing the maximal firing frequency. This suggests a possible role of channel targeting in regulating spiking frequency. Mutagenesis studies suggest the electrostatic repulsion between the Kv3.1b N/C termini, created by its C-terminal splice domain, unmasks the Kv3.1b axonal targeting motif. Kv3.1b axonal targeting increased the maximal spiking frequency in response to prolonged depolarization. This finding was further supported by the results of local application of channel blockers and computer simulations. Taken together, our studies have demonstrated that alternative splicing controls neuronal firing rates by regulating the polarized targeting of Kv3.1 channels."

We investigated how cell wall components of Gram-positive bacteria contribute to the development of sepsis. Experimental observations derived from cultured primary macrophages and the cell line indicate that Gram-positive bacterial endotoxins induce hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) mRNA and protein expression. Inoculation of live or heat-inactivated Gram-positive bacteria with macrophages induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity in macrophages. Concordant with these results, myeloid deficiency of HIF-1α attenuated Gram-positive bacterial endotoxin-induced cellular motility and proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages.

Sepsis, the most feared complication of bacterial infection, is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Epidemiologic studies indicate that the incidence of sepsis has been increasing, perhaps because of numerous factors such as aging of the population, increased performance of complex procedures (e.g. organ transplantation), increased use of chemotherapy, and frequent use of indwelling lines and devices (1Martin G.S. Mannino D.M. Eaton S. Moss M. The epidemiology of sepsis in the United States from 1979 through 2000.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (4817) Google Scholar, 2Lever A. Mackenzie I. Sepsis. Definition, epidemiology, and diagnosis.BMJ. 2007; 335: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The most common causative agents for sepsis are Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Although much attention has focused on understanding how Gram-negative organisms induce sepsis, we note that over the past few decades the incidence of Gram-positive sepsis has increased (3Angus D.C.

Thus, a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing Gram-positive sepsis is required to combat this lethal disease. Akin to Gram-negative sepsis, where bacterial wall components such as LPS are causative, Gram-positive bacterial wall components such as teichoic acid (TA), 3The abbreviations used are: TAteichoic acidLTAlipoteichoic acidPGNpeptidoglycan(s)iNOSinductible nitric oxide synthaseHREhypoxic response elementKLFKrüppel-like factorm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionHIFhypoxia-inducible factor. lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and peptidoglycans (PGN) are thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis (6Opal S.M.

Biol. 2011; 6: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent reports have indicated that isolated PGN and LTA can induce most of the clinical manifestation of septic shock syndrome (10Kengatharan K.M. De Kimpe S. Robson C. Foster S.J. Thiemermann C. Mechanism of gram-positive shock.

Med. 1998; 188: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Several reports also support a cooperative effect of these agents on experimental disease. For example, De Kimpe et al. (11De Kimpe S.J. Kengatharan M. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. The cell wall components peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus act in synergy to cause shock and multiple organ failure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Similarly, studies by Kengatharan et al. (12Kengatharan M. De Kimpe S.J. Thiemermann C.

Recent mechanistic efforts have also begun to shed light on the cellular events that mediate the effects of Gram-positive bacterial wall products. For example, studies from Dunne et al. (13Dunne D.W. Resnick D. Greenberg J. Krieger M. Joiner K.A. The type I macrophage scavenger receptor binds to gram-positive bacteria and recognizes lipoteichoic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1863-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the type 1 macrophage scavenger receptor binds to LTA through polyanionic bonds. Studies by Schwandner et al. (14Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. Peptidoglycan- and lipoteichoic acid-induced cell activation is mediated by toll-like receptor 2.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) indicated that LTA induced cellular activation via Toll-like receptors (e.g. TLR2) and NF-κB activation. Consistent with these observations, in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that Gram-positive bacterial products can induce expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-6) and iNOS in myeloid cells that are key contributors to the sepsis syndrome. In keeping with these observations, studies using a human whole blood model indicated that lipoteichoic acid can induce expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (15Wang J.E. Jørgensen P.F. Almlöf M. Thiemermann C. Foster S.J. Aasen A.O. Solberg R. Peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus induce tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10 production in both T cells and monocytes in a human whole blood model.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3965-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that precise molecular mechanisms mediate the effects of Gram-positive bacterial endotoxins that contribute to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In addition to bacterial wall components, sites of infection are typically characterized by hypoxia. The importance of hypoxia has been highlighted by studies focused on the role of the master regulator of hypoxic signaling, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Studies by Johnson and co-workers (16Cramer T. Yamanishi Y. Clausen B.E. Förster I. Pawlinski R. Mackman N. Haase V.H. Jaenisch R. Corr M. Nizet V. Firestein G.S. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Johnson R.S.

HIF-1 is a heterodimeric helix-loop-helix transcription factor whose expression is stringently regulated at mRNA and protein levels. Protein stability of the α subunit of HIF-1 is regulated by a family of enzymes termed prolylhydroxylases, whose action directs HIF-1α degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in a process dependent on interaction with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein (19Semenza G.L. HIF-1, O(2), and the 3 PHDs. How animal cells signal hypoxia to the nucleus.Cell. 2001; 107: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, prolylhydroxylase activity is inhibited, and HIF-1α accumulates and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds the constitutively activated HIF-1β. The resultant heterodimer HIF-1 binds to the hypoxic response elements (HREs) of target genes (20Semenza G.L. Oxygen sensing, homeostasis, and disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In addition to hypoxia, lipopolysaccharide can potently induce HIF-1α transcription. Thus, the combination of bacterial products and hypoxia can, through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, augment HIF-1α levels (21Nizet V. Johnson R.S. Interdependence of hypoxic and innate immune responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are a subclass of the zinc finger family of DNA-binding transcription factors implicated in a broad spectrum of biological processes. Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) was initially identified by the Lingrel laboratory and termed lung Krüppel-like factor because of its high level in lung tissues (22Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Isolation of a gene encoding a functional zinc finger protein homologous to erythroid Krüppel-like factor. Identification of a new multigene family.Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the context of myeloid cell biology, our group identified KLF2 as a negative regulator of myeloid cell activation (23Das H. Kumar A. Lin Z. Patino W.D. Hwang P.M. Feinberg M.W. Majumder P.K. Jain M.K. Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) regulates proinflammatory activation of monocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). KLF2 overexpression was found to attenuate LPS-induced expression of cytokines and chemokines through inhibiting transcriptional activity of NF-κB and activator protein 1 (AP-1). More recently we found that myeloid KLF2 regulates the host response to polymicrobial infection and lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock (24Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kawanami D. Sharma N. Takami Y. Zhou G. Shi H. Nayak L. Jeyaraj D. Grealy R. White M. McManus R. Ryan T. Leahy P. Lin Z. Haldar S.M. Atkins G.B. Wong H.R. Lingrel J.B. Jain M.K. The myeloid transcription factor KLF2 regulates the host response to polymicrobial infection and endotoxic shock.Immunity. 2011; 34: 715-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, a role for this factor in Gram-positive infection and sepsis has not been elucidated. Herein, we identify HIF-1α as an important mediator of Gram-positive bacterial endotoxin-induced cellular functions and inflammatory gene expression. Further, we provide evidence that KLF2 modulate Gram-positive endotoxin-induced HIF-1α expression and myeloid cell response in vitro and in vivo. Lipopolysaccharide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Teichoic acid was obtained from GenWay Biotech, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Anti-HIF-1α antibody and anti-actin antibody were obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Transwell permeable supports with 8.0-μm pore size were obtained from Corning, Inc. (Lowell, MA). Escherichia coli (ATCC number 21149) and Staphylococcus aureus (strain Newman) bacterial strains were obtained from the ATCC. Lipoteichoic acid was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or extracted as described previously (25Behr T. Fischer W. Peter-Katalini J. Egge H. The structure of pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid.

The RAW264.7 cell line was purchased from the ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 ºC. Primary mouse macrophages and neutrophils were obtained from the peritoneal cavity by inducing peritonitis with 3% thioglycolate broth in 8- to 12-week-old mice as described previously (16Cramer T.

HIF-1α is essential for myeloid cell-mediated inflammation.Cell. 2003; 112: 645-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). These primary peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils were cultured in serum supplemented DMEM as described above. The mouse lines used in this study were generated as described previously (24Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kawanami D. Sharma N. Takami Y. Zhou G. Shi H. Nayak L. Jeyaraj D. Grealy R. White M. McManus R.

Briefly, a mouse line expressing lysozyme M promoter-driven Cre recombinase (LysMCre:Cre) was crossed to HIF-1α-floxed (HIF-1αFL/FL) mice to generate a myeloid-specific HIF-1α-deficient mouse line. Similarly, KLF2-floxed (KLF2FL/FL) mice were crossed with LysMCre:Cre mice to generate myeloid-specific KLF2-deficient mice. All mouse colonies were maintained in a clean animal facility, and all animal experimentation was approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice (8–12 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with a mixture of lipoteichoic acid (3 mg/kg) and peptidoglycan (1 mg/kg) or saline solution. Mice were monitored for 4 days following this injection and their rectal temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded. The shock index was calculated using the following formula: Shock index = heart rate/systolic blood pressure. Survival data were analyzed by the construction of Kaplan-Meier plots and use of the log-rank test. Total RNA was isolated from RAW 264.7 cells or mouse primary peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils following indicated treatment using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase in the presence of random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using Universal SYBR Green PCR Master Mix on an Applied Biosystems Step One plus Real-Time PCR system by applying gene-specific primers. A luciferase reporter plasmid driven by three tandem copies of the HRE sequence were transfected or cotransfected with KLF2 plasmids in RAW264.7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, these cells were exposed to live (5 m.o.i.) or heat-inactivated bacteria or bacterial endotoxins and luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Results are presented as relative luciferase activity over the control group. Primary mouse peritoneal macrophages or RAW264.7 cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer (Sigma) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche) following the indicated treatment. Equal quantities of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by the indicated antibody by immunoblotting assay. Mouse primary peritoneal macrophages from the indicated genotype or RAW264.7 cells infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-KLF2 were induced with teichoic acid or lipoteichoic acid for 4 h. A cell suspension containing 2 × 105 cells was added to the upper chamber of the transwell inserts. The lower chambers of the transwell plates were filled with DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. These transwell chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Following incubation, cells on the upper part of the wells were removed, and the migrated cells in the lower side of the filter were fixed and stained with Giemsa. The migrated cells on the filter were counted under an inverted microscope. To analyze macrophage-invasive properties, cells treated with teichoic acid or lipoteichoic acid were added to the upper wells of the transwell inserts coated with growth factor-reduced Martigel, and was performed as described previously (24Mahabeleshwar G.H.

Briefly, S. aureus bacteria were grown in logarithmic phase in Luria broth medium. These bacterial cultures were centrifuged to sediment actively proliferating bacteria. These bacterial pellets were washed in sterile ice-cold 1× PBS and diluted with DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA to the required concentration. These actively proliferating bacteria were added to the top of the monolayer macrophage culture for 2 h. These cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and incubated with antibiotic-containing media for 20 min to eliminate cell surface-associated bacteria. These macrophage cells were cultured for an additional 6 h and lysed with non-ionic detergent-containing buffer. These macrophage cell lysate-containing intracellular proliferating bacteria were serially diluted with sterile 1× PBS and spread on agar plates to enumerate bacterial colony-forming units. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. unless indicated otherwise. The statistical significance of differences between two groups was analyzed with Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Previous studies from our group (24Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kawanami D. Sharma N. Takami Y. Zhou G. Shi H. Nayak L. Jeyaraj D. Grealy R.

Pagé E.L. Soucy G.M. Richard D.E. Hypoxic gene activation by lipopolysaccharide in macrophages.

To determine whether a parallel effect occurred with Gram-positive wall components, we examined whether HIF-1α transcriptional activity is modulated by exposure of macrophages to Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus. We found that transcriptional activity of HIF-1 was significantly elevated in macrophages following exposure to live (5 m.o.i.) or heat-inactivated, Gram-positive bacteria under normoxic condition (Fig. 1A). Indeed, induction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity by Gram-positive bacteria was as strong as Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli). Intriguingly, individual endotoxin components of Gram-positive bacteria (TA and LTA) robustly induced HIF-1-dependent transcriptional activity in the macrophage cell line (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicated that Gram-positive bacteria and endotoxins derived from Gram-positive bacteria strongly activate HIF-1-dependent transcriptional activity in myeloid cells under normoxic condition. We next sought to determine whether the induction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity by Gram-positive bacteria and their endotoxins led to an equitable increase in HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression. Accordingly, wild-type mouse peritoneal macrophages were exposed to live (5 m.o.i.) or heat-inactivated E. coli or S. aureus and expression of HIF-1α mRNA and protein were analyzed by quantitative PCR and immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, both live and heat- inactivated S. aureus induced HIF-1α mRNA expression. Importantly, inoculation of live or heat-inactivated S. aureus with wild-type macrophages also robustly induced HIF-1α at the protein level (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that the heat-stable component of S. aureus induced HIF-1α expression at mRNA and protein levels in macrophages. Therefore, we next evaluated the individual endotoxin component of Gram-positive bacteria such as TA and LTA on expression of HIF-1α mRNA and protein in wild-type mouse peritoneal macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1, D and F, compared to control treatment, both TA and LTA induced HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression. Our previous experiments indicated that Gram-positive endotoxins induce HIF-1α at mRNA and protein levels. Next, we analyzed the kinetics of HIF-1α mRNA and protein induction by TA in wild-type mouse peritoneal macrophages. Teichoic acid induced HIF-1α mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A) up to 4 μg/ml. Interestingly, a higher dose (8–10 μg/ml) of TA did not alter HIF-1α expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the time-dependent HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression analysis indicated that TA (4 μg/ml) induced HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression as early as 6 h, an effect that was sustained for up to 24 h (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern of HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression was observed in wild-type mouse peritoneal macrophages in response to LTA (Fig. 2, C and D). Collectively, these results indicate that Gram-positive endotoxins such as TA and LTA induce HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The studies above identify HIF-1α as important in the response to Gram-positive infection. We next sought to examine whether Gram-positive bacterial products affected key myeloid cellular processes. Accordingly, mouse peritoneal macrophages derived from control (LysMCre/Cre) and HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice were stimulated with TA or LTA and subjected to a cell migration or invasion assay (Fig. 3, A and B). Although both agents robustly induced macrophage cell migration and invasion, this effect was significantly attenuated in HIF-1α-deficient macrophages. To further evaluate the functional consequences of HIF-1α activation by Gram-positive bacteria and TA/LTA, we performed an antibiotic protection assay to enumerate intracellular killing of S. aureus by control (LysMCre/Cre) macrophages compared with intracellular bacterial killing by those derived from the HIF-1α-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3C). Our results indicate that deficiency of HIF-1α significantly attenuates macrophage intracellular bacterial killing and results in a significantly higher number of colony-forming units in an antibiotic protection assay. We next sought to determine whether the altered cellular response to Gram-positive toxins in HIF-1α-deficient macrophages was due to diminished expression of HIF-1α target genes that modulate these cellular processes. Accordingly, control (LysMCre/Cre) and HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils were stimulated with TA or LTA, and expression of HIF-1α target genes that are involved in intracellular bacterial killing and cellular motility were analyzed (Fig. 3, D–H). Both TA and LTA robustly induced iNOS expression in control macrophages, an effect that was significantly attenuated in HIF-1α-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3D). This reduction in iNOS expression in HIF-1α-deficient macrophages corresponded with a decrease in macrophage intracellular bacterial killing ability. Further, TA and LTA treatment increased expression of COX-2, MMP-2, IL-1β, and IL-6 in macrophages and neutrophils derived from control mice; effects that were significantly diminished in HIF-1α-deficient myeloid cells (Fig. 3, E–H). Taken together, these results indicated that Gram-positive bacterial endotoxins mediate some of their key effects through activation of the HIF-1α signaling pathway. Previous work from our group and others has implicated KLF2 as a critical transcriptional regulator of myeloid cell activation and HIF-1α expression (23Das H. Kumar A. Lin Z. Patino W.D. Hwang P.M.

https://openalex.org/W2097690145,"The small GTPase H-Ras is a proto-oncogene that activates a variety of different pathways including the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. H-Ras is mutated in many human malignancies, and these mutations cause the protein to be constitutively active. Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes, 15 kDa (PEA-15) blocks ERK-dependent gene transcription and inhibits proliferation by sequestering ERK in the cytoplasm. We therefore investigated whether PEA-15 influences H-Ras-mediated transformation. We found that PEA-15 does not block H-Ras-activated proliferation when H-Ras is constitutively active. We show instead that in H-Ras-transformed mouse kidney epithelial cells, co-expression of PEA-15 resulted in enhanced soft agar colony growth and increased tumor growth in vivo. Overexpression of both H-Ras and PEA-15 resulted in accelerated G1/S cell cycle transition and increased activation of the ERK signaling pathway. PEA-15 mediated these effects through activation of its binding partner phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Inhibition of PLD1 or interference with PEA-15/PLD1 binding blocked PEA-15's ability to increase ERK activation. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which PEA-15 positively regulates Ras/ERK signaling and increases the proliferation of H-Ras-transformed epithelial cells through enhanced PLD1 expression and activation. Thus, our work provides a surprising mechanism by which PEA-15 augments H-Ras-driven transformation. These data reveal that PEA-15 not only suppresses ERK signaling and tumorigenesis but also alternatively enhances tumorigenesis in the context of active Ras."

In this study, we explored potential regulatory relationships between TIP60 and the c-Myb oncoprotein in hematopoietic cells. We first showed that TIP60 is a c-Myb interacting protein and that the interaction is dependent on the TIP60 acetyltransferase domain and c-Myb transactivation domain. We then found that coexpressing TIP60 decreases the transcriptional activation ability of c-Myb in functional reporter assays. A ChIP assay also revealed that TIP60 binds to the c-Myb target gene c-Myc promoter in a c-Myb-dependent manner. Consistently, knockdown of Tip60 expression by siRNA increased endogenous c-Myc expression. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation of Jurkat cell lysates revealed that c-Myb is associated with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, known to interact with TIP60 and repress transcription. Finally, we compared Tip60 expression in six primary AML samples with three normal CD34+ cell samples using quantitative RT-PCR. Tip60 expression was significantly (∼60%) lower in the AML samples. In summary, these studies demonstrate that TIP60 negatively modulates c-Myb transcriptional activity by recruiting histone deacetylases in human hematopoietic cells, leading us to hypothesize that TIP60 is a normal regulator of c-Myb function and that dysregulated or mutated TIP60 may contribute to c-Myb-driven leukemogenesis.

Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 16: 357-366Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). TIP60 plays diverse physiological roles in many processes. It forms stable nuclear complexes that promote histone acetylation in nucleosomes (3Murr R. Loizou J.I. Yang Y.G. Cuenin C. Li H. Wang Z.Q. Herceg Z.

TIP60 also interacts with the kinases ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-Pkcs) and participates in DNA damage responses (9Ikura T.

In addition, a recent large-scale RNAi screen revealed that TIP60 is required for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity (10Fazzio T.G. Huff J.T. Panning B.

The proto-oncogene c-Myb is the normal cellular homologue of v-Myb, the transforming oncogene of avian myeloblastosis (AMV) and avian leukemia virus E26 (12Klempnauer K.H. Gonda T.J. Bishop J.M.

Located on chromosome arm 6q in humans, the transcript of c-Myb encodes a transcription factor, c-Myb, which recognizes the consensus nucleotide sequence 5′-PyAAC(G/Py)G-3′ (13Biedenkapp H.

Viral myb oncogene encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity.Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). c-Myb plays a major role in regulating G1/S transition in cycling hematopoietic cells (14Gewirtz A.M.

G1/S transition in normal human T-lymphocytes requires the nuclear protein encoded by c-myb.Science. 1989; 245: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and functions as a transactivator of a number of important cellular genes such as mim-1, c-Myc, cdc2, Bcl-2, c-kit, Neuromedin U (NmU), CCNB1 (Cyclin B1), and GATA-3 (15Ramsay R.G. Gonda T.J. MYB function in normal and cancer cells.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). c-Myb has long been postulated to play an important role in leukemogenesis on the basis of studies which have shown that activation of c-Myb by truncation at either the carboxyl or amino terminus, or both can induce acute myeloid leukemias in avian species and mouse or B-cell lymphomas in chicken (16Nason-Burchenal K.

Aberrant expression of c-Myb has also been associated with human malignancies, including colon carcinoma and leukemia, in particular human acute T-cell leukemia (18Clappier E. Cuccuini W. Kalota A.

In addition, c-Myb is an essential factor for homeobox- and p210 BCR/ABL-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells (19Hess J.L. Bittner C.B. Zeisig D.T. Bach C. Fuchs U. Borkhardt A. Frampton J.

Further evidence that c-Myb is involved in tumorigenesis is found in its ability to drive MLL-associated leukemogenesis (21Jin S. Zhao H. Yi Y. Nakata Y. Kalota A.

In this study, we report that c-Myb activity is indeed subject to regulation by TIP60 and that this mechanism of regulation is likely of physiologic relevance for leukemia development.

The AML samples and CD34+ cells purified from healthy donors were obtained from the Stem Cell and Xenograft Core of the University of Pennsylvania. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). HL-60, K562, and Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine.

Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and complementary DNA synthesis was performed using the Superscripttm reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was carried out in an ABI 7900 HT sequence detection system using TaqMan master mix and the protocol of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All data were normalized using the endogenous GAPDH control. The primers for detection of the expression c-Myc, Tip60 were from Qiagen. The primers for GAPDH and c-Myb have been described previously (23Zhao H. Kalota A. Jin S. Gewirtz A.

Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with the addition of the protease inhibitors. 50 μg of extracts were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot analyses were revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences, Fairfield, CT). Antibodies used in this study were anti-FLAG (Sigma); anti-TIP60; anti-Actin; anti-Myc (9E10); anti-AcK (acetylated lysine); anti-HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 (Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-c-Myb (Millipore). ChIPs were performed with the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. ChIP DNA was detected using quantitative PCR or standard PCR and staining with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels with c-Myc promoter-specific primes that flanked the c-Myb binding site (forward, 5′-AAAAGGGGAAAGAGGACCTGG-3′; reverse, 5′CCTAAAAGGGGCAAGTGGAGAG-3′) or GAPDH promoter-specific primers as a control (forward, 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGAACAGGAGCAG AGAGCGA-3′). ChIP assays were also completed with anti-acetyl-histone H4 as a positive control and normal mouse or rabbit IgG as a negative control. K562 cells (2 × 107), Jurkat cells (2 × 107), or HEK293T cells (2 × 107) transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids (4 μg each) by using nucleofection or FuGENE 6 were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 800 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Total cell lysate (500 μg) was precleared with protein G-agarose beads and mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. c-Myb, FLAG-tagged, and Myc-tagged proteins were then immunoprecipitated using the anti-c-Myb anti-FLAG or anti-Myc mAb combined with the protein G-agarose beads. The agarose beads were then washed four times with the washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore), and the blots were probed with antibodies as indicated. HEK293T transfections and all luciferase assays were performed as described in (12Klempnauer K.H. Gonda T.J. Bishop J.M.

K562 (1 × 106) cells were transfected with 1 μg of either control siRNA (d-001210-01, Dharmacon), human TIP60 siRNA (sc-37966, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), human HDAC1 siRNA (sc-29343, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), human HDAC2 siRNA (sc-29345, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), human HDAC3 siRNA (sc-35538, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or siRNA for c-Myb targeting 5′-UAUCAGUUCGUCCAGGCAG-3′ with an Amaxa (Gaithersburg, MD) nucleofector. Acetylation assays were carried out according to the published method (24Gu W. Roeder R. Activation of p53 sequence-specific DNA binding by acetylation of the p53 C-terminal domain.Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). Reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris HCl, (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Na butyrate, [3H]acetyl coenzymeA or 500 nm acetyl CoA (GE Healthcare), in vitro translated FLAG-Tip60, or FLAG-c-Myb, or a combination of the two proteins (produced from 2 μg of plasmid for each by a standard in vitro translation reaction from Promega). The mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and analyzed on SDS/PAGE afterward. Acetylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. The expression of FLAG-TIP60 and FLAG-c-Myb were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. Myc-tagged p53 was used as the positive control substrate for acetylation by TIP60. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. The significance of differences between the groups compared was determined by Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.01 or 0.05 was considered statistically significant. TIP60 has been reported to associate with a growing number of transcription factors, modulating their transcriptional activities. To explore whether TIP60 can regulate c-Myb transcription activity, we first investigated the interaction between TIP60 and c-Myb. We cotransfected HEK293T cells with c-Myb and FLAG-tagged TIP60 (F-TIP60) or FLAG-TIP60m (F-TIP60m is a mutated form of TIP60 that lacks histone acetyltransferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.”). Immunoprecipitation of F-TIP60 followed by immunoblotting for c-Myb revealed an interaction between c-Myb and F-TIP60 (Fig. 1A). c-Myb did not interact with F-TIP60m (Fig. 1A) and was also absent in cells lacking F-TIP60. Furthermore, the endogenous c-Myb and TIP60 proteins interact in hematopoietic cell lines. Thus, endogenous TIP60 was present in immunoprecipitates of endogenous c-Myb from either K562 (data not shown) or Jurkat cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that these proteins interact at physiological levels of protein expression. Together, these results provide strong evidence of an interaction between TIP60 and c-Myb in hematopoietic cells. To address whether TIP60 interacts directly with c-Myb, both proteins were in vitro translated with or without a FLAG tag. The translated proteins were then combined in an in vitro binding assay. Under these conditions, c-Myb again coimmunoprecipitated with F-TIP60 but was not present in immunoprecipitates from the empty vector control sample (Fig. 1C), suggesting that TIP60 directly interacts with c-Myb. c-Myb comprises a DNA binding domain, a transcription activation domain, and a C-terminal negative regulatory domain. To determine which subdomain of c-Myb is responsible for the interaction with TIP60, we cotransfected a panel of c-Myb expression constructs together with TIP60 expression vectors in HEK293T cells. As summarized in Fig. 2A (Western blot analyses shown in B and C), deletion of the DNA binding domain or the negative regulatory domain has no effect on the ability of c-Myb to bind TIP60. In contrast, c-Myb fragments containing the transcription activation domain strongly interacted with TIP60, indicating that TIP60 interacts with the transcription activation domain within a region spanning residues 194 to 325. As mentioned above, mutations in the MYST domain within TIP60 disrupted the interaction between c-Myb and TIP60, suggesting that the MYST domain is necessary for its binding to c-Myb. This prompted us to test whether MYST is sufficient for the association. To this end, we used four additional FLAG-tagged truncations of TIP60, F-TIP60N (residues 1–258), which includes the chromodomain F-TIP60C (residues 259–513), F-TIP60M (residues 259–389), which spans the MYST domain, and F-TIP60C (residue 389–513). These constructs were cotransfected with c-Myb into HEK293T cells, and immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-FLAG antibody coupled to agarose beads. c-Myb coimmunoprecipitated when the MYST domain was present (Fig. 2E). This result further suggests that, although the chromodomain of TIP60 appears to be dispensable, the MYST domain of TIP60 is necessary and sufficient for the interaction between c-Myb and TIP60. Because TIP60 acetylates and regulates the function of non-histone transcription factors such as c-Myc and p53 (1Patel J.H. Du Y. Ard P.G. Phillips C. Carella B. Chen C.J. Rakowski C. Chatterjee C. Lieberman P.M. Lane W.S. Blobel G.A. McMahon S.B. The c-MYC oncoprotein is a substrate of the acetyltransferases hGCN5/PCAF and TIP60.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10826-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we tested whether TIP60 could acetylate c-Myb, a posttranslational event known to modulate c-Myb activity. F-c-Myb and F-TIP60 proteins were generated by in vitro translation (Fig. 3A, left panel) and the translated proteins were mixed for the acetylation reactions in the presence of [3H]-acetyl-CoA. As shown in Fig. 3A, bands corresponding to the size of radioactively labeled TIP60 proteins were apparent (lanes 4 and 7), but a corresponding acetylated band for c-Myb was not detected, indicating that c-Myb is not a substrate of TIP60 under these assay conditions. F-TIP60 was also self-acetylated (lanes 4 and 7). However, when assayed under these conditions, p53 was readily acetylated by TIP60 (Fig. 3B, lane 3). We also tested whether TIP60 could promote acetylation of c-Myb in vivo. The FLAG-c-Myb expressing construct was cotransfected with FLAG-TIP60 construct into K562 cells, and c-Myb and TIP60 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads. The acetylated proteins in the immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blot analyses with pan-anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Again, only acetylated TIP60 protein could be detected in this approach (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 7), further confirming that c-Myb is not a favorable substrate for the acetyltransferase TIP60 in vivo. In contrast, TIP60 enhanced the acetylation of p53 when both Tip60 and p53 were cotransfected into K562 cells (Fig. 3D, lane 2 and 3). We next examined the effect of TIP60 on the ability of c-Myb to activate transcription of known target genes. Using transient transfection and a dual luciferase assay we evaluated the effects of TIP60 on the transcriptional activation of the Myb-responsive mim-1 promoter in HEK293T cells. Coexpressing TIP60 with c-Myb decreased the ability of c-Myb to activate the mim-1-driven luciferase reporter by ∼60% compared with activation in the absence of TIP60 (Fig. 4), and the inhibition was dependent on the amount of TIP60, suggesting that TIP60 inhibits c-Myb activity in a dose-dependent manner. The physiologic significance of this observation was further explored. A ChIP assay revealed that both c-Myb and TIP60 bind to the c-Myc promoter, another known c-Myb target gene, in K562 cells (Fig. 5B). Previously, we established an inducible c-Myb dominant negative (MybDN) cell line (K562-MERT) through stable transfection of a conditionally active c-Myb DNA binding domain fused to the Drosophila engrailed transrepressor and a modified mouse estrogen receptor into K562 human leukemia cells. The MybDN remains inactive unless presented with a modified ligand for the estrogen receptor, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. As shown in Fig. 5C, inactivation of endogenous c-Myb in K562-MERT cells reduced the occupancy of TIP60 in the c-Myc promoter, suggesting that c-Myb recruits TIP60 to its preferred site in the c-Myc promoter. As expected, loss of c-Myb activity resulted in a reduction of histone H4 acetylation in c-Myc promoter (Fig. 5C) and a decrease in the level of c-Myc expression (D). Finally, we verified that TIP60 could regulate the expression of c-Myc by siRNA knockdown experiments. Using c-Myb, Tip60, and appropriate control siRNAs we achieved specific knockdowns of c-Myb and Tip60 (∼80–90%, and ∼70–80%, respectively). Consistent with prior reports, c-Myc expression decreased ∼60% when c-Myb was targeted, and modestly but significantly (p < 0.05) increased ∼50% when Tip60 was targeted (Fig. 5E), confirming that TIP60 negatively regulates c-Myc expression. Similar activation of c-Myc expression was observed with a lentiviral Tip60 shRNA (data not shown). In addition, the levels of histone H4 acetylation in the c-Myc promoter were induced upon loss of TIP60 (Fig. 5F). Taken together, our data suggest that TIP60 might be recruited by c-Myb to suppress the expression of c-Myb target genes.FIGURE 5TIP60 binds to the c-Myc promoter and negatively regulates c-Myc expression.

Coimmunoprecipitation of Jurkat cell or K562 cell lysates revealed that c-Myb associates with HDAC1 and HDAC2, but not HDAC4 and HDAC7 (Fig. 6A). To test whether the observed association of HDAC1/2 with c-Myb in cells is direct, pull-down assays were carried out to examine the interaction of in vitro translated HA-c-Myb and FLAG-HDAC1/2, but c-Myb could not be detected in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-HDAC1/2 (data not shown). To determine whether TIP60 could facilitate the interaction of c-Myb and HDAC2, a further coimmunoprecipitation binding assay using FLAG-tagged TIP60, HA-tagged c-Myb, and Myc tagged HDAC2 expressed in transfected HEK293T cells indicated that c-Myb easily coprecipitated with HDAC2 in the presence of TIP60 (Fig. 6B). To investigate whether TIP60 facilitates the binding of HDAC2 to the c-Myb target site in the c-Myc promoter, we performed ChIP assays using anti-c-Myb, anti-TIP60, and anti-HDAC2 antibodies upon knockdown Tip60 by siRNA in K562 cells. We found that loss of Tip60 had no effect on the expression of c-Myb and HDAC2 (Fig. 6C). However, it reduced the occupancy of HDAC2 in the c-Myc promoter (Fig. 6D), suggesting that TIP60 is required for the recruitment of HDAC2 to the c-Myb target site. Last, we tested whether HDAC1/2 knockdown affects c-Myc expression in K562 cells. Consistent with a previous report (25Senese S. Zaragoza K. Minardi S. Muradore I. Ronzoni S. Passafaro A. Bernard L.

To identify genes that mediate ErbB2-driven cell motility, we performed differential gene expression analysis of ErbB2-expressing migrating breast cancer cells vs mutant ErbB2-expressing non-migrating cells. Among the genes that were specifically induced in migrating cells were known transcriptional targets of ErbB2, such as matrix metalloproteinases, and novel ErbB2 targets. Contribution of selected candidate genes to ErbB2-driven cell motility was tested by small interfering RNA targeting. Knockdown of the soluble form of ST2 (sST2), also called interleukin-1 receptor-like 1, one of the most robustly induced genes, decreased ErbB2-induced cell motility in two different cell lines. In response to ErbB2 activation, sST2 protein expression and secretion were increased. Moreover, recombinant sST2 associated with the plasma membrane and sST2-blocking antibodies reduced ErbB2-induced motility. Interestingly, cells from metastatic breast tumors secreted higher levels of sST2 than primary tumor cells. Finally, sST2 was found at high levels in the serum of metastatic breast cancer patients. Our data suggest that sST2 contributes to breast cancer cell motility and that sST2 secretion is associated with metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1970638050,"The maintenance of T cell memory is critical for the development of rapid recall responses to pathogens, but may also have the undesired side effect of clonal expansion of T effector memory (T(EM)) cells in chronic autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms by which lineage differentiation of T cells is controlled have been investigated, but are not completely understood. Our previous work demonstrated a role of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 in effector T cell function in autoimmune disease. In the present study, we have identified a mechanism by which Kv1.3 regulates the conversion of T central memory cells (T(CM)) into T(EM). Using a lentiviral-dominant negative approach, we show that loss of function of Kv1.3 mediates reversion of T(EM) into T(CM), via a delay in cell cycle progression at the G2/M stage. The inhibition of Kv1.3 signaling caused an up-regulation of SMAD3 phosphorylation and induction of nuclear p21(cip1) with resulting suppression of Cdk1 and cyclin B1. These data highlight a novel role for Kv1.3 in T cell differentiation and memory responses, and provide further support for the therapeutic potential of Kv1.3 specific channel blockers in T(EM)-mediated autoimmune diseases."

Despite considerable effort, thus far there is no cure or treatment available for the disorder. Using the approach of tandem affinity purification we recently discovered that prothymosin-α (ProTα), a small highly acidic protein, interacts with mutant Htt (mHtt). This was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. Overexpression of ProTα remarkably reduced mHtt-induced cytotoxicity in both non-neuronal and neuronal cell models expressing N-terminal mHtt fragments, whereas knockdown of ProTα expression in the cells enhanced mHtt-caused cell death. Deletion of the central acidic domain of ProTα abolished not only its interaction with mHtt but also its protective effect on mHtt-caused cytotoxicity. Additionally, overexpression of ProTα inhibited caspase-3 activation but enhanced aggregation of mHtt. Furthermore, when added to cultured cells expressing mHtt, the purified recombinant ProTα protein not only entered the cells but it also significantly suppressed the mHtt-caused cytotoxicity. Taken together, these data suggest that ProTα might be a novel therapeutic target for treating HD and other polyglutamine expansion disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2137309994,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors control tumor progression as well as evasion from the toxic effects of chemotherapy. Accordingly, antibodies targeting the cognate receptors, such as EGFR/ErbB-1 and the co-receptor HER2/ErbB-2, are widely used to treat cancer patients, but agents that target the EGF-like growth factors are not available. To circumvent the existence of 11 distinct ErbB ligands, we constructed a soluble fusion protein (hereinafter: TRAP-Fc) comprising truncated extracellular domains of EGFR/ErbB-1 and ErbB-4. The recombinant TRAP-Fc retained high-affinity ligand binding to EGF-like growth factors and partially inhibited growth of a variety of cultured tumor cells. Consistently, TRAP-Fc displayed an inhibitory effect in xenograft models of human cancer, as well as synergy with chemotherapy. Additionally, TRAP-Fc inhibited invasive growth of mammary tumor cells and reduced their metastatic seeding in the lungs of animals. Taken together, the activities displayed by TRAP-Fc reinforce critical roles of EGF-like growth factors in tumor progression, and they warrant further tests of TRAP-Fc in preclinical models."

Here we used atomic force and confocal microscopy to examine the adhesive forces between IRBCs and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Initial contact of the cells generated a mean ± sd adhesion force of 167 ± 208 pN from the formation of single or multiple bonds with CD36. The strength of adhesion increased by 5- to 6-fold within minutes of contact through a signaling pathway initiated by CD36 ligation by live IRBCs, or polystyrene beads coated with anti-CD36 or PpMC-179, a recombinant peptide representing the minimal binding domain of the parasite ligand PfEMP1 to CD36. Engagement of CD36 led to localized phosphorylation of Src family kinases and the adaptor protein p130CAS, resulting in actin recruitment and CD36 clustering by 50-60% of adherent beads. Uninfected red blood cells or IgG-coated beads had no effect. Inhibition of the increase in adhesive strength by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 or gene silencing of p130CAS decreased adhesion by 39 ± 12 and 48 ± 20%, respectively, at 10 dyn/cm2 in a flow chamber assay. Modulation of adhesive strength at PfEMP1-CD36-actin cytoskeleton synapses could be a novel target for antiadhesive therapy.— Davis, S. P., Amrein, M., Gillrie, M. R., Lee, K., Muruve, D. A., Ho, M.

https://openalex.org/W2060237390,"Natural killer T (NKT) cells express a semi-invariant Vα14 T cell receptor (TCR) and recognize structurally diverse antigens presented by the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d that range from phosphoglycerolipids to α- and β-anomeric glycosphingolipids, as well as microbial α-glycosyl diacylglycerolipids. Recently developed antibodies that are specific for the complex of the prototypical invariant NKT (iNKT) cell antigen αGalCer (KRN7000) bound to mouse CD1d have become valuable tools in elucidating the mechanism of antigen loading and presentation. Here, we report the 3.1 Å resolution crystal structure of the Fab of one of these antibodies, L363, bound to mCD1d complexed with the αGalCer analog C20:2, revealing that L363 is an iNKT TCR-like antibody that binds CD1d-presented αGalCer in a manner similar to the TCR. The structure reveals that L363 depends on both the L and H chains for binding to the glycolipid-mCD1d complex, although only the L chain is involved in contacts with the glycolipid antigen. The H chain of L363 features residue Trp-104, which mimics the TCR CDR3α residue Leu-99, which is crucial for CD1d binding. We characterized the antigen-specificity of L363 toward several different glycolipids, demonstrating that whereas the TCR can induce structural changes in both antigen and CD1d to recognize disparate lipid antigens, the antibody L363 can only induce the F' roof formation in CD1d but fails to reorient the glycolipid headgroup necessary for binding. In summary, L363 is a powerful tool to study mechanism of iNKT cell activation for structural analogs of KRN7000, and our study can aid in the design of antibodies with altered antigen specificity."

In order to develop new Aβ-specific peptides for AD, a randomized 12-mer peptide library with Aβ1-10 as the target was used to identify peptides in the present study. After three rounds of selection, specific phages were screened, and their binding affinities to Aβ1-10 were found to be highly specific. Finally, a special peptide was synthesized according to the sequences of the selected phages. In addition, the effects of the special peptide on Aβ aggregation and Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo were assessed. The results show that the special peptide not only inhibited the aggregation of Aβ into plaques, but it also alleviated Aβ-induced PC12 cell viability and apoptosis at appropriate concentrations as assessed by the cell counting kit-8 assay and propidium iodide staining. Moreover, the special peptide exhibited a protective effect against Aβ-induced learning and memory deficits in rats, as determined by the Morris water maze task. In conclusion, we selected a peptide that specifically binds Aβ1-10 and can modulate Aβ aggregation and Aβ-induced neuronal damage. This opens up possibilities for the development of a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD."

However, virtually no progress has been made in the exploration of the ligand binding sites for the N-terminal moiety of the peptide that is responsible for both ligand binding and receptor activation. Both GLP-1 and GIP have a random coil structure in the N-terminal portion where they share ∼70% amino acid sequence similarity. The random coil structure is followed by an α-helical region where the sequence similarity between GLP-1 and GIP is not pronounced. Like their peptide ligands, GLP1R and GIPR exhibit high degrees of amino acid sequence identity with similar molecular structure and signaling processes. However, GLP-1 does not bind to GIPR and vice versa (33Gallwitz B. Witt M. Morys-Wortmann C. Fölsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. GLP-1/GIP chimeric peptides define the structural requirements for specific ligand-receptor interaction of GLP-1.Regul. Pept. 1996; 63: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of distinct amino acid residues in the receptors that discriminate between GLP-1 and GIP. Thus, the use of chimeric GLP1R/GIPRs is an excellent strategy to explore the domain responsible for differential ligand affinity. In the present study, using chimeric and point-mutated GLP1R/GIPRs combined with chimeric GLP-1/GIP peptides, we attempted to identify amino acid residues in the core domain of GLP1R that confer ligand selectivity toward GLP-1. We found that Asn302 of ECL2 of GLP1R likely interacts with His1 of GLP-1 and that Ile196 of TMH2 and Leu232 and Met233 of ECL1 may form a binding pocket for interaction with Thr7 of GLP-1. Wild type GLP-1, GIP, and chimeric GIPs (cGIPs) were synthesized by AnyGen (Gwangju, Korea). All cGIPs possess a Ser residue at position 2 to protect from cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (34Hinke S.A. Kühn-Wache K. Hoffmann T. Pederson R.A. McIntosh C.H. Demuth H.U.

The rat GLP1R and human GIPR cloned into pcDNA3 were kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Thorens, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. The CRE-luc vector containing four copies of CRE (TGACGTCA) was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). For domain swapping between GLP1R and GIPR, individual cDNA fragments of interest were amplified through PCR using Pfu polymerase (ELPIS Biotech, Daejeon, Korea) and two specific primers, one corresponding to the 5′- or the 3′-end of the receptor cDNAs and another corresponding to the region of overlap between the two receptors. The two fragments, one from GLP1R and the other from GIPR, were subjected to a second round of PCR to generate the chimeric cDNAs. All the chimeric constructs were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector at the HindIII and XhoI sites. The single and double mutants were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and then cloned into pcDNA3 at the HindIII and XhoI sites. The DNA sequences of the chimeras and mutants were verified by automatic sequencing. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. For luciferase assays, cells were plated in 48-well plates 1 day before transfection and transfected with Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with the respective ligands for 6 h. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined using a luciferase assay system according to the standard methods for the Wallac 1420 VICTOR3 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GLP-1 and [H1,T7,E15,A18]cGIP were radioiodinated using the chloramine-T method and purified by chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.01 m acetic acid and 0.1% BSA. Cells were transfected with wild type or mutant receptor (300 ng of DNA/well in 12-well plates) with Effectene (Qiagen). Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with binding buffer (serum-free DMEM with 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) containing 100,000 cpm 125I-labeled ligand in the presence of various concentrations of cold ligand. Cells were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS twice. Radioactivity of cell lysate resolved in 1% SDS and 0.2 m NaOH was determined using the Wallac 1489 Wizard 3 γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A homology model for GLP1R and GLP-1 interaction was built on the basis of the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2RH1) of the human β2-adrenoreceptor (36Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M.

Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The sequence of GLP1R was manually aligned to the human β2-adrenoreceptor and other GPCRs with known structures based on transmembrane helices predicted by TMHMM Server v.2.0 (38Krogh A.

Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). During the homology modeling, a disulfide bond was forced between Cys226 and Cys296. Distance restraints were introduced between His1 of GLP-1 and Asn274 of GLP1R and between Thr7 of GLP-1 and Ile196, Lys197, and Met302 of GLP1R. All structural figures were prepared using PyMOL v1.4.1 (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Francisco, CA). Data analysis was performed using nonlinear regression with a sigmoid dose response. The agonist concentrations that induced half-maximal stimulation (EC50) or half-maximal inhibition of binding (IC50) were calculated using GraphPad PRISM4 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Group means were compared using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. To determine specific core regions of GLP1R and GIPR responsible for molecular interaction with their ligands, a series of GIPR/GLP1R (GI/L) chimeric receptors were constructed (Fig. 1A and Table 2). The reciprocal GLP1R/GIPR (GL/I) chimeras were also constructed (Fig. 1B and Table 3). HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid containing the chimeric receptors and the CRE-luc vector. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of peptide ligand for 6 h, and luciferase activity was determined (35Moon M.J. Kim H.Y. Kim S.G. Park J. Choi D.S. Hwang J.I. Seong J.Y. Tyr1 and Ile7 of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) confer differential ligand selectivity toward GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors.Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Potencies of GLP-1 toward GI/L chimeric receptors were gradually decreased as the portion of GIPR was increased. Particularly, when the N-terminal ECD, TMH2, ECL1, and ECL2 were subsequently swapped with those of GIPR, the potency of GLP-1 was significantly decreased. Replacement of the region from the N terminus to ECL2 with that of GIPR (GI/L5) led to a loss of ability to respond to GLP-1 (Fig. 1A). This observation highly correlates with the finding that the chimeric GIPR having the N terminus to ECL2 of GLP1R (GL/I5) responded to GLP-1 with high affinity similar to that of wild type GLP1R (Fig. 1B). Together, these findings suggest that the particular regions of GLP1R including the N-terminal ECD, TMH2, ECL1, and ECL2 form a core domain necessary for retaining full activity of the receptor in response to ligand stimulation.TABLE 2Ligand sensitivities of GIPR/GLP1R chimeric receptorsTABLE 2Ligand sensitivities of GIPR/GLP1R chimeric receptorsTABLE 3Ligand sensitivities of GLP1R/GIPR chimeric receptorsTABLE 3Ligand sensitivities of GLP1R/GIPR chimeric receptors The GLP1R chimera with the N-terminal ECD of GIPR (GI/L1) gained an ability to respond to GIP. The GLP1R chimera having the N terminus to ECL1 of GIPR (GI/L3) was fully activated by GIP, behaving like wild type GIPR (Fig. 1A). In accordance with this result, the GIPR chimera with the N-terminal ECD of GLP1R (GL/I1) lost the ability to bind with GIP, indicating that the N-terminal ECD and ECL1 of GIPR are critical for binding with GIP (Fig. 1B). Previously, using cGIPs in which Tyr1, Ile7, Asp15, and/or His18 were replaced by His, Thr, Glu, and Ala, respectively (Table 1), we demonstrated that Tyr/His1 and Ile/Thr7 of GIP/GLP-1 peptides confer differential ligand selectivity toward GIPR and GLP1R (35Moon M.J. Kim H.Y. Kim S.G. Park J. Choi D.S. Hwang J.I. Seong J.Y. Tyr1 and Ile7 of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) confer differential ligand selectivity toward GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors.Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study, we applied these cGIPs to further determine the specific regions of GLP1R that potentially interact with Tyr/His1 and Ile/Thr7 of GIP/GLP-1 peptides (Fig. 2A). All cGIPs were able to activate the wild type GLP1R with lower potency than wild type GLP-1 but showed remarkably higher potency than wild type GIP (35Moon M.J. Kim H.Y. Kim S.G. Park J. Choi D.S. Hwang J.I. Seong J.Y. Tyr1 and Ile7 of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) confer differential ligand selectivity toward GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors.Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The potencies of all chimeric peptides toward GI/L1 were 20–100-fold higher than those toward the wild type GLP1R (Fig. 2). These increased potencies are likely due to a high affinity interaction between the GIPR ECD of this chimeric receptor and the C-terminal portion of the chimeric peptides. With regard to [H1,T7,E15,A18]cGIP and [H1,T7]cGIP, their increased potencies were gradually decreased as the GIPR portion of the chimeric receptors was increased. Compared with the potency of chimeric peptides toward GI/L1, there was a significant reduction in their potencies for GI/L2 that has TMH2 of GIPR, and a second significant decrease in potency was seen for GI/L5 containing ECL2 of GIPR (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, there was a tendency for decreased potencies for GI/L3 harboring ECL1 of GIPR. This observation suggests that His1 and Thr7 in the chimeric peptide may interact with the amino acid residues in TMH2, ECL1, and ECL2 of GLP1R. Interestingly, the potency of His1-containing [H1,E15,A18]cGIP was first decreased for GI/L5 (Fig. 2D), whereas the potency of Thr7-containing [T7,E15,A18]cGIP was decreased for GI/L2 (Fig. 2E). Thus, it is plausible that His1 of the peptide may bind with amino acid residues in ECL2 of GLP1R, and Thr7 may interact with amino acids in TMH2 of GLP1R. [E15,A18]cGIP exhibited a greatly increased potency toward GI/L1 compared with that toward the wild type GLP1R, and this potency was further increased as the portion of GIPR was increased in the chimeric receptors (Fig. 2F), behaving like wild type GIP. Thus, Glu15 and Ala18 residues of this peptide may marginally affect interaction of the ligand with the core region of GLP1R in good agreement with our previous study (35Moon M.J. Kim H.Y. Kim S.G. Park J. Choi D.S. Hwang J.I. Seong J.Y. Tyr1 and Ile7 of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) confer differential ligand selectivity toward GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors.Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further identify the specific amino acid residues of GLP1R conferring ligand binding and activation, the amino acid sequences of the regions comprising TMH2, ECL1, and ECL2 in several vertebrate GLP1Rs and human GIPR were analyzed. Amino acid sequence comparison of these regions revealed that Ile196 and Lys197 of TMH2, Leu232 and Met233 of ECL1, and Asn302 and Met303 of ECL2 in GLP1R are evolutionarily conserved across species but differ from the corresponding residues in GIPR. Other amino acid residues in these regions are conserved for both GLP1R and GIPR or highly variable across species (Fig. 3). Thus, the above mentioned residues are likely GLP1R-specific.

But PZA susceptibility test is challenging because PZA activity is optimal only in an acid environment that inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis. For current phenotypic methods, inconsistent results between different labs have been reported. Direct sequencing of pncA gene is being considered as an accurate predictor for PZA susceptibility, but this approach needs expensive sequencers and a mutation database to report the results. An in-vitro synthesized Pyrazinamidase (PZase) assay was developed based on PCR amplification of pncA gene and an in vitro wheat germ system to express the pncA gene into PZase. The activity of the synthesized PZase was used as an indicator for PZA susceptibility. Fifty-one clinical isolates were tested along with pncA sequencing and the BACTEC MGIT 960 methods. The in-vitro synthesized PZase assay was able to detect PZA susceptibility of M. tuberculosis within 24 h through observing the color difference either by a spectrometer or naked eyes. This method showed agreements of 100% (33/33) and 88% (14/16) with the pncA sequencing method, and agreements of 96% (27/28) and 65% (15/23) with the BACTEC MGIT 960 method, for susceptible and resistant strains, respectively. The novel in-vitro synthesized PZase assay has significant advantages over current methods, such as its fast speed, simplicity, no need for expensive equipment, and the potentials of being a direct test, predicting resistance level and easy reading results by naked eyes. After confirmation by more clinical tests, this method may provide a radical change to the current PZA susceptibility assays."
https://openalex.org/W2093605534,"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been used widely to induce gene silencing in cells. To predict the efficacy of an siRNA with respect to inhibition of its target mRNA, we developed a two layer system, siPRED, which is based on various characteristic methods in the first layer and fusion mechanisms in the second layer. Characteristic methods were constructed by support vector regression from three categories of characteristics, namely sequence, features, and rules. Fusion mechanisms considered combinations of characteristic methods in different categories and were implemented by support vector regression and neural networks to yield integrated methods. In siPRED, the prediction of siRNA efficacy through integrated methods was better than through any method that utilized only a single method. Moreover, the weighting of each characteristic method in the context of integrated methods was established by genetic algorithms so that the effect of each characteristic method could be revealed. Using a validation dataset, siPRED performed better than other predictive systems that used the scoring method, neural networks, or linear regression. Finally, siPRED can be improved to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.777 when the threshold of the whole stacking energy is ≥-34.6 kcal/mol. siPRED is freely available on the web at http://predictor.nchu.edu.tw/siPRED."
https://openalex.org/W1977796449,"Our previous work showed that in T98G cells, a human glioblastoma multiforme-derived cell line, the association of c-Fos to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consequently, the capacity of c-Fos to activate phospholipid synthesis, is regulated by the phosphorylation state of tyrosine (tyr) residues #10 and #30 of c-Fos. The small amount of c-Fos present in quiescent cells is tyr-phosphorylated, is dissociated from the ER membranes and does not activate phospholipid synthesis. However, on induction of the cell to re-enter growth, c-Fos expression is rapidly induced, it is found dephosphorylated, associated to ER membranes and activating phospholipid synthesis (Portal et al., 2007). Herein, using in vivo and in vitro experimental strategies, we show that the kinase c-Src is capable of phosphorylating tyr residues of c-Fos whereas the phosphatase TC45 T-cell protein-tyr phosphatase (TC-PTP) dephosphorylates them, thus enabling c-Fos/ER association and activation of phospholipid synthesis. Results also suggest that the regulation of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of c-Fos occurs at the TC-PTP level: induction of cells to re-enter growth promotes the translocation of TC45 from a nuclear to a cytoplasmic location concomitant with its activation. Activated TC45 in its turn promotes dephosphorylation of pre-formed c-Fos, enabling cells to rapidly activate phospholipid synthesis to respond to its growth demands."

The affinities of eight aminoacyl-tRNAs were differentially destabilized by the introduction of the H66A mutation into Escherichia coli EF-Tu, whereas Ala-tRNA(Ala) and Gly-tRNA(Gly) were unaffected. The H66F and H66W proteins each show a different pattern of binding of 10 different aminoacyl-tRNAs, clearly showing that this position is critical in establishing the specificity of EF-Tu for different esterified amino acids. However, the H66A mutation does not greatly affect the ability of the ternary complex to bind ribosomes, hydrolyze GTP, or form dipeptide, suggesting that this residue does not directly participate in ribosomal decoding. Selective mutation of His-66 may improve the ability of certain unnatural amino acids to be incorporated by the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2057868882,"Our recent studies have uncovered that aggregation-prone proinsulin preserves a low relative folding rate and maintains a homeostatic balance of natively and non-natively folded states (i.e., proinsulin homeostasis, PIHO) in β-cells as a result of the integration of maturation and disposal processes. Control of precursor maturation and disposal is thus an early regulative mechanism in the insulin production of β-cells. Herein, we show pathways involved in the disposal of endogenous proinsulin at the early secretory pathway. We conducted metabolic-labeling, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry studies to examine the effects of selective proteasome and lysosome or autophagy inhibitors on the kinetics of proinsulin and control proteins in various post-translational courses. Our metabolic-labeling studies found that the main lysosomal and ancillary proteasomal pathways participate in the heavy clearance of insulin precursor in mouse islets/β-cells cultured at the mimic physiological glucose concentrations. Further immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry studies in cloned β-cells validated that among secretory proteins, insulin precursor is heavily and preferentially removed. The rapid disposal of a large amount of insulin precursor after translation is achieved mainly through lysosomal autophagy and the subsequent basal disposals are carried out by both lysosomal and proteasomal pathways within a 30 to 60-minute post-translational process. The findings provide the first clear demonstration that lysosomal and proteasomal pathways both play roles in the normal maintenance of PIHO for insulin production, and defined the physiological participation of lysosomal autophagy in the protein quality control at the early secretory pathway of pancreatic β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2041596011,"Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4) is essential for B and T cell development and immune response regulation, and has both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions. IRF-4 was originally identified as a proto-oncogene resulting from a t(6;14) chromosomal translocation in multiple myeloma and its expression was shown to be essential for multiple myeloma cell survival. However, we have previously shown that IRF-4 functions as a tumor suppressor in the myeloid lineage and in early stages of B cell development. In this study, we found that IRF-4 suppresses BCR/ABL transformation of myeloid cells. To gain insight into the molecular pathways that mediate IRF-4 tumor suppressor function, we performed a structure-function analysis of IRF-4 as a suppressor of BCR/ABL transformation. We found that the DNA binding domain deletion mutant of IRF-4, which is localized only in the cytoplasm, is still able to inhibit BCR/ABL transformation of myeloid cells. IRF-4 also functions as a tumor suppressor in bone marrow cells deficient in MyD88, an IRF-4-interacting protein found in the cytoplasm. However, IRF-4 tumor suppressor activity is lost in IRF association domain (IAD) deletion mutants. These results demonstrate that IRF-4 suppresses BCR/ABL transformation by a novel cytoplasmic function involving its IAD domain."

Attachment of the GalA residues requires the lipid donor dodecaprenyl-phosphate GalA (Dod-P-GalA), which is synthesized by the GalA transferase RgtE reported here. The galacturonosyl transferases RgtA, -B, and -C utilize Dod-P-GalA to attach GalAs on the LPS core region, and RgtD attaches GalA to the lipid A 4' position. As reported here, the functions of the rgtD and rgtE genes were determined via insertion mutagenesis and structural characterization of the mutant lipid A. The rgtE(-) mutant lacked Dod-P-GalA as determined by mass spectrometry of total lipid extracts and the inability of rgtE(-) mutant membranes to provide the substrate for heterologously expressed RgtA activity. In addition, we created single mutations in each of the rgtA, -B, -C, -D, and -E genes to study the biological function of the GalA residues. The structures of the core oligosaccharide region from each of the rgt mutants were elucidated by glycosyl linkage analysis. Each mutant was assayed for its sensitivity to sodium deoxycholate and to the antimicrobial cationic peptide, polymyxin B (PmxB). The rgt mutants were more sensitive than the parent strain to deoxycholate by varying degrees.

https://openalex.org/W2036190342,"Synchrony among populations has been attributed to three major hypotheses: dispersal, the Moran effect, and trophic-level interactions. Unfortunately, simultaneous testing of these hypotheses demands complete and detailed data, which are scarce for ecological systems.Hudson's Bay Company data on mink and muskrat fur returns in Canada represent an excellent opportunity to test these hypotheses because of the detailed spatial and temporal data from this predator-prey system. Using structural equation modelling, support for each hypothesis was evaluated at two spatial scales: across Canada and dividing the country into three regions longitudinally. Our results showed that at both scales mink synchrony is a major factor determining muskrat synchrony, supporting the hypothesis of trophic-level interactions, but the influence of winter precipitation synchrony is also important in eastern Canada. Moreover, mink synchrony is influenced principally by winter precipitation synchrony at the level of all Canada (Moran effect), but by distance at regional level, which might suggest some influence of dispersal at this level.Our result is one of the few reports of synchrony mediated by trophic-level interactions, highlighting the importance of evaluation of scale effects in population synchrony studies."
