https://openalex.org/W4294001352,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Here, using whole-genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing of 2,754 childhood patients with ALL, we find that, despite a generally low mutation burden, ALL cases harbor a median of four putative somatic driver alterations per sample, with 376 putative driver genes identified varying in prevalence across ALL subtypes. Most samples harbor at least one rare gene alteration, including 70 putative cancer driver genes associated with ubiquitination, SUMOylation, noncoding transcripts and other functions. In hyperdiploid B-ALL, chromosomal gains are acquired early and synchronously before ultraviolet-induced mutation. By contrast, ultraviolet-induced mutations precede chromosomal gains in B-ALL cases with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21. We also demonstrate the prognostic significance of genetic alterations within subtypes. Intriguingly, DUX4- and KMT2A-rearranged subtypes separate into CEBPA/FLT3- or NFATC4-expressing subgroups with potential clinical implications. Together, these results deepen understanding of the ALL genomic landscape and associated outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4294051824,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unique insights into the pathology and cellular origin of disease. We introduce single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS), an approach that links scRNA-seq with polygenic disease risk at single-cell resolution, independent of annotated cell types. scDRS identifies cells exhibiting excess expression across disease-associated genes implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We applied scDRS to 74 diseases/traits and 1.3 million single-cell gene-expression profiles across 31 tissues/organs. Cell-type-level results broadly recapitulated known cell-type–disease associations. Individual-cell-level results identified subpopulations of disease-associated cells not captured by existing cell-type labels, including T cell subpopulations associated with inflammatory bowel disease, partially characterized by their effector-like states; neuron subpopulations associated with schizophrenia, partially characterized by their spatial locations; and hepatocyte subpopulations associated with triglyceride levels, partially characterized by their higher ploidy levels. Genes whose expression was correlated with the scDRS score across cells (reflecting coexpression with GWAS disease-associated genes) were strongly enriched for gold-standard drug target and Mendelian disease genes. scDRS associates individual cells in scRNA-seq with disease by scoring single-cell transcriptomes using GWAS gene signatures. Applied to 74 GWAS and 1.3 million single-cell profiles, scDRS identifies specific cellular subpopulations associated with these diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4294051554,"Pathways localizing proteins to their sites of action are essential for eukaryotic cell organization and function. Although mechanisms of protein targeting to many organelles have been defined, how proteins, such as metabolic enzymes, target from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cellular lipid droplets (LDs) is poorly understood. Here we identify two distinct pathways for ER-to-LD protein targeting: early targeting at LD formation sites during formation, and late targeting to mature LDs after their formation. Using systematic, unbiased approaches in Drosophila cells, we identified specific membrane-fusion machinery, including regulators, a tether and SNARE proteins, that are required for the late targeting pathway. Components of this fusion machinery localize to LD-ER interfaces and organize at ER exit sites. We identified multiple cargoes for early and late ER-to-LD targeting pathways. Our findings provide a model for how proteins target to LDs from the ER either during LD formation or by protein-catalysed formation of membrane bridges."
https://openalex.org/W4294051845,"The functions of many microbial communities exhibit remarkable stability despite fluctuations in the compositions of these communities. To date, a mechanistic understanding of this function–composition decoupling is lacking. Statistical mechanisms have been commonly hypothesized to explain such decoupling. Here, we proposed that dynamic mechanisms, mediated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also enable the independence of functions from the compositions of microbial communities. We combined theoretical analysis with numerical simulations to illustrate that HGT rates can determine the stability of gene abundance in microbial communities. We further validated these predictions using engineered microbial consortia of different complexities transferring one or more than a dozen clinically isolated plasmids, as well as through the reanalysis of data from the literature. Our results demonstrate a generalizable strategy to program the gene stability of microbial communities. Dynamic redundancy by horizontal gene transfer stabilizes gene abundances amidst compositional fluctuations in microbial communities, which suggests a means to program gene stability of complex microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W4294053497,"Tumour dependency on specific metabolic signals has been demonstrated and often guided numerous therapeutic approaches. We identify melanoma addiction to the mitochondrial protein glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), which functions in lysine metabolism and controls protein glutarylation. GCDH knockdown induced cell death programmes in melanoma cells, an activity blocked by inhibition of the upstream lysine catabolism enzyme DHTKD1. The transcription factor NRF2 mediates GCDH-dependent melanoma cell death programmes. Mechanistically, GCDH knockdown induces NRF2 glutarylation, increasing its stability and DNA binding activity, with a concomitant transcriptional upregulation of ATF4, ATF3, DDIT3 and CHAC1, resulting in cell death. In vivo, inducible inactivation of GCDH effectively inhibited melanoma tumour growth. Correspondingly, reduced GCDH expression correlated with improved survival of patients with melanoma. These findings identify melanoma cell addiction to GCDH, limiting apoptotic signalling by controlling NRF2 glutarylation. Inhibiting the GCDH pathway could thus represent a therapeutic approach to treat melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W4294295689,"Introduction Peer workers (those with lived/living experience of substance use) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives in British Columbia, Canada. The onset of the coronavirus disease pandemic has significantly compounded the impact of the overdose crisis. Peer workers are integral in supporting people who use substances. However, despite the important work they do, peer workers often lack formalized credibility and do not have the same resources available to them as service providers without lived experience. The peer-led project titled the Peer2Peer Project implemented several support programs for peer workers, including providing pulse oximeters to peer workers to supplement their overdose response procedures. Materials and methods This study was a component of a larger evaluation of the pulse oximeter program at two organizations in BC. The study aims to highlight the competencies of peer workers who use pulse oximeters. Telephone interviews were conducted with seven peer workers who were given pulse oximeters. The transcripts were thematically coded using Covert et al.’s framework of core competencies of community health workers to compare our sample with other widely recognized professions. Findings We found that peer workers who used pulse oximeters described several core competencies in their work and these were aligned with Covert et al.’s core competencies for community health workers, including assessment, community health practice, communication, diversity and inclusion, professional practice, and disease prevention and management. Conclusion By aligning peer workers’ skills to those of community health workers, we create awareness on the competencies of peer workers in using oximeters to supplement overdose response and advocate for them to receive more recognition and respect within the workplace. Further, our findings act as groundwork for future research in identifying the professional proficiencies of peer workers."
https://openalex.org/W4294219153,"Spermatogenesis is a highly coordinated process that initiates shortly after birth and continues throughout the lifespan of male animals. Foxo1 is a transcription factor and is involved in many biological processes. It has been reported that the inactivation of Foxo1 in gonocytes during the embryonic stage causes the defects of spermatogenesis. In the present study, we found that the inactivation of Foxo1 in spermatogonia after birth also caused germ cell loss and male infertility. We found that the initiation of meiosis was not affected; however, the germ cell development was arrested after meiosis and lack of mature spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis. We also found that the proliferation of Foxo1-deficient spermatogonia stem cells was significantly reduced under in vitro conditions. Further study revealed that inactivation of Pten in postnatal spermatogonia using Stra8-Cre did not affect germ cell development and the subcellular location of FOXO1 in Pten-deficient spermatogonia. This study demonstrated that Foxo1 was involved in the development of spermatogonia after birth and the function of Foxo1 was probably not regulated by PI3K/PTEN signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4294295700,"Background Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) pose a great global burden. The contribution of respiratory viruses to adult SARI is relatively understudied in Asia. We aimed to determine viral aetiology of adult SARI patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods The prevalence of 20 common (mainly viral) respiratory pathogens, and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and 5 bacterial select agents was investigated from May 2017 to October 2019 in 489 SARI adult patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, using molecular assays (Luminex NxTAG-RPP kit and qPCR assays). Viral metagenomics analysis was performed on 105 negative samples. Results Viral respiratory pathogens were detected by PCR in 279 cases (57.1%), including 10 (2.0%) additional detections by metagenomics analysis. The most detected viruses were rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV) (49.1%) and influenza virus (7.4%). Three melioidosis cases were detected but no SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or other bacterial select agents. Bacterial/viral co-detections and viral co-detections were found in 44 (9.0%) and 27 (5.5%) cases respectively, mostly involving RV/EV. Independent predictors of critical disease were male gender, chronic lung disease, lack of runny nose and positive blood culture with a significant bacterial pathogen. Asthma and sore throat were associated with increased risk of RV/EV detection, while among RV/EV cases, males and those with neurological disease were at increased risk of critical disease. Conclusions Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the high prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults with SARI was mainly attributed to RV/EV. Continued surveillance of respiratory virus trends contributes to effective diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4294295822,"Background Although COVID-19 vaccines hold the potential to dramatically alter the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy remains a serious threat to the management and control of COVID-19 infections. Vaccination of young adults plays a crucial role in achieving herd immunity. However, the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among the youth in China have not been fully explored. Our study aims to investigate the direct and indirect effects of perceived health literacy on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Methods This survey was conducted among Chinese college students during September and October, 2020. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was defined as the likelihood that participants would get a COVID-19 vaccine. A mediation analysis was employed to explore the direct and indirect effects of perceived health literacy on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Results A total of 2,587 college students were included in our study. The results of the survey revealed that the majority (80.40%) of the participants expressed high COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. After controlling for demographic characteristics, the relationship between perceived health literacy and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was mediated by positive attitudes toward general vaccination (std.β = 0.004, p = 0.037) and self-efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine (std.β = 0.053, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The findings suggest that interventions targeting health literacy to promote COVID-19 vaccination coverage might consider placing greater emphasis on enhancing the positive attitude towards and self-efficacy of vaccines among youth."
https://openalex.org/W4294295904,"This prospective study aims to establish reference ranges for vertebral heart score (VHS), vertebral left atrial size (VLAS), and radiographic left atrial dimension (RLAD) in pugs. The impact of clinical severity of Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS), gender, body condition score, and body weight on VHS, VLAS, and RLAD were investigated. Intra- and interobserver correlation was determined. Correlation of radiographic scores to echocardiographic left atrial dimension was inspected. Additionally, for VLAS and RLAD, correlation to VHS was examined. Additionally, an assessment of thoracic and vertebral malformations was performed. Forty-seven privately owned pugs underwent physical examination, echocardiography, and thoracic radiography to determine cardiac health. Thirty-two pugs were eligible for establishing reference ranges for VHS in right lateral radiographs, which was 11.25 ± 0.62 (95% range, 10.1–12.8). Reference ranges for VHS in left lateral, and for VLAS and RLAD in right lateral radiograph were determined in 30 pugs. The VHS in left lateral radiograph was 11.01 ± 0.70 (95% range, 9.4–12.6), VLAS was 1.96 ± 0.38 (95% range, 1.1–2.8), and RLAD was 1.59 ± 0.34 (95% range, 0.7–2.4). Clinical severity of BOAS did not show any impact on radiographic measurements. For VLAS, a significant correlation to VHS was detected by all observers. No other variables had a consistent influence on the radiographic scores given by all observers. Interobserver agreement was almost perfect for VHS (0.89 on right lateral and 0.91 on left lateral image), moderate for VLAS (0.49), and fair for RLAD (0.22). More than one third of the entire study population (18 of 47 pugs) showed at least one thoracic cavity or spine abnormality, often leading to considerable changes in vertebral body shape and size."
https://openalex.org/W4294295928,"During mammalian evolution, the Myodural Bridges (MDB) have been shown to be highly conserved anatomical structures. However, the putative physiological function of these structures remains unclear. The MDB functionally connects the suboccipital musculature to the cervical spinal dura mater, while passing through the posterior atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial interspaces. MDB transmits the tensile forces generated by the suboccipital muscles to the cervical dura mater. Moreover, head movements have been shown to be an important contributor to human CSF circulation. In the present study, a 16-week administration of a Myostatin-specific inhibitor, ACE-031, was injected into the suboccipital musculature of rats to establish an experimental animal model of hyperplasia of the suboccipital musculature. Using an optic fiber pressure measurement instrument, the present authors observed a significant increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) while utilizing the hyperplasia model. In contrast, surgically severing the MDB connections resulted in a significant decrease in intracranial pressure. Thus, these results indicated that muscular activation of the MDB may affect CSF circulation, suggesting a potential functional role of the MDB, and providing a new research perspective on CSF dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4294317015,"Global change driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions is altering ecosystems at unprecedented rates, especially coral reefs, whose symbiosis with algal symbionts is particularly vulnerable to increasing ocean temperatures and altered carbonate chemistry. Here, we assess the physiological responses of three Caribbean coral (animal host + algal symbiont) species from an inshore and offshore reef environment after exposure to simulated ocean warming (28, 31°C), acidification (300-3290 μatm), and the combination of stressors for 93 days. We used multidimensional analyses to assess how a variety of coral physiological parameters respond to ocean acidification and warming. Our results demonstrate reductions in coral health in Siderastrea siderea and Porites astreoides in response to projected ocean acidification, while future warming elicited severe declines in Pseudodiploria strigosa. Offshore S. siderea fragments exhibited higher physiological plasticity than inshore counterparts, suggesting that this offshore population was more susceptible to changing conditions. There were no plasticity differences in P. strigosa and P. astreoides between natal reef environments, however, temperature evoked stronger responses in both species. Interestingly, while each species exhibited unique physiological responses to ocean acidification and warming, when data from all three species are modelled together, convergent stress responses to these conditions are observed, highlighting the overall sensitivities of tropical corals to these stressors. Our results demonstrate that while ocean warming is a severe acute stressor that will have dire consequences for coral reefs globally, chronic exposure to acidification may also impact coral physiology to a greater extent in some species than previously assumed. Further, our study identifies S. siderea and P. astreoides as potential 'winners' on future Caribbean coral reefs due to their resilience under projected global change stressors, while P. strigosa will likely be a 'loser' due to their sensitivity to thermal stress events. Together, these species-specific responses to global change we observe will likely manifest in altered Caribbean reef assemblages in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4293718630,"The protostome leucokinin (LK) signaling system, including LK peptides and their G protein-coupled receptors, has been characterized in several species. Despite the progress, molecular mechanisms governing LK peptide-receptor interactions remain to be elucidated. Previously, we identified a precursor protein for Aplysia leucokinin-like peptides (ALKs) that contains the greatest number of amidated peptides among LK precursors in all species identified so far. Here, we identified the first ALK receptor from Aplysia, ALKR. We used cell-based IP1 activation assays to demonstrate that two ALK peptides with the most copies, ALK1 and ALK2, activated ALKR with high potencies. Other endogenous ALK-derived peptides bearing the FXXWX-amide motif also activated ALKR to various degrees. Our examination of cross-species activity of ALKs with the Anopheles LK receptor was consistent with a critical role for the FXXWX-amide motif in receptor activity. Furthermore, we showed, through alanine substitution of ALK1, the highly conserved phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), and C-terminal amidation were each essential for receptor activation. Finally, we used an artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction server (Robetta) and Autodock Vina to predict the ligand-bound conformation of ALKR. Our model predicted several interactions (i.e., hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and amide-pi stacking) between ALK peptides and ALKR, and several of our substitution and mutagenesis experiments were consistent with the predicted model. In conclusion, our results provide important information defining possible interactions between ALK peptides and their receptors. The workflow utilized here may be useful for studying other ligand-receptor interactions for a neuropeptide signaling system, particularly in protostomes."
https://openalex.org/W4294218890,"Immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized cancer treatment, but only a minor fraction of patients shows durable responses. A new approach to overcome this limitation is yet to be identified. Recently, we have shown that photobiomodulation (PBM) with near-infrared (NIR) light in the NIR-II window reduces oxidative stress and supports the proliferation of CD8+ T cells, suggesting that PBM with NIR-II light could augment anti-cancer immunity. Here, we report a novel approach to support tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells upon PBM with NIR-II laser with high tissue penetration depth. Brief treatments of a murine model of breast cancer with dual 1064 and 1270 nm lasers reduced the expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in CD8+ T cells in a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer. The direct effect of the NIR-II laser treatment on T cells was confirmed by the enhanced tumor growth delay by the adoptive transfer of laser-treated CD8+ T cells ex vivo against a model tumor antigen. We further demonstrated that specific NIR-II laser parameters augmented the effect of the immune checkpoint inhibitor on tumor growth. PBM with NIR-II light augments the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy by supporting CD8+ T cells. Unlike the current immunotherapy with risks of undesirable drug–drug interactions and severe adverse events, the laser is safe and low-cost. It can be broadly combined with other therapy without modification to achieve clinical significance. In addition, our study established a path to develop a novel laser-based therapy to treat cancer effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4294295610,"Birth month was an important risk factor for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation in infants. However, little is known about the role of birth month in RSV hospitalisation in finer age bands during infancy, which is relevant to strategies for RSV passive immunisations for infants. We aimed to understand the role of birth month in the burden of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) hospitalisation in finer age bands of the first year of life.In this retrospective study, we analysed the hospitalisation records during 2014-19 at the University Hospital of Split, Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia. We estimated all-cause and RSV associated ALRI hospitalisation rates among children under five years, with a focus on infants by finer age band and birth month.We included 1897 ALRI hospitalisations during the study period. Overall in children under five years, annual hospitalisation rate was 14.66/1000 (95% CI: 14.01-15.34) for all-cause ALRI, and was 7.56/1000 (95% CI: 6.83-8.34) for RSV-ALRI. RSV-ALRI hospitalisation rate was highest in infants aged 28 days-<3 months (61.15/1000, 95% CI: 52.91-70.31). Infants born in November, December and January (2-3 months before RSV peak) had the highest hospitalisation rates during infancy. Depending on the birth month of infants, the risk of RSV-ALRI hospitalisation peaked at different months of age; infants who were born in September had the highest RSV-ALRI hospitalisation rate at the age of 3-<6 months.Our study underlines the importance of birth month in planning RSV immunisation strategies for infants, and provides useful baseline data for effectiveness analysis of novel RSV prophylactic products."
https://openalex.org/W4294295664,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale, with research emerging to indicate that it negatively impacted the population's mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess whether the pandemic led to an increase in depression and anxiety across participants or whether a diathesis-stress model would be more appropriate. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intolerance at two baselines six months apart as well as during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic exactly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indicated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandemic-related distress. Pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity. These findings underscore the necessity of longitudinal designs and diathesis-stress models in the study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also emphasize that individuals with higher rates of baseline psychopathology are as particularly at risk for higher levels of distress in response to disaster-related stressors."
https://openalex.org/W4294295797,"Immediately after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Early 2020, most affected countries reacted with strict lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. Since that time, the measures were adapted on a short time basis according to certain numbers (i.e., number of infected, utilization of intensive care units). Implementing a long-term optimal strategy was not possible since a forecast when R&D will succeed in developing an effective vaccination was not available. Our paper closes this gap by assuming a stochastic arrival rate of the COVID-19 vaccine with the corresponding change in the optimal policy regarding the accompanying optimal lockdown measures. The first finding is that the lockdown should be intensified after the vaccine approval if the pace of the vaccination campaign is rather slow. Secondly, the anticipation of the vaccination arrival also leads to a stricter lockdown in the period without vaccination. For both findings, an intuitive explanation is offered."
https://openalex.org/W4294295888,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many aspects of our lives. Older adults, those with less income or fewer resources, and those living in rural parts of the United States are potentially more vulnerable. To understand the negative impact of COVID-19 on perceived food security, physical and mental health, and loneliness in a sample of older, rural, low-income adults in the United States, we use results from a mailed survey in which residents of four Indiana counties contrasted their status during the early period of the pandemic to their typical pre-pandemic status. We test for significant changes in status and what predicts negative impacts to food security, health, and loneliness. We asked respondents to report on both pre-pandemic and since-pandemic experiences in the instrument, which was administered after the pandemic had begun, in May 2020. We measure food security using the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (six-item short form; HFSSM), physical and mental health using the Centers for Disease Control’s Healthy Days Measures (HRQOL-4), and loneliness using the UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale. A binomial test identified significant declines in status for all three measures. Logistic regressions identified factors associated with each of the measures worsening. Fear of going to the store or food pantry was associated with all three measures. Decreased store hours and closed food pantries were associated with lower food security. More education, fewer years of age, being female, decreased income, and stockpiling were associated with more reported days of poor physical or mental health. Fewer years of age, lack of transportation, and eating less often with others were associated with perceived increased loneliness. The pandemic had a negative impact on respondents’ food security, unhealthy days, and loneliness, but different factors were associated with each measure for this population. Our findings provide insight for targeted recovery efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4294295675,"Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for vision. The key risk factor for the development and progression of this disease is increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Implantable glaucoma drainage devices have been developed to divert aqueous humor from the glaucomatous eye as a means of reducing IOP. The artificial drainage pathway created by these devices drives the fluid into a filtering bleb. The long-term success of filtration surgery is dictated by the proper functioning of the bleb and overlying Tenon's and conjunctival tissue. To better understand the influence of the health condition of these tissues on IOP, we have developed a mathematical model of fluid production in the eye, its removal from the anterior chamber by a particular glaucoma implant-the PRESERFLO® MicroShunt-, drainage into the bleb and absorption by the subconjunctival vasculature. The mathematical model was numerically solved by commercial FEM package COMSOL. Our numerical results of IOP for different postoperative conditions are consistent with the available evidence on IOP outcomes after the implantation of this device. To obtain insight into the adjustments in the implant's hydrodynamic resistance that are required for IOP control when hypotony or bleb scarring due to tissue fibrosis take place, we have simulated the flow through a microshunt with an adjustable lumen diameter. Our findings show that increasing the hydrodynamic resistance of the microshunt by reducing the lumen diameter, can effectively help to prevent hypotony. However, decreasing the hydrodynamic resistance of the implant will not sufficiently decrease the IOP to acceptable levels when the bleb is encapsulated due to tissue fibrosis. Therefore, to effectively reduce IOP, the adjustable glaucoma implant should be combined with a means of reducing fibrosis. The results reported herein may provide guidelines to support the design of future glaucoma implants with adjustable hydrodynamic resistances."
https://openalex.org/W4294295810,"Substance use among school-going adolescents increases the risk of developing mental disorders, addiction, and substance use disorders. These may lead to poor academic performance and reduced productivity, which affects adolescent lives. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of substance use and associated factors among secondary school adolescents in the Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania.The study used secondary data from a cross-sectional survey of adolescents aged 10-19 years from public secondary schools in the Kilimanjaro Region, northern Tanzania. Substance use was measured using the Global School Health Survey (GSHS) questionnaire. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages, while numerical variables used mean and standard deviation. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to obtain odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to determine risk factors associated with lifetime and current (within the past 30 days preceding the survey) substance use.The lifetime and current prevalence of substance use among 3224 adolescents was 19.7% and 12.8%, respectively, while alcohol and cigarettes were commonly used. Female adolescents had lower odds of current substance use (OR = 0.63, 95%CI 0.50-0.80). Higher odds of current substance use were among adolescents who have ever had sex (OR = 4.31, 95%CI 3.25-5.71), ever engaged in a physical fight (OR = 2.19, 95%CI 1.73-2.78), ever been bullied (OR = 1.55, 95%CI 1.16-2.05), always seen alcohol advertisements (OR = 1.87, 95%CI 1.37-2.53), and adolescents whose parent/guardians rarely understood their problems (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.03-1.85). Adolescents whose classmates always showed social support had lower odds of current substance use (AOR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.53-0.97). Similar factors were associated with lifetime substance users.The study reflects a high prevalence of substance use among adolescents in the Kilimanjaro region. Alcohol and cigarette are the most prevalent substances used. Regulatory measures are essential to limit alcohol advertisements that are media portrayed. Efforts are needed to reduce risk behaviors, such as physical violence and bullying, through peer support groups/clubs in school environments."
https://openalex.org/W4294295890,"Forcibly displaced individuals typically encounter daily stressors, which can negatively impact mental health above and beyond direct exposure to war-related violence, trauma and loss. Understanding the perspectives of war affected communities regarding daily stressors can enhance the integration of mental health into local primary care. The aim of the current study was to explore how daily stressors are conceptualized in a post-conflict setting. Data collection was completed with 53 adult participants who were recruited from primary healthcare clinics in Northern Province, Sri Lanka. Individual interviews were conducted in Tamil, audio-recorded, translated from Tamil to English, and transcribed. Themes emerging from the data were organized into an analytical framework based on iterative coding and grounded in the daily stressors framework. Stressors were conceptualized as chronic stressors and systemic stressors. Findings indicate that chronic stressors, such as loss of property, permeate daily life and have a profound impact on psychological wellbeing. Interviewees additionally reported that systemic stressors stemmed from unresolved grief for missing family members and limited support from institutions. The results of the current study complement existing literature, suggesting the value of multipronged approaches which identify and address symptoms of complicated bereavement while simultaneously alleviating financial hardship. An understanding of stressors experienced by conflict-affected populations in times of chronic adversity can be informative for the design and implementation of culturally-tailored interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4294316880,"Participatory research (PR) is on the rise. In Spain, PR is scarce in the field of health, although there is an increasing interest in the matter. A comprehensive understanding of the meanings and practical implications of ""public participation"" is essential to promote participation in health research. The aim of the study is to explore the discursive positions on PR among individuals with experience in participatory processes in different areas and how this understanding translates into practice. We conducted a critical discourse analysis of 21 individuals with experience in PR and participatory processes (13 women, 8 men), mainly from the field of health and other areas of knowledge. Sixteen were Spanish and the rest were from the United Kingdom (3), United States (1), and Canada (1). Interviews were conducted in person or by telephone. The fieldwork was conducted between March 2019 and November 2019. The dominant discourses on public participation are situated along two axes situated on a continuum: the purpose of public participation and how power should be distributed in public participation processes. The first is instrumental public participation, which sees participatory research as a tool to improve research results and focuses on institutional interests and power-decision making is hold by researchers and institutions. The second, is transformative public participation, with a focus on social change and an equitable sharing of decision-making power between the public and researchers. All discursive positions stated that they do not carry out specific strategies to include the most socially disadvantaged individuals or groups. A shift in the scientific approach about knowledge, along with time and resources, are required to move towards a more balanced power distribution in the processes involving the public."

This study was undertaken to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Inf-V infections in a sample of hospitalized children with ARI. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 500 children between 1 month to 5 years old with symptoms of ARI were collected at the Teaching Hospital Kegalle Sri Lanka From May 2016 to June 2018, NPAs were tested for influenza A (Inf-A) and B (Inf-B) viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) 1-3 using an immunofluorescence assay. The Inf-V were then subtyped using a multiplex RT-PCR. Inf-V were detected in 10.75% (54/502) of the hospitalized children with ARI and in that 5.57% (28/502) were positive for Inf-A and 5.17% (26/502) were positive for Inf-B. Of the 54 Inf-V positive children, 33 were aged between 6 and 20 months. Of the 28 children infected with Inf-A, 15 had uncharacterized lower respiratory infection, 7 had bronchopneumonia and 6 had bronchiolitis. Of the 26 children infected with Inf-B, 11 had uncharacterized lower respiratory infection, 10 had bronchiolitis, and 4 had bronchopneumonia. Inf-B circulated throughout the year with a few peaks, one in June and then in August followed by November to December in 2016 and one in April 2017 and January 2018. Inf-A circulated throughout the year with a major peak in March to April 2017 and July 2018. ARI was more common in boys compared to girls. Majority of the children infected with Inf-V were diagnosed with uncharacterized lower respiratory infection and mild to moderate bronchiolitis. Inf-V infections were prevalent throughout the year in the study area of Sri Lanka with variations in the type of the circulating virus."
https://openalex.org/W4294316941,"We evaluated the prognostic significance of malnutrition in patients with metastatic cervical cancer. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the cases of 43 patients with stage IVB (FIGO2018) cervical cancer treated at our institute from December 2004 to December 2017. We determined the correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and survival by performing univariate and multivariate analyses. The serum albumin value at diagnosis was used as an index of malnutrition. The median follow-up period was 16.4 months (range, 0.9–91.4 months). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates for all patients were 61.6% and 48.6%, respectively. The optimal serum albumin for predicting 1-year survival was 3.3 g/dL, as determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve to maximize the area under the curve. The OS of the patients with albumin &gt;3.3 g/dL (n = 28) was significantly better than that of the patients with albumin ≤3.3 g/dL (n = 15) (p = 0.004). The univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that pretreatment serum albumin and mode of primary treatment were significantly associated with survival in patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. Hypoalbuminemia was an unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with metastatic cervical cancer."

https://openalex.org/W4294266435,"Humans are predisposed to forming ""first impressions"" about the people we encounter including impressions about their personality traits. While the relationship between personality and strategic decision-making has been widely explored, we examine the role of personality impressions in predicting strategic behaviour and devising behavioural responses. In a laboratory setting, after only 4-minutes of ""small talk"", subjects developed a sense of the personality of their partners, particularly extraversion, which consequently changed their behaviour in future interactions. Subjects cooperated more in public goods games when they believed their partner to be extraverted and found it more difficult to out-guess opponents they perceived as similar to themselves in a level-k reasoning task, having engaged in conversation with them. We trace how language can generate these effects using text analysis, showing that talking more makes individuals appear extraverted and pro-social which in turn engenders pro-social behaviour in others."
https://openalex.org/W4294295646,"To evaluate disparities in the frequency of scientific activity between medical doctors and nurses in Peru.We carried out a secondary data analysis of the National Health Services Users' Satisfaction Survey (ENSUSALUD), 2016. This nationally representative survey evaluates doctors and nurses working in clinical settings. We defined scientific activity as i) having published an original article (journal indexed in Web of Science, Scopus or Medline); and ii) having authored an abstract in a national or international conference. We estimated crude and adjusted disparities prevalence ratios (aDPR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).We included 2025 doctors and 2877 nurses in the analysis; 71% of doctors doctor were male, and 93% of nurses were female (p<0.001). Among doctors, 13.9% had published an article, and 8.4% presented an abstract at a conference in the last two years, while these proportions were 0.6% and 2.5% for nurses, respectively. The adjusted models showed that doctors, when compared to nurses, were approximately 27 times likely to have published a paper (aDPR = 27.86; 95% CI 10.46 to 74.19) and twice as likely to have authored a conference abstract (aDPR = 2.51; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.53).There are important disparities in scientific activity between doctors and nurses working in clinical settings in Peru. Disparities are more significant for article publication than for authoring in conference abstracts. We suggest public policies that promote research dissemination between health professionals, with emphasis on nurses."
https://openalex.org/W4294295672,"The paranasal sinuses are hollowed, air-filled cavities surrounding the nasal cavity. Many pathological processes affect the sinuses, but inflammatory conditions are the commonest, even in asymptomatic patients who undergo head imaging for other indications showing one or more abnormalities of the sinuses. Our research aims to determine the prevalence of incidental paranasal sinuses abnormalities seen among patients who undergo head CT scanning. In addition, it provides baseline information for further investigations required. The study was designed to evaluate all patients who underwent head CT scanning for any reason unrelated to paranasal sinuses abnormalities. 1849 cases were selected and retrospectively analyzed from the elective and emergency CT in the last nine months, from August 2020 to April 2021. In order to meet the inclusion criteria, indications for imaging must not be sinus-related. The study was conducted on 1849 cases who had undergone head CT scans for pathology, 1204 (65%) were male and 645 (35%) were female. Abnormalities of the sinuses were found in about 617 (33%) of all patients, with a higher rate in males (22.23%) than females (11.14%). In addition, these abnormalities were found in younger patients at a higher rate than in middle and old ages 19.74%, 7.19%, and 6.44%, respectively. Our findings revealed that the prevalence of paranasal sinuses abnormalities in asymptomatic Saudi patients was high (33%). Most of the affected sinuses were the maxillary.

https://openalex.org/W4294295686,"We perform an event study analysis that quantifies the market reaction to clinical trial result announcements for 13,807 trials from 2000 to 2020, one of the largest event studies of clinical trials to date. We first determine the specific dates in the clinical trial process on which the greatest impact on the stock prices of their sponsor companies occur. We then analyze the relationship between the abnormal returns observed on these dates due to the clinical trial outcome and the properties of the trial, such as its phase, target accrual, design category, and disease and sponsor company type (biotechnology or pharmaceutical). We find that the classification of a company as ""early biotechnology"" or ""big pharmaceutical"" had the most impact on abnormal returns, followed by properties such as disease, outcome, the phase of the clinical trial, and target accrual. We also find that these properties and classifications by themselves were insufficient to explain the variation in excess returns observed due to clinical trial outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4294295701,"Governments can use social media platforms such as Twitter to disseminate health information to the public, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic [Pershad (2018)]. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of Canadian government and public health officials’ use of Twitter as a dissemination platform during the pandemic and to explore the public’s engagement with and sentiment towards these messages. We examined the account data of 93 Canadian public health and government officials during the first wave of the pandemic in Canada (December 31, 2019 August 31, 2020). Our objectives were to: 1) determine the engagement rates of the public with Canadian federal and provincial/territorial governments and public health officials’ Twitter posts; 2) conduct a hashtag trend analysis to explore the Canadian public’s discourse related to the pandemic during this period; 3) provide insights on the public’s reaction to Canadian authorities’ tweets through sentiment analysis. To address these objectives, we extracted Twitter posts, replies, and associated metadata available during the study period in both English and French. Our results show that the public demonstrated increased engagement with federal officials’ Twitter accounts as compared to provincial/territorial accounts. For the hashtag trends analysis of the public discourse during the first wave of the pandemic, we observed a topic shift in the Canadian public discourse over time between the period prior to the first wave and the first wave of the pandemic. Additionally, we identified 11 sentiments expressed by the public when reacting to Canadian authorities’ tweets. This study illustrates the potential to leverage social media to understand public discourse during a pandemic. We suggest that routine analyses of such data by governments can provide governments and public health officials with real-time data on public sentiments during a public health emergency. These data can be used to better disseminate key messages to the public."
https://openalex.org/W4294295829,"Introduction Part of the patients infected by COVID-19 have at least one lasting sequel of the disease and may be framed in the concept of long Covid. These sequelae can compromise the quality of life, increase dependence on other people for personal care, impair the performance of activities of daily living, thus compromising work activities and harming the health of the worker. This protocol aims to critically synthesize the scientific evidence on the effects of Covid-19 among workers and its impact on their health status and professional life. Method Searches will be performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library Central, Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS and Epistemonikos. Included studies will be those that report the prevalence of long-term signs and symptoms in workers and/or the impact on their health status and work performance, which may be associated with Covid-19 infection. Data extraction will be conducted by 3 reviewers independently. For data synthesis, a results report will be carried out, based on the main outcome of this study. Discussion This review will provide evidence to support health surveillance to help decision makers (i.e. healthcare providers, stakeholders and governments) regarding long-term Covid.

https://openalex.org/W4294295843,"Fiber intake may be associated with lower risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) but data from metabolically unhealthy African American women is sparse. We examined the association of dietary fiber intake and MetS among postmenopausal African American women with obesity. Baseline cross-sectional data from the Focused Intervention on Exercise to Reduce CancEr (FIERCE) trial of 213 women (mean age 58.3 years) were used. Dietary intake was assessed by Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs). Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were performed to estimate associations of MetS with fiber intake and adherence to dietary fiber intake guidelines, respectively. Mean daily fiber intake was (10.33 g/1000kcal) in women with impaired metabolic health. We observed an inverse association of total fiber intake with MetS. One unit increase in energy-adjusted fiber intake was associated with a 0.10 unit decrease in the MetS z-score (p = 0.02). Similar results were obtained for both soluble and insoluble fiber. In multivariate-adjusted analyses, participants not adherent to fiber intake recommendations were more likely to have MetS as compared to those reporting intakes in the recommended range (adjusted odds ratio 4.24, 95% CI: 1.75, 10.30). Of the MetS components, high fasting glucose and high triglycerides were all associated with lower intake of fiber. Study participants who consumed a higher amount of fiber had a better overall metabolic profile and were less likely to have MetS in our cross-sectional analysis of postmenopausal African American women with obesity and unhealthy metabolic profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4294316891,"Melatonin has been proved to have positive effects on cellular damage and metabolic regulation. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of melatonin supplementation during an intensive training period on physical performance decline, oxidative stress and cellular damage state. The investigation was conducted on 20 soccer players who participated in an exhaustive six-day training schedule associated with daily 5 mg oral melatonin or placebo ingestion. Resting blood samples and physical performance were measured before and after the training period. The mixed 2-way ANOVA (group x training camp) showed that compared to placebo, melatonin intake prevented an increase in advanced oxidation protein products (p&gt;0.05) and increased the antioxidant enzyme activity (i.e., superoxide dismutase; p&lt;0.001). In addition, melatonin prevented an increase of biomarkers of renal function (e.g., creatinine; p&gt;0.05) and biomarkers of muscle (e.g., creatine kinase; p&gt;0.05) and liver (e.g., gamma-glutamyltransferase; p&gt;0.05) damage. Furthermore, melatonin alleviated the deterioration in physical performance (countermovement jump, five-jump test and 20-m sprint; p&gt;0.05). In conclusion, the obtained data showed increased oxidative stress and renal, muscle and liver damage in professional soccer players during an exhaustive training schedule. Melatonin intake during the training period exerts beneficial effects on physical performance and protects tissues against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species and cellular damage."
https://openalex.org/W4294316916,"Surface waters, especially those receiving wastewater flows, can disseminate antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB), antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG), and antibiotics. In the Scioto River of central Ohio, United States, we evaluated fishes as potential sentinels of ARB and antimicrobial contamination and investigated the influence of antimicrobial exposure on the fish intestinal resistome. Seventy-seven fish were collected from river reaches receiving inputs from two wastewater treatment plants that serve the greater Columbus Metropolitan Area. Fish were screened for the presence of cephalosporin-resistant (CeRO) and carbapenem-resistant (CRO) organisms, epidemic carbapenemase genes, and antibiotic drugs and metabolites using culture methods, droplet digital PCR, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-MS/MS). Nearly 21% of fish harbored a CeRO in their resistome, with 19.4% exhibiting bacteria expressing an AmpC genotype encoded by bla CMY , and 7.7% with bacteria expressing an extended-spectrum β-lactamase phenotype encoded by bla CTX-M. bla KPC and bla NDM were present in 87.7% (57/65) and 80.4% (37/46) of the intestinal samples at an average abundance of 10 4 copies. Three antibiotics–lincomycin (19.5%), azithromycin (31.2%) and sulfamethoxazole (3.9%)–were found in hepatic samples at average concentrations between 25–31 ng/g. Fish harboring bla CTX-M and those exposed to azithromycin were at greater odds of being downstream of a wastewater treatment plant. Fish that bioconcentrated antibiotics in their liver were not at greater odds of harboring CeRO, CRO, or epidemic carbapenemase gene copies in their resistome. Our findings confirm that fishes can be effective bioindicators of surface waters contaminated with ARB, ARG, and antibiotics. Moreover, our findings highlight the varying importance of different mechanisms that facilitate establishment of ARB in aquatic ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W4294353920,"Rapidly attending towards potentially harmful stimuli to prevent possible damage to the body is a critical component of adaptive behavior. Research suggests that individuals display an attentional bias, i.e., preferential allocation of attention, for consciously perceived bodily sensations that signal potential threat, like itch or pain. Evidence is not yet clear whether an attentional bias also exists for stimuli that have been presented for such a short duration that they do not enter the stream of consciousness. This study investigated whether a preconscious attentional bias towards itch-related pictures exists in 127 healthy participants and whether this can be influenced by priming with mild itch-related stimuli compared to control stimuli. Mild itch was induced with von Frey monofilaments and scratching sounds, while control stimuli where of matched modalities but neutral. Attentional bias was measured with a subliminal pictorial dot-probe task. Moreover, we investigated how attentional inhibition of irrelevant information and the ability to switch between different tasks, i.e., cognitive flexibility, contribute to the emergence of an attentional bias. Attentional inhibition was measured with a Flanker paradigm and cognitive flexibility was measured with a cued-switching paradigm. Contrary to our expectations, results showed that participants attention was not biased towards the itch-related pictures, in facts, attention was significantly drawn towards the neutral pictures. In addition, no effect of the itch-related priming was observed. Finally, this effect was not influenced by participants' attentional inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Therefore, we have no evidence for a preconscious attentional bias towards itch stimuli. The role of preconscious attentional bias in patients with chronic itch should be investigated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4293718626,"Triphosphate tunnel metalloenzymes (TTMs) are found in all biological kingdoms and have been characterized in microorganisms and animals. Members of the TTM family have divergent biological functions and act on a range of triphosphorylated substrates (RNA, thiamine triphosphate, and inorganic polyphosphate). TTMs in plants have received considerably less attention and are unique in that some homologs harbor additional domains including a P-loop kinase and transmembrane domain. Here, we report on structural and functional aspects of the multimodular TTM1 and TTM2 of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our tissue and cellular microscopy studies show that both AtTTM1 and AtTTM2 are expressed in actively dividing (meristem) tissue and are tail-anchored proteins at the outer mitochondrial membrane, mediated by the single C-terminal transmembrane domain, supporting earlier studies. In addition, we reveal from crystal structures of AtTTM1 in the presence and absence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog a catalytically incompetent TTM tunnel domain tightly interacting with the P-loop kinase domain that is locked in an inactive conformation. Our structural comparison indicates that a helical hairpin may facilitate movement of the TTM domain, thereby activating the kinase. Furthermore, we conducted genetic studies to show that AtTTM2 is important for the developmental transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in Arabidopsis, whereas its closest paralog AtTTM1 is not. We demonstrate through rational design of mutations based on the 3D structure that both the P-loop kinase and TTM tunnel modules of AtTTM2 are required for the developmental switch. Together, our results provide insight into the structure and function of plant TTM domains."

https://openalex.org/W4294218721,"Mechanical signals stimulate mitochondrial function but the molecular mechanisms are not clear. Here, we show that the mechanically sensitive ion channel Piezo1 plays a critical role in mitochondrial adaptation to mechanical stimulation. The activation of Piezo1 induced mitochondrial calcium uptake and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In contrast, loss of Piezo1 reduced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in calvarial cells and these changes were associated with increased expression of the phosphodiesterases Pde4a and lower cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. In addition, Piezo1 increased cAMP production and the activation of a cAMP-responsive transcriptional reporter. Consistent with this, cAMP was sufficient to increase mitochondrial OCR and the inhibition of phosphodiesterases augmented the increase in OCR induced by Piezo1. Moreover, the inhibition of cAMP production or activity of protein kinase A, a kinase activated by cAMP, prevented the increase in OCR induced by Piezo1. These results demonstrate that cAMP signaling contributes to the increase in mitochondrial OXPHOS induced by activation of Piezo1."
https://openalex.org/W4294295663,"Objective The commonly held association of hyperthyroidism with sinus tachycardia and widened pulse pressure (PP) has not been reassessed in decades despite patients with hyperthyroidism in current practice not always present with these signs. The study objective was to assess prevalence and variability of sinus tachycardia and widened PP in present day among individuals with different degrees of hyperthyroidism. Methods Data was collected retrospectively from 248 adult patients in an outpatient setting with biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism, recorded heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) who were not treated with medications that can influence these parameters. Results Mean age was 42.0 ± 14.2 years with 66.9% being female. Median free thyroxine (fT4) level was 3.49 (IQR 2.42–4.58) ng/dL and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.02 (IQR 0.01–0.03) mIU/L. Tachycardia, defined as HR &gt;100 bpm, was present in 28.2%. In the lowest and highest fT4 quartiles, tachycardia was present in 16.4% and 38.7% respectively. Using logistic regression, tachycardia was associated with higher fT4 and diastolic BP. More lenient outcome of tachycardia with HR &gt;90 bpm was seen in 47.2%. Widened PP, defined as &gt;50 mmHg, was observed in 64.1% of patients and correlated with higher fT4 and BP. Conclusions Tachycardia is not a common feature of hyperthyroidism today. The relatively infrequent finding of tachycardia in this study compared to older studies may reflect differences in the way medicine is practiced today. The increased ordering of thyroid function tests most likely unmasked cases of mild or asymptomatic thyrotoxicosis. A widened PP was a more prevalent clinical finding in this study."
https://openalex.org/W4294295674,"Robots are becoming increasingly accessible to both experts and non-experts. Therefore, establishing a method for learning robot operations that can be easily mastered by non-experts is important. With this in mind, we aimed to develop a method that facilitates skill acquisition for non-experts that operate robots. As a first step, this study examined the effects of button layout on the exploration and learning of robot operations. A humanoid robot was operated using an unfamiliar tablet-based user interface to achieve the task of shifting the robot’s posture to the desired posture: single-foot-standing. The process in which participants found and repeated sequences of commands to achieve the shift task was observed. Four types of button layouts were prepared: normal, random, name appears after the first success (NAFS), and change to normal controller after the first success (CNFS). The normal layout roughly matched the position of the robot’s joints, whereas the random layout was randomly assigned, and no information was displayed on each button. Before completing the shift task, a random layout was provided in the NAFS and CNFS layouts. After the first success, the corresponding joint information was displayed in the NAFS layout, whereas the layout was changed to a normal one in the CNFS layout. In total, 51 participants used the normal layout, 7 participants used the random layout, 25 participants used the NAFS layout, and 24 participants used the CNFS layout. The results indicate that providing a random layout during the exploration process (before the first success) is preferable for effective exploration and learning. However, during the learning process (after the first success), providing the relationship between joint movements and buttons in a visual manner is better without changing the button layout from that used in the exploration process."

However, in low grade or subnephrotic proteinuria the diagnostic value of kidney biopsy as first-line diagnostics is less well established.We conducted a retrospective analysis of all native kidney biopsies at our institution (n = 639) between 01/2012 and 05/2021 for comparison of histological diagnoses and clinical outcomes stratified by amount of proteinuria at the time of kidney biopsy: A: <300mg/g creatinine (low grade), B: 300-3500mg/g creatinine (subnephrotic), C >3500mg/g creatinine (nephrotic).Nephrotic range proteinuria was associated with the highest frequency (49.3%) of primary glomerulopathies followed by subnephrotic (34.4%) and low grade proteinuria (37.7%). However, within the subnephrotic group, the amount of proteinuria at kidney biopsy was linearly associated with renal and overall survival (HR 1.05 per Δ100mg protein/g creatinine (95% CI: 1.02-1.09, p = 0.001)) independent of present histological diagnoses and erythrocyturia.Frequency of primary glomerulopathies supports to perform kidney biopsy in patients with subnephrotic proteinuria. These patients have a substantial risk of ESKD and death upon follow-up. Therefore, diagnostic accuracy including histopathology is essential to guide personalized treatment and avert detrimental courses."

However, little information is available about the metabolic basis of pharmacological values of P . lactiflora flowers. In this study, we investigated metabolites in the different parts of P . lactiflora flowers, including petal, stamen petaloid tissue and stamen, by widely targeted metabolomics approach. A total of 1102 metabolites were identified, among which 313 and 410 metabolites showed differential accumulation in comparison groups of petal vs. stamen petaloid tissue and stamen vs. stamen petaloid tissue. Differential accumulated metabolites analysis and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the flavonoids were the most critical differential metabolites. Furthermore, difference accumulation of flavonoids, phenolic acids, tannins and alkaloids might lead to the differences in antioxidant activities and tyrosinase inhibition effects. Indeed, stamen petaloid tissue displayed better antioxidant and anti-melanin production activities than petal and stamen through experimental verification. These results not only expand our understanding of metabolites in P . lactiflora flowers, but also reveal that the stamen petaloid tissues of P . lactiflora hold the great potential as promising ingredients for pharmaceuticals, functional foods and skincare products."
https://openalex.org/W4294295713,"Background Limited data are available on clinical phenotype for delirium that occurs frequently among patients admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical pictures of delirium, and their association with clinical outcomes in CICU patients. Methods A total of 4,261 patients who were admitted to the CICU between September 1 2012 to December 31 2018 were retrospectively registered. Patients were excluded if they were admitted to the CICU for less than 24 hours or had missed data. Ultimately, 2,783 patients were included in the analysis. A day of delirium was defined as any day during which at least one CAM-ICU assessment was positive. The clinical risk factors of delirium were classified by the delirium phenotype, as follows; hypoxic, septic, sedative-associated, and metabolic delirium. Results The incidence of delirium was 24.4% at the index hospitalization in all CICU patients, and 22.6% within 7 days after CICU admission. The most common delirium phenotype was septic delirium (17.2%), followed by hypoxic delirium (16.8%). Multiple phenotypes were observed during most delirium days. Delirium most frequently occurred in patients with heart failure. Of all patients affected by delirium within 7 days, both ICU and hospital mortality significantly increased according to the combined number of delirium phenotypes. Conclusions Delirium occurred in a quarter of patients admitted to the modern CICU and was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Therefore, more efforts are needed to reduce the clinical risk factors of delirium, and to prevent it in order to improve clinical outcomes in the CICU."

This paper describes the implementation of the KMMS across the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia from January 2018 to December 2021. We used the Dynamic Sustainability Framework to progress the implementation and assess at the intervention, practice setting and ecological system level using a mixed methods approach to analyse implementation. Rates of administration and results of screening were described using a retrospective audit of electronic medical records. Analyses of KMMS training registry, stakeholder engagement and sustainability initiatives were descriptive. KMMS acceptability was assessed using qualitative descriptive approaches to analyse patient feedback forms (n = 39), healthcare professional surveys (n = 15) and qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals (n = 6). We found a significant increase in overall recorded perinatal screening (pre-implementation: 30.4% v Year 3: 46.5%, P < 0.001) and use of the KMMS (pre-implementation: 16.4% v Year 3: 46.4%, P < 0.001). There was improved fidelity in completing the KMMS (from 2.3% to 61.8%, P < 0.001), with 23.6% of women screened recorded as being at increased risk of depression and anxiety. Most healthcare professionals noted the high levels of perinatal mental health concerns, stress, and trauma that their patients experienced, and identified the KMMS as the most appropriate perinatal screening tool. Aboriginal women reported that it was important for clinics to ask about mood and feelings during the perinatal period, and that the KMMS was appropriate. Aboriginal women consistently reported that it was good to have someone to talk to. This study demonstrates that innovation in perinatal depression and anxiety screening for Aboriginal women is possible and can be implemented into routine clinical care with the support of a sustained multi-year investment and strong partnerships."
https://openalex.org/W4294295846,"Linear measurements taken from bony landmarks are often utilised in facial approximation (FA) to estimate and plan the placement of overlying soft tissue features. This process similarly guides craniofacial superimposition (CFS) practices. Knowledge of how hard and soft tissue features spatially relate around the mouth region is, however, limited. Geometric morphometric techniques have thus been used to investigate size and shape variation in dentition-to-lip mouth morphology in a South African population. Twenty landmarks (twelve dentition, eight lips) were digitised, using cone-beam CT images of the anterior craniofacial complex in a Frankfurt/Frankfort position, for 147 individuals aged between 20 and 75 years. Principal Component Analysis and Canonical Variate Analysis established that much shape variation exists. A two-way ANOVA identified significant (p < 0.0001) population and sex variation with mouth shape. Black individuals presented with thicker lips, with the oral fissure aligning closely to the dental occlusion. Oral fissure position for white individuals corresponded to the inferior one-quarter (females) or one-sixth (males) of the maxillary central incisor crowns. Males presented larger dimensions than females, but females had a greater lip-to-teeth height ratio than their male counterparts. A pooled within-group regression analysis assessed the effect of age on the dentition and lips and found that it had a significant (p < 0.0001) impact on mouth shape. Ageing was associated with a reduced lip and teeth height, increased mouth width, and a lowered oral fissure and cheilion placement. The generated mean shape data, with metric guides, offer a visual and numerical guide that builds on existing FA and CFS standards, enhancing our understanding of hard and soft tissue relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4294295862,"While all lower limb prosthesis walkers have a high risk of tripping and/or falling, above knee prosthesis users are reported to fall more frequently. Recognising this, engineers designed microprocessor knees (MPK) to help mitigate these risks, but to what extent these devices reduce this disparity between above and below knee users is unclear. A service review was carried out in a prosthetic limb centre regarding the frequency of trips and falls in the previous four weeks. Data from unilateral, community ambulators were extracted. Ordered logistic regressions were applied to investigate whether MPKs mitigated the increased risk of trips and falls for prosthetic knee users, compared to below knee prosthesis users. Socio-demographics (sex, age), prosthesis (prosthesis type, years of use), health (comorbidities, vision, contralateral limb status, medication), and physical function (use of additional walking aids, activity level) were included as covariates. Of the 315 participants in the analysis, 57.5% reported tripping and 20.3% reported falling. Non-microprocessor prosthetic knee (non-MPK) users were shown to trip significantly more than below knee prosthesis users (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.17-3.28). Other covariates showing a significant association included contralateral limb injuries (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.15-3.18) and using an additional walking aid (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.13-3.50). Non-MPK users were also shown to fall significantly more than below knee prosthesis users (OR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.73-6.45), with no other covariates showing a significant association. MPK users did not show an increased frequency of trips (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.33-1.64) or falls (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.18-2.62), compared to below knee prosthesis users. Of those who tripped at least once in the previous four weeks, those using a non-MPK (OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.30-5.74) presented an increased frequency of falling. These findings provide evidence to suggest that the use of MPKs reduces the difference in falls risk between above knee and below knee prosthesis users, providing justification for their provision."

The study aimed to investigate the independent and combined effects of consuming a high protein dairy milk beverage with or without a PRT on markers of intestinal epithelial integrity and selected systemic inflammatory responses in active older (≥50 yrs) adults. Thirty two (males n = 24, females n = 8) active older adults [mean (SD): Age 62 (7) years, weight 74.2 (14.0) kg, height 1.73 (10.0) cm, BMI 24.9 (4.0) kg/m2, and body fat mass: 25.8 (9.1)%)], that reported exercising ≥3/week (211 (91) min/week) were randomly allocated into one of four groups: dairy milk (DM), exercise and dairy milk (EX+DM), exercise alone (EX), and control (CON). Groups with EX underwent 12-weeks whole-body PRT program (x3 sessions/week), groups with DM consumed the beverage twice daily (30g protein/day), and CON was required to carry out their ad libitum dietary and exercise habits. Plasma concentrations of CRP, IL-1ß, IL-1ra, LBP, and sCD14 were determined by ELISA from samples collected at weeks 0, 6, and 12. Data were analyzed (SPSS v25.0) for group and time differences using a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc analysis. No significant differences were observed for any of the measured plasma biomarkers. The previously observed increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine response is likely due to a muscular cellular response and not an indication of intestinal epithelial integrity disturbance and/or subsequent translocation of luminal originated pathogenic bacterial compounds."

Although Burundi has a high burden of anaemia, which may be worsened by the high burden of malaria, little is known about the extent of the problem in very young children who are most at risk of severe disease. We estimated the prevalence, and assessed the factors associated with anaemia in children aged 6-24 months using baseline data collected as part of an on-going study evaluating the effect of Micronutrient supplementation on anaemia and cognition among children in high malaria transmission settings in Burundi.Between February and March 2020, surveys were conducted in 498 households within the catchment area of Mukenke Health Center. One child aged 6-24 months was selected per household to participate in the survey. Following written informed consent, we administered a questionnaire to the child's primary caregiver to capture information on child's demographics, nutritional status, food intake, health (status, and morbidity and treatment-seeking practices), as well as the household markers of wealth. A physical exam was conducted, and a blood sample was collected to: 1) assess for presence of plasmodium infection using a rapid diagnosis test; 2) estimate the haemoglobin levels using a portable haemocue machine. A stool sample was also collected to examine for the presence of helminth infections.The prevalence of anaemia was 74.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 61.5%-84.0%), with most of the anaemic study participants classified as having moderate anaemia (59.2%). A total of 62 (12.5%) participants had positive malaria rapid diagnosis tests. Factors significantly associated with higher odds of developing anaemia included not receiving deworming medication (adjusted Odd ratio [aOR] = 3.54, 95% CI 1.79-6.99, p<0.001), the child's home location (Mukenke II: aOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.89-2.62, p<0.001; Mukenke: aOR = 2.76, 95% CI 2.46-3.10, p<0.001 and Budahunga: aOR = 3.12, 95% CI 2. 94-3.31, p<0.001) and the child's age group (Children aged 6-11 months: aOR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.32-3.91, p<0.001). Education level was inversely associated with less odds of anaemia: child's primary care giver with a secondary (aOR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47-0.95, p = 0,024) and tertiary education level (aOR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.38-0.61, p<0.001).Anaemia is highly prevalent among young children in high malaria transmission setting. Anaemia is more prevalent among children who not dewormed and those with malaria. To prevent the long-term adverse outcomes of the anaemia in children, policy makers should focus on improving uptake of the deworming and malaria prevention programs, promote preventive interventions and improve the education of women especially in families with very young children."
https://openalex.org/W4294316976,"Introduction In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, hypothermia immediately following birth is common even in countries rich in medical resources. The purpose of this study is to design a standard prevention bundle that decreases the rate of hypothermia among infants after birth and to investigate efficacy of the bundle and short-term outcomes for VLBW infants. Methods This quality improvement project was conducted from February 2017 to July 2018 on all VLBW preterm infants admitted at a single referral level III neonatal intensive care unit. The infants were classified into the pre-intervention (February to September 2017) and post-intervention (October 2017 to July 2018) groups according to the time periods when they were recruited. During the pre-intervention period, we analyzed the primary causes of hypothermia, developed solutions corresponding to each cause, integrated all solutions into a prevention bundle, and applied the bundle during the post-intervention period. Afterwards, the incidence of neonatal hypothermia and short-term outcomes, such as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), acidosis, and shock requiring inotropic agents, in each group were compared. Results A total of 95 VLBW infants were enrolled in the study, including 37 pre-intervention, and 58 post-intervention cases. The incidence of hypothermia in preterm infants decreased significantly upon the implementation of our prevention bundle, both in the delivery room (from 45.9% to 8.6%) and on admission (59.5% to 15.5%). In addition, the short-term outcomes of VLBW infants improved significantly, especially with the decreased incidence of IVH (from 21.6% to 5.2%, P = 0.015). Conclusions Our standardized prevention bundle for preventing hypothermia in VLBW infants is effective and decreased the IVH rate in VLBW infants. We strongly believe that this prevention bundle is a simple, low-cost, replicable, and effective tool that hospitals can adopt to improve VLBW infant outcomes."
