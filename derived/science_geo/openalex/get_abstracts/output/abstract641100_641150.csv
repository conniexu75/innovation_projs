https://openalex.org/W2981477552,"We analyzed genetic data of 47,429 multiple sclerosis (MS) and 68,374 control subjects and established a reference map of the genetic architecture of MS that includes 200 autosomal susceptibility variants outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), one chromosome X variant, and 32 variants within the extended MHC. We used an ensemble of methods to prioritize 551 putative susceptibility genes that implicate multiple innate and adaptive pathways distributed across the cellular components of the immune system. Using expression profiles from purified human microglia, we observed enrichment for MS genes in these brain-resident immune cells, suggesting that these may have a role in targeting an autoimmune process to the central nervous system, although MS is most likely initially triggered by perturbation of peripheral immune responses."

It is unclear what the increase in demand for antibiotics means for the occurrence of drug resistance in animals and risk to humans. Van Boeckel et al. describe the global burden of antimicrobial resistance in animals on the basis of systematic reviews over the past 20 years (see the Perspective by Moore). There is a clear increase in the number of resistant bacterial strains occurring in chickens and pigs. The current study provides a much-needed baseline model for low- and middle-income countries and provides a “one health” perspective to which future data can be added.

https://openalex.org/W2974741115,"Magnetic Weyl semimetals Weyl semimetals (WSMs)—materials that host exotic quasiparticles called Weyl fermions—must break either spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry. A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co 2 MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 , which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects. Science , this issue p. 1278 , p. 1282 , p. 1286 ; see also p. 1248"
https://openalex.org/W3102656146,"Bulk-surface correspondence in Weyl semimetals assures the formation of topological ""Fermi-arc"" surface bands whose existence is guaranteed by bulk Weyl nodes. By investigating three distinct surface terminations of the ferromagnetic semimetal Co3Sn2S2 we verify spectroscopically its classification as a time reversal symmetry broken Weyl semimetal. We show that the distinct surface potentials imposed by three different terminations modify the Fermi-arc contour and Weyl node connectivity. On the Sn surface we identify intra-Brillouin zone Weyl node connectivity of Fermi-arcs, while on Co termination the connectivity is across adjacent Brillouin zones. On the S surface Fermi-arcs overlap with non-topological bulk and surface states that ambiguate their connectivity and obscure their exact identification. By these we resolve the topologically protected electronic properties of a Weyl semimetal and its unprotected ones that can be manipulated and engineered."

However, many high-performance thermoelectrics are made of expensive or toxic materials. He et al. found that a material composed of primarily tin and sulfur could be optimized to have relatively good thermoelectric properties. Introducing about 10% selenium to tin sulfide helped tune these properties by electronic band manipulation. This material is a step toward more earth-abundant, less toxic, and lower-cost thermoelectrics than the telluride-based materials currently in use. Science , this issue p. 1418"
https://openalex.org/W3015074294,"Topological matter is known to exhibit unconventional surface states and anomalous transport owing to unusual bulk electronic topology. In this study, we use photoemission spectroscopy and quantum transport to elucidate the topology of the room temperature magnet Co$_2$MnGa. We observe sharp bulk Weyl fermion line dispersions indicative of nontrivial topological invariants present in the magnetic phase. On the surface of the magnet, we observe electronic wave functions that take the form of drumheads, enabling us to directly visualize the crucial components of the bulk-boundary topological correspondence. By considering the Berry curvature field associated with the observed topological Weyl fermion lines, we quantitatively account for the giant anomalous Hall response observed in our samples. Our experimental results suggest a rich interplay of strongly correlated electrons and topology in this quantum magnet."

The epithelium may contribute to these functions directly or by cross-talk with immune cells. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to resolve the spatiotemporal immune topology of the human kidney. We reveal anatomically defined expression patterns of immune genes within the epithelial compartment, with antimicrobial peptide transcripts evident in pelvic epithelium in the mature, but not fetal, kidney. A network of tissue-resident myeloid and lymphoid immune cells was evident in both fetal and mature kidney, with postnatal acquisition of transcriptional programs that promote infection-defense capabilities. Epithelial-immune cross-talk orchestrated localization of antibacterial macrophages and neutrophils to the regions of the kidney most susceptible to infection. Overall, our study provides a global overview of how the immune landscape of the human kidney is zonated to counter the dominant immunological challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2975979611,"Chromosome errors, or aneuploidy, affect an exceptionally high number of human conceptions, causing pregnancy loss and congenital disorders. Here, we have followed chromosome segregation in human oocytes from females aged 9 to 43 years and report that aneuploidy follows a U-curve. Specific segregation error types show different age dependencies, providing a quantitative explanation for the U-curve. Whole-chromosome nondisjunction events are preferentially associated with increased aneuploidy in young girls, whereas centromeric and more extensive cohesion loss limit fertility as women age. Our findings suggest that chromosomal errors originating in oocytes determine the curve of natural fertility in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2975185045,"Microbial entrainment of metabolism The metabolism of mammals is synchronized to daily cycles relating to sleep and mealtimes. It is not surprising that the gut microbiota, which aids in digestion, should also display daily cycling. Kuang et al. found that the gut microbiota can mediate daily cycles epigenetically (see the Perspective by Bishehsari and Keshavarzian). The microbiota induces rhythmic expression of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in epithelial cells of the small intestine, but not those of the colon. HDAC3 expression drives oscillations in intestinal metabolic gene expression, especially for nutrient transport and lipid metabolism. HDAC3 also directly activates estrogen-related receptor α, which promotes lipid absorption. Consequently, mice that lack a gut microbiota lack daily regulation of their metabolism and become obese on high-fat chow. Disruption of HDAC3 cycling could be an explanation for human obesity associated with antibiotic damage to the microbiota and with sleep disruption caused by jet lag and nighttime working.

Most methods rely on light, and the poor penetration of light into tissues limits their application. Ultrasound penetrates tissues, and cellular reporters that respond to ultrasound have been developed recently. These reporters are air-filled protein structures that provide buoyancy in the bacteria they are derived from, but when surrounded by a fluid medium, they reflect sound waves. Farhadi et al. achieved expression from multiple genes to create these complex structures in mammalian cells. In addition to optimizing reporter production and detection, they visualize cells in a proof-of-principle experiment in mouse tumor xenografts. Science , this issue p. 1469"
https://openalex.org/W3105752039,"We report a large-scale density-matrix renormalization group study of the lightly doped Hubbard model on 4-leg cylinders at hole doping concentration $\delta=12.5\%$. By keeping a large number of states for long system sizes, we are able to reveal a delicate interplay between superconductivity and charge and spin density wave orders tunable via next-nearest neighbor hopping t'. For finite t', the ground state is consistent with that of a Luther-Emery liquid, having `half-filled' charge stripes with power-law superconducting and charge-density-wave correlations of wave-length $\lambda=1/2\delta$, but short-range spin correlations. This is in direct contrast to the case with t'=0, where superconducting correlations fall off exponentially while charge- and spin-density modulations are dominant. Our results indicate that a route to robust long-range superconductivity involves destabilizing insulating charge stripes in the doped Hubbard model."

https://openalex.org/W2975015725,"Habitat connectivity enhances diversity Fragmentation of ecosystems leads to loss of biodiversity in the remaining habitat patches, but retaining connecting corridors can reduce these losses. Using long-term data from a large, replicated experiment, Damschen et al. show quantitatively how these losses are reduced. In their pine savanna system, corridors reduced the likelihood of plant extinction in patches by about 2% per year and increased the likelihood of patch colonization by about 5% per year. These benefits continued to accrue over the course of the 18-year experiment. By the end of monitoring, connected patches had 14% more species than unconnected patches. Restoring habitat connectivity may thus be a powerful technique for conserving biodiversity, and investment in connections can be expected to magnify conservation benefit.

Jiang et al. used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to look at how the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp40 work together in the client binding and release cycle. Hsp40 alters the folding properties of the client protein, perhaps unfolding a non-native state, by binding dynamically through multiple binding sites. Hsp70 binding to Hsp40 displaces the unfolded client. The released protein may either fold to its native state, or be rebound for another chaperone cycle. Science , this issue p. 1313"

They used a library of 2000 blood samples from 800 known individuals that have been left to run wild and unmanaged. Resistance declines as the sheep age, which reduces a sheep's chances of surviving the winter.

https://openalex.org/W2976231598,"Starting from Gauss and Kelvin, knots in fields were postulated behaving like particles, but experimentally they were found only as transient features or required complex boundary conditions to exist and couldn't self-assemble into three-dimensional crystals. We introduce energetically stable micrometer-sized knots in helical fields of chiral liquid crystals. While spatially localized and freely diffusing in all directions, they resemble colloidal particles and atoms, self-assembling into crystalline lattices with open and closed structures. These knots are robust and topologically distinct from the host medium, though they can be morphed and reconfigured by weak stimuli under conditions like in displays. A combination of energy-minimizing numerical modeling and optical imaging uncovers the internal structure and topology of individual helical field knots and various hierarchical crystalline organizations they form."
https://openalex.org/W2979693602,"The present study investigated the effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation on cardiac vagal activity, the activity of the vagus nerve regulating cardiac functioning. We applied stimulation on the left cymba conchae and tested the effects of different stimulation intensities on a vagally-mediated heart rate variability pagerameter (i.e., the root mean square of successive differences) as well as on subjective ratings of strength of perceived stimulation intensity and unpleasantness due to the stimulation. Three experiments (within-subject designs, M = 61 healthy participants each) were carried out: In Experiment 1, to choose one fixed stimulation intensity for the subsequent studies, we compared three preset stimulation intensities (i.e., 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mA) with each other. In Experiment 2, we compared the set stimulation method with the free stimulation method, in which the participants were instructed to freely choose an intensity. In Experiment 3, to control for placebo effects, we compared both methods (i.e., set stimulation vs. free stimulation) with their respective sham stimulations. In the three experiments, an increase of cardiac vagal activity was found from resting to the stimulation phases. However, this increase in cardiac vagal activity was not dependent on stimulation intensity (Experiment 1), the method used to stimulate (i.e., set vs. free; Experiment 2), or whether stimulation was active or sham (Experiment 3). This pattern of results was solidly supported by Bayesian estimations. On the subjective level, higher stimulation intensities were perceived as significantly stronger and a stronger stimulation was generally also perceived as more unpleasant. The results suggest that cardiac vagal activity may be similarly influenced by afferent vagal stimuli triggered by active and sham stimulation with different stimulation intensities. Potential explanations for these findings and its implications for future research with tVNS are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2979716626,"Background Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) was a pilot program introduced in Tigray, Ethiopia to monitor maternal and perinatal death. However; its implementation and operation is not evaluated yet. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the implementation and operational status and determinants of MPDSR using a programmatic data and stakeholders involved in the program. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was applied in public health facilities (75 health posts, 50 health centers and 16 hospitals) using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were entered in to Epi-info and then transferred to SPSS version 21 for analysis. All variables with a p-value of ≤ 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in to multivariable logistic regression model to identify the independent predictors. For the qualitative part, manual thematic content analysis was done following data familiarization (reading and re-reading of the transcripts). Results In this study, only 34 (45.3%) of health posts were practicing early identification and notification of maternal/perinatal death. Furthermore, only 36 (54.5%) and 35(53%) of health facilities were practiced good quality of death review and took proper action respectively following maternal/perinatal deaths. Availability of three to four number of Health Extension Workers (HEWs) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 6.09, 95%CI (Confidence Interval): 1.51–24.49), availability of timely Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) reports (AOR = 4.39, 95%CI: 1.08–17.80) and participation of steering committee’s in death response (AOR = 9.19, 95%CI: 1.31–64.34) were the predictors of early identification and notification of maternal and perinatal death among health posts. Availability of trained nurse (AOR = 3.75, 95%CI: 1.08–12.99) and health facility’s head work experience (AOR = 3.70, 95%CI: 1.04–13.22) were also the predictors of quality of death review among health facilities. Furthermore; availability of at least one cluster review meeting (AOR = 4.87, 95%CI: 1.30–18.26) and uninterrupted pregnant mothers registration (AOR = 6.85, 95%CI: 1.22–38.54) were associated with proper response implementation to maternal and perinatal death. Qualitative findings highlighted that perinatal death report was so neglected. Community participation and intersectoral collaboration were among the facilitators for MPDSR implementation while limited human work force capacity and lack of maternity waiting homes were identified as some of the challenges for proper response implementation. Conclusion This study showed that the magnitude of: early death identification and notification, review and response implementation were low. Strengthening active surveillance with active community participation alongside with strengthening capacity building and recruitment of additional HEWs with special focus to improve the quality of health service could enhance the implementation of MPDSR in the region."

It is representative of vocal learning songbirds specifically, which comprise half of all bird species, and of Neoaves broadly, which comprise 95% of all bird species. Although transgenesis in the zebra finch has been accomplished, it is with a very low efficiency of germ-line transmission and far from the efficiency with a more genetically tractable but vocal nonlearning species, the chicken (a Galloanseriformes). To improve germ-line transmission in the zebra finch, we identified and characterized its primordial germ cells (PGCs) and compared them with chicken. We found striking differences between the 2 species, including that zebra finch PGCs were more numerous, more widely distributed in early embryos before colonization into the gonads, had slower timing of colonization, and had a different developmental gene-expression program. We improved conditions for isolating and culturing zebra finch PGCs in vitro and were able to transfect them with gene-expression vectors and incorporate them into the gonads of host embryos. Our findings demonstrate important differences in the PGCs of the zebra finch and advance the first stage of creating PGC-mediated germ-line transgenics of a vocal learning species.-Jung, K.

https://openalex.org/W2980108977,"Previous studies have revealed the anti-inflammatory properties of rice bran oil (RBO), but the detailed mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent studies on the molecular/cellular anti-inflammatory mechanisms of dietary components have demonstrated that mitochondrial respiration plays a key role in macrophage functioning. Since dietary lipids are major substrates for mitochondrial respiration through β-oxidation, the current study examined whether RBO regulates inflammatory responses by modulating mitochondrial energy metabolism. Palm oil (PO), enriched with palmitic acid which are known to be effectively taken up by cells and used for oxidative phosphorylation, served as a positive control. In the in vitro model of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine cells, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in the culture supernatant were significantly reduced by RBO treatment. In contrast, secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was upregulated by RBO. Transcription of genes encoding inflammatory mediator molecules (COX-2 and iNOS) and expression of activation markers (CD80, CD86, and MHC-II) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were suppressed by RBO. Mitochondrial respiration (as assessed by an extracellular flux analyzer) increased upon RBO treatment, as the basal respiration, maximal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity were upregulated. In an in vivo study, C57BL/6 mice were fed a negative control diet containing corn oil (CO), PO, or RBO for 4 weeks, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were isolated from their tibias and femurs. In pro-inflammatory M1-polarized BMDM (M1-BMDM), the RBO-induced suppression of IL-6 and TNF-α was recapitulated in vivo. Mitochondrial respiration in M1-BMDM also increased following the RBO intervention and the PO control treatment as compared to CO fed negative control. Overall, the current study for the first time demonstrates that RBO regulates inflammatory responses in murine macrophages by upregulating mitochondrial respiration. Further clinical studies are required to validate the animal study."
https://openalex.org/W2979806689,"The carboxysome is a bacterial micro-compartment (BMC) subtype that encapsulates enzymatic activities necessary for carbon fixation. Carboxysome shells are composed of a relatively complex cocktail of proteins, their precise number and identity being species dependent. Shell components can be classified in two structural families, the most abundant class associating as hexamers (BMC-H) that are supposed to be major players for regulating shell permeability. Up to recently, these proteins were proposed to associate as homo-oligomers. Genomic data, however, demonstrated the existence of paralogs coding for multiple shell subunits. Here, we studied cross-association compatibilities among BMC-H CcmK proteins of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Co-expression in Escherichia coli proved a consistent formation of hetero-hexamers combining CcmK1 and CcmK2 or, remarkably, CcmK3 and CcmK4 subunits. Unlike CcmK1/K2 hetero-hexamers, the stoichiometry of incorporation of CcmK3 in associations with CcmK4 was low. Cross-interactions implicating other combinations were weak, highlighting a structural segregation of the two groups that could relate to gene organization. Sequence analysis and structural models permitted the localization of interactions that would favor formation of CcmK3/K4 hetero-hexamers. The crystallization of these CcmK3/K4 associations conducted to the elucidation of a structure corresponding to the CcmK4 homo-hexamer. Yet, subunit exchange could not be demonstrated in vitro. Biophysical measurements showed that hetero-hexamers are thermally less stable than homo-hexamers, and impeded in forming larger assemblies. These novel findings are discussed within the context of reported data to propose a functional scenario in which minor CcmK3/K4 incorporation in shells would introduce sufficient local disorder as to allow shell remodeling necessary to adapt rapidly to environmental changes."

Few studies explore global DNA methylation in lung fibroblasts, but none have focused on transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) as a potential modifier of the DNA methylome. Here we analyzed changes in methylation and gene transcription in normal and IPF fibroblasts following TGF-β1 treatment. We analyzed the effects of TGF-β1 on primary fibroblasts derived from normal or IPF lungs treated for 24 hours and 5 days using the Illumina 450k Human Methylation array and the Prime View Human Gene Expression Array. TGF-β1 induced an increased number of gene expression changes after short term treatment in normal fibroblasts, whereas greater methylation changes were observed following long term stimulation mainly in IPF fibroblasts. DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DMNT3a) and tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3) were upregulated after 5-days TGF-β1 treatment in both cell types, whereas DNMT3a was upregulated after 24h only in IPF fibroblasts.

The analysis is based on longitudinal information from a subsample of 1,261 individuals aged 60+ years at baseline from the Costa Rican Study of Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES): a nationally representative sample of elderly population. Random effects regression models for panel data were used to estimate the associations with LTL and its longitudinal changes. Sample collection procedures and DNA refrigerator storage time were strongly associated with LTL: telomeres are longer in blood collected in October-December, in DNA extracted from <1-year-old blood cells, and in DNA stored at 4°C for longer periods of time up to five years. The data confirmed that telomeres are shorter at older ages, as well as among males, and diabetic individuals, whereas telomeres are longer in the high-longevity Nicoya region. Most health, biomarkers, and early childhood indicators did not show significant associations with LTL. Longitudinal LTL variation over approximately two years was mainly associated with baseline LTL levels, as found in other studies. Our findings suggest that if there is unavoidable variability in season of sample collection and DNA storage time, these factors should be controlled for in all demographic and epidemiologic studies of LTL. However, due to unobserved components of measurement variation, statistical control may be inadequate as compared to standardization of data collection procedures."

We found that Melissodes spp. were dominant in and showed fidelity to MF plants, gathering sunflower pollen efficiently throughout the day. In contrast, honey bees dominated on MS lines, mostly gathered nectar and exhibited high floral constancy, even after interacting with a second visitor. Also, honey bees carried sunflower pollen on their bodies while visiting MS inflorescences.

https://openalex.org/W2979865876,"Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to motor weakness. There is no cure, and treatment focuses on slowing down progression, which is achieved by a multidisciplinary approach. Hence, it is vital to understand the population needs for an optimal management of the disease. Objectives To evaluate the current status of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the region of Catalonia, how the disease is managed and its direct medical costs. Methods Records corresponding to 841 patients diagnosed between the year 2007 and 2017 were analysed in a retrospective population-based study, including data from primary care centres, hospitals (inpatient and outpatient care), extended care facilities and mental health centres. Results Mean diagnosis age was 66.11 years (SD = 12.61) and 52.79% of admitted patients were males. On average, 14.91 months elapsed between diagnosis and death, and the mean age of death was 72.64 years (SD = 12.00). Patients were admitted 10.70 times per year, mostly into primary care (86.50%), although most expenses were concentrated in hospital inpatient care. The mean cost per patient per year was €1,168. The 83.24% of patients had more than 4 systems affected by chronic conditions. Conclusions Primary care is of utmost importance in ALS attention in Catalonia, which may have a direct impact in reducing hospitalisation costs. Nonetheless, the expenses linked to inpatient care represent the biggest portion of total costs. Patients’ healthcare usage patterns and the high proportion of patients with multiple chronic conditions should be taken into account in order to adapt and improve guidelines and healthcare systems."

Here we analyze their occurrence in a previously assembled global skin microbiome dataset from 205 amphibian species. Pigmentiphaga made up about 5% of the total number of reads in this global dataset. They were mostly found in unrelated arboreal frogs from Madagascar (Mantellidae and Hyperoliidae), but also occurred at low abundances on Neotropical frogs. Based on their 16S sequences, most of the sequences belong to a clade within Pigmentiphaga not assignable to any type strains of the five described species of the genus.

Here, we report the full genome sequence of this bacterium which, based on 16S sequences of >97% similarity, has previously been found on human skin, floral nectar, tree sap, stream sediment and soil. Its genome consists of a single circular chromosome with 6,165,255 bp, 5,300 predicted coding sequences, 57 tRNA genes, and three rRNA operons. In comparison with other known Pigmentiphaga genomes it encodes a higher number of genes associated with environmental information processing and cellular processes.

ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) initiates the synthesis pathway and synthesizes ADP-glucose, the substrate of starch synthase (SS), of which SSIV is an isoform. Mutations of the AGPase subunit and SSIV-coding genes affect starch content and cause variation in the number of granules. Here, we pyramided the functional mutation alleles of the AGPase subunit gene TaAGP.L-B1 and the SSIV-coding gene TaSSIVb-D to elucidate their synergistic effects on other key starch biosynthesis genes and their impact on starch content. Both the TaAGP.L-B1 and TaSSIVb-D genes were expressed in wheat grain development, and the expression level of TaAGP.L-B1 was higher than that of TaSSIVb-D. The TaAGP.L-B1 gene was downregulated in the agp.L-B1 single and agp.L-B1/ssIV-D double mutants at 12 to 18 days after flowering (DAF). TaSSIVb-D expression was significantly reduced at 6 DAF in both ssIV-D single and double mutants. In the agp.L-B1/ssIV-D double mutant, TaGBSSII was upregulated, while TaAGPSS, TaSSI, and TaSBEII were downregulated. Under the interaction of these genes, the total starch and amylopectin contents were significantly decreased in agp.L-B1 and agp.L-B1/ssIV-D mutants. The results suggested that the mutations of TaAGP.L-B1 and TaSSIVb-D genes resulted in variation in the expression patterns of the other four starch synthetic genes and led to a reduction in starch and amylopectin contents. These mutants could be used further as germplasm for resistant starch analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2979570702,"Background The palliative care consultation service (PCCS) of the National Health Insurance payments has been promoted in Taiwan since 2011, although few studies have been conducted on healthcare staffs’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding PCCS in Taiwan; consequently, the main objective of this study was to explore any correlations regarding the above by cross-sectional design using convenience sampling. Methods A total of 210 healthcare staff members were enrolled from a regional hospital from June 1, 2018, to September 30, 2018. Questionnaire items on the Palliative Care Consultation Service Inventory (KAP-PCCSI) were used to measure healthcare staff’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices of PCCS. The collected data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis. Results The results revealed that the mean scores for knowledge of and attitudes of KAP-PCCSI were 58.7 ± 8.9 (perfect score: 75) and 42.7 ± 4.7 (perfect score: 50) respectively, while the mean score for practices of KAP-PCCSI was 36.3 ± 8.1 (perfect score: 50); moreover, the healthcare staff’s knowledge and attitudes were positively correlated with their practices (p < 0.01). The results also showed that knowledge, attitudes, experience of having a family member(s) or friend(s) passing away, and being a medical personnel constituted the major predictors of practices (p < 0.001). These factors explained 43.2% of the overall variance for practices of KAP-PCCSI. Conclusions The findings can help healthcare staff understand factors influencing practices of KAP-PCCSI and can serve as a reference for the development of strategies for palliative care education and training while improving the care quality of patients undergoing such palliative care with terminal life considerations in the hospitals, thereby fulfilling the goal of achieving holistic care."
https://openalex.org/W2975639981,"My students were taking midterms when my phone erupted with urgent messages. “Student is having a panic attack,” texted a teaching assistant. I ran out of my office, down a flight of stairs and found the student—a pupil in my 350-person organic chemistry class—lying motionless on the ground outside the exam hall. “I can't move my fingers, head, or legs,” she cried. “I don't know what's happening to me.” My mind raced as she slipped in and out of consciousness. I asked a bystander to call 911 and held the student's hand, reassuring her that help was on the way. “Did my exam really trigger a panic attack?” I asked myself. “Why am I not prepared to deal with a situation like this?”

> “I think of [my students] as flowers—different flowers with different needs.” 

It was my first time teaching the course. But I knew that the subject was challenging for my undergraduate students. I also knew that the course had a reputation for doling out few A's. This was a source of stress for premed students in particular, who feared that a low grade in organic chemistry would keep them from getting into medical school. I had no idea that my exam could elicit a full-blown panic attack, though.

The saving grace that day was another student, who had emergency medical training and rushed over to help. She led the student through a series of breathing exercises that calmed her down and helped her regain the use of her limbs. Afterward, I asked her what happened. “I panicked when I was reading the questions,” she said. My heart sank, wondering whether I could have done anything to prevent this.

The following day, I was scheduled to lecture to the same class. I knew that I had to address what had happened during the midterm. I didn't want to infringe on the student's privacy by mentioning her. So, I started by saying: “I want to take some time today to talk about something important. How many of you think that this is a weed-out course?” Half of my students raised their hands gingerly. “I'm sorry to hear that,” I continued. “I want you all to know that I do not consider any of you to be weeds; you all deserve to be here.”

I flashed a slide of flowers in various shapes and hues—a stark contrast from the chemical structures I'd shown in past lectures. I smiled at my students and said: “I think of you as flowers—different flowers with different needs. You may not bloom at the same time, but you will bloom! You may not do well in a midterm exam, but you will learn from your mistakes and do better on the final exam. I believe this. I believe in you.”

From that point on, my office hours were packed. Previously, only a few top-performing students had come, but the new batch included students who were struggling as well as those who were first-generation college attendees. Some asked about lecture topics and study strategies; others opened up about personal issues—family health problems, impostor syndrome, depression—that they'd been struggling with. I was amazed that a simple, frank discussion in lecture could make such a difference.

We educators shouldn't need a crisis to remind us of our students' emotional needs. But it took a crisis to transform my approach to teaching. I now make a point of talking about mental health at the outset of every course, giving the students my “flower” speech and mentioning places where they can go for extra support. Before exams, I ask my students to use digital clickers to rate their current mental health and I share the results onscreen, which helps students realize that they're not alone in feeling stressed.

Finally, I do my best to learn my students' names. This may seem like a small thing, and it's challenging in such a large class. But I've found that they feel valued—and are more likely to ask me for help—when I put in the effort to recognize them as unique individuals.

The DNA within a human cell, known as the genotype, provides a blueprint to direct a host of processes for building an embodied organism. Although we often treat the human genome as if it is fixed, there is a lot of variation between individuals. The observable human phenotype consists of multiple traits resulting from many genetic variants within any single genome. Hair, eye and skin color, height, build, and behavior all represent such polygenic traits. Many of these traits can be modulated by our environment—for instance, through exposure to stress, sunlight, or microbes—resulting in a range of outcomes. This special issue expands our view of genotype and phenotype and explores recent advances in understanding the factors that influence the development of the human phenotype. We examine cases in which various cells and traits are specified by DNA mutation or epigenetic changes, but we also highlight cases in which phenotype is affected by suites of genes and gene products from commensal bacteria. This special issue illustrates the diverse approaches that together are increasing our understanding of the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype, with the potential to drive discoveries that promote human health.

https://openalex.org/W2974041687,"John Robert (“Bob”) Schrieffer, one of the leading theoretical physicists of the past century, passed away on 27 July. He was 88. His seminal work with physicists John Bardeen and Leon Cooper earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 and is now the accepted the theory of superconductivity. The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory solves one of the major scientific problems of the early 20th century and has been foundational for many important developments in physics since.

Born in Oak Park, Illinois, on 31 May 1931, Bob's family moved to New York and then to Florida. He remained fond of Florida, eventually returning in 1992 as a professor at Florida State University. He received a bachelor of science degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953. There, under the guidance of John Slater, he became interested in solid-state physics. He did his graduate work with physicist John Bardeen at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC). When he went to see Bardeen about a possible thesis problem, Bob later recounted, Bardeen pulled out a paper from his desk with a list of 10 possible projects. At the bottom of the list was “superconductivity.”

Bob received his Ph.D. in physics from UIUC in 1957 and went on to postgraduate fellowships at Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute and England's University of Birmingham. While at the Bohr Institute, he met Anne Grete Thomsen; they were married in 1960. His next positions were at the University of Chicago and then the physics department at UIUC. In 1962, Bob joined the University of Pennsylvania physics department, where he remained for almost two decades. In 1980, he took a position at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), physics department and at the National Science Foundation's Institute for Theoretical Physics (ITP), also in Santa Barbara. Bob served as the second director of the ITP and played an important role in its development into the major center for theoretical physics that it is today.

Superconductivity is responsible for spectacular quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale. A superconductor supports a “persistent current”—a current that can flow forever without requiring any input of energy. Moreover, table-top superconducting devices can exhibit quantized behaviors that directly, and with apparently infinite precision, reflect the fundamental constants of nature that define quantum mechanics on the microscale. Superconductivity was first observed in 1911, and all the greatest theorists attempted to explain it in the decades after the invention of quantum mechanics. The solution required a leap of imagination. Bob achieved the mathematically simple but conceptually profound step when he wrote down an explicit wave function—one that violates the otherwise immutable principle of particle number conservation. This opened the door to a number of successful predictions of the BCS theory.

Extensions of the original BCS work—many of them carried out by Bob with various junior collaborators—led to an increasingly detailed (microscopic) theory. In addition to its direct role as a theory of superconductivity, the BCS theory led to great successes in theoretical physics that crossed subdisciplines. In nuclear physics, it played a central role in the understanding of the structure of complex nuclei and of neutron stars. It also played a vital role in reaching the modern understanding of the quantum field theory that underlies today's standard model of strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions.

It was characteristic of much of Bob's work that the calculations were simple and explicit, whereas the implications were broad and deep. His work on solitons in conducting polymers was broadly important, leading to the first concrete realization of a system that exhibits fractionalized charge and initiating inquiry into the implications of topology for the electronic properties of matter. Yet, the key calculations are so simple that they now are given as homework assignments in introductory courses on condensed-matter physics. Other examples are the “Schrieffer counting argument” for computing the charge of a topological excitation as a fraction of the fundamental electron charge, and the demonstration, in collaboration with physicists Frank Wilczek and Daniel Arovas, that the quasiparticles in the famous Laughlin state for the fractional quantum Hall effect have not only fractional charge but fractional braiding statistics. These works form important pieces of the intellectual foundation of many later developments concerning the interplay of quantum mechanics and topology for the emergent properties of macroscopic systems, including solitons in polyacetylene, quantum Hall devices, and topological insulators.

We were both fortunate to have been Bob's postdocs. D.S. was his first postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, and S.A.K. was his last postdoc there and moved with him to UCSB to become his first California postdoc. D.S. had moved to UCSB 12 years earlier and played a role in convincing Bob to move there. Somehow, despite being inordinately busy, Bob always had time for us. Often, while we were all at UCSB, he would have lunch with us and with any interesting visitors who were present, and then we would all go for a leisurely walk around the lagoon, delighting in the views and discussing physics.

Bob was known to be a statesman of science without a personal agenda. Confidence in his leadership derived from a universal acceptance and belief in his ability and personal integrity. Beyond this, those fortunate to have known him will remember his patience, kindness, and the ever-present twinkle in his eye. They also know how he suffered from the highs and lows of the bipolar disorder that took over his life at the end. In addition to his remarkable intellect and physical insight, we remember Bob as a mentor and later a friend, whose determination, bordering on stubbornness, accompanied by good-natured optimism when physics became difficult, was cherished by all who knew him.

Some worried that my research progress would stall; others warned that my industry experience would be no help—and might even be a drawback—if I ever decided to apply for academic positions. But I had enjoyed collaborating with industry scientists, and I was curious to find out more about how treatments were developed from basic research. So I accepted the job. Now, 3 years later and contrary to my colleagues' predictions, I'm making the switch back to academia—where I think my industry experience will serve me well."
