https://openalex.org/W2071066283,"A series of hypotheses is presented about the relation of national energy use to national economic activity (both time series and cross-sectional) which offer a different perspective from standard economics for the assessment of historical and current economic events. The analysis incorporates nearly 100 years of time series data and 3 years of cross-sectional data on 87 sectors of the United States economy. Gross national product, labor productivity, and price levels are all correlated closely with various aspects of energy use, and these correlations are improved when corrections are made for energy quality. A large portion of the apparent increase in U.S. energy efficiency has been due to our ability to expand the relative use of high-quality fuels such as petroleum and electricity, and also to relative shifts in fuel use between sectors of the economy. The concept of energy return on investment is introduced as a major driving force in our economy, and data are provided which show a marked decline in energy return on investment for all our principal fuels in recent decades. Future economic growth will depend largely on the net energy yield of alternative fuel sources, and some standard economic models may need to be modified to account for the biophysical constraints on human economic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1976119057,"Computer modeling of 611 high-quality analyses of normal ground waters from diverse geographic areas reveals that aqueous oxidation-reduction reactions are generally not at equilibrium. Multiple redox couples present in individual samples yield computed Nernstian Eh (redox potential) values spanning as much as 1000 millivolts. The computed Eh values do not agree with each other, nor do they agree with the single ""master"" value measured in the field with a platinum electrode. Because of internal disequilibrium, the use of any measured Eh value as input to equilibrium hydrogeochemical computer models will generally yield misleading results for normal ground waters."
https://openalex.org/W2086721946,Materials representing common interstratified clay minerals are shown to be composed of aggregates of fundamental particles. Transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction demonstrate that the x-ray diffraction characteristics of a wide range of interstratification can be modeled experimentally by utilizing materials containing only three types of particles. The data have been incorporated into a new model that regards interstratified clay minerals as populations of fundamental particles whose x-ray diffraction patterns result from interparticle diffraction.

Potassium bromide mixed with graphite was under pressure between the anvils when melting occurred. The diamond surface melted at pressures greater than approximately 120 kilobars and graphitized at lower pressures. Evidence for the melting and graphitization of the diamond was obtained by optical and scanning electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2049978300,"Vertebrate speciation in the southwest of Australia has long been viewed as resulting from multiple invasions of eastern source stocks during the Pleistocene. Microcomplement fixation studies of serum albumin evolution in frogs of the genus Heleioporus provide the first hard data on age and phylogenetic relationships among species in this genus and lead to rejection of the multiple invasion model in favor of speciation occurring in Western Australia. The albumin molecular clock was used to estimate that the species divergences in this genus occurred between 4 million to 12 million years ago in the late Tertiary (Pliocene-Miocene), rather than in the Quaternary (the last 2 million years)."
https://openalex.org/W2009517255,"A 12-member commission appointed by the Interior Department could decide to stop or change the Garrison Diversion Unit irrigation project in North Dakota. Under attack since the early 1970s by environmentalists and farmers whose land was disrupted, the project would store and divert water from the Missouri River in a series of canals and reservoirs. The project also ran into trouble with the Canadian government over concerns about pollution from irrigation runoff. Promoted heavily by the Reagan administration as a way to provide irrigation to dry areas and stabilize the economy, the project conflicts with other government payments to farmers to limit production. Little evidence supports the need to supplement municipal water supplies. Controversy over these issues, the value of free drainage to farmers, the impact of fish screens and other environmental impacts underscroes the need to develop a workable plan agreeable to both sides."
