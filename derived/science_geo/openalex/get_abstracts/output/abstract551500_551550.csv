https://openalex.org/W2269336718,"How to shape mitochondrial networks Mitochondria undergo fragmentation or fusion in response to changes in cellular metabolism. Toyama et al. report that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is both necessary and sufficient to control mitochondrial fragmentation. AMPK functions as a sensor to monitor the energy status of the cell by phosphorylating mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), a protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane. MFF then acts to recruit a cytoplasmic guanosine triphosphatase that promotes mitochondrial fission. Science , this issue p. 275"

Attesting to its limitations is the growing evidence that certain transcripts annotated as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in fact code for small peptides with biologically important functions. One such lncRNA-derived micropeptide in mammals is myoregulin, which reduces muscle performance by inhibiting the activity of a key calcium pump. Nelson et al. describe the opposite activity in a second lncRNA-derived micropeptide in mammalian muscle, called DWORF (see the Perspective by Payre and Desplan). This peptide enhances muscle performance by activating the same calcium pump. DWORF may prove to be useful in improving the cardiac muscle function of mammals with heart disease.

To get properly oriented, they often require some help from oxygen or nitrogen groups nearby. Appending and removing these directing groups, however, detracts from the efficiency of chemical synthesis. Zhang et al. show that amino acids can act as temporary directing groups in the Pd-catalyzed coupling of arenes with aldehydes or ketones. By reversibly binding to these latter substrates just long enough for the Pd catalysis to ensue, the amino acids eliminate the need for more laborious directing group manipulations.

Delatte et al. show that, in the fruit fly, many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain the modified base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The chemical mark is added by the same enzyme that adds 5hmC to DNA. Because many mRNAs involved in neuronal development contain 5hmC, blocking the enzyme causes brain defects and is lethal. In vivo, RNA hydroxymethylation promotes mRNA translation.

https://openalex.org/W2233221955,"Opening one ring to tack on another Curious chemists have long sought to learn just how tightly carbon atoms can be bound together. For instance, it's possible to form a bond between two opposite corners of an already strained four-membered ring to make an edge-sharing pair of triangles. Gianatassio et al. have now devised a general use for these and related molecular curiosities. They show that appropriately modified nitrogen centers can pop open the most highly strained bond, leaving the more modestly strained ring motif intact. In this way, small rings can emerge as a convenient diversifying element in compounds, including new pharmaceutical candidates. Science , this issue p. 241"

Although treating these hemoglobinopathies with gene therapy is possible, there is a pressing need for pharmacologic approaches to treat general patient populations. One promising approach is to reactivate repressed expression of fetal-type hemoglobin (HbF) in adult erythroid cells. Masuda et al. reveal a molecular mechanism governing HbF repression as mediated by the LRF/ZBTB7A transcription factor. The study may encourage the development of new HbF reactivation therapies for hemoglobinopathies. Science , this issue p. 285"
https://openalex.org/W2151809817,"We report the discovery of ASASSN-15lh (SN 2015L), which we interpret as the most luminous supernova yet found. At redshift z = 0.2326, ASASSN-15lh reached an absolute magnitude of M_{u,AB} = -23.5+/-0.1 and bolometric luminosity L_bol = (2.2+/-0.2)x 10^45 ergs s^-1, which is more than twice as luminous as any previously known supernova. It has several major features characteristic of the hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), whose energy sources and progenitors are currently poorly understood. In contrast to most previously known SLSNe-I that reside in star-forming dwarf galaxies, ASASSN-15lh appears to be hosted by a luminous galaxy (M_K ~ -25.5) with little star formation. In the 4 months since first detection, ASASSN-15lh radiated (1.1+/- 0.2)x10^52 ergs, challenging the magnetar model for its engine."

https://openalex.org/W2237077216,"Archaeological evidence for human dispersal through northern Eurasia before 40,000 years ago is rare. In west Siberia, the northernmost find of that age is located at 57°N. Elsewhere, the earliest presence of humans in the Arctic is commonly thought to be circa 35,000 to 30,000 years before the present. A mammoth kill site in the central Siberian Arctic, dated to 45,000 years before the present, expands the populated area to almost 72°N. The advancement of mammoth hunting probably allowed people to survive and spread widely across northernmost Arctic Siberia."
https://openalex.org/W2259972015,"Natural disasters pose serious threats to large urban areas, therefore understanding and predicting human movements is critical for evaluating a population’s vulnerability and resilience and developing plans for disaster evacuation, response and relief. However, only limited research has been conducted into the effect of natural disasters on human mobility. This study examines how natural disasters influence human mobility patterns in urban populations using individuals’ movement data collected from Twitter. We selected fifteen destructive cases across five types of natural disaster and analyzed the human movement data before, during, and after each event, comparing the perturbed and steady state movement data. The results suggest that the power-law can describe human mobility in most cases and that human mobility patterns observed in steady states are often correlated with those in perturbed states, highlighting their inherent resilience. However, the quantitative analysis shows that this resilience has its limits and can fail in more powerful natural disasters. The findings from this study will deepen our understanding of the interaction between urban dwellers and civil infrastructure, improve our ability to predict human movement patterns during natural disasters, and facilitate contingency planning by policymakers."

We examined the role of A-to-I RNA editing by two ADARs, ADAR1 and ADAR2, in the sensing of self-RNA in the absence of pathogen infection, leading to activation of IFN-induced, RNA-mediated responses in mouse embryo fibroblasts. IFN treatment of Adar1−/− cells lacking both the p110 constitutive and p150 IFN-inducible ADAR1 proteins induced formation of stress granules, whereas neither wild-type (WT) nor Adar2−/− cells displayed a comparable stress granule response following IFN treatment. Phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2α at serine 51 was increased in IFN-treated Adar1−/− cells but not in either WT or Adar2−/− cells following IFN treatment. Analysis by deep sequencing of mouse exonic loci containing A-to-I-editing sites revealed that the majority of editing in mouse embryo fibroblasts was carried out by ADAR1. IFN treatment increased editing in both WT and Adar2−/− cells but not in either Adar1−/− or Adar1−/−p150 cells or Stat1−/− or Stat2−/− cells. Hyper-edited sites found in predicted duplex structures showed strand bias of editing for some RNAs. These results implicate ADAR1 p150 as the major A-to-I editor in mouse embryo fibroblasts, acting as a feedback suppressor of innate immune responses otherwise triggered by self-RNAs possessing regions of double-stranded character.

One mechanism by which cells respond to different forms of stress is the global reduction of protein synthesis (1Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Translational control in stress and apoptosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2α on serine 51 is recognized as a universal mechanism of translation suppression in response to cellular stress (1Holcik M. Sonenberg N.

Four different protein kinases are activated in mammalian cells in response to different stresses, and they all catalyze Ser-51 phosphorylation of eIF2α as follows: protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR) activated by double-stranded RNA; heme-regulated inhibitor kinase activated by hemin deficiency and oxidative stress; general control non-derepressible kinase 2 (GCN2) activated by amino acid deficiency; and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase activated by protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress (2Samuel C.E.

The global inhibition of translation in cultured cells mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation is linked to the formation of stress granules (SG), 2The abbreviations used are: SG, stress granule; ADAR1, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; mmPCR-seq, microfluidics-based multiplex PCR and deep sequencing; RIG, retinoic acid-inducible gene. cytoplasmic aggregates of stalled 40S ribosomal subunit-containing translation initiation complexes, translation initiation factors, and RNA-binding proteins, including Ras GTPase-activating protein-Src homology 3 domain binding protein 1 G3BP1 (4Anderson P.

A cornerstone of innate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) system (9Borden E.C. Sen G.C. Uze G. Silverman R.H. Ransohoff R.M. Foster G.R. Stark G.R.

IFNs act through the transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes that encode products responsible for the biological activities of IFNs, including the ability of IFNs to inhibit virus multiplication and enhance apoptosis (11Randall R.E.

The central importance of PKR furthermore is illustrated both by the large number of viruses that encode gene products that antagonize PKR activation and function, and by the effects of genetic disruption of the Pkr gene (12Sadler A.J.

Similar to PKR, ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1) is an IFN-inducible dsRNA-binding protein with enzyme activity (30Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Expression and regulation by interferon of a double-stranded-RNA-specific adenosine deaminase from human cells: evidence for two forms of the deaminase.Mol. Cell.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are both antiviral and proviral.Virology. 2011; 411: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, unlike PKR, ADAR1 uses dsRNA as a substrate (32Toth A.M. Zhang P. Das S. George C.X. Samuel C.E.

Biol. 2006; 81: 369-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ADAR1 catalyzes the C6 deamination of adenosine (A) in dsRNA structures to generate inosine (I), a process known as A-to-I editing (33Bass B.L.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA, RNA editing, and interferon action.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2011; 31: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Adenosine deamination catalyzed by ADARs can lead to destabilization of dsRNA structures, because I base-pairs (bp) as G instead of A, and I:U mismatch bp are less stable than A:U bp (31Samuel C.E.

Two mammalian genes, Adar1 and Adar2, encode enzymatically active ADARs (31Samuel C.E. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are both antiviral and proviral.Virology. 2011; 411: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The Adar1 gene encodes two quite different protein size isoforms that are both active deaminases, the large or p150 IFN-inducible protein found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and a short or p110 constitutively expressed nuclear protein (30Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Expression and regulation by interferon of a double-stranded-RNA-specific adenosine deaminase from human cells: evidence for two forms of the deaminase.Mol. Cell.

Expression of ADAR1 proteins, inducible p150 and constitutive p110, occurs by a mechanism involving alternative promoters and alternative exon 1 splicing; the promoter driving p150 expression is IFN-inducible by JAK-STAT signaling (36George C.X.

Furthermore, in the absence of virus infection, IFNβ treatment alone induces SG formation in HeLa cells stably deficient in both p110 and p150 but not in ADAR1 sufficient cells (43John L. Samuel C.E. Induction of stress granules by interferon and down-regulation by the cellular RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1.Virology. 2014; 454: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to test whether IFN treatment in the absence of infection affected the SG response in cells genetically null for a single ADAR gene product and, if so, to assess the effect of IFN treatment on both the global A-to-I RNA editing profile and on PKR activation measured by eIF2α phosphorylation. Using mouse MEF cell lines genetically null for only the inducible p150 (Adar1−/−p150), for both the p150 and p110 ADAR1 proteins (Adar1−/−), or for only the ADAR2 protein (Adar2−/−), we examined the role that these ADARs play in the formation of SG and the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to IFN treatment, and how the IFN treatment affected the pattern of A-to-I editing observed in MEFs. Surprisingly, we found Adar1−/−p150 cells lacking only p150 readily formed SG in response to IFNα/β treatment, as did Adar1−/− cells lacking both p150 and p110. By contrast, IFN treatment did not lead to SG formation in Pkr−/− cells, Stat2−/− cells, or wild-type MEF cells and only poorly in Adar2−/− cells. When over 500 exonic loci containing about 11,000 editing sites were analyzed, the vast majority of the editing events were dependent upon ADAR1 rather than ADAR2, and many were enhanced by IFN treatment of Adar2−/− cells and wild-type MEF cells but not Adar1−/− or Adar1−/−p150 MEF cells. Stat1−/− and Stat2−/− cells showed significant editing that was not enhanced by IFN. Finally, elevated phosphorylation of eIF2α was found in the Adar1−/− cells but not in Adar2−/− or wild-type cells following IFN treatment. These results suggest that ADAR1 p150 plays an important role in destabilization of dsRNA structures present in cellular RNAs found in IFN-treated cells that otherwise, in the absence of ADAR1 p150, accumulate to a sufficiently high concentration above the threshold necessary to trigger the activation of dsRNA-dependent innate responses illustrated by eIF2α phosphorylation and SG formation.

Briefly, cells seeded onto 18-mm glass coverslips in 12-well plates were either left untreated or IFN-treated as indicated, and then they were fixed after 24 or 48 h with 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin (Sigma). Permeabilization and blocking were carried out using Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 2% (v/v) normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (CBP buffer). Permeabilized cells then were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in CBP buffer.

In zebra finches, we found that exposure to a tutor's song drives spiking activity within premotor neurons in the juvenile, whereas inhibition suppresses such responses upon learning in adulthood. We measured inhibitory currents evoked by the tutor song throughout development while simultaneously quantifying each bird's learning trajectory. Surprisingly, we found that the maturation of synaptic inhibition onto premotor neurons is correlated with learning but not age. We used synthetic tutoring to demonstrate that inhibition is selective for specific song elements that have already been learned and not those still in refinement. Our results suggest that structured inhibition plays a crucial role during song acquisition, enabling a piece-by-piece mastery of complex tasks."

Such tuning is harnessed within terahertz quantum cascade lasers to reversibly alter their emission. This is achieved in two key steps: First by exciting graphene plasmons within an aperiodic lattice laser and, second, by engineering photon lifetimes, linking graphene's Fermi energy with the round-trip gain. Modal gain and hence laser spectra are highly sensitive to the doping of an integrated, electrically controllable, graphene layer. Demonstration of the integrated graphene plasmon laser principle lays the foundation for a new generation of active, programmable plasmonic metamaterials with major implications across photonics, material sciences and nanotechnology."

https://openalex.org/W2258580413,"Aquatic animals have a close relationship with water, but differences in their symbiotic bacteria and the bacterial composition in water remains unclear. Wild or domestic Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinensis) and the water in which they live were collected from four sampling sites in Jiangsu and Shanghai, China. Bacterial composition in water, gills or guts of E. sinensis, were compared by high-throughput sequencing using 16S rRNA genes. Analysis of >660,000 sequences indicated that bacterial diversity was higher in water than in gills or guts. Tenericutes and Proteobacteria were dominant phyla in guts, while Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were dominant in gills and water. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated that microbiota from gills, guts or water clearly separated into three groups, suggesting that crabs harbor a more specific microbial community than the water in which they live. The dominant OTUs in crab gut were related to Mycoplasmataceae, which were low in abundance in gills, showing that, like mammals, crabs have body-site specific microbiota. OTUs related to Ilumatobacter and Albimonas, which are commonly present in sediment and seawater, were dominant in gills but almost absent from the sampled water. Considering E. sinensis are bottom-dwelling crustacean and they mate in saline water or seawater, behavior and life cycle of crabs may play an important role in shaping the symbiotic bacterial pattern. This study revealed the relationship between the symbiotic bacteria of Chinese mitten crab and their habitat, affording information on the assembly factors of commensal bacteria in aquatic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2301686354,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial use and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in the digestive and respiratory tract in three different production systems of food producing animals. A longitudinal study was set up in 25 Belgian bovine herds (10 dairy, 10 beef, and 5 veal herds) for a 2 year monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibilities in E. coli and Pasteurellaceae retrieved from the rectum and the nasal cavity, respectively. During the first year of observation, the antimicrobial use was prospectively recorded on 15 of these farms (5 of each production type) and transformed into the treatment incidences according to the (animal) defined daily dose (TIADD) and (actually) used daily dose (TIUDD). Antimicrobial resistance rates of 4,174 E. coli (all herds) and 474 Pasteurellaceae (beef and veal herds only) isolates for 12 antimicrobial agents demonstrated large differences between intensively reared veal calves (abundant and inconstant) and more extensively reared dairy and beef cattle (sparse and relatively stable). Using linear mixed effect models, a strong relation was found between antimicrobial treatment incidences and resistance profiles of 1,639 E. coli strains (p<0.0001) and 309 Pasteurellaceae (p≤0.012). These results indicate that a high antimicrobial selection pressure, here found to be represented by low dosages of oral prophylactic and therapeutic group medication, converts not only the commensal microbiota from the digestive tract but also the opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in the respiratory tract into reservoirs of multi-resistance."

A total of 1,113 participants (692 children aged 6–11 yrs; 422 adolescents aged 12–15 yrs) from the 2012 NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey. Participants completed physical activity and screen time questionnaires, and their body mass index and cardiorespiratory fitness (adolescents only) were assessed. Adolescents completed additional physical activity questions to estimate daily MET minutes. Children not meeting the screen time guideline had 1.69 times the odds of being overweight/obese compared to those meeting the screen time guideline, after adjusting for physical activity and other control variables. Among adolescent, screen time was significantly associated with being overweight/obese (odds ratio = 1.82, 95% confidence interval: 1.06–3.15), but the association attenuated toward the borderline of being significant after controlling for physical activity. Being physically active was positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness, independent of screen time among adolescents. In joint association analysis, children who did not meet physical activity nor screen time guidelines had 2.52 times higher odds of being overweight/obese than children who met both guidelines. Adolescents who did not meet the screen time guideline had significantly higher odds ratio of being overweight/obese regardless of meeting the physical activity guideline. Meeting the physical activity guideline was also associated with cardiorespiratory fitness regardless of meeting the screen time guideline in adolescents. Screen time is a stronger factor than physical activity in predicting weight status in both children and adolescents, and only physical activity is strongly associated with cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescents."

https://openalex.org/W2287056933,"Upon exposure to environmental stress, phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α-P) represses global protein synthesis, coincident with preferential translation of gene transcripts that mitigate stress damage or alternatively trigger apoptosis. Because there are multiple mammalian eIF2 kinases, each responding to different stress arrangements, this translational control scheme is referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR). Included among the preferentially translated mRNAs induced by eIF2α-P is that encoding the transcription factor CHOP (DDIT3/GADD153). Enhanced levels of CHOP promote cell death when ISR signaling is insufficient to restore cell homeostasis. Preferential translation of CHOP mRNA occurs by a mechanism involving ribosome bypass of an inhibitory upstream ORF (uORF) situated in the 5′-leader of the CHOP mRNA. In this study, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to define the inhibitory features of the CHOP uORF and the biological consequences of loss of the CHOP uORF on CHOP expression during stress. We discovered that specific sequences within the CHOP uORF serve to stall elongating ribosomes and prevent ribosome reinitiation at the downstream CHOP coding sequence. As a consequence, deletion of the CHOP uORF substantially increases the levels and modifies the pattern of induction of CHOP expression in the ISR. Enhanced CHOP expression leads to increased expression of key CHOP target genes, culminating in increased cell death in response to stress."

Using inoculation with live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) as an infection model, we have recently shown that ingestion of sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprout homogenates (BSH) reduces markers of viral load in the nose. To investigate the systemic effects of short-term BSH supplementation in the context of LAIV-inoculation, we examined peripheral blood immune cell populations in non-smoking subjects from this study, with a particular focus on NK cells. We carried out a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study measuring the effects of BSH (N = 13) or placebo (alfalfa sprout homogenate, ASH; N = 16) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to a standard nasal vaccine dose of LAIV in healthy volunteers. Blood was drawn prior to (day-1) and post (day2, day21) LAIV inoculation and analyzed for neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells. In addition, NK cells were enriched, stimulated, and assessed for surface markers, intracellular markers, and cytotoxic potential by flow cytometry. Overall, LAIV significantly reduced NKT (day2 and day21) and T cell (day2) populations. LAIV decreased NK cell CD56 and CD158b expression, while significantly increasing CD16 expression and cytotoxic potential (on day2). BSH supplementation further increased LAIV-induced granzyme B production (day2) in NK cells compared to ASH and in the BSH group granzyme B levels appeared to be negatively associated with influenza RNA levels in nasal lavage fluid cells. We conclude that nasal influenza infection may induce complex changes in peripheral blood NK cell activation, and that BSH increases virus-induced peripheral blood NK cell granzyme B production, an effect that may be important for enhanced antiviral defense responses.

https://openalex.org/W2267427207,"There is increasing public and scientific concern regarding the long-term behavioural effects of video game use in children, but currently little consensus as to the nature of any such relationships. We investigated the relationship between video game use in children, degree of violence in games, and measures of depression and a 6-level banded measure of conduct disorder. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used. A 3-level measure of game use at age 8/9 years was developed, taking into account degree of violence based on game genre. Associations with conduct disorder and depression, measured at age 15, were investigated using ordinal logistic regression, adjusted for a number of potential confounders. Shoot-em-up games were associated with conduct disorder bands, and with a binary measure of conduct disorder, although the strength of evidence for these associations was weak. A sensitivity analysis comparing those who play competitive games to those who play shoot-em-ups found weak evidence supporting the hypothesis that it is violence rather than competitiveness that is associated with conduct disorder. However this analysis was underpowered, and we cannot rule out the possibility that increasing levels of competition in games may be just as likely to account for the observed associations as violent content. Overall game exposure as indicated by number of games in a household was not related to conduct disorder, nor was any association found between shoot-em-up video game use and depression."

https://openalex.org/W2412949340,"The small GTPase RhoA has been implicated in various cellular activities, including the formation of stress fibers, cell motility, and cytokinesis. In addition to the canonical GTPase cycle, recent findings have suggested that phosphorylation further contributes to the tight regulation of Rho GTPases. Indeed, RhoA is phosphorylated on serine 188 (188S) by a number of protein kinases. We have recently reported that Rac1 is phosphorylated on threonine 108 (108T) by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Here, we provide evidence that RhoA is phosphorylated by ERK on 88S and 100T in response to EGF stimulation. We show that ERK interacts with RhoA and that this interaction is dependent on the ERK docking site (D-site) at the C-terminus of RhoA. EGF stimulation enhanced the activation of the endogenous RhoA. The phosphomimetic mutant, GFP-RhoA S88E/T100E, when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, displayed higher GTP-binding than wild type RhoA. Moreover, the expression of GFP-RhoA S88E/T100E increased actin stress fiber formation in COS-7 cells, which is consistent with its higher activity. In contrast to Rac1, phosphorylation of RhoA by ERK does not target RhoA to the nucleus. Finally, we show that regardless of the phosphorylation status of RhoA and Rac1, substitution of the RhoA PBR with the Rac1 PBR targets RhoA to the nucleus and substitution of Rac1 PBR with RhoA PBR significantly reduces the nuclear localization of Rac1. In conclusion, ERK phosphorylates RhoA on 88S and 100T in response to EGF, which upregulates RhoA activity."
https://openalex.org/W2287751202,"4-Cresol is not only a significant synthetic intermediate for production of many aromatic chemicals, but also a priority environmental pollutant because of its toxicity to higher organisms. In our previous studies, a gene cluster implicated to be involved in 4-cresol catabolism, creCDEFGHIR, was identified in Corynebacterium glutamicum and partially characterized in vivo. In this work, we report on the discovery of a novel 4-cresol biodegradation pathway that employs phosphorylated intermediates. This unique pathway initiates with the phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group of 4-cresol, which is catalyzed by a novel 4-methylbenzyl phosphate synthase, CreHI. Next, a unique class I P450 system, CreJEF, specifically recognizes phosphorylated intermediates and successively oxidizes the aromatic methyl group into carboxylic acid functionality via alcohol and aldehyde intermediates. Moreover, CreD (phosphohydrolase), CreC (alcohol dehydrogenase), and CreG (aldehyde dehydrogenase) were also found to be required for efficient oxidative transformations in this pathway. Steady-state kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) for each catabolic step were determined, and these results suggest that kinetic controls serve a key role in directing the metabolic flux to the most energy effective route."

MSCs are often delivered with hyaluronic acid (HA), although the combined mechanism of action is not fully understood; we thus investigated the immunomodulatory effects of combining MSCs with different molecular weights (MW) of HA. Methods HAs with MWs of 1.6 MDa (hHA), 150 kDa or 7.5 kDa, were added to MSCs alone or MSC-immune cell co-cultures. Gene expression analyses, flow cytometry and cytokine measurements were assessed to determine the effect of HAs on the MSC interactions with immune cells. Results MSCs in the presence of HAs, in both normal and lymphocyte-conditioned medium, showed negligible changes in gene expression. While addition of hHA resulted in increased proliferation of activated lymphocytes, both in the presence and absence of MSCs, the overall combined effect was a more regulated, homeostatic one; this was supported by higher ratios of secreted IL10/IFNγ and IL10/IL2, in lymphocyte cultures, than with lower MW HAs or no HA, both in the presence and absence of MSCs. In addition, examination of monocyte-derived macrophages showed an increased M2 macrophage frequency (CD14+CD163+CD206+) in the presence of hHA, both with and without MSCs. Conclusions hHA produces a less pro-inflammatory environment than lower MW HAs. Moreover, combining hHA with MSCs has an additive effect on the MSC-mediated immunomodulation, suggestive of a more potent combination treatment modality for OA."

Both the store-operated channels and the store-independent arachidonate-regulated Ca2+ (ARC) channels are regulated by STIM1. In the present study, we show that, in addition to its location in the endoplasmic reticulum, SARAF is constitutively expressed in the plasma membrane, where it can interact with plasma membrane (PM)-resident ARC forming subunits in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Using siRNA-based and overexpression approaches we report that SARAF negatively regulates store-independent Ca2+ entry via the ARC channels. Arachidonic acid (AA) increases the association of PM-resident SARAF with Orai1. Finally, our results indicate that SARAF modulates the ability of AA to promote cell survival in neuroblastoma cells.

In this study, we sought to determine which Rab proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking of nascent WNV particles. RNAi analysis revealed that Rab8b plays a role in WNV particle release. We found that Rab8 and WNV antigen were colocalized in WNV-infected human neuroblastoma cells, and that WNV infection enhanced Rab8 expression in the cells. In addition, the amount of WNV particles in the supernatant of Rab8b-deficient cells was significantly decreased compared with that of wild-type cells. We also demonstrated that WNV particles accumulated in the recycling endosomes in WNV-infected cells. In summary, these results suggest that Rab8b is involved in trafficking of WNV particles from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2271814291,"Animals have evolved many ways to enhance their own reproductive success. One bizarre sexual ritual is the “love” dart shooting of helicid snails, which has courted many theories regarding its precise function. Acting as a hypodermic needle, the dart transfers an allohormone that increases paternity success. Its precise physiological mechanism of action within the recipient snail is to close off the entrance to the sperm digestion organ via a contraction of the copulatory canal, thereby delaying the digestion of most donated sperm. In this study, we used the common garden snail Cornu aspersum to identify the allohormone that is responsible for this physiological change in the female system of this simultaneous hermaphrodite. The love dart allohormone (LDA) was isolated from extracts derived from mucous glands that coat the dart before it is stabbed through the partner's body wall. We isolated LDA from extracts using bioassay-guided contractility measurement of the copulatory canal. LDA is encoded within a 235-amino acid precursor protein containing multiple cleavage sites that, when cleaved, releases multiple bioactive peptides. Synthetic LDA also stimulated copulatory canal contractility. Combined with our finding that the protein amino acid sequence resembles previously described molluscan buccalin precursors, this indicates that LDA is partially conserved in helicid snails and less in other molluscan species. In summary, our study provides the full identification of an allohormone that is hypodermically injected via a love dart. More importantly, our findings have important consequences for understanding reproductive biology and the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies.

Overexpression of USP14 decreased ubiquitination while treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinase (IU1) increased receptor ubiquitination. Treatment with the internalization inhibitor Dynasore blunted both USP14 and IU1 effects on the receptor ubiquitination state, suggesting a post-endocytic site of action. Overexpression of USP14 also led to an accelerated degradation of GABAB in a catalytically independent fashion.

https://openalex.org/W2469400850,"Introduction The advent of electroanatomical mapping (EAM) systems for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has dramatically decreased radiation exposure. However, the need for some fluoroscopy remains for obtaining left atrial (LA) access. The aim was to test the feasibility of fluoroscopy-free PVI in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) guided solely by an EAM system. Methods Consecutive patients with AF undergoing PVI and documented PFO were studied. An EAM-guided approach without fluoroscopy and ultrasound was used. After completing the map of the right atrium, the superior vena cava and the coronary sinus, a catheter pull-down to the PFO was performed allowing LA access. The map of the LA and subsequent PVI was also performed without fluoroscopy. Results 30 patients [age 61±12 years, 73% male, ejection fraction 0.64 (0.53–0.65), LA size in parasternal long axis 38±7 mm] undergoing PVI were included. The time required for right atrial mapping including transseptal crossing was 9±4 minutes. Total procedure time was 127±37 minutes. Fluoroscopy-free PVI was feasible in 26/30 (87%) patients. In four patients, fluoroscopy was needed to access (n = 3) or to re-access (n = 1) the LA. In these four patients, total fluoroscopy time was 5±3 min and the DAP was 14.9±13.4 Gy*cm2. Single-procedure success rate was 80% (24/30) after a median follow-up of 12 months. Conclusion In patients with a documented PFO, completely fluoroscopy-free PVI is feasible in the vast majority of cases."

This study assessed the effect of spatial variation in surface water resources on the ranging behaviour of the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). We analyzed data for 1992 (dry year with 20 water points) and 2000 (wet year with 30 water points) against presence-only data for five packs of L. pictus in a part of Hwange National Park and adjacent smallholder communal farming areas in western Zimbabwe. Modelling the potential habitat for L. pictus using Maxent with distance from water points (Dw) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as predictor variables was successful for 2000 (AUC = 0.793) but not successful for 1992 (AUC = 0.423), with L. pictus probability of occurrence near water points being more for year 2000 than for year 1992. The predicted L. pictus range was wider in 1992 (~13888.1 km2) than in 2000 (~958.4 km2) (Test of Proportions, χ2 = 124.52, df = 1, P = 0.00). Using the 2nd order Multitype Nearest Neighbour Distance Function (Gcross), we also observed significant attraction between L. pictus and water points within only ~1km radius for 1992 but up to ~8km radius for 2000. Our study reinforced the notion that surface water resources attract wild dogs in the savannahs but paradoxically less so when water resources are scarce. In particular, our study furthers current understanding of the effects of changing water availability regimes on the endangered L. pictus, providing evidence that the endangered predator's home range encroaches into potential ecological traps (i.e., smallholder communal farming areas) when water resources are scarce."
https://openalex.org/W2261108226,"By blocking TNFα-related effects, thalidomide not only inhibits hepatic fibrogenesis but improves peripheral vasodilatation and portal hypertension in cirrhotic rats. Nonetheless, the investigation of thalidomide's effects on splanchnic and collateral microcirculation has been limited. Our study explored the roles of intestinal and mesenteric TNFα along with inflammasome-related pathway in relation to cirrhosis and the splanchnic/collateral microcirculation.Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, mechanisms of the effects of thalidomide on intestinal and mesenteric inflammatory, vasodilatory and angiogenic cascades-related abnormalities were explored in cirrhotic rats that had received 1-month thalidomide (C-T) treatment.In cirrhotic rats, high tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO)x levels were associated with the NOD-like receptors protein 3 (NLRP3), IL-1β and caspase-1 inflammasome over-expression in splenorenal shunt and mesenteric tissues. The thalidomide-related inhibition of mesenteric and splenorenal shunt inflammasome expression was accompanied by a significantly decreased intestinal mucosal injury and inflammasome immunohistochemical staining expression. Suppression of various angiogenic cascades, namely VEGF-NOS-NO, was paralleled by a decrease in mesenteric angiogenesis as detected by CD31 immunofluorescence staining and by reduced portosystemic shunting (PSS) in C-T rats. The down-regulation of the mesenteric and collateral vasodilatory VEGF-NOS-NO cascades resulted in a correction of vasoconstrictive hypo-responsiveness and in an attenuation of vasodilatory hyper-responsiveness when analyzed by in situ perfusion of the superior mesenteric arterial (SMA) and portosystemic collaterals. There was also a decrease in SMA blood flow and an increase in SMA resistance in the C-T rats. Additionally, acute incubation with thalidomide abolished TNFα-augmented VEGF-mediated migration of and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which was accompanied by corresponding changes in inflammatory and angiogenic substances release.The suppression of inflammasome over-expression by chronic thalidomide treatment ameliorates inflammatory, angiogenic and vasodilatory cascades-related pathogenic changes in the splanchnic and collateral microcirculation of cirrhotic rats. Thalidomide seems to be a promising agent that might bring about beneficial changes to the disarrangements of peripheral, hepatic, splanchnic and collateral systems in cirrhosis."

We use UV and Halogen excitations in this study. Region of interest(ROI) of hyperspectral images of 256 oil samples from four varieties are obtained within the spectral region of 400–720nm. Radiation indexes extracted from each ROI are used as feature vectors. These indexes are individual band radiation index (RI), difference of consecutive spectral band radiation index (DRI), ratio of consecutive spectral band radiation index (RRI) and normalized DRI (NDRI). Another set of features called quantized histogram matrix (QHM) are extracted by applying quantization on the image histogram from these features. Based on these feature sets, improved kernel independent component analysis (iKICA) is used to select significant features. For comparison, algorithms such as plus L reduce R (plusLrR), Fisher, multidimensional scaling (MDS), independent component analysis (ICA), and principle component analysis (PCA) are also used to select the most significant wavelengths or features. Support vector machine (SVM) is used as the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are able to obtain robust and better classification performance with fewer number of spectral bands and simplify the design of computer vision systems."
https://openalex.org/W2271725357,"Background The entry of HIV into its host cell is an interesting target for chemotherapeutic intervention in the life-cycle of the virus. During entry, reduction of disulfide bridges in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 by cellular oxidoreductases is crucial. The cellular thioredoxin reductase-1 plays an important role in this oxidoreduction process by recycling electrons to thioredoxin-1. Therefore, thioredoxin reductase-1 inhibitors may inhibit gp120 reduction during HIV-1 entry. In this present study, tellurium-based thioredoxin reductase-1 inhibitors were investigated as potential inhibitors of HIV entry. Results The organotellurium compounds inhibited HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in cell culture at low micromolar concentrations by targeting an early event in the viral infection cycle. Time-of-drug-addition studies pointed to virus entry as the drug target, more specifically: the organotellurium compound TE-2 showed a profile similar or close to that of the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T-20). Surface plasmon resonance-based interaction studies revealed that the compounds do not directly interact with the HIV envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, nor with soluble CD4, but instead, dose-dependently bind to thioredoxin reductase-1. By inhibiting the thioredoxin-1/thioredoxin reductase-1-directed oxidoreduction of gp120, the organotellurium compounds prevent conformational changes in the viral glycoprotein which are necessary during viral entry. Conclusion Our findings revealed that thioredoxin-1/thioredoxin reductase-1 acts as a cellular target for the inhibition of HIV entry."

https://openalex.org/W2297951403,"Cone snail toxins are well known blockers of voltage-gated sodium channels, a property that is of broad interest in biology and therapeutically in treating neuropathic pain and neurological disorders. Although most conotoxin channel blockers function by direct binding to a channel and disrupting its normal ion movement, conotoxin μO§-GVIIJ channel blocking is unique, using both favorable binding interactions with the channel and a direct tether via an intermolecular disulfide bond. Disulfide exchange is possible because conotoxin μO§-GVIIJ contains an S-cysteinylated Cys-24 residue that is capable of exchanging with a free cysteine thiol on the channel surface. Here, we present the solution structure of an analog of μO§-GVIIJ (GVIIJ[C24S]) and the results of structure-activity studies with synthetic μO§-GVIIJ variants. GVIIJ[C24S] adopts an inhibitor cystine knot structure, with two antiparallel β-strands stabilized by three disulfide bridges. The loop region linking the β-strands (loop 4) presents residue 24 in a configuration where it could bind to the proposed free cysteine of the channel (Cys-910, rat NaV1.2 numbering; at site 8). The structure-activity study shows that three residues (Lys-12, Arg-14, and Tyr-16) located in loop 2 and spatially close to residue 24 were also important for functional activity. We propose that the interaction of μO§-GVIIJ with the channel depends on not only disulfide tethering via Cys-24 to a free cysteine at site 8 on the channel but also the participation of key residues of μO§-GVIIJ on a distinct surface of the peptide."

With the hope of developing potent drug candidates by the modification of the 2',4'-position of the ribose with the inclusion of a bridge, efforts were focused on the inhibition of Taq DNA polymerase using quantitative real time PCR, and the results revealed the significant inhibitory effects of 2',4'-bridged thymidine nucleoside on the polymerase. Study on the mode of inhibition revealed the competitive mechanism with which the 2',4'-bridged thymidine operates. With a Ki value of 9.7 ± 1.1 μM, the 2',4'-bridged thymidine proved to be a very promising inhibitor. Additionally, docking analysis showed that all the nucleosides including 2',4'-bridged thymidine were able to dock in the active site, indicating that the substrate analogs reflect a structural complementarity to the enzyme active site. The analysis also provided evidence that Asp610 was a key binding site for 2',4'-bridged thymidine. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to further understand the conformational variations of the binding. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values for the peptide backbone of the enzyme and the nitrogenous base of the inhibitor stabilized within 0.8 and 0.2 ns, respectively. Furthermore, the MD analysis indicates substantial conformational change in the ligand (inhibitor) as the nitrogenous base rotated anticlockwise with respect to the sugar moiety, complemented by the formation of several new hydrogen bonds where Arg587 served as a pivot axis for binding formation. In conclusion, the active site inhibition of Taq DNA polymerase by 2',4'-bridged thymidine suggests the potential of bridged nucleosides as drug candidates."

They called for more intense looks at how the sex organs interact during copulation and proposed new methods for measuring these organs."
