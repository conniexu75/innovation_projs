https://openalex.org/W1579558830,"In order to identify residues required for the binding of interleukin-8 (IL-8) to its receptor, mutants were constructed in which clusters of charged amino acids were systematically replaced with alanine along the entire IL-8 sequence. The mutants were tested for their ability to induce a receptor-mediated rise in cytosolic free Ca2+, a property of wild-type IL-8 which can readily be detected by flow cytometry using neutrophils loaded with the calcium probe Indo-1. Eleven of the 12 mutants caused neutrophil calcium mobilization at 5 nM; the exception being a triple alanine mutant at positions K3, E4, and R6, which was inactive at all concentrations tested (150 nM maximum). A second set of mutants was generated in which residues 1-15 were individually mutated to alanine. Mutants E4A, L5A, or R6A were all inactive in the Ca2+ assay at 5 nM and competed poorly with 125I-IL-8 for neutrophil receptor binding; I10A, E4A, L5A, and R6A had approximately 30-, 100-, 100-, and 1000-fold reduced affinity, as compared with control IL-8, respectively. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of IL-8 indicates that, in solution, the side chains of E4, L5, R6, and I10 point away from the core of the protein and do not participate in any intramolecular hydrogen bonds or salt bridges (Clore, G. M., and Gronenborn, A. M. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 217, 611-620)."
https://openalex.org/W1597826703,"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), EC 3.1.1.4, which catalyzes the release of free fatty acids from the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, has been extensively studied from the viewpoint of eicosanoid production (Arita, H., Nakano, T., and Hanasaki, K. (1989) Prog. Lipid Res. 28, 273-301). Several lines of evidence suggest that extracellular PLA2 is pathophysiologically related to some disorders, including inflammation and hypersensitivity. Despite this, little is known of the precise mechanism of the pathological processes as well as their intrinsic correlation with dysfunction. Here, we report a novel PLA2 action on the proliferation of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts via specific binding sites of approximately Mr 200,000. Pancreatic type PLA2 in the active form specifically recognized the sites and stimulated thymidine incorporation in DNA. Its inactive zymogen and other PLA2s from platelets, snake, and bee venoms showed much lesser activities. Although the physiological significance remains to be identified, our finding is the first to offer a new viewpoint on the effect of mammalian extracellular PLA2 on cellular function."

Comparative photoaffinity labeling with [35S]ATP gamma S and with the photolabile bile salt derivative (7,7-azo-3 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-[3 beta-3H]-cholan-24-oyl-2'- aminoethanesulfonate followed by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody (Be 9.2) revealed the identity of the ATP-binding and the bile salt-binding canalicular membrane glycoprotein with the apparent Mr of 110,000 (gp110). The isoelectric point of this glycoprotein was 3.7. Transport of bile salt was studied in vesicles enriched in canalicular and sinusoidal liver membranes. Incubation of canalicular membrane vesicles with [3H] taurocholate in the presence of ATP resulted in an uptake of the bile salt into the vesicles which was sensitive to vanadate. ATP-dependent taurocholate transport was also observed in membrane vesicles from mutant rats deficient in the ATP-dependent transport of cysteinyl leukotrienes and related amphiphilic anions. Substrates of the P-glycoprotein (gp170), such as verapamil and doxorubicin, did not interfere with the ATP-dependent transport of taurocholate. Reconstitution of purified gp110 into liposomes resulted in an ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]taurocholate. These results demonstrate that gp110 functions as carrier in the ATP-dependent transport of bile salts from the hepatocyte into bile. This export carrier is distinct from hitherto characterized ATP-dependent transport systems."
https://openalex.org/W1500713135,"The endothelin peptides constitute a family of potent vasoconstrictor molecules. Endothelin-1 (ET1) is secreted by vascular endothelial cells and may have a role in the regulation of vascular tone. To better understand the function of ET1, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the ET1 gene. Utilizing reporter gene transfection experiments, we have previously identified two promoter regions, located at base pairs -148 to -117 (Region A) and -117 to -98 (Region B) of the ET1 gene. Both regions are necessary for high level ET1 transcription in endothelial cells. A nuclear protein binding to the GATA motif in Region A has been identified and proven to be necessary for expression of the ET1 gene. However, the cis-acting sequences and their cognate binding proteins for Region B have not been investigated. To identify protein binding motifs in Region B we performed DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays using a DNA fragment encoding base pairs -204 to -94 of the ET1 gene. Results from these studies indicated that the AP1 consensus sequence (GTGACTAA) in Region B as the only protein-binding motif. Site-directed mutagenesis of the ET1 AP1 site resulted in a 30-fold reduction in promoter activity, establishing the functional significance of this sequence. Additional experiments investigated the role of Jun and Fos in ET1 transcription. By employing antisera to Jun and Fos in gel mobility shift assays, both of these proteins were identified as endothelial cell nuclear proteins binding to the ET1 AP1 sequence. In trans-activation experiments, we showed that cotransfection of c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly increased the transcription rate of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids containing three synthetic ET1 AP1 sites. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of the AP1 recognition sequence, and the role of Fos and Jun proteins in the regulation of ET1 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1552427867,"The gfa gene encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intermediate filament protein found almost exclusively in astrocytes. Transient transfection studies with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene were used to identify regions of the gfa gene responsible for its expression. Three regions, A, B, and D, were found to be important. The D region is located near the basal promoter, while A and B are next to each other about 1500 bp further upstream. The regions contain several sequences homologous to binding sites of known transcription factors, and in addition, each contains an identical novel 10-bp motif. The A, B, and D regions act in a cell-specific manner; when joined to the SV 40 early promoter, they enhance transcription in the glial cell line U251, but not in the nonglial cell line HepG2. Consistent with this observation, the DNase I footprint produced in these regions by nuclear extract from U251 cells differs from that produced by an extract from HepG2 cells. The B region appears to be the most active of the three, as by itself it stimulates strong cell-specific transcription, whereas addition of the other two regions has little effect. When the B region is at its normal distance from the basal promoter, deletion of D severely reduces transcription, but when B is placed near the promoter, D is unimportant. This suggests that the D region may function primarily to promote interactions that bring B close to the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1547123213,"We identified a 60-kDa diisopropylfluorophosphate-(DFP) reactive protein in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, at a yield of 50-100 pmol/lavage. The protein is associated with the cell-free lavage fluid sediment, which consists mainly of surfactant. [3H]DFP labeling is inhibited by heating to 56 degrees C, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and 1 mM bis(4-nitrophenyl)-phosphate. An identical 60-kDa [3H]DFP-reactive protein is present in the insoluble fraction of alveolar macrophage-conditioned culture medium and in total membrane preparations of alveolar macrophages. The [3H]DFP-labeled protein was purified approximately 30-fold from lavage fluid sediment by size-exclusion (Sephacryl S-200) and ion-exchange (Mono-Q) chromatography. Cyanogen bromide treatment of the partially purified protein produced a major labeled peptide of 14 kDa with an NH2-terminal sequence 90% identical to a region of form 1 rabbit liver microsomal carboxylesterase. Esterase activity in unlabeled starting material, detected using p-nitrophenyl valerate as substrate, copurified with the [3H]DFP-labeled enzyme. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the partial amino acid sequence and on a highly conserved region of known liver carboxylesterase sequences. Polymerase chain reaction using these primers and reverse-transcribed human alveolar macrophage mRNA yielded a 354-base pair product which was then used to screen a human alveolar macrophage cDNA library. A complete esterase sequence was obtained from two incomplete, overlapping clones, and is virtually identical to human liver carboxylesterase partial sequences. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a single approximately 1.7-kilobase transcript in human monocytes and alveolar macrophages, with much higher levels in the latter. These data indicate that human alveolar macrophages both contain and release a serine esterase that is apparently identical to liver microsomal carboxylesterase. Its enzymatic profile suggests it is a major component of alveolar macrophage-nonspecific esterase activity. We hypothesize that it acts as a detoxication enzyme in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1607500403,"We have demonstrated that calcium-dependent potassium transport in erythrocytes requires the participation of a cytoplasmic protein. Activation of calcium-dependent potassium transport causes an increase in the membrane-bound levels of this protein which is dependent on the calcium concentration and which is highly correlated (r = 0.791, p less than 0.0001) with the loss of potassium. Reconstitution of this transport pathway in sonicated erythrocyte membrane vesicles was achieved only in vesicles containing the cytoplasmic protein indicating a causal relationship in this transport system. The protein is found in high levels within the cytoplasm of erythrocytes (5.6 mg/ml red blood cells) and yet less than 1% of the protein located in the cytoplasm is required to bind to the membrane in order to initiate the potassium efflux. The analysis of rat organ homogenates demonstrated that this protein is located in most tissues with particular enrichment in adrenal glands, brain, lung, and blood. These results demonstrate that there is a cytoplasmic protein, herein named calpromotin, which is a necessary and sufficient cytoplasmic component of calcium-dependent potassium transport in erythrocytes and perhaps other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1534850320,"Mac-2, a galactose-binding lectin secretion by activated macrophages, is the major non-integrin laminin-binding protein in these cells. Mac-2 is also expressed by epithelial cells in the intestine and kidney. We wished to identify intestinal glycoproteins other than laminin that have a high affinity for Mac-2 and that could be considered as candidate ligands or partners for this lectin in intestinal epithelium. Certain lines of human colon adenocarcinoma cells produce two Mac-2-binding glycoproteins (M2BP-1 and M2BP-2) that were identified by their avid association with Mac-2 following detergent lysis and immunoprecipitation. These glycoproteins do not share a common epitope with Mac-2, and the interaction between Mac-2 and these proteins is mediated through the carbohydrate-binding domain of Mac-2 and sugar moieties on M2BP-1 and M2BP-2. M2BP-1 (98 kDa) and M2BP-2 (70 kDa) were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and were specifically eluted with either galactose or lactose. Peptide maps revealed that M2BP-1 and M2BP-2 are structurally related. M2BP-1 is secreted and could conceivably associate with Mac-2 extracellularly. N-terminal sequence analysis of M2BP-2 suggests that these glycoproteins represent a unique subset of candidate ligands for this mammalian beta-galactoside lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1659650576,"Photoactivated rhodopsin is quenched upon its phosphorylation in the reaction catalyzed by rhodopsin kinase and the subsequent binding of a regulatory protein, arrestin. We have found that heparin and other polyanions compete with photoactivated, phosphorylated rhodopsin to bind arrestin (48-kDa protein, S-antigen). This is shown (a) by the suppression of stabilized metarhodopsin II; (b) by changes in the digestion of arrestin in the presence of heparin; and (c) by the restoration of arrestin-quenched phosphodiesterase activity. When bound to arrestin, heparin also mimics phosphorylated rhodopsin by similarly exposing arrestin to limited proteolysis. We conclude that heparin and rhodopsin have similar means of binding to arrestin, and we propose a cationic region of arrestin (beginning with Lys163 of the bovine sequence) as the interaction site. In agreement with previous kinetic data we interpret the results in terms of a binding conformation of arrestin which is stabilized by rhodopsin or heparin and is open to proteolytic attack."
https://openalex.org/W1600920155,"Human heart chymase, a chymotrypsin-like serine proteinase that hydrolyzes the Phe8-His9 bond in angiotensin I (Ang I) to yield the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) and His-Leu, is the most specific, efficient Ang II-forming enzyme described. Other mammalian chymases display a much broader substrate specificity. To better define its substrate specificity, we have mapped the extended substrate-binding site of human heart chymase using Ang I analogs. The enzyme has a preference for aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan at the P1 site. At the S2 subsite there is a significant preference for proline over hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acids. There is no clear preference for hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acids at the S'1 and S'2 subsites, but an Ang I analog containing a P'1 proline is not hydrolyzed and one with a P'2 proline is hydrolyzed poorly. An increasing reduction in reactivity occurs when the P position amino acids in Ang I are deleted sequentially from the N terminus. An increase or decrease in the length of the His-Leu leaving group also produces a marked decrease in reactivity. No single determinant in Ang I is preeminently required for efficient catalysis, but several factors acting synergistically appear to be important. Thus, we propose that ideal substrates for human heart chymase should contain the structure nXaa-Pro-[Phe, Tyr, or Trp]-Yaa-Yaa, where n greater than or equal to 6; Xaa = any amino acid; Yaa = any amino acid except proline. This structure exists in Ang I and neurotensin, both of which are good substrates for human heart chymase. These findings indicate that the selection of the scissile bond by the extended substrate-binding site of human heart chymase is more restricted than that in other chymases."
https://openalex.org/W1556685667,"Abstract Addition of 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (alkenyl-lyso-GPE) to human neutrophil membrane preparations containing 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC) resulted in rapid deacylation of the 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC to 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC (lyso-platelet-activating factor, lyso-PAF). When acetyl-CoA was included in the incubation mixture, the [3H]lyso-PAF was converted to [3H]PAF. Studies of [3H]arachidonate-labeled neutrophils permeabilized with Staphlococcus aureus alpha-toxin revealed a major shift of labeled [3H]arachidonate from the choline to the ethanolamine-containing phosphoglycerides upon addition of alkenyl-lyso-GPE. The studies indicated that lyso-PAF is formed in the system by the transfer of arachidonate from 1-O-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC to the alkenyl-lyso-GPE by a CoA-independent transacylase reaction. Mass measurements revealed a rapid loss of arachidonate from 1-radyl-2-acyl-GPE and a concomitant increase in alkenyl-lyso-GPE upon stimulation of the neutrophils by ionophore A23187. Based on these and other findings, a pathway is proposed that may play a significant, if not obligatory, role in the synthesis of PAF in intact stimulated neutrophils. It has been widely accepted that phospholipase A2 acts directly on 1-O-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC as the first step in the synthesis of PAF via formation of lyso-PAF. In the proposed scheme, phospholipase A2, upon stimulation, acts rapidly on ethanolamine plasmalogen selectively releasing arachidonic acid and generating alkenyl-lyso-GPE. The CoA-independent transacylase then selectively transfers arachidonate from 1-radyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC to the alkenyl-lyso-GPE generating lyso-PAF, which is then acetylated to form PAF. The interactions outlined can account for the synthesis of 1-acyl-2-acetyl-GPC, 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acetyl-GPE, and eicosanoids, in parallel with PAF."
https://openalex.org/W1484728386,"A cDNA that encodes the kidney isoenzyme of the mitochondrial glutaminase (pGA) was generated by recombination of two cDNAs that were isolated from a random-primed rat brain lambda gt11 library. pGA encodes 674 amino acids which includes an N-terminal sequence of 16 residues that should form an amphipathic helix, typical of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Residues 73-90 correspond to the N-terminal sequence of the more abundant 65-kDa glutaminase peptide. In vitro transcription and translation of pGA yields a 72-kDa peptide that is immunoprecipitated with glutaminase-specific antibodies. Incubation of the glutaminase precursor with isolated mitochondria yields the 68- and 65-kDa peptides that are characteristic of the mature glutaminase. Thus, the two mature glutaminase peptides are synthesized from a single precursor. The complete 3' nontranslated region of the GA mRNA was characterized by sequencing a GA cDNA (pGA12) that was isolated from an oligo(dT)-primed rat kidney lambda gt10 library. This segment contains numerous AU-rich regions, four potential stem-loop structures, and a 48 base pair repeat of CA dinucleotides. Such domains may contribute to the increased stability of the GA mRNA that occurs in response to metabolic acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W1605252096,"Farnesyl-protein transferase (FTase) purified from rat or bovine brain is an alpha/beta heterodimer, comprised of subunits having relative molecular masses of approximately 47 (alpha) and 45 kDa (beta). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two unlinked genes, RAM1/DPR1 (RAM1) and RAM2, are required for FTase activity. To explore the relationship between the mammalian and yeast enzymes, we initiated cloning and immunological analyses. cDNA clones encoding the 329-amino acid COOH-terminal domain of bovine FTase alpha-subunit were isolated. Comparison of the amino acid sequences deduced from the alpha-subunit cDNA and the RAM2 gene revealed 30% identity and 58% similarity, suggesting that the RAM2 gene product encodes a subunit for the yeast FTase analogous to the bovine FTase alpha-subunit. Antisera raised against the RAM1 gene product reacted specifically with the beta-subunit of bovine FTase, suggesting that the RAM1 gene product is analogous to the bovine FTase beta-subunit. Whereas a ram1 mutation specifically inhibits FTase, mutations in the CDC43 and BET2 genes, both of which are homologous to RAM1, specifically inhibit geranylgeranyl-protein transferase (GGTase) type I and GGTase-II, respectively. In contrast, a ram2 mutation impairs both FTase and GGTase-I, but has little effect on GGTase-II. Antisera that specifically recognized the bovine FTase alpha-subunit precipitated both bovine FTase and GGTase-I activity, but not GGTase-II activity. Together, these results indicate that for both yeast and mammalian cells, FTase, GGTase-I, and GGTase-II are comprised of different but homologous beta-subunits and that the alpha-subunits of FTase and GGTase-I share common features not shared by GGTase-II."
https://openalex.org/W1574785618,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II subunit gene RPB9 was isolated and sequenced. RPB9 is a single copy gene on chromosome VII. The RPB9 sequence predicts a protein of 122 amino acids with a molecular mass of 14,200 Da. The yeast RPB9 subunit is similar in size and sequence to a protein encoded by DNA adjacent to the suppressor of the Hairy Wing gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Deletion of the RPB9 gene produced cells that were heat- and cold-sensitive. The RPB9 subunit, like the previously described RNA polymerase II subunit RPB4, is not essential for synthesis of mRNA, but is required for normal cell growth over a wide temperature range."
https://openalex.org/W1563102421,"Tissue factor is an integral membrane glycoprotein that serves as an essential cofactor for the blood coagulation factor VIIa. Recent studies have attempted to localize the tissue factor recognition determinant of human factor VIIa. While several regions of factor VIIa have been implicated as important for tissue factor binding, the high affinity tissue factor recognition determinant of human factor VIIa is unknown. In order to define the determinant, we constructed a set of six chimeric proteins composed of portions of factor VII and factor IX. We then utilized the chimeras in competition experiments with 125I-labeled factor VIIa for recombinant tissue factor bound to an Immobilon-P membrane. The data indicate that the high affinity tissue factor recognition determinant of human factor VIIa is within the epidermal growth factor domains."
https://openalex.org/W1503849410,"We isolated membranes from leupeptin-induced autophagic vacuoles and compared them with lysosomal membranes purified from dextran-administered rats. In protein composition, autophagic vacuole membranes prepared from long term-starved (36 h) rats bear marked resemblance to lysosomal membranes, whereas vacuole membranes prepared from short term-starved (12 h) animals differ significantly from lysosomal membranes. Immunoblotting analyses showed that only autophagic vacuole membranes from short term-starved rats possess endoplasmic reticulum markers such as cytochrome P450 and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. None of the membranes contain sialyltransferase, a Golgi membrane marker. In experiments in which rats were starved after feeding to induce autophagy, the appearance of the endoplasmic reticulum markers occurred during 6-12 h of starvation, concomitantly with increases in vacuolar proteins and sequestered cytosolic aldolase. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane markers and sequestered aldolase declined gradually after 20-36 h of starvation, suggesting that prolonged starvation causes no further increase in the formation of autophagic vacuoles but an increase in the population of matured autophagic vacuoles. Thus, the prominent markers of endoplasmic reticulum from which autophagosomes originate are well preserved in autophagic vacuole membranes, and retention of these markers is highly dependent on the formation and subsequent maturation process of autophagic vacuoles."
https://openalex.org/W1584409725,"Abstract Previous studies of bacteriorhodopsin have indicated interactions between Asp-85, Asp-212, Arg-82, and the retinylidene Schiff base. The counterion environment of the Schiff base has now been further investigated by using single and double mutants of the above amino acids. Chromophore regeneration from bacterioopsin proceeds to a normal extent in the presence of a single aspartate or glutamate residue at position 85 or 212, whereas replacement of both charged amino acids in the mutant Asp-85----Asn/Asp-212----Asn abolishes the binding of retinal. This indicates that a carboxylate group at either residue 85 or 212 is required as counterion for formation and for stabilization of the protonated Schiff base. Measurements of the pKa of the Schiff base reveal reductions of greater than 3.5 units for neutral single mutants of Asp-85 but only decreases of less than 1.2 units for corresponding substitutions of Asp-212, relative to the wild type. Substitutions of Asp-85 show large red shifts in the absorption spectrum that are partially reversible upon addition of anions, whereas mutants of Asp-212 display minor red shifts or blue shifts. We conclude, therefore, that Asp-85 is the retinylidene Schiff base counterion in wild-type bacteriorhodopsin. In the mutant Asp-85----Asn/Asp-212----Asn formation of a protonated Schiff base chromophore is restored in the presence of salts. The spectral properties of the double mutant are similar to those of the acid-purple form of bacteriorhodopsin. Upon addition of salts the folded structure of wild-type and mutant proteins can be stabilized at low pH in lipid/detergent micelles. The data indicate that exogenous anions serve as surrogate counterions to the protonated Schiff base, when the intrinsic counterions have been neutralized by mutation or by protonation."
https://openalex.org/W1554853279,"von Willebrand factor (vWf) is a multimeric plasma glycoprotein that functions in hemostasis as the initiator of platelet adhesion to damaged blood vessels and as the carrier of Factor VIII (FVIII). Montgomery et al. (Montgomery, R.R., Hathaway, W.E., Johnson, J., Jacobsen, L., and Muntean, W. (1982) Blood 60, 201-207) reported a variant of von Willebrand disease characterized by the abnormal interaction between FVIII and a defective vWf. To identify the molecular basis of this abnormal interaction, we isolated platelet RNA from members of one of the affected families and determined the nucleotide sequence of the FVIII-binding domain encoded by the vWf mRNA. A single G to A transition at nucleotide 2561 was linked with disease expression and results in the substitution of Gln for Arg91 in mature vWf. A restriction fragment containing this mutation was introduced into a full-length vWf expression vector, and both wild type and mutant vWf were expressed in COS-7 cells. In a solid-phase binding assay, expressed vWf was captured with anti-vWf monoclonal antibody AVW1 and then incubated with 6.25-400 milliunits of recombinant FVIII. After washing, vWf-bound FVIII activity was determined with a chromogenic assay. Mutant vWf showed reduced binding of FVIII compared with wild type, suggesting that the substitution of Gln for Arg91 is the likely basis for the abnormal vWf/FVIII interaction in this von Willebrand disease variant."
https://openalex.org/W1575374956,"We have recently cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the rat hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (P450c7) (Li, Y. C., Wang, D. P., and Chiang, J. Y. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12012-12019), which catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of bile acid synthesis in the liver. By using the polymerase chain reaction, we have designed two P450c7 cDNAs. One has the second Met codon deleted and the third Thr codon replaced with an Ala. The other lacks codons for the NH2-terminal hydrophobic sequence of amino acids 2-24 (P450c7 delta 2-24). The cDNAs were separately cloned into the expression vector pKK233-2 and transformed into Escherichia coli. After induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, bacteria harboring recombinant plasmids expressed a polypeptide which reacted with the antibody against cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in immunoblots. The slightly modified full-length enzyme was expressed to 0.2% of the total bacterial lysate and was located in the membrane fraction, whereas P450c7 delta 2-24 was expressed at a 10-fold higher level (2%), of which 85% was in the cytosol and the remaining associated with the membranes. We have purified P450c7 delta 2-24 which showed a typical reduced-CO difference spectrum of cytochrome P450 and reconstituted cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. P450c7 delta 2-24 has a similar Km for cholesterol (24.6 microM) but a lower Vmax (0.10 nmol/min) and a lower turnover number (1.93 min-1) as compared with the enzyme isolated from rat liver microsomes. The purified P450c7 delta 2-24 has an unique hydrophilic NH2 terminus and contains monomers and dimers in equal amounts. This is the first report demonstrating that a genetically engineered cytochrome P450 enzyme lacking a typical NH2-terminal hydrophobic sequence is mainly cytosolic and catalytically active."
https://openalex.org/W1507156849,"The adherence of the human respiratory pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, to purified glycosphingolipids was investigated using thin layer chromatography overlay assays. Both virulent and avirulent strains of B. pertussis bound to asialo GM1. The bacterium did not bind to the gangliosides GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b, nor to lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, or Forssman antigen. However, after treatment of the chromatography plates with sialidase, B. pertussis bound to the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b but not to GM3. Comparison of the oligosaccharide structures of these gangliosides suggests that the minimum sugar structure needed for avid bacterial binding is GalNAc beta 4Gal. This structure has been previously implicated as a receptor for other human respiratory pathogens (Krivan, H. C., Roberts, D. D., Ginsburg, V. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 85, 6157-6161). Virulent strains of B. pertussis also bound specifically to sulfatide. This response was dose-dependent and inhibited by the anionic polysaccharide dextran sulfate. The sulfated-sugars dextran sulfate, fucoidan, and heparin inhibited the attachment of virulent strains of B. pertussis to human WiDr cells and to hamster trachea cells indicating that sulfatides on the surface of mammalian cells may function as a receptor for B. pertussis. The occurrence of both sulfatides and asialo GM1 in human lung and trachea suggests that these glycolipids may serve as specific receptors for B. pertussis."
https://openalex.org/W1552760664,"The first step in the synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in stimulated neutrophils is generally accepted to be hydrolysis of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC), with 1-O-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC being the preferred precursor. Characterization of the enzymatic activity responsible for the hydrolysis of 1-O-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC has been hampered by lack of an active and reliable cell-free system for study. In the present studies, membrane preparations containing 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC were prepared from intact human neutrophils that had been labeled using 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-lyso-GPC. When the labeled membrane preparations were incubated in the presence of unlabeled 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC (5 microM), rapid deacylation (up to 25% of the label in 10 min) of the 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC to 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC (lyso-PAF) was observed. The deacylation activity appeared to be the same in preparations from resting or stimulated cells. No requirement for Ca2+, various nucleotides, or protein kinase activation could be demonstrated. A number of observations indicated that [3H]lyso-PAF is formed in the system by the action of the CoA-independent transacylase present in the cells rather than by phospholipase A2. Both 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC and 1-acyl-2-lyso-GPC elicited deacylation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC, whereas neither 3-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC nor 1-O-alkyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, which should act as detergents but are not transacylase substrates, effected deacylation. The deacylation activity and CoA-independent transacylase activities were blocked in parallel by a number of inhibitors and by heat inactivation. In preparations containing 1-O-alkyl-2-[3H]arachidonoyl-GPC, no release of free [3H]arachidonic acid was observed. However, a shift of the [3H]arachidonate into exogenous 1-O-tetradecyl-2-lyso-GPC was observed in the system. These findings are consistent with the generation of [3H]lyso-PAF by the CoA-independent transacylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1525660030,"6-Hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase (6-HDNO) was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 cells from the recombinant plasmid pAX-6-HDNO as a beta-galactosidase-6-HDNO fusion protein. Affinity chromatography of the fusion protein on p-aminobenzyl-1-thio-beta-galactopyranoside-agarose and subsequent digestion with protease Xa yielded highly purified apo6-HDNO. Incubation of the purified protein with [14C]FAD demonstrated that flavinylation of apo6-HDNO proceeds autocatalytically. Phosphorylated three-carbon compounds such as glycerol-3-P, which are known to stimulate the formation of the histidyl (N3)-(8 alpha) FAD between apo6-HDNO and FAD (Brandsch, R., and Bichler, V. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 182, 125-128), could be replaced in their action by high concentrations of glycerol (45%) or sucrose (20%). These substances apparently induced and stabilized a conformational state of the apoenzyme compatible with covalent attachment of FAD. In the absence of glycerol the apoenzyme readily lost the ability to form holoenzyme at temperatures above 30 degrees C. Holoenzyme formation protected the 6-HDNO polypeptide from this thermal denaturation. Autoflavinylation of 6-HDNO was inhibited by the sulfhydryl reagents dithionitrobenzoate or N-ethylmaleimide. Inhibition was prevented by mercaptoethanol or FAD, but not 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine, the substrate of the holoenzyme. A cysteine-thiol group may therefore be involved in reactions leading to the covalent attachment of FAD to apo6-HDNO. When flavinylation of apo6-HDNO proceeded under anaerobic conditions, the amount of incorporation of [14C]FAD into the polypeptide was indistinguishable from reactions performed in the presence of O2. None of the FAD-derivatives (8-demethyl-FAD, 8-chloro-FAD, and 5-deaza-FAD) could replace FAD in holoenzyme formation. The failure of covalent attachment of 5-deaza-FAD to apo6-HDNO is in agreement with the assumption that the quinone methide form of the isolloxazine ring is an intermediate in the flavinylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1566966224,"Insulin receptors can be purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized insulin, but published methods all suffer from a rather low capacity of the affinity columns. By using insulin that has been protected in positions A1 and B29, we have been able to couple the insulin selectively through the B1 amino group to divinyl sulfone-activated agarose. The N terminus of the B-chain is the most innocuous site as far as receptor-insulin interaction is concerned, and this strategy allowed us to make affinity columns with capacities of several milligrams of receptor/ml of resin. The receptor used was the soluble ectodomain of the human insulin receptor, produced in transfected baby hamster kidney cells. The column preparation and the elution conditions are described in detail, as the efficacy of the purification depends strongly on both. The purity of the eluted receptors was so high that quantitative amino acid analysis fitted with theory. The molar absorption coefficient at 278.5 nm was 296,000 M-1 cm-1. Finally, it could be unequivocally established that the soluble receptor binds two molecules of insulin with equal affinity."

Activity was restored by the addition of both recombinant yeast TFIID and partially purified factor b, a yeast fraction shown previously to be required for polymerase II transcription. On the basis of this assay with heat-treated extract, factor b was purified to virtual homogeneity. The factor appears to comprise polypeptides of approximately 85, 75, and 50 kDa, since these three polypeptides co-purify with activity, and since a native mass of about 200 kDa is estimated from glycerol gradient sedimentation and gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W2135695852,"Direct binding of laminin in the form of its complex with nidogen to planar lipid bilayers was demonstrated with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Binding occurred equally well to zwitterionic (phosphatidylcholine) and negatively charged (phosphatidylglycerol) lipids and was enhanced by sulfatides but only at nonphysiological molar ratios higher than 30 mol %. Strong interactions with lipid bilayers were also observed for bovine serum albumin. This explains a strong inhibition of laminin binding by this protein. However, binding of laminin to sulfatide-rich bilayers was not completely inhibited. Observable by the microscopic technique was the formation of laminin clusters on the surface of the bilayer which occurred concomitantly with binding. Both processes were strongly enhanced by the presence of calcium. These results show that calcium-induced laminin self-assembly is enhanced at lipid surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1489754394,"A novel Ca(2+)-binding protein, tentatively designated calgizzarin, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from chicken gizzard smooth muscle by W-7 (N-(6-aminohexyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide))-Sepharose affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Application of W-7-Sepharose affinity chromatography to various tissues revealed that calgizzarin-like proteins were abundant in bovine aorta and rabbit lung. Using the same procedure, we could purify a calgizzarin-like protein from rabbit lung. Calgizzarin has a Mr of 13,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and approximately 30,000 as determined by gel filtration on a TSK G 3000SW high performance liquid chromatography column, suggesting that calgizzarin seems to be a rodlike protein. The isoelectric point of calgizzarin was found to be pH 5.8. Calgizzarin can exist as a dimer by forming a disulfide bridge. The 45Ca autoradiographic technique showed that the protein binds to Ca2+. On an alkaline/urea gel, calgizzarin migrated faster in the presence of EGTA than in the presence of CaCl2, thereby indicating a Ca(2+)-dependent conformational change in this protein. The partial amino acid sequence (65 amino acid residues) of calgizzarin was seen to be SLLAVFQRYAGREGDNLKLSKKEFRTFMNTELASFTKNQKDPAVVDRMMKRLDINSDGQLDFQEF, and two putative Ca(2+)-binding sites (GREGDNLKLSKKE and D INSDGQLDFQE) were detected. So far as the obtained 65-amino acid sequence is concerned, calgizzarin has approximately a 50% sequence homology with S-100 alpha, 47% with S-100 beta, and 39% with pEL-98 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1491884957,"We have identified, by a combination of ligand, 45Ca2+, and immunoblotting, two large membrane proteins akin to the mammalian so-called low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) in chicken tissues. LRP has thus far been demonstrated only in mammalian species where it is thought to act as a receptor for proteinase-alpha 2-macroglobulin complexes and/or chylomicron remnants, lipoproteins not produced in birds. One of the chicken LRPs was demonstrated in liver, and has the same apparent Mr and hallmark biochemical properties as rat liver LRP. The other chicken LRP is smaller (approximately 380 kDa) and is expressed in ovarian follicles, but is undetectable in liver. Immunological analysis demonstrated a lack of cross-reactivity between the two LRPs, as well as between them and the previously identified chicken oocyte-specific 95-kDa receptor for the yolk precursors, very low density lipoprotein, and vitellogenin (Stifani, S., Barber, D. L., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W. J. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 1955-1959). As shown by ligand blotting, both chicken LRPs have the ability to interact with vitellogenin, a property they share not only with rat LRP, but also with mammalian LDL receptors. To obtain independent confirmation of the ligand blotting results, the smaller (follicular) LRP was purified and high-affinity binding of vitellogenin to it was demonstrated by a solid-phase filtration binding assay. Amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments of the smaller LRP were obtained, and its homology with human LRP demonstrated through unambiguous alignment of three fragments. Both chicken LRPs, the chicken oocyte 95-kDa receptor, as well as rat LRP, could be shown by ligand blotting to interact specifically with chicken serum alpha 2-macroglobulin. In addition, human apolipoprotein E, a ligand implicated in receptor-mediated metabolism of chylomicron remnants, also binds to the smaller chicken LRP, further emphasizing the similarities between LDL receptors and related proteins from a variety of species. In analogy to the known dichotomy of chicken LDL receptors, which is characterized by the production of the 95-kDa oocyte-specific receptor on one hand and a 130-kDa LDL receptor that is exclusively expressed in somatic cells (Hayashi, K., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3131-3139), it appears that the smaller and larger chicken LRPs also may be restricted to the oocyte and somatic cells, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1591841346,"It has been reported that the sequence Tyr20-X-Arg-Phe23 present within the cytoplasmic tail of the transferrin receptor may represent a tyrosine internalization signal (Collawn, J.F., Stangel, M., Kuhn, L.A., Esekogwu, V., Jing, S., Trowbridge, I.S., and Tainer, J. A. (1990) Cell 63, 1061-1072). However, as Tyr20 is not conserved between species (Alvarez, E., Girones, N., and Davis, R. J. (1990) Biochem. J. 267, 31-35), the functional role of the putative tyrosine internalization signal is not clear. To address this question, we constructed a series of 32 deletions and point mutations within the cytoplasmic tail of the human transferrin receptor. The effect of these mutations on the apparent first order rate constant for receptor endocytosis was examined. It was found that the region of the cytoplasmic tail that is proximal to the transmembrane domain (residues 28-58) is dispensable for rapid endocytosis. In contrast, the distal region of the cytoplasmic tail (residues 1-27) was found to be both necessary and sufficient for the rapid internalization of the transferrin receptor. The region identified includes Tyr20-X-Arg-Phe23, but is significantly larger than this tetrapeptide. It is therefore likely that structural information in addition to the proposed tyrosine internalization signal is required for endocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether a heterologous tyrosine internalization signal (from the low density lipoprotein receptor) could function to cause the rapid endocytosis of the transferrin receptor. It was observed that this heterologous tyrosine internalization signal did not allow rapid endocytosis. We conclude that the putative tyrosine internalization signal (Tyr20-Thr-Arg-Phe23) is not sufficient to determine rapid endocytosis of the transferrin receptor. The data reported here indicate that the transferrin receptor internalization signal is formed by a larger cytoplasmic tail structure located at the amino terminus of the receptor."

Several potential binding sites for transcription factors, including the recognition sequences for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and octamer-binding proteins (Oct) have been described in the 5'-flanking region of the human LPL gene. To identify elements which regulate the expression of LPL in adipocytes, plasmids containing deletion mutants of the 5'-LPL promoter region and the luciferase reporter gene were transfected in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Deletions at -724, -565, -461, -368, -232, -167, -92, -35, and -17 relative to the transcriptional start site modified transcription from 100 to 162, 194, 185, 128, 63, 53, 29, and 0%, respectively, indicating the presence of negative (-724 to -565) and positive (-368 to -35) cis-acting regulatory elements. Transfection of HepG2 cells, which do not synthesize LPL, with the same constructs resulted in a similar pattern of expression for the majority of the deletions. However, deletions between -724 and -368 base pairs resulted in a 75-100% increase in transcription in 3T3 adipocytes but not in HepG2 cells, indicating the presence of tissue-specific regulatory element(s) in this region. An important regulatory element affecting LPL transcription in adipocytes was identified by gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprint analysis. Using these techniques, a nuclear protein(s) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was shown to bind specifically to a fragment which included the proximal octamer recognition site (from -46 to -39) present in the LPL promoter. The DNA-protein complex comigrates with an electrophoretic band containing the Oct-1-DNA complex in BJA-B nuclear extracts and the DNA-protein complex was selectively competed only by DNA fragments containing the octamer sequence. Preincubation of 3T3-L1 nuclear extracts with an antibody directed against the POU domain of Oct-1 inhibited the formation of the DNA-protein complex. Deletion of the proximal octanucleotide motif from the plasmid containing the -461 fragment of the LPL promoter, resulted in a 79 and 76% decrease in the level of expression in transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes and HepG2 hepatocytes, respectively. These combined results have established that the expression of LPL in adipocytes is modulated by multiple positive and negative regulatory elements within the 5'-flanking region of the LPL gene. A proximal octamer binding sequence which specifically interacts with a nuclear protein(s) that exhibits the characteristics of Oct-1 has been identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1570757418,"The 5'-flanking sequence of the human prothrombin gene was isolated by screening a human liver phage library with a human prothrombin cDNA as a hybridization probe. A phage was identified that contained 3 kilobase pairs of DNA upstream of the initiator methionine codon. Primer extension studies showed that the major transcription initiation sites were located 23 and 36 base pairs upstream of the initiator codon. DNA sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the human prothrombin gene were then analyzed for cis-activating transcriptional activity by a transient expression system using the human growth hormone gene as the reporter gene. The chimeric expression vector was introduced into HepG2 cells, and secreted human growth hormone was monitored by using a radio-immunoassay. These studies showed that the 3-kilo-base pair fragment contained sequences that were sufficient for the initiation of transcription in HepG2 cells. Subsequent deletion studies showed that the 3-kilobase pair fragment contained two elements: a weak promoter in the region immediately upstream of the mRNA coding sequence and an enhancer located between nucleotides -860 and -940. The enhancer element was active at a distance and in either orientation. In addition, the enhancer was liver cell-specific and acted on heterologous promoters including the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and the mouse metallothionein I promoter. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the enhancer with a DNA sequence data base showed the enhancer sequence to be unique. The enhancer sequence is flanked by an inverted repeat 5' CCTCCC 3' and contains a putative binding site for hepatic nuclear factor 1. Deoxyribonuclease I footprint analysis and linker scanning mutagenesis showed that the enhancer contains multiple protein binding motifs. Mutagenesis of the 3' boundary CCTCCC sequence eliminated the enhancer activity. Comparison with other liver genes showed the presence of the CCTCCC sequence in the hepatitis B virus enhancer, the alpha 1-antitrypsin promoter, and the fibrinogen beta-chain promoter, suggesting a functional role for this motif."
https://openalex.org/W1560489569,"pBR322 DNA can be replicated via a DNA A-dependent pathway mediated by its binding to the two DNA A-binding sites (dnaA boxes) present near the plasmid origin. DNA synthesis requires the transcription of RNA II (the leading-strand primer precursor) to generate a specific unwound structure in the region containing the dnaA boxes. In this structure, the DNA containing the dnaA boxes can take the form of either a RNA II-parental H strand pBR322 DNA hybrid opposed by the displaced parental L strand (in the absence of RNase H and DNA polymerase I), or a nascent leading strand-parental H strand DNA duplex opposed by the displaced parental L strand (in the presence of RNase H and DNA polymerase I). These findings defined three types of potential sites for productive DNA A binding: (i) the displaced parental L single strand, (ii) a hairpin formed by the inverted repeat of the two dnaA boxes, and (iii) either the RNA-DNA duplex or the nascent leading strand-parental DNA duplex. By using a combination of: (i) inhibition of the replication of a plasmid carrying oriC by oligonucleotides of various dnaA box sequences and conformation, (ii) a gel mobility shift assay to measure DNA A binding to the same oligonucleotide substrates, (iii) replication of pBR322 DNA templates with either one or no dnaA box, and (iv) photocross-linking to demonstrate DNA A binding to an RNA-DNA hybrid, evidence is presented here that DNA A-mediated pBR322 DNA replication proceeds by a mechanism in which DNA A binds to the duplex side of the unwound origin structures and loads the DNA B protein in trans to the displaced parental L strand DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1589293066,"Prothrombinase assembly was studied on macroscopic planar bilayers consisting of 20% dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine (DOPS) and 80% dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). The dissociation constant for the binding of factor Xa to the bilayer, measured by ellipsometry, was Kd = 47 +/- 8 nM (mean +/- S.D.) and this value was lowered to Kd = 2.2 +/- 0.3 pM by preadsorption of factor Va. This latter value was determined from direct measurement of steady-state thrombin production. A comparable value of Kd = 1.0 +/- 0.1 pM was found by repeating these experiments in suspensions of phospholipid vesicles, and it was verified that prothrombinase assembly was not influenced by the addition of prothrombin. Using a minute amount (0.094 fmol cm-2) of preadsorbed factor Va, it was found that the rate of prothrombinase assembly exceeds the rate of collisions between Xa molecules from the buffer and the sparse Va molecules on the bilayer. Apparently, factor Xa adsorbs first to the membrane and then associates rapidly with factor Va by lateral diffusion. The data indicate almost instantaneous equilibrium of this complex formation on the surface with a lower limit for the bimolecular rate constant of kon = 2.8 x 10(13) (mol/cm2)-1 s-1. In suspensions of small phospholipid vesicles, prothrombinase assembly is collisionally limited and the value of kon should be proportional to vesicle diameter. This was verified with a method for estimation of kon values from thrombin generation curves. Values of 0.36 x 10(9) and 1.6 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 were found for vesicles of 20-30- and 60-80-nm diameter, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1520583513,"Retinoic acid (RA) treatment of T-47D human breast cancer cells results in a rapid decrease in the concentration of progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA which causes a slow loss of cellular PR protein (Clarke, C. L., Roman, S. D., Graham, J., Koga, M., Sutherland, R. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12694-12700). The mechanisms involved are unknown and this study was undertaken to determine whether the decline in PR mRNA was due to transcriptional inhibition and to evaluate the functional consequences of the RA-mediated decrease in PR. The transcription rate of the PR gene was decreased by RA, and the effect was maximal 2-3 h after treatment. Cycloheximide cotreatment was unable to relieve the inhibitory effect of RA and PR transcription suggesting that the effect was not dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. There was no effect of RA on PR mRNA half-life at the times examined (0-6 h of RA treatment). To determine the functional consequence of PR down-regulation the progestin-responsive plasmid pMSG-CAT was expressed transiently in T-47D cells which were then exposed to RA for 24 h. RA-pretreated cells were then treated with the synthetic progestin ORG 2058 and the extent of progestin stimulation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity measured. ORG 2058 treatment resulted in an induction of CAT activity which was maximal at a progestin concentration of 1 nM. Interestingly, the ability of ORG 2058 to induce CAT activity was decreased in RA-pretreated cells. The diminished progestin responsiveness of RA-pretreated cells was confirmed in separate experiments which showed that the progestin inducibility of TGF-alpha mRNA was also decreased in cells treated with ORG 2058 following pretreatment with RA for 24 h. These data demonstrate that RA decreases PR mRNA concentrations by direct transcriptional inhibition, leading to decreased cellular PR concentrations. The decreased levels of PR result in impaired responsiveness to progestins and this suggests that RA derived from dietary vitamin A may have a role in modulating cellular sensitivity to progestins."
https://openalex.org/W1599990654,"Multiple forms of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, which have been separated and characterized in the accompanying manuscript (Lopez-Rodas, G., Georgieva, E. I., Sendra, R., and Loidl, P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18745-18750), together with in vivo acetate incorporation, were studied during the germination of Zea mays embryos. Total histone acetyltransferase activity increases during germination with two maxima at 40 and 72 h after start of germination. This fluctuation is mainly due to the cytoplasmic B-enzyme which predominantly acetylates histone H4 up to the diacetylated form. The nuclear histone acetyltransferase A2, specific for H3, is low throughout germination, except at 24 h, when it transiently becomes the main activity. Both enzymes are also present in the dry embryo, whereas the second nuclear enzyme A1, specific for H3 and H4, is absent in the initial stage of differentiation. The two histone deacetylases, HD1 and HD2, exhibit entirely different patterns. Whereas HD1 activity is low in the dry embryo and increases during germination, HD2 is the predominant enzyme at the start of differentiation, but almost disappears at later stages. Analysis of the in vivo acetate incorporation reveals that H4 is present in up to tetraacetylated subspecies. The pattern of acetate incorporation into core histones closely resembles the fluctuations of histone acetyltransferase B. Based on the analysis of thymidine kinase activity a close correlation was established between histone acetyltransferase B and DNA replication, whereas the A2 enzyme is associated with transcriptional activity. Histone deacetylase HD1 obviously serves a specific function in the dry embryo and could be a prerequisite for DNA repair processes. The study confirms the idea of DNA repair processes. The study confirms the idea of multiple functions of histone acetylation and assigns distinct enzymes, involved in this modification, to certain nuclear processes."
https://openalex.org/W1504799171,"To determine whether RsrI endonuclease recognizes and cleaves the sequence GAATTC in duplex DNA similarly to its isoschizomer EcoRI we initiated a functional comparison of the two enzymes. Equilibrium binding experiments showed that at 20 degrees C RsrI endonuclease binds to specific and nonspecific sequences in DNA with affinities similar to those of EcoRI. At 0 degrees C the affinity of RsrI for its specific recognition sequence is reduced 7-fold whereas the affinity for noncanonical sequences remains relatively unchanged. Unlike EcoRI, incubation of RsrI endonuclease with N-ethylmaleimide inactivates the enzyme; however, preincubation with DNA prevents the inactivation. The N-ethylmaleimide-treated enzyme fails to bind DNA as assayed by gel mobility shift assays. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of RsrI and EcoRI endonucleases suggests that modification of Cys245 is responsible for the inactivation. Fe(II). EDTA and methidiumpropyl-EDTA.Fe(II) footprinting results indicate that RsrI, like EcoRI, protects 12 base pairs from cleavage when bound to its specific recognition sequence in the absence of Mg2+. RsrI bends DNA by approximately 50 degrees, as determined by measuring the relative electrophoretic mobilities of specific RsrI-DNA complexes with the binding site in the center or near the end of the DNA fragment. This value is similar to that reported for EcoRI. RsrI also unwinds the DNA helix by 25 degrees +/- 5 degrees, a value close to that reported for EcoRI endonuclease. Collectively, these results indicate that the overall structural changes induced in the DNA by the binding of RsrI and EcoRI endonucleases to DNA in the absence of Mg2+ are similar. In the accompanying paper (Aiken, C. R., McLaughlin, L. W., and Gumport, R. I. (1991) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1548448107,"Abstract The role of a Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism in the generation of agonist-induced increases of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was studied in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. In single cells, repetitive stimulations with caffeine at 200-s intervals evoked reproducible spikes of [Ca2+]i. Ryanodine, an agent that interacts with the CICR channel of muscle, inhibited the caffeine-induced spikes of [Ca2+]i in a way. High affinity binding sites for [3H]ryanodine (Kd 3.3 nM, Bmax 26 fmol/mg protein) were also detected in membranes from chromaffin cells, supporting the presence of a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive CICR channel. Pretreatment of single cells with caffeine + ryanodine to reduce the size of the caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ compartment inhibited a subsequent spike of [Ca2+]i evoked by histamine, a D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-forming agonist. This demonstrates that a significant portion of the Ca2+ released by histamine comes from a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive pool. Ryanodine inhibited by 50% the size of [Ca2+]i spikes evoked by repetitive stimulation with histamine and did so in a use-dependent manner. These data suggest that, in addition to D-myoinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, activation of a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive CICR channel participates in the generation of histamine-induced release of intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1485491605,"Full-length cDNA clones for succinyltransferase of the rat alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex were isolated from rat heart cDNA libraries in lambda gt11. The cDNA clones were identified as those for rat succinyltransferase by the identity of their predicted amino acid sequence with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of rat succinyltransferase determined by protein chemical analysis and the known amino acid sequence of bovine succinyltransferase. The clone with the longest cDNA consisted of 2747 base pairs and coded for a leader peptide of 56 amino acid residues and a mature protein of 386 amino acid residues. The primary structure of rat succinyltransferase showed close similarity to Escherichia coli and Azotobacter vinelandii succinyltransferases, in the COOH-terminal part forming the lipoyl-binding domain and the NH2-terminal part forming the inner core-catalytic domain. However, the rat succinyltransferase did not contain a sequence motif that has been found as an E3- and/or E1-binding site in the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferases of three alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (Hummel, K.

https://openalex.org/W1551666220,"DEAE-Sepharose chromatography of extracts from Zea mays meristematic cells revealed multiple histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase enzyme forms. An improved method for nuclear isolation allowed us to discriminate nuclear and cytoplasmic enzymes. Two nuclear histone acetyltransferases, A1 and A2, a cytoplasmic B-enzyme and two nuclear histone deacetylases, HD1 and HD2, have been identified. The histone specificity of the different enzyme forms has been studied in an in vitro system, using chicken erythrocyte histones as substrate. The cytoplasmic histone acetyltransferase B is the predominant enzyme, which acetylates mainly histone H4 and to a lesser extent H2A. The nuclear histone acetyltransferase A1 preferentially acetylates H3 and also H4, whereas enzyme A2 is specific for H3. This substrate specificity was confirmed with homologous Z. mays histones. The two histone deacetylases differ from each other with respect to ionic strength dependence, inhibition by acetate and butyrate, and substrate specificity. The strong inhibitory effect of acetate on histone deacetylases was exploited to distinguish different histone acetyltransferase forms."
https://openalex.org/W1603530183,"Previous independent studies suggested that type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the p34cdc2 protein kinase cell cycle regulator co-localize at centrosomes. In order to investigate whether there is an association of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase with p34cdc2 in human fibroblasts, we used three different approaches. First, the regulatory subunits RI and RII were photoaffinity-labeled with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP, and anti-p34cdc2 immunoprecipitates were screened for the presence of either RI or RII regulatory subunits by one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Second, anti-RII alpha immunoprecipitates were screened for the presence of p34cdc2 by Western blot using three different affinity-purified antibodies recognizing different domains of human p34cdc2. Conversely, anti-p34cdc2 immunoprecipitates (three different antibodies), as well as the material retained on p13suc1-Sepharose Bio-Beads, which binds specifically p34cdc2, were screened for the presence of RII alpha. Finally, we have looked for cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity specifically inhibited by PKI in immunoprecipitates obtained from extracts treated with different anti-p34cdc2 antibodies. All these experiments gave concordant results and demonstrate that at least at G0/G1, human fibroblasts contain a complex of active type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase associated through its RII alpha subunit with p34cdc2."

The kinetics of RsrI cleavage are affected by each substitution, with the effects being generally more deleterious than with EcoRI, as shown by the greater reduction in the specificity constant kcat/KM. The magnitudes of the effects of several substitutions are consistent with the formation of direct enzyme-nucleobase contacts at the indicated positions. With substrates containing 2-amino-purine or 2,6-diaminopurine at the central adenine or uracil at the outermost thymine in the recognition sequence, cleavage by RsrI was very slow, less than one-tenth the rate of the corresponding EcoRI-catalyzed reaction. The lower tolerance of RsrI endonuclease for functional group changes in its recognition site may reflect differences in the mechanisms of DNA recognition by the two enzymes. Although RsrI and EcoRI endonucleases bind with similar affinities to specific and nonspecific DNA sequences and appear to introduce similar structural distortions in DNA upon binding, the use of substrate analogues reveals significant differences at the level of catalysis in the mechanisms by which these two endonucleases recognize the duplex sequence GAATTC."
https://openalex.org/W1545346032,"Human C5 cDNA fragments were used to identify five overlapping cosmid clones that spanned the entire C5 gene. Partial sequencing and Southern analysis of the clones were performed to identify intron/exon boundaries and to map intron size. The human C5 gene is 79 kilobases in length and is comprised of 41 exons. Comparison of C5 with the homologous family members C3 and C4 revealed striking similarities in exon size and number. Less, although significant similarities were also observed with the family member alpha 2-macroglobulin. The transcriptional start site for the C5 gene was observed as a doublet at positions 29 and 28 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon. The 5‘-flanking region of the gene contains sequences homologous with several known responsive elements, including interferon, interleukin-6, glucocorticoid, estrogen, NF-kappa B, and HNF-1. Two previously identified truncated cDNAs, pHC5A and pHC5B, contain 21 and 16 exons, respectively. The last exon in pHC5A, designated exon 21a, is a product of alternative splicing and is not present in the major full-length transcript. Truncation of pHC5A is the result of an alternative polyadenylation signal located in exon 21a. In pHC5B, exon 16 is extended on the 3‘ end by additional flanking genomic sequence that also contains an alternative polyadenylation signal."
https://openalex.org/W1490631017,"The molecular structure of a high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) isolated from the purple photosynthetic bacterium, Ectothiorhodospira halophila strain BN9626, has been solved by x-ray diffraction analysis to a nominal resolution of 2.5 A and refined to a crystallographic R value of 18.4% including all measured x-ray data from 30.0- to 2.5-A resolution. Crystals used in the investigation contained two molecules/asymmetric unit and belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 60.00 A, b = 31.94 A, c = 40.27 A, and beta = 100.5 degrees. An interpretable electron density map, obtained by combining x-ray data from one isomorphous heavy atom derivative with non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening, clearly showed that this high potential iron-sulfur protein contains 71 amino acid residues, rather than 70 as originally reported. As in other bacterial ferredoxins, the [4Fe-4S] cluster adopts a cubane-like conformation and is ligated to the protein via four cysteinyl sulfur ligands. The overall secondary structure of the E. halophila HiPIP is characterized by a series of Type I and Type II turns allowing the polypeptide chain to wrap around the [4Fe-4S] prosthetic group. The hydrogen bonding pattern around the cluster is nearly identical to that originally observed in the 85-amino acid residue Chromatium vinosum HiPIP and consequently, the 240 mV difference in redox potentials between these two proteins cannot be simply attributed to hydrogen bonding patterns alone."
https://openalex.org/W1492226735,"Limited trypsinization of rat fatty acid synthase monomers results in cleavage at sites protected in the native dimer. A 47,000-Da polypeptide containing the transferase component was isolated from the digest and its location in the multifunctional polypeptide established. Both acetyl and malonyl moieties are transferred stoichiometrically from CoA ester to this polypeptide and each can replace the other, confirming that a single common site is utilized in the loading of these substrates onto the fatty acid synthase. Transferase activity of the 47,000-Da polypeptide decreases with increasing acyl donor chain length (malonyl = acetyl greater than butyryl greater than hexanoyl greater than octanoyl). Activity is inhibited by certain thiol-directed reagents, and protection is afforded by substrate suggesting the presence of a sensitive cysteine residue near the substrate binding site. The transferase was also able to utilize as acyl acceptor the Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein and the acyl carrier protein domain of the multifunctional fatty acid synthase. When the fatty acid synthase monomer was trypsinized under milder conditions, the 47,000-Da transferase domain could be isolated in association with the 8,000-Da acyl carrier protein domain. The transferase was capable of translocating substrate moieties from CoA ester donors to the associated acyl carrier protein. The results provide the first direct evidence that, in the head-to-tail oriented fatty acid synthase homodimer, functional communication between the transferase domain located near the end of one polypeptide and the acyl carrier protein domain located at the opposite end of the other polypeptide is facilitated by a stable physical interaction between these domains."
https://openalex.org/W2110432921,"Lysine 269 in Escherichia coli tryptophan indole-lyase (tryptophanase) has been changed to arginine by site-directed mutagenesis. The resultant K269R mutant enzyme exhibits kcat values about 10% those of the wild-type enzyme with S-(o-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine, L-tryptophan, and S-benzyl-L-cysteine, while kcat/Km values are reduced to 2% or less. The pH profile of kcat/Km for S-benzyl-L-cysteine for the mutant enzyme exhibits two pK alpha values which are too close to separate, with an average value of 7.6, while the wild-type enzyme exhibits pK alpha values of 6.0 and 7.8. The pK alpha for the interconversion of the 335 and 412 nm forms of the K269R enzyme is 8.3, while the wild-type enzyme exhibits a pK alpha of 7.4. Steady-state kinetic isotope effects on the reaction of [alpha-2H]S-benzyl-L-cysteine with the K269R mutant enzyme (Dkcat = 2.0; D(kcat/Km) = 3.9) are larger than those of the wild-type enzyme (Dkcat = 1.4; D(kcat/Km) = 2.9). Rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic studies demonstrate that the K269R mutant enzyme does not accumulate quinonoid intermediates with L-alanine, L-tryptophan, or S-methyl-L-cysteine, but does form quinonoid absorption peaks in complexes with S-benzyl-L-cysteine and oxidolyl-L-alanine, whereas wild-type enzyme forms prominent quinonoid bands with all these amino acids. Single wavelength stopped-flow kinetic studies demonstrate that the alpha-deprotonation of S-benzyl-L-cysteine is 6-fold slower in the K269R mutant enzyme, while the intrinsic deuterium kinetic isotope effect is less for the K269R enzyme (Dk = 4.2) than for the wild-type (Dk = 7.9). The decay of the K269R quinonoid intermediate in the presence of benzimidazole is 7.1-fold slower than that of the wild-type enzyme. These results demonstrate that Lys-269 plays a significant role in the conformational changes or electrostatic effects obligatory to the formation and decomposition of the quinonoid intermediate, although it is not an essential basic residue."
https://openalex.org/W1531512516,"The CheR methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to specific glutamyl residues in bacterial chemoreceptor proteins. Studies with sulfhydryl reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) suggest that a cysteine residue is required for enzyme activity. The nucleotide sequence of the cheR gene predicts a 288-amino acid protein with cysteine residues at positions 31 and 229. To ascertain the role of these cysteine residues in the structure and function of the enzyme, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to change each cysteine to serine. Whereas the Cys229-Ser mutation had essentially no effect on transferase activity, the Cys31-Ser mutation caused an 80% decrease in enzyme activity. The double mutant in which both cysteines were replaced by serines also had markedly reduced transferase activity. Preincubation of the wild type or Cys229-Ser proteins with either S-adenosylmethionine or beta-mercaptoethanol protected it from inhibition by sulfhydryl reagents, whereas prior incubation with the second substrate, the Tar receptor, gave partial protection. From these studies, Cys31 appears to be necessary for enzyme activity, and it seems to be located in the vicinity of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1557585018,"p21ras specific antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate p21ras polypeptides from human A431 cells. In addition to p21ras, this antiserum precipitated a series of polypeptides with relative molecular weights of 150,000, 120,000, 105,000, and 50,000. The precipitation of these polypeptides was prevented by preincubation of the antiserum with an excess of purified Ras protein. These polypeptides do not share an epitope with p21ras, and two of them (120 and 150 kDa) copurify with a fraction of p21ras. The co-precipitation of p21ras with these polypeptides was detected in a variety of cell types. The pattern of the immunoprecipitates was consistently different in normal and ras-transformed cells. The 120- and 150-kDa polypeptides are phosphorylated on serine and threonine in A431 cells. Serum treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in the phosphoserine content of the 120-kDa polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1571665637,"A family of 12 different mixed ligand complexes of iron with cyanide and substituted 1,10-phenanthroline was prepared. The electron transfer properties of each reagent were systematically manipulated by varying the substituent(s) on the aromatic ring system and the stoichiometry of the two types of ligands in the complex. Values for the standard reduction potentials of each member of this family of electron transfer reagents were determined and spanned from 500 to 900 mV. The one-electron transfer reactions between each of these substitution-inert reagents and the high potential blue copper protein, rusticyanin, from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans were studied by stopped flow spectrophotometry under acidic conditions. For comparison with the protein results, the kinetics of electron transfer between each of these reagents and sulfatoiron were also investigated. The Marcus theory of electron transfer was successfully applied to this set of kinetic data to demonstrate that 10 of the 12 reagents had equal kinetic access to the redox center of the rusticyanin and utilized the same reaction pathway for electron transfer. The utility of these synthetic electron transfer reagents in characterizing the electron transfer properties of very high potential, redox-active metalloproteins is illustrated."
https://openalex.org/W2145826213,"In vitro, Escherichia coli RecA protein acts upon gapped and partially homologous linear duplex DNA to generate recombination products linked by Holliday junctions. When strand exchange reactions are supplemented with purified RecBCD enzyme, we observe the formation of products that resemble recombinants. The formation of splice recombinant products was not observed. The individual subunits, RecB, RecC, or RecD, had no effect on RecA protein-mediated strand exchange nor on the Holliday junctions formed in the reaction. Analysis of the way in which patch products arise indicates exonucleolytic digestion of the linear arms of the recombination intermediates (alpha-structures) by RecBCD enzyme. We find no evidence for specific resolution events at the site of the Holliday junction by RecBCD enzyme using these DNA substrates."
