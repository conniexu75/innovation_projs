https://openalex.org/W2086802238,"Climatic and soil factors which affect the movement of radiostrontium in soils are discussed. A mathematical model of strontium movement through soils was developed from the results of laboratory experiments. It is concluded that if soils over the earth should be seriously contaminated through weapon testing or radiological warfare, the natural processes of soil purification through leaching would proceed at different rates in different areas.

https://openalex.org/W2076182680,"THE numerous paper chromatographic methods1–3 so far presented for the separation of corticosteroids all have limitations; our results may therefore be of interest. We have found that by impregnating the papers with a 90 per cent methanol solution we could separate the corticosteroids rapidly at room temperature (16–20°C.). The method also works for prednisone and prednisolone (Table 1). Furthermore, it is suitable for quantitative and semi-quantitative determinations."

The clear statement by Clift and Cook1 regarding the ready thermal decarboxylation of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones of oxaloacetic and acetoacetic acids has sometimes been overlooked, particularly in the use of melting points as a means of identification. Some of our observations bear on the problem."
