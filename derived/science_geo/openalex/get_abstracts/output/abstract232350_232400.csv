https://openalex.org/W2070161878,"Recently, artificially constructed metamaterials have become of considerable interest, because these materials can exhibit electromagnetic characteristics unlike those of any conventional materials. Artificial magnetism and negative refractive index are two specific types of behavior that have been demonstrated over the past few years, illustrating the new physics and new applications possible when we expand our view as to what constitutes a material. In this review, we describe recent advances in metamaterials research and discuss the potential that these materials may hold for realizing new and seemingly exotic electromagnetic phenomena."

It is essential for diverse applications ranging from miniature lasers and light-emitting diodes1,2,3,4,5, to single-photon sources for quantum information6,7,8, and to solar energy harvesting9. To explore such new quantum optics applications, a suitably tailored dielectric environment is required in which the vacuum fluctuations that control spontaneous emission can be manipulated10,11. Photonic crystals provide such an environment: they strongly modify the vacuum fluctuations, causing the decay of emitted light to be accelerated or slowed down12,13, to reveal unusual statistics14, or to be completely inhibited in the ideal case of a photonic bandgap1,15. Here we study spontaneous emission from semiconductor quantum dots embedded in inverse opal photonic crystals16. We show that the spectral distribution and time-dependent decay of light emitted from excitons confined in the quantum dots are controlled by the host photonic crystal. Modified emission is observed over large frequency bandwidths of 10%, orders of magnitude larger than reported for resonant optical microcavities17. Both inhibited and enhanced decay rates are observed depending on the optical emission frequency, and they are controlled by the crystals' lattice parameter. Our experimental results provide a basis for all-solid-state dynamic control of optical quantum systems18."
https://openalex.org/W2090705553,"It is generally accepted that magnetic order in an insulator requires the cation to have partially filled shells of d or f electrons. Here we show that thin films of hafnium dioxide (HfO2), an insulating oxide better known as a dielectric layer for nanoscale electronic devices, can be ferromagnetic even without doping. This discovery challenges our understanding of magnetism in insulators, because neither Hf4+ nor O2- are magnetic ions and the d and f shells of the Hf4+ ion are either empty or full."

Using human tissue culture cells, we show that promoter-directed siRNA inhibits transcription of an integrated, proviral, elongation factor 1alpha (EF1A) promoter–green fluorescent protein reporter gene and of endogenous EF1A. Silencing was associated with DNA methylation of the targeted sequence, and it required either active transport of siRNA into the nucleus or permeabilization of the nuclear envelope by lentiviral transduction. These results demonstrate that siRNA-directed transcriptional silencing is conserved in mammals, providing a means to inhibit mammalian gene function."

https://openalex.org/W2156470002,"The Mars Exploration Rover Spirit and its Athena science payload have been used to investigate a landing site in Gusev crater. Gusev is hypothesized to be the site of a former lake, but no clear evidence for lacustrine sedimentation has been found to date. Instead, the dominant lithology is basalt, and the dominant geologic processes are impact events and eolian transport. Many rocks exhibit coatings and other characteristics that may be evidence for minor aqueous alteration. Any lacustrine sediments that may exist at this location within Gusev apparently have been buried by lavas that have undergone subsequent impact disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2022827866,"The events that occur during the fusion of double-membraned mitochondria are unknown. As an essential step toward determining the mechanism of mitochondrial fusion, we have captured this event in vitro. Mitochondrial outer and inner membrane fusion events were separable and mechanistically distinct, but both required guanosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis. Homotypic trans interactions of the ancient outer transmembrane guanosine triphosphatase, Fzo1, were required to promote the fusion of mitochondrial outer membranes, whereas electrical potential was also required for fusion of inner membranes. Our conclusions provide fundamental insights into the molecular events driving mitochondrial fusion and advance our understanding of the evolution of mitochondrial fusion in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2124556397,"The magnitude of heat and salt transfer between the Indian and Atlantic oceans through ‘Agulhas leakage’ is considered important for balancing the global thermohaline circulation1,2,3. Increases or reductions of this leakage lead to strengthening or weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning and associated variation of North Atlantic Deep Water formation4,5,6. Here we show that modern Agulhas waters, which migrate into the south Atlantic Ocean in the form of an Agulhas ring, contain a characteristic assemblage of planktic foraminifera. We use this assemblage as a modern analogue to investigate the Agulhas leakage history over the past 550,000 years from a sediment record in the Cape basin. Our reconstruction indicates that Indian–Atlantic water exchange was highly variable: enhanced during present and past interglacials and largely reduced during glacial intervals. Coherent variability of Agulhas leakage with northern summer insolation suggests a teleconnection to the monsoon system. The onset of increased Agulhas leakage during late glacial conditions took place when glacial ice volume was maximal, suggesting a crucial role for Agulhas leakage in glacial terminations, timing of interhemispheric climate change7 and the resulting resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation6."

https://openalex.org/W2007939145,"The fundamental building block of the copper oxide superconductors is a Cu4O4 square plaquette. The plaquettes in most of these materials are slightly distorted to form a rectangular lattice, for which an influential theory predicts that high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity is nucleated in ‘stripes’ aligned along one of the axes1,2,3. This theory received strong support from experiments that indicated a one-dimensional character for the magnetic excitations in the high-Tc material YBa2Cu3O6.6 (ref. 4). Here we report neutron scattering data on ‘untwinned’ YBa2Cu3O6+x crystals, in which the orientation of the rectangular lattice is maintained throughout the entire volume. Contrary to the earlier claim4, we demonstrate that the geometry of the magnetic fluctuations is two-dimensional. Rigid stripe arrays therefore appear to be ruled out over a wide range of doping levels in YBa2Cu3O6+x, but the data may be consistent with liquid-crystalline stripe order5. The debate about stripes has therefore been reopened."
https://openalex.org/W2026108752,"Archaeopteryx, the earliest known flying bird (avialan) from the Late Jurassic period, exhibits many shared primitive characters with more basal coelurosaurian dinosaurs (the clade including all theropods more bird-like than Allosaurus), such as teeth, a long bony tail and pinnate feathers. However, Archaeopteryx possessed asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail, together with a wing feather arrangement shared with modern birds. This suggests some degree of powered flight capability but, until now, little was understood about the extent to which its brain and special senses were adapted for flight. We investigated this problem by computed tomography scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction of the braincase of the London specimen of Archaeopteryx. Here we show the reconstruction of the braincase from which we derived endocasts of the brain and inner ear. These suggest that Archaeopteryx closely resembled modern birds in the dominance of the sense of vision and in the possession of expanded auditory and spatial sensory perception in the ear. We conclude that Archaeopteryx had acquired the derived neurological and structural adaptations necessary for flight. An enlarged forebrain suggests that it had also developed enhanced somatosensory integration with these special senses demanded by a lifestyle involving flying ability."

https://openalex.org/W2761887593,"Over the six years since the discovery of the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425, which was associated with the nearby (distance approximately 40 Mpc) supernova 1998bw, astronomers have debated fiercely the nature of this event. Relative to bursts located at cosmological distance (redshift z approximately 1), GRB 980425 was under-luminous in gamma-rays by three orders of magnitude. Radio calorimetry showed that the explosion was sub-energetic by a factor of 10. Here we report observations of the radio and X-ray afterglow of the recent GRB 031203 (refs 5-7), which has a redshift of z = 0.105. We demonstrate that it too is sub-energetic which, when taken together with the low gamma-ray luminosity, suggests that GRB 031203 is the first cosmic analogue to GRB 980425. We find no evidence that this event was a highly collimated explosion viewed off-axis. Like GRB 980425, GRB 031203 appears to be an intrinsically sub-energetic gamma-ray burst. Such sub-energetic events have faint afterglows. We expect intensive follow-up of faint bursts with smooth gamma-ray light curves (common to both GRB 031203 and 980425) to reveal a large population of such events."
https://openalex.org/W1989569988,"The cascade of events that leads to vaccinia-induced actin polymerization requires Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the viral membrane protein A36R. We found that a localized outside-in signaling cascade induced by the viral membrane protein B5R is required to potently activate Src and induce A36R phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. In addition, Src-mediated phosphorylation of A36R regulated the ability of virus particles to recruit and release conventional kinesin. Thus, Src activity regulates the transition between cytoplasmic microtubule transport and actin-based motility at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1540180599,"Panoramic Camera images at Gusev crater reveal a rock-strewn surface interspersed with high- to moderate-albedo fine-grained deposits occurring in part as drifts or in small circular swales or hollows. Optically thick coatings of fine-grained ferric ironârich dust dominate most bright soil and rock surfaces. Spectra of some darker rock surfaces and rock regions exposed by brushing or grinding show near-infrared spectral signatures consistent with the presence of mafic silicates such as pyroxene or olivine. Atmospheric observations show a steady decline in dust opacity during the mission, and astronomical observations captured solar transits by the martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, as well as a view of Earth from the martian surface."
https://openalex.org/W2082461969,"Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and TRPC protein expression were investigated in the rat-derived hippocampal H19-7 cell line. Thapsigargin-stimulated Ba2+ entry and the expression of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7 mRNA and protein were observed in proliferating H19-7 cells. When cells were placed under differentiating conditions, a change in TRPC homolog expression profile occurred. The expression of TRPC1 and TRPC3 mRNA and protein dramatically increased, while the expression of TRPC4 and TRPC7 mRNA and protein dramatically decreased; in parallel a 3.4-fold increase in the level of thapsigargin-stimulated Ba2+ entry was observed and found to be inhibited by 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane. The selective suppression of TRPC protein levels by small interfering RNA (siRNA) approaches indicated that TRPC1 and TRPC3 are involved in mediating SOCE in proliferating H19-7 cells. Although TRPC4 and TRPC7 are expressed at much higher levels than TRPC1 and TRPC3 in proliferating cells, they do not appear to mediate SOCE. The co-expression of siRNA specific for TRPC1 and TRPC3 in proliferating cells inhibited approximately the same amount of SOCE as observed with expression of either siRNA alone, suggesting that TRPC1 and TRPC3 work in tandem to mediate SOCE. Under differentiating conditions, co-expression of siRNA for TRPC1 and TRPC3 blocked the normal 3.4-fold increase in SOCE and in turn blocked the differentiation of H19-7 cells. This study suggests that placing H19-7 cells under differentiating conditions significantly alters TRPC gene expression and increases the level of SOCE and that this increase in SOCE is necessary for cell differentiation.

Ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger, which plays a key role in regulating cellular processes such as gene expression, secretion, proliferation, and apoptosis (1Villereal M.L. Byron K.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 119: 67-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 3Berridge M.J. Novartis Found. Symp. 2001; 239: 52-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration of Ca2+ is carefully controlled through regulation of a variety of membrane channels and pumps. In excitable cells, the level of Ca2+ entry is controlled primarily by well characterized voltage-gated channels, as well as a variety of ligandgated channels (4Tsien R.W. Lipscombe D. Madison D. Bley K. Fox A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 52-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Jackson M.B. Adv. Neurol. 1999; 79: 511-524PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the principal mechanism for regulating Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells is via non-voltagegated channels, such as store-operated channels (SOCs) 1The abbreviations used are: SOC, store-operated channel; ROC, receptor-operated channel; SOCE, store-operated calcium entry; TRP, transient receptor potential; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; bFGF, basic FGF; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; TG, thapsigargin; CCh, carbachol.1The abbreviations used are: SOC, store-operated channel; ROC, receptor-operated channel; SOCE, store-operated calcium entry; TRP, transient receptor potential; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; bFGF, basic FGF; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; TG, thapsigargin; CCh, carbachol. and receptor-operated channels (ROCs). SOCs are activated by emptying of the intracellular inositol trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The resulting Ca2+ entry, initially referred to as capacitative calcium entry (6Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar), is often called store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The best characterized SOC is the calcium release-activated Ca2+ channel (CRAC) seen in lymphocytes and macrophages, characterized by an inward rectifying current (ICRAC) and a high selectivity for Ca2+ (7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), but SOCs with different characteristics have been well documented in other cell systems (8Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the exact molecular configuration of SOCs has not been conclusively identified, strong evidence points to the involvement of transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins in this process (9Wu X. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C526-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11337-11343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, many of the same TRPC homologs have also been implicated in mediating receptor-operated channels (ROCs) (13Wu X. Babnigg G. Zagranichnaya T. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13597-13608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The TRP family of proteins is a wide and diverse group, both structurally and functionally. Currently, the mammalian TRP family is divided into three large groups, the TRPC subfamily (TRPC1-TRPC7), the TRPV subfamily, and the TRPM subfamily (15Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The seven mammalian TRPC proteins have been shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues, with surprisingly high levels of expression seen in the brain, an observation that raises questions concerning the role of TRPC channels in the brain. While it is clear that the type of channels reported to result from TRPC protein expression would be critical for the functioning of non-excitable cells, where there are few voltage-sensitive channels expressed, it is much less clear why excitable cells would need such channels. Excitable cells have numerous subtypes of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that mediate much larger currents than are carried by the SOCs characterized to date. Also, while SOCs can be influenced by membrane depolarization via a reduced driving force for Ca2+, a membrane depolarization would result in a decrease, instead of an increase, in Ca2+ entry via SOCs. It is more likely that SOCs, and other channels formed from TRPC proteins, are neuromodulatory for neuronal cells most likely being stimulated by agonists for G protein-coupled receptors. To pursue the importance of TRPC proteins in excitable cells, we have investigated the expression profile of TRPC proteins, as well as the existence of SOCE, in H19-7 cells, a cell culture model for hippocampal neurons. Our results establish H19-7 cells as an important cultured cell line for the future study of the physiological importance of TRPC proteins and SOCE in neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—fura 2-free acid, fura 2-AM, and pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes. Thapsigargin was purchased from LC laboratories and G418 from Mediatech. HBSS, DMEM, and Ca2+-free HBSS solutions came from Invitrogen. All other reagents were either obtained from Sigma, or their source is acknowledged when the agent is first discussed.Cultured H19-7 Hippocampal Neurons—The H19-7 cell line was established in the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Wainer in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Marsha Rosner, according to the protocol published in Eves et al. (16Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In short, the cells were isolated from the hippocampus of 19-day-old rat embryos. They were immortalized by transfecting with a temperature-sensitive version of SV40 large T antigen. For proliferation, the cells are cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated (1 mg/ml in 50 mm boric acid) coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418, and 2 mm glutamine (DMEM-proliferation medium). The cells are grown at 33 °C in humidified 5% CO2/95% air. To initiate differentiation, the cells are incubated at 39 °C and placed in N2 medium, which consists of DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418, 2mm glutamine, 31.5 ng/ml progesterone, 100 μg/ml transferin, and 30 μg/ml sodium selenate. Then 50 ng/ml of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was added to the N2 medium, and the cells were allowed to differentiate.Ca2+Imaging—[Ca2+]i concentration was measured in cells loaded with the fluorescent indicator fura 2. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 25-mm coverslips. On the morning of the experiment, cells were washed twice with HEPES-buffered HBSS, loaded for 1 h with 5 μm fura 2-AM in HBSS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin + 0.025% pluronic F-127, and then unloaded in HBSS for another 30 min. The coverslips were mounted as the bottom of a chamber that was placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope. Cells in the chamber were perfused via an eight-channel syringe system. A suction pipette maintained a constant volume of solution (∼0.5 ml) in the chamber.An InCyt IM2™ fluorescence imaging system (dual-wavelength fluorescence imaging system, Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was used to measure [Ca2+]i during the experiment. Excitation light from a xenon light source was alternately passed through 340 and 380 nm narrow pass filters mounted in a Sutter filter wheel (Lambda 10-C). The 510 nm emissions were captured by a Cooled CCD camera (Cohu 4915). The images were transmitted to a computer and processed with the imaging software InCyt IM2™ 4.6. [Ca2+]i was calculated by measuring the ratio of the two emission intensities for excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Calcium standard solutions, that were prepared with fura 2 potassium salt, were used to create a graph of fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) as a function of Ca2+ concentration (nm). This graph was then used to convert fluorescence ratios in an experiment to calcium concentrations. For experiments comparing proliferating and differentiated cells, individual cells were circled and the Ca2+ response of individual cells monitored. For the siRNA experiments in proliferating cells, a field of ∼200 cells was monitored, and an averaged response for the coverslip was recorded.In experiments in which Ba2+ influx was measured, the data are reported as the 340/380 ratio (F340/380), since the fura 2 calibration curve for Ba2+ differs from the calibration curve for Ca2+. A measure of the level of SOCE in the cells was obtained by subtracting the slope of the Ba2+ leak (before stimulation) from the slope of Ba2+ influx (after stimulation) for each cell or coverslip trace.Nominally Ca2+-free HBSS was prepared by stirring Ca2+-free, Mg2+-free, and HCO–3-free HBSS with Chelex-100 beads. After filtering out the Chelex 100 beads, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm.siRNA Constructs—For each individual rat TRPC homolog, potential siRNA target sites (19 nucleotides in length) were chosen. The potential target sites were compared with the rat genome data base using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST), and any target sequences with homology to other coding sequences were eliminated from consideration. Hairpin siRNA template oligonucleotide design was done by entering siRNA target sequences into the web-based insert design tool at the following address: www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/psilencer_converter.html. Then two complementary oligonucleotides (Table I) were synthesized, annealed, and ligated into the linearized pSilencer 3.1 H1 hygro vector (Ambion Inc.) for each siRNA target site. All procedures were performed as directed by the manufacturer's instruction manual (Ambion Inc.). The inserts were sequenced to confirm that there were no unwanted mutations. For the co-expression of siRNA for TRPC1 and TRPC3, the TRPC1 siRNA was expressed in a vector containing puromycin-selectable markers, and the cells stably expressing siRNA to TRPC3 were transfected with the siTRPC1 construct and grown in selection medium containing both hygromycin and puromycin to establish a stable cell line.Table ITarget sequences for constructing siRNA specific for TRPC homologsmRNAAccession numberOrientationHairpin oligonucleotides sequence (5′-3′) (target sequence printed in bold)Target locationrTRPC1AF061266ForwardGATCCCGGGTGACTATTATATGGTTTTCAAGAGAAACCATATAATAGTCACCCTTTTTTGGAAA246-264ReverseAGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGGGTGACTATTATATGGTTTCTCTTGAATTCCATATAATAGTCACCCGGrTRPC3NM_021771ForwardGATCCCATACGAGGTGGTGCACCTGTTCAAGAGACAGGTGCACCACCTCGTATTTTTTTGGAAA258-276ReverseAGCTTTTCCAAAAAAATACGAGGTGGTGCACCTGTCTCTTGAACAGGTGCACCACCTCGTATGGrTRPC4NM_053434ForwardGATCCTACCAAGAGGTGATGAGGATTCAAGAGATCCTCATCACCTCTTGGTATTTTTTGGAAA2165-2183ReverseAGCTTTTCCAAAAAATACCAAGAGGTGATGAGGATCTCTTGAATCCTCATCACCTCTTGGTAGHTRPC7NM_020389aWe used the human TRPC7 sequence to design this hairpin construct because the rat TRPC7 sequence was not yet available.ForwardGATCCCGCGAGAAGGGCACCAGTCTGTTCAAGAGACAGACTGGTGCCCTTCTCGTTTTTTGGAAA102-120ReverseAGCTTTTCCAAAAAACGAGAAGGGCACCAGTCTGTCTCTTGAACAGACTGGTGCCCTTCTCGCGGa We used the human TRPC7 sequence to design this hairpin construct because the rat TRPC7 sequence was not yet available.

Surviving cells after 1 week were collected and used in all experiments.Total RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated from H19-7 cells using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen Inc.) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). The RNA sample was additionally purified by ethanol precipitation and its concentration determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm.PCR Primers—PCR primers for rTRPC1 and rTRPC3–7 were designed based on published sequences in GenBank™ (Table II).Table IISequences of inner primers and outer primers for TRPC homologsmRNAAccession numberOrientationPrimer sequence (5′-3′)LocationrTRPC1AF061266ForwardTGGTGAGAAATTACCTTCGGAAC3640-3662ReverseTTTTATAAGAATTTGCCCAAAAG3808-3830rTRPC3NM_021771ForwardTTAATACCTTCACCATGCGGAG2390-2411ReverseGAACTCTTGGAGGCCAACAGG2568-2588rTRPC4NM_053434ForwardAAGGATTAGCTTCACGGGGTG2712-2732ReverseCCTCCTCCTGGGCGTGTTTC2890-2909rTRPC5NM_080898ForwardTGAGTCGTCAGGCAAACGGTC2821-2841ReverseTCCTGCCACATAGAGTGCTGC2953-2973rTRPC6NM_053559ForwardAGAAATTTGGAATTTTGGGAAG2420-2441ReverseTCCTTATCAATCTGGGCCTGC2601-2621rTRPC7XM_225159ForwardCCTGTACTCCTACTACCGAGGTGC2340-2363ReverseTGGTGACATTATAAACGCCGTAC2499-2521 Open table in a new tab RT-PCR—First-strand cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript™ III RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of oligo(dT). The mRNA samples were denaturated at 65 °C for 5 min. Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 55 min and was stopped by heating samples at 75 °C for 10 min. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using the TRPC isoform-specific primers listed in Table II and PCR Platinum Supermix reagent (Invitrogen). PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, followed by 60 °C for 1 min. After completion of the 40 cycles, samples were incubated at 60 °C for 10 min. A β-actin positive control was performed alongside the experimental samples, as well as a negative control with no reverse transcriptase. The PCR products were visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and the bands digitized using a Kodak Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System 120 with Kodak 1D 3.0 software for Macintosh computers.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system using SYBR7 Green PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems) and cDNA synthesized as described above. PCR was performed using the kit protocol in a 25-μl reaction volume. The integrity of the RT-PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis. Melting curves for rTRPC1, rTRPC3, rTRPC4, and rTRPC7 showed one specific signal. The amount of PCR products in differentiated H19-7 cells or in proliferating cells transformed with siRNA constructs was calculated in reference to the individual calibration curves based on cDNA obtained from proliferating H19-7 cells.Western Blotting—H19-7 cells (proliferating and differentiated) were grown on 10-cm dishes under the conditions described above. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na2VO4, 2 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm NaF). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit (Pierce). Total protein extract (50–150 μg) was applied on 8% SDS-PAGE (16 × 16-cm gels) and run overnight. The proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Inc.) and after 1-h blocking were treated with polyclonal anti-TRPC antibodies raised against the TRPC homolog tested. The concentrations used were as follows: anti-TRPC3, 1:200 (Alomone Laboratories); anti-TRPC1 and anti-TRPC4, 1:250 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-TRPC7, 1:500 (Abcam). Membranes were washed 4 × 15 min with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), incubated for 30 min at room temperature with secondary anti-rabbit or anti-goat antibody (1:5000 in TBS-T), washed under the same conditions, and developed with Super-Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) at a suitable time so as not to saturate the film. The films were digitized on a flatbed scanner and the relative spot intensities determined in Photoshop 6.0. The images were inverted, the bands outlined, and a measure of the average gray level and the number of pixels in the spot obtained within the histogram function. We used the product of the average gray level value and the number of pixels to represent the integrated signal in the band. Each Western blot was repeated at least three times using different cell lysates.RESULTSEndogenous Expression of TRPC Homologs—The initial goal was to determine which TRPC homologs are expressed in proliferating H19-7 cells. For this purpose, cells were grown at 33 °C in DMEM-proliferation medium. Cells were removed from their growth environment and mRNA extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RT-PCR reactions were run utilizing primers specific for individual TRPC homologs (Table II). As shown in Fig. 1, proliferating H19-7 cells express mRNA for TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7. Negative controls with no reverse transcriptase showed no signal.Next, it was determined whether the TRPC mRNA expression profile was modified when cells were differentiated. Therefore, cells were switched to N2 medium, shifted from 33 °C to the non-permissive temperature of 39 °C, and treated with FGF over a period of several days. Although differentiation is monitored on the basis of morphological features such as elongation and development of axonal processes (Fig. 2), differentiated H19-7 cells previously have been characterized to exhibit significantly lower rates of [3H]thymidine incorporation than their undifferentiated counterparts, to express several uniquely neuronal/glial markers such as NFP, MAP-2, and GAP-43 and to show activation of neuronal-like sodium channels (16Eves E.M.

Proliferating cells and post-mitotic, differentiated cells were then assayed for TRPC mRNA expression using methods of real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, there is a definite disparity in the mRNA levels of certain TRPC homologs in proliferating versus differentiated cells. The mRNA levels for TRPC1 and TRPC3 dramatically increase in magnitude, while the mRNA level for TRPC4 and TRPC7 dramatically decline upon differentiation.Fig. 2Morphology of cultured neuronal hippocampal cells. Hippocampal H19-7 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and grown at 33 °C in DMEM-proliferation medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. For differentiation, cells were grown in N2 medium to which 50 ng/ml bFGF was added. Phase contrast images of proliferating H19-7 cells (upper panel) and differentiated H19-7 cells (lower panel) were captured using an ORCA-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu) attached to a Nikon eclipse TE200 microscope (20× phase objective).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Real-time RT-PCR analyses of TRPC gene expression in proliferatingversusdifferentiated H19-7 cells. Real-time RT-PCR analyses were performed with the SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Bars depict the percentage of TRPC gene expression calculated by the method recommended in the ABI user's manual. Data were normalized from triplicate reverse transcriptase reaction repeats. Data were calculated based on calibration curves for each primer pair. The calibration curves were made using cDNA from proliferating H19-7 cells in five serial dilutions (duplicate repeats).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)While the difference in mRNA levels in Fig. 3 suggests that a difference in TRPC protein levels might exist between proliferating and differentiated H19-7 cells, it was necessary to demonstrate this by Western blots. Thus, Western blots were run on extracts of both proliferating and differentiated cells to monitor levels of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC7 protein. As shown in Fig. 4, proliferating cells have much higher levels of TRPC4 and TRPC7 protein, while differentiated cells have much higher levels of TRPC1 and TRPC3 protein.Fig. 4Western blot analyses of TRPC protein levels in proliferatingversusdifferentiated H19-7 cells. Proliferating and differentiated H19-7 cells were grown under conditions described in the legend to Fig. 2. For each lane, 50-μg samples of total protein extract were applied and Western blots performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative Western blots are shown for TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC7. B, quantitative data summarizing three independent experiments for each TRPC homolog are based on the relative spot intensities. Although not seen at this protein concentration and exposure time, TRPC3 is present in proliferating H19-7 cells (see Fig. 10A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Levels of SOCE in Proliferating and Differentiated H19-7 Cells—To investigate the functional implications of the difference in rTRPC expression profile between proliferating and differentiated H19-7 cells, the level of SOCE was examined under these two conditions. H19-7 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and then treated under proliferating or differentiating conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) for a period of several days. Cells were loaded with fura 2 and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration monitored by fluorescence imaging. Cells were incubated in HBSS, and a base-line Ca2+ value was established. In initial experiments, cells were shifted briefly to a Ca2+-free HBSS medium containing Ba2+ to assess the basal leak. Cells were then shifted to a Ca2+-free HBSS solution and thapsigargin added at a dose of 1 μm. Following the return of Ca2+ to basal values, Ba2+ was added and the Ba2+ entry monitored. Representative time courses for individual proliferating (Fig. 5A, left panel) or differentiated cells (Fig. 5B, left panel) are shown. One can see from this example that the Ba2+ entry in response to Ca2+ store depletion is much greater in the differentiated H19-7 cells. We chose Ba2+ as the entering cation as it is not pumped by the Ca-ATPases (19Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kwan C.Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 678-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore can distinguish between effects on Ca2+ entry versus Ca2+ pump pathways. A statistical analysis of the Ba2+ entry measurements is shown in Fig. 5C. The Ba2+ entry in proliferating H19-7 cells is 0.0010 ± 0.00003 s–1, while the Ba2+ entry in differentiated cells is 0.0034 ± 0.00014 s–1 (these values are statistically different, p < 0.00001). The basal Ca2+ value, the area under the TG-stimulated Ca2+ release curve, and the Ba2+ leak flux (essentially zero) were all comparable for proliferating versus differentiated H19-7 cells.Fig. 5SOCE measured in proliferatingversusdifferentiated H19-7 cells. Hippocampal H19-7 cells were grown under proliferating or differentiating conditions as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Left panel, representative time courses of Ba2+ entry in proliferating (A) and differentiated H19-7 cells (B) are shown along with the average Ba2+ entry under these conditions (C). In the absence of calcium, 2 mm Ba2+ was added to Ca2+-free HBSS to measure Ba2+ leak. After switching to Ca2+-free medium, Ca2+ stores were released with 1 μm thapsigargin and then 2 mm Ba2+ added. SOCE was determined by subtracting initial Ba2+ leak influx from Ba2+ influx following Ca2+ store depletion. Each trace represents a single cell response. Differentiated H19-7 cells have statistically higher SOCE (*, p < 0.00001). The number of individual cells tested for SOCE is shown in parentheses. Center panel, the effect of 100 μm CCh on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores following treatment with thapsigargin. Cells were treated with thapsigargin in a Ca2+-free medium as described above, and then after the 30-min store-depletion period 100 μm CCh was added. There was no CCh-induced release of Ca2+ in either proliferating cells (n = 150) or differentiated cells (n = 96). Right panel, 100 μm CCh was added to control cells in a Ca2+-free medium. There was a dramatic CCh-induced release of Ca2+ in both proliferating (n = 90) and differentiated cells (n = 45).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assure that thapsigargin was equally depleting inositol trisphosphate-sensitive stores in proliferating versus differentiated cells, we assessed the ability of CCh to release intracellular Ca2+ following treatment of cells with thapsigargin. Addition of 100 μm CCh following thapsigargin treatment had no additional effect on Ca2+ release in either proliferating (Fig. 5A, center panel) or differentiated (Fig. 5B, center panel) H19-7 cells. In the absence of Ca2+ store depletion, CCh induced a robust release of intracellular Ca2+ in both proliferating (Fig. 5A, right panel) and differentiated (Fig. 5B, right panel) cells.The question arose as to whether the elevation of SOCE in differentiated H19-7 cells would show up as an increase in agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry. Thus, in Fig. 6, Ba2+ entry was monitored following the stimulati"

However, the molecular mechanisms of these specialized trafficking events and their integration with the intracellular membrane transport machinery are virtually unknown. Here, we have investigated the role of the Rab family of membrane sorting proteins in the late stages of receptor trafficking into the postsynaptic membrane. We have identified Rab8, a vesicular transport protein associated with trans-Golgi network membranes, as a critical component of the cellular machinery that delivers AMPA-type glutamatergic receptors (AMPARs) into synapses. Using electron microscopic techniques, we have found that Rab8 is localized in close proximity to the synaptic membrane, including the postsynaptic density. Electrophysiological studies indicated that Rab8 is necessary for the synaptic delivery of AMPARs during plasticity (long-term potentiation) and during constitutive receptor cycling. In addition, Rab8 is required for AMPAR delivery into the spine surface, but not for receptor transport from the dendritic shaft into the spine compartment or for delivery into the dendritic surface. Therefore, Rab8 specifically drives the local delivery of AMPARs into synapses. These results demonstrate a new role for the cellular secretory machinery in the control of synaptic function and plasticity directly at the postsynaptic membrane.

These results demonstrate a new role for the cellular secretory machinery in the control of synaptic function and plasticity directly at the postsynaptic membrane. Synaptic plasticity is critical for the establishment and maturation of functional neuronal circuits in the brain and is widely thought of as the cellular process responsible for learning and memory. An important mechanism controlling synaptic maturation and remodeling is the targeting and delivery of neurotransmitter receptors into synapses. However, very little is known of the exocytic processes that sort neurotransmitter receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. In addition, it remains to be determined how these specialized trafficking events are integrated with the intracellular membrane transport machinery. In fact, most of our current knowledge on membrane trafficking at the synapse derives from studies on neurotransmitter vesicle fusion at the presynaptic terminal (reviewed in Refs. 1Sudhof T.C.

They can traffic in and out of the synaptic membrane constitutively or in an activity-dependent manner, and this regulated trafficking is known to contribute to synaptic plasticity during brain development and in adulthood (3Sheng M.

Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3650) Google Scholar). In hippocampus, AMPARs containing GluR1 or GluR4 subunits are delivered to synapses in an activity-dependent manner upon N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor activation, leading to long-lasting synaptic potentiation (8Hayashi Y.

In contrast, AMPARs containing only GluR2 and GluR3 subunits cycle continuously in and out of synapses in a manner largely independent of synaptic activity (10Shi S. Hayashi Y. Esteban J.A.

These two distinct trafficking routes have been coined as regulated and constitutive pathways, respectively (17Malinow R. Mainen Z.F. Hayashi Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating membrane transport in these pathways are largely unknown.Members of the Rab family of small GTPases are important regulators of intracellular membrane sorting in eukaryotes. In particular, they are proposed to mediate membrane transport specificity (18Pfeffer S.R.

Rab proteins are likely to be important for neuronal function because alterations in Rab protein regulation can lead to mental retardation in humans (21D'Adamo P. Menegon A. Lo Nigro C. Grasso M.

Rab3 is a presynaptic member of this family (22Fischer von Mollard G. Mignery G.A. Baumert M. Perin M.S. Hanson T.J. Burger P.M. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, the potential role of Rab proteins in neurotransmitter receptor targeting and synaptic function at the postsynaptic terminal has never been tested.Besides Rab3, three members of the Rab family are involved in exocytic delivery into the plasma membrane: Rab4, Rab8, and Rab11. In neurons, Rab8 has an exclusive somatodendritic distribution (27Huber L.A. de Hoop M.J. Dupree P. Zerial M. Simons K. Dotti C. J.

Rab4 is involved in the recycling pathway from early endosomes back into the plasma membrane, whereas Rab11 mediates membrane transport from late endosomes and trans-Golgi network (32van der Sluijs P.

These three Rab proteins act on late stages of the exocytic trafficking into the plasma membrane and therefore are attractive candidates to mediate receptor targeting into the postsynaptic membrane.In this study, we have explored the role of these exocytic Rab proteins in synaptic function and plasticity and, in particular, in the late trafficking events that deliver AMPARs into synapses. Using a combination of molecular biology, electrophysiology, and imaging techniques on organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we have found that Rab8, but not Rab4 or Rab11, is required for the late stages of AMPAR synaptic delivery into the postsynaptic membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs of Recombinant Proteins and Expression—Rab8a, Rab4a, and Rab11a coding sequences were cloned by PCR from a commercial rat brain cDNA preparation (catalog no. 7150; Clontech). The rat Rab8a sequence that we cloned has 96% and 97% identity to the mouse and human sequences, respectively. The reported Rab8a rat sequence in the NCBI data base (accession numbers M83675 and NM_053998) has a significant N-terminal truncation (83 amino acids) with respect to the mouse and human sequences and with respect to the rat sequence we cloned. This is probably due to a sequencing error in the rat sequence submitted originally. Our cloned Rab4a sequence was identical to the reported rat Rab4a sequence in the NCBI data base (accession number P05714) with the exception of two differences: Q47S and T75R. These two amino acids in our sequence (Ser47) and (Arg75) are conserved in the mouse and human sequences reported in the NCBI data base (accession numbers NP_033029 and NP_004569, respectively). Therefore, these two differences probably correspond to sequencing errors in the previously reported rat sequence. Our cloned Rab11a sequence was identical to the reported one in the NCBI data base (accession number NM_031152). Rab8a, Rab4a, and Rab11a coding sequences were cloned as fusion proteins downstream from enhanced green fluorescence protein using the pEGFP-C1 plasmid (catalog no. 6084; Clontech). The dominant negative mutants (GDP-bound form) were generated by PCR introducing a single-amino acid substitution described previously (T22N for Rab8dn, S22N for Rab4dn, and S25N for Rab11dn). The RFP fusion construct of Rab8dn was generated with a red fluorescence protein variant (tdimer2 (12Passafaro M. Piech V. Sheng M. Nat.

Hippocampal slices are prepared from young rats (postnatal day 5 to 7) and placed in culture on semiporous membranes (42Gahwiler B.H. Capogna M. Debanne D. McKinney R.A. Thompson S.M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). After 4-7 days in culture, the recombinant gene is delivered into the slices. For the experiments shown in Figs. 3 (A and B), 4, 5 (B and C), and 7, we used the biolistic delivery method (43Lo D.C. McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1263-1268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), which allowed us to co-express several proteins with plasmids bearing the cytomegalovirus promoter. For the rest of the experiments, we use the Sindbis virus expression system (44Schlesinger S. Trends Biotechnol. 1993; 11: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is a replication-deficient, low-toxicity, neurotropic virus, allowing the expression of recombinant proteins exclusively in neurons by injecting the viral solution extracellularly in the desired area of a hippocampal slice (41Malinow R.

The recombinant proteins were expressed for 36 h when AMPA receptor subunits were expressed (Figs. 3, A and B, 4, and 7) or for 15 h in the rest of the cases. Neurons remain morphologically and electrophysiologically intact during these expression times.

Values for surface and total receptors were taken from the fluorescence intensity peaks after background subtraction (dashed line). Scale bar, 2 μm. C, surface ratio from pairs of spines and dendrites in GluR2-transfected neurons (left panel) or in GluR2 + Rab8dn-transfected neurons (middle panel). Surface ratios for spines and dendrites were calculated by dividing the corresponding background-subtracted Cy5 and GFP values. Surface ratios are normalized by the mean dendrite value (0.31 ± 0.05 for GluR2 alone and 0.31 ± 0.04 for GluR2 + Rab8dn). Cumulative probabilities (right panel) of spine/dendrite ratios show a significant difference between the surface ratio distribution of GluR2-transfected and GluR2 + Rab8dn-transfected neurons. For comparison, dashed lines indicate that 50% of the spine-dendrite pairs have less surface ratio in the spine than in the dendrite for cells transfected with GluR2 alone (black line, cumulative probability = 0.5 for spine/dendrite = 1). In contrast, 75% of the spine-dendrite pairs have less surface ratio in the spine than in the dendrite for cells co-transfected with Rab8dn (red line, cumulative probability = 0.75 for spine/dendrite = 1). D, total receptor amount (GFP signal) in spines and dendrites are calculated in GluR2-transfected neurons (left panel) and in GluR2 + Rab8dn-transfected neurons (middle panel). Values are normalized by the mean obtained at dendrites (50 ± 4 for GluR2 alone and 54 ± 3 for GluR2 + Rab8dn). The cumulative probability (right panel) indicates that Rab8dn does not significantly change the total receptor distribution in spines versus dendrites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Rab8 is necessary for both the constitutive and regulated delivery of AMPA receptors into synapses.A-C, top, sample trace of evoked AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic responses recorded at -60 mV from uninfected/nontransfected and infected/transfected cells. Scale bars, 20 pA and 10 ms. A, bottom, Rab8dn significantly reduced AMPA transmission in the presence of high Mg2+ (12 mm MgCl2). Average current amplitude at -60 mV from uninfected and infected cells was 46.9 ± 9.9 and 26.7 ± 4.5 pA, respectively. n represents the number of pathways from cell pairs. p = 0.03, according to the Wilcoxon test. B, bottom, expression of t-CaMKII significantly increases AMPAR-mediated transmission. Nontransfected, 32.5 ± 6.1 pA; transfected with t-CaMKII, 81.5 ± 14.4 pA. p = 0.001, according to the Wilcoxon test; n represents the number of the pathways from cell pairs. C, bottom, Rab8dn blocked t-CaMKII-induced potentiation of AMPA responses. Nontransfected, 25.0 ± 4.2 pA; transfected with t-CaMKII + Rab8dn, 19.7 ± 3.8 pA. D, Rab8dn does not change the phosphorylation levels of CaMKII. Left panels, Western blot analysis showing the P-Thr286 αCaMKII/total αCaMKII ratios in Rab8dn-infected slices and uninfected slices.

Endogenous receptors conduct current at -60 and +40 mV, whereas recombinant receptors conduct only at negative membrane potentials. Therefore, delivery of the recombinant homomeric receptors is accompanied by an increase in the rectification value (a decrease in the outward current, depicted by the arrowhead in A, with respect to the inward current). A, average rectification values were as follows: control (uninfected), 1.9 ± 0.2; GluR2-(R586Q), 3.3 ± 0.2; GluR2-(R586Q) + Rab8dn, 2.1 ± 0.3; GluR2-(R586Q) + Rab8wt, 3.3 ± 0.2; and Rab8dn, 2.3 ± 0.3. B, average rectification values were as follows: GluR1 + t-CaMKII, 3.9 ± 0.7; GluR1 + t-CaMKII and Rab8dn, 1.8 ± 0.2; GluR1 + PSD95, 3.5 ± 0.5; GluR1 + PSD95 and Rab8dn, 2.0 ± 0.2; and GluR1 + PSD95 and Rab8wt, 3.5 ± 0.4. n represents the number of pathways; p is the probability value according to Student's t test. A and B, top, sample traces of evoked AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses recorded at -60 and +40 mV from control or transfected cells as indicated. Scale bars, 20 pA and 20 ms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Electrophysiology—Simultaneous double whole-cell recordings were obtained from nearby pairs of infected and uninfected CA1 pyramidal neurons under visual guidance using fluorescence and transmitted light illumination. The recording chamber was perfused with 119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 11 mm glucose, 0.1 mm picrotoxin, 10 μm bicuculline, and 2 μm 2-chloroadenosine, at pH 7.4, and gassed with 5% CO2/95% O2. Patch recording pipettes (3-6 megaohms) were filled with 115 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 20 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 0.4 mm Na3GTP, 10 mm sodium phosphocreatine, and 0.6 mm EGTA, at pH 7.25. In the rectification experiments (i.e.Fig. 7), 0.1 mm spermine was added. Voltage-clamp whole-cell recordings were carried out with multiclamp 700A amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Synaptic responses were evoked with two bipolar electrodes with single voltage pulses (200 μs, up to 20 V). The stimulating electrodes were placed over Schaffer collateral fibers between 300 and 500 μm from the recorded cells. Because only CA1 cells and not CA3 cells are infected, this configuration ensures that recombinant proteins are always expressed exclusively in postsynaptic cells. Synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated responses were measured at -60 mV, and NMDA receptor-mediated responses were measured at +40 mV, and they were averaged over 50-100 trials. In the rectification experiment (Fig. 7), NMDA receptor-mediated responses were blocked pharmacologically using 0.1 mm dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. Synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated responses were measured at -60 and +40 mV, and the ratio of these responses was used as an index of rectification. Long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments were carried out as described previously (16Gerges N.Z. Tran I.C. Backos D.S. Harrell J.M. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. Esteban J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4758-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), by pairing 0 mV postsynaptic depolarization with 3 Hz presynaptic stimulation (300 pulses).Biochemistry—Hippocampal extracts were prepared in homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin and 1% Triton X-100) as described previously (8Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Expression of Rab proteins was analyzed by Western blot with anti-Rab4 (BD Biosciences), anti-Rab8 (Pharmingen), and anti-Rab11 (Zymed Laboratories) antibodies. Phosphorylation of α calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II at Thr286 was analyzed with phospho-specific and regular anti-αCaMKII antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) using the homogenization buffer described above supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 μm microcystin LR, and 0.5 μm calyculin A).Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical detection of recombinant AMPA receptors was carried out with anti-GFP mouse antibody (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence labeling was achieved with anti-mouse biotinylated secondary antibody (Sigma) and streptavidin tagged with either AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes; Fig. 3) or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences; Fig. 4). Detergents were omitted in all incubations to evaluate surface expression. Images were taken using Olympus FV 500 confocal microscopy. A ×60 lens with water immersion interface was used. FluoView software was used for acquiring the images. ImageJ was used for three-dimensional reconstruction and quantification of fluorescence intensities. Analysis of surface immunostaining at spines and dendrites was carried out as follows. Line plots of fluorescence intensity were generated across spine heads and the adjacent dendritic shafts. Fluorescence intensity at each compartment was quantified from the peaks corresponding to the spine and the dendrite after background subtraction (Fig. 4B). Then, surface ratios were calculated as the ratio between the GFP signal (total receptor) and the Cy5 signal (surface receptor).Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Hippocampal slices were fixed and processed for osmium-free post-embedding immunogold labeling, essentially as described previously (45Phend K.D. Rustioni A. Weinberg R.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Rab8 was labeled with anti-Rab8 antibody (Pharmingen) and an anti-mouse antibody coupled to 6-nm gold particles (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Electron micrographs were obtained with a Philips CM-100 transmission electron microscope and a Kodak 1.6 Megaplus digital camera.RESULTSRole of Rab4, Rab8, and Rab11 in AMPA Receptor-mediated Synaptic Transmission—As a first step to evaluate the role of these three exocytic Rab proteins in synaptic transmission, we blocked the function of these proteins individually by expressing the corresponding dominant negative (Rab-dn) forms as GFP fusion proteins in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (see “Experimental Procedures”). Point mutations known to confer dominant negative (GDP-bound) phenotypes to these proteins have been employed in multiple occasions: Rab4-(S22N) (46Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H.

https://openalex.org/W2136569949,"The α-defensin antimicrobial peptide family is defined by a unique tridisulfide array. To test whether this invariant structural feature determines α-defensin bactericidal activity, mouse cryptdin-4 (Crp4) tertiary structure was disrupted by pairs of site-directed Ala for Cys substitutions. In a series of Crp4 disulfide variants whose cysteine connectivities were confirmed using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, mutagenesis did not induce loss of function. To the contrary, the in vitro bactericidal activities of several Crp4 disulfide variants were equivalent to or greater than those of native Crp4. Mouse Paneth cell α-defensins require the proteolytic activation of precursors by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), prompting an analysis of the relative sensitivities of native and mutant Crp4 and pro-Crp4 molecules to degradation by MMP-7. Although native Crp4 and the α-defensin moiety of proCrp4 resisted proteolysis completely, all disulfide variants were degraded extensively by MMP-7. Crp4 bactericidal activity was eliminated by MMP-7 cleavage. Thus, rather than determining α-defensin bactericidal activity, the Crp4 disulfide arrangement confers essential protection from degradation by this critical activating proteinase."

https://openalex.org/W2145442915,"Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) have been viewed traditionally as damaging to the cell. However, a predominance of evidence has shown that ROI can also function as important activators of key cellular processes, and ROI have been shown to play a vital role in cell signaling networks. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases) are a family of related kinases that are activated in response to increased intracellular calcium concentrations. In this report we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide treatment results in the activation of both CaM kinase II and IV in Jurkat T lymphocytes. Surprisingly, this activation occurs in the absence of any detectable calcium flux, suggesting a novel means for the activation of these kinases. Treatment of Jurkat cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which does not cause a calcium flux, also activated the CaM kinases. The addition of catalase to the cultures inhibited PMA-induced activation of the CaM kinases, suggesting that similar to hydrogen peroxide, PMA also activates the CaM kinases via the production of ROI. One mechanism by which this likely occurs is through oxidation and consequential inactivation of cellular phosphatases. In support of this concept, okadaic acid and microcystin-LR, which are inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), induced CaM kinase II and IV activity in these cells. Overall, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which ROI can induce CaM kinase activation in T lymphocytes."

The C57BL/6J-Min/+ (Min/+) mouse is a model for CRC and develops numerous intestinal adenomas. We analyzed the normal mucosa of Min/+ and Apc+/+ (WT) littermate mice together with Apc-null adenomas to gain insight into the roles of Egfr in these intestinal tissues. Protein analyses showed that Egfr activity was highest in the tumors, and also up-regulated in Min/+ relative to WT enterocytes. Expression of ubiquitylated Egfr (Egfr-Ub) was increased in Min/+ enterocytes and tumors. Tumors exhibited increased association of Egfr with clathrin heavy chain (CHC), Gab1, and p85α, the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and tumors also overexpressed c-Src, PDK1, and Akt. Immunohistochemistry for Akt-p-Ser473 revealed a low level of this active kinase in Min/+ and WT enterocytes and its strong presence in tumors. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a product of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) activity that is up-regulated in Min/+ tumors and transactivates Egfr. PGE2 expression was significantly higher in untreated Min/+ tumors and reduced by treatment with the Cox-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. Dietary administration of this NSAID also inhibited Egfr activity in tumors. Increased activation of the EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in tumors relative to Apc+/+ and ApcMin/+ enterocytes provides potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions to differentially suppress tumor formation, promotion, progression, and/or recurrence.

Our goal is to understand the earliest events in intestinal tumorigenesis, as it may be possible at this stage to intervene with chemopreventive drugs that suppress tumor formation or progression. As a model for early Apc-associated tumorigenesis, we examined the Min/+ mouse, an animal that develops numerous intestinal adenomas as a result of germline mutation of Apc (3Su L.K. Kinzler K.W.

This receptor has multiple ligands and must homodimerize or heterodimerize with other Erb-B family members in the plasma membrane. Growth factor-dependent activation of the RTK activity of EGFR ensues following autophosphorylation of five specific residues in the C-terminal domain (20Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Several different mechanisms regulate EGFR activity. For example, negative regulation occurs when the active receptor is endocytosed into clathrin-coated pits and transported to lysosomes; an alternative fate of internalized EGFR allows it to collect in depots for recycling back to the plasma membrane (21Sorkin A. von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The active receptor also undergoes ubiquitin-dependent sorting and degradation initiated by interaction with Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) family proteins that possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (22Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). EGFR also may interact with tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate specific autophosphorylated residues (23Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). EGFR activity coordinates intestinal cell development in vivo. The bowel mucosa is rapidly self-renewing, and as intestinal stem cell daughters differentiate, they acquire migratory ability. When small intestine enterocytes arrive at villus tips, they senesce and are exfoliated into the lumen. A primary function of ligand-bound EGFR in differentiating enterocytes may be to enhance cell movement by inducing membrane ruffling and activating the Rho family GTPase, Rac1, which, in turn, controls enterocyte differentiation and migration by altering the actin cytoskeleton (24Ridley A.J.

Consistent with its effects on the cytoskeleton, EGFR regulates both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. For example, EGFR modulates the activity of focal adhesion kinase, a signaling regulator located near the basal membrane at sites of contact with the extracellular matrix (30Brunton V.G. Ozanne B.W. Paraskeva C. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Harder K.W. Moller N.P. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol.

Moreover, EGFR dynamically alters intercellular adhesion in migratory cells by phosphorylating β-catenin, a modification that disassembles E-cadherin-dependent adhesion complexes at adherens junctions (AJs) (34Hoschuetzky H.

Finally, mature enterocytes carry out their physiological functions and are protected from apoptosis while they transit villi. EGFR and integrins collaborate to prevent epithelial cell detachment from the extracellular matrix and anoikis (38Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G.

These considerations prompted us to examine whether Egfr regulation and/or downstream signaling were altered in the histologically normal Min/+ mucosa and tumors compared with that of the Apc+/+ enterocytes from the WT littermate. Characterizing EGFR-dependent signal transduction pathways that operate in normal enterocytes to permit cell survival, movement, and proliferation in vivo should yield information relevant to cancer prevention and therapy. Materials—5-6-week-old C57BL/6J Min/+ and WT littermate mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were fed AIN-76A diet with or without celecoxib at 1,500 mg/kg (Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ).

Tissue Harvesting—Experiments used ∼4-month-old Min/+ mice and their WT littermates, as the source of intestinal tissues. Upon sacrifice, the entire small and large intestine of each mouse was removed from just below the stomach to the rectum. The small intestine was cut at its mid point. Tissue from the proximal ileum was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. The remaining segments of small intestine were washed with Dulbecco's PBS containing physiological concentrations of MgCl2 and CaCl2. When harvesting Min/+ tissue, intestinal segments were opened longitudinally, and adenomas were quickly counted, excised, and pooled. Tumors were either placed in lysis buffer or frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. In parallel, enterocytes from the WT and Min/+ small intestine were scraped using the edge of a glass microscope slide, a method that mostly yields post-mitotic enterocytes of villi (41Carothers A.M.

Collected cells were suspended in PBS and twice washed with centrifugations at 1,700 rpm for 5 min in the cold. Washed enterocytes were either used immediately to prepare protein lysates or cell pellets were frozen and stored as above. Pervanadate (10 mm) was freshly prepared as detailed (42Lu Y. Yu Q.

Opened, washed segments of small bowel were immersed in this medium with and without the treatment agent, and placed in an humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 15 min, prior to enterocyte collection as above. Treatments with PGE2 (200 nm) and AG1478 (70 nm) were also performed in this manner. Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. For total cell lysates (TCLs), washed enterocytes were placed in Dounces containing 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 0.2 mm phenylarsine oxide (PAO), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm ALLN, 3 mm H2O2, and 1% Triton X-100). Pooled tumors (∼30-50 tumors per sample) were placed in 0.5 ml of this buffer. WT and Min/+ samples were homogenized for 10 and tumors for 30 strokes. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Aliquots were removed for protein determinations. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were precleared for 3 h with agarose G-beads. These beads were removed, and antibodies (4 μg) were separately added to lysate aliquots containing normalized amounts of protein (500-800 μg). Samples were rocked in the cold for 1h, G-beads were again added, and samples were rocked overnight. After G-bead removal, stringent washing and eluting was performed as detailed by the vendor. To separate proteins into membrane (P100) and cytosolic (S100) fractions, post-nuclear lysates were prepared (41Carothers A.M. Melstrom Jr., K.A. Mueller J.D. Weyant M.J. Bertagnolli M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39094-39102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, enterocytes were placed in Dounces containing 4 ml of a detergent-free lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.2 mm phenylarsine oxide (PAO), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm ALLN, 3 mm H2O2). Tumors were placed in a Dounce homogenizer containing 1-2 ml of this buffer. Both samples were then set on ice for 15 min prior to homogenizing with 30 strokes. Cell lysates were spun at 1,700 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were then centrifuged in a Ti70.1 rotor at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The S100 supernatants containing cytosolic proteins were removed to separate tubes and mixed with Laemmli sample buffer. The P100 pellets containing integral and associated membrane proteins were also suspended in this buffer. Aliquots of both fractions were collected for protein determinations, and the samples were stored at -80 °C. Immunoblot analyses were performed as previously detailed (40Weyant M.J. Carothers A.M. Bertagnolli M.E. Bertagnolli M.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 949-956PubMed Google Scholar). In every experiment shown, the input TCLs from the same precleared samples used for immunoprecipitations were analyzed in parallel. Previously blotted membranes were placed in stripping buffer (68 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol) at 65 °C for 20 min before re-probing. All experiments were repeated using independently prepared lysates from separate animals at least three times. PGE2ELISA—Washed enterocytes from one-half of the small intestine of WT and Min/+ mice and ∼40 pooled Min/+ adenomas were separately lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 μm indomethacin) by homogenization and clarified, as above. PGE2 measurements were performed using the vendor's protocol. Briefly, aliquots (3 mg) of each lysate were subjected to PGE2 affinity chromatography for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with 95% ethanol that subsequently was evaporated by vacuum centrifugation. The eluates were each suspended in 90 μl of EIA buffer. Triplicate reactions of samples, diluted 1:20 and 1:50 in EIA buffer, were run in parallel with a standard curve. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a Molecular Devices microplate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). Immunohistochemistry—For IHC, serial 4 μm sections of tumorbearing intestinal mucosa from Min/+ mice were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed with 10 mm citrate buffer pH 6.0 in a pressure cooker for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% H2O2 in methanol, and slides were then washed in PBS. The sections were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (1:50) or anti-Akt (1:200) antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were then washed in PBS, and sections were incubated in EnVision 228 System anti-rabbit labeled polymer for 30 min at room temperature. Enzyme detection was performed with DAB chromogen. Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Images were obtained using an Olympus BX40 microscope at ×60 power. Egfr Activation Is Increased in ApcMin/+Enterocytes and ApcMin/-Intestinal Adenomas—Because the ApcMin allele perturbs enterocyte adhesion and migration in the intestine (41Carothers A.M.

Bilinski R.T. Martucci C. Chadburn A. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5045-5050PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Egfr activity is increased in both the normal mucosa and adenomas of Min/+ mice relative to the WT littermate. Therefore, we assessed the overall level of Egfr expression in TCLs of WT enterocytes and tumors obtained from adult Min/+ mice. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A) using EGFR antibody (clone 13) showed that overall Egfr expression was increased in tumors relative to WT enterocytes. By our lysis and electrophoresis conditions, Egfr protein in the mouse samples yielded several bands in a size range of ∼170-200 kDa. The ∼200-kDa band was especially prominent in tumors when compared with untreated WT. A similar size range was evident in the commercially obtained, positive control lysate (EGF-stimulated A431). In this and subsequent figures, immunoblots of the TCLs used for each of the immunoprecipitations were included, and immunoprecipitation and sample loading controls were detailed in the legends. The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR (EGFR-p-Y) expressed in cells is an indicator of its activation level. To compare the relative expression of Egfr-p-Y in WT tissue to that present in tumors, we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblots using 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (p-Y) and EGFR antibodies (Fig. 1B). To further assess the differential expression of Egfr in our specimens, we performed ex vivo treatment of WT intestinal tissue with pervanadate, a cell permeable tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor that stimulates overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation (44Heffetz D. Bushin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When TCLs of WT tissue treated with pervanadate were used for immunoblots, Egfr bands of ∼170 and ∼200 kDa were intensified and resembled those produced from the adenoma lysates (Fig 1A, lane 3). As anticipated, pervanadate treatment of WT tissue increased Egfr expression. In immunoprecipitation experiments to compare the relative amounts of Egfr tyrosine phosphorylation, a single band of ∼170 kDa was detected in the untreated WT enterocytes, however, ∼200- and ∼170-kDa bands appeared in the pervanadate-treated WT and tumor samples. As expected, active Egfr was present in the normal WT mucosa (Fig. 1B). Because the ∼200-kDa band occurred in both the Egfr and p-Y immunoprecipitations of pervanadate-treated WT and tumor samples, this band may account for the overall increase of Egfr in tumors relative to untreated WT. This band also represents a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Egfr. Egfr activity was attributed to stimulate the growth and/or progression of intestinal adenomas at the very earliest stages (13Roberts R.B. Min L. Washington M.K. Olsen S.J. Settle S.H. Coffey R.J. Threadgill D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1521-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Since all adenomas in the Min/+ mouse are Apc-null due to loss of heterozygosity (4Luongo C. Moser A.R. Gledhill S. Dove W.F. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5947-5952PubMed Google Scholar), this idea implied that the complete loss of Apc function in polyps precedes Egfr dysregulation. To examine this, we compared the expression and activity of Egfr in lysates of Min/+ enterocytes to those of WT littermates. Immunoblot analysis of normalized amounts of protein presented in Fig. 1C (top) revealed higher Egfr expression in Min/+ relative to WT enterocytes. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations and immunoblots of these samples using the EGFR and 4G10 antibodies were performed to assess the relative activity of Egfr. Greater amounts of Egfr-p-Y were present in Min/+ than in WT enterocytes (Fig. 1D, middle). To confirm and extend these data, we performed immunoblot analyses using WT, Min/+, and tumor-fractionated cell lysates. The P100 fraction contained membrane-integral and -associated proteins, while the S100 fraction contained cytosolic proteins. Immunoblots were probed with two different phospho-specific antibodies directed against active, human EGFR (Fig. 1D). Each of these antibodies recognizes the mouse homolog of this receptor. Significant amounts of membrane-localized, active Egfr were present only in tumors. Unlike the WT sample, however, an appreciable amount of active Egfr was present in the soluble fractions of both normal Min/+ enterocytes and adenomas. This result suggests that in Apc+/+ cells, Egfr protein is efficiently down-regulated, but that negative regulation of this receptor kinase is deficient in Min/+ enterocytes and tumors. Binding of the growth factor, EGF, to EGFR occurs in the basolateral membranes of intestinal enterocytes (45Scheving L.A. Shiurba R.A. Nguyen T.D. Gray G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1735-1741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however 80-85% of total immunoreactive EGFR is associated with intracellular organelles (46Carpentier J.L. Rees A.R. Gregoriou M. Kris R. Schlessinger J. Orci L. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 161: 312-326Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We performed IHC to examine the expression and localization of Egfr within the crypt-villus axis of WT proximal ileum treated with and without pervanadate. Using a rabbit anti-EGFR antibody, positive staining was evident in the WT small intestine, especially in mid- to upper-villus enterocytes (Fig. 2A, left). As expected, Egfr was diffusely present in the cytoplasm in the untreated, normal enterocytes. This result suggested that active Egfr is internalized in WT cells either for recycling to the plasma membrane or turnover. Egfr IHC of the WT tissue treated with pervanadate that was performed in parallel showed strongly enhanced immunostaining, especially at apical and basal membranes (Fig. 2A, right). These results i"

During the first 23 days of the swarm, hypocentral depths migrated at a rate of 2.4 millimeters per second up-dip along a 40-square-kilometer structure striking north 30° west and dipping 50° to the northeast. SLID's transient velocity of 20 millimeters per year implies a lower bound of 200 nanostrains per year (parts per billion per year) on local strain rates, an order of magnitude greater than the 1996 to 2003 regional rate. The geodetic displacement is too large to be explained by the elastic strain from the cumulative seismic moment of the sequence, suggesting an aseismic forcing mechanism. Aspects of the swarm and SLID displacements are consistent with lower-crustal magma injection under Lake Tahoe."
https://openalex.org/W2024396689,"The deposition of atmospheric dust into the ocean has varied considerably over geological time. Because some of the trace metals contained in dust are essential plant nutrients which can limit phytoplankton growth in parts of the ocean, it has been suggested that variations in dust supply to the surface ocean might influence primary production. Whereas the role of trace metal availability in photosynthetic carbon fixation has received considerable attention, its effect on biogenic calcification is virtually unknown. The production of both particulate organic carbon and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) drives the ocean's biological carbon pump. The ratio of particulate organic carbon to CaCO3 export, the so-called rain ratio, is one of the factors determining CO2 sequestration in the deep ocean. Here we investigate the influence of the essential trace metals iron and zinc on the prominent CaCO3-producing microalga Emiliania huxleyi. We show that whereas at low iron concentrations growth and calcification are equally reduced, low zinc concentrations result in a de-coupling of the two processes. Despite the reduced growth rate of zinc-limited cells, CaCO3 production rates per cell remain unaffected, thus leading to highly calcified cells. These results suggest that changes in dust deposition can affect biogenic calcification in oceanic regions characterized by trace metal limitation, with possible consequences for CO2 partitioning between the atmosphere and the ocean."

With in organello import studies, oxidizing agents arrest the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) bound to the Tim9p-Tim10p complex in the intermembrane space; this productive intermediate can be chased into the inner membrane upon subsequent treatment with reductant. Moreover, AAC import is markedly decreased by oxidant treatment in Δhot13 mitochondria and improved when Hot13p is overexpressed, suggesting Hot13p may function to remodel the small TIM complexes during import.

Curran S.P. Tranebjaerg L. Koehler C.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The specific function of the cysteine residues has been debated recently (12Koehler C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One set of studies suggests that the motif is important for Zn2+ coordination in the small Tim proteins (16Lutz T. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M.

Additional mitochondrial proteins, including the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and superoxide dismutase, also contain disulfide bonds (21Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Pathways for the formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial periplasm have been well characterized (23Kadokura H. Beckwith J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E247-E249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but Moss and colleagues (24Senkevich T.G. White C.L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a complete pathway in the cytosol for disulfide bond insertion in the virion membrane proteins of poxvirus. Included in this pathway is an FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase. The mitochondrial intermembrane space also contains the FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase, Erv1p, suggesting an oxidative folding pathway might occur in this compartment (25Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Muhlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the small TIM complexes might require proteins to mediate their assembly. We report the identification of the intermembrane space protein Hot13p that is required for the efficient assembly of the small Tim proteins into 70-kDa complexes. Additional in organello studies showed that imported AAC was arrested in the intermembrane space bound to the Tim9p-Tim10p complex in the presence of oxidant but was subsequently chased into the inner membrane when the organelle was treated with reductant. We suggest that translocation of polytopic inner membrane proteins across the intermembrane space might be mediated by the local redox state of the small Tim proteins. Plasmids and Strains—Standard genetic techniques were used for growth, manipulation, and transformation of yeast strains (26Guthrie C. Fink G.R.

For expression of the recombinant Tim13p, TIM13 with a C-terminal 9× histidine tag was cloned into pET28a (Novagen). Expression was induced according to the manufacturer's protocols (Novagen). HOT13 with a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag was cloned into the pRS420 series of vectors under the GPD1 promoter (PGPD) and PGK1 terminator (TPGK) for overexpression. A C-terminal HOT13-GFP fusion was created by PCR-based gene manipulation and integration (29Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Tim13p-9XHis—Briefly, the overexpressed Tim13p-9XHis was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol under denaturing conditions. The urea-denatured Tim13p-9XHis was imported in chemical amounts for import and cross-linking studies in purified mitochondria. Import of Radiolabeled Proteins into Isolated Mitochondria— Mitochondria were purified from lactate-grown yeast cells and assayed for in vitro protein import as described (28Koehler C.M. Merchant S.

Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 277-285Google Scholar). Proteins were synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine after in vitro transcription of the corresponding gene by SP6 polymerase. The reticulocyte lysate containing the radiolabeled precursor was incubated with isolated mitochondria at the indicated temperatures in import buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.6 m sorbitol, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 20 mmK+-HEPES, pH 7.4). Where indicated, the potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane was dissipated with 1 μm valinomycin. Non-imported radiolabeled protein was removed by treatment with 100 μg/ml trypsin or 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 15–30 min on ice; trypsin was inhibited with 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and proteinase K with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, respectively. Where indicated mitochondria and/or the in vitro translated precursors were pretreated with oxidants (H2O2, t-BOOH, or oxidized glutathione) or reducing agents (DTT or β-ME) for the given time points on ice. For import reactions under oxidizing conditions followed by a chase with the reductant DTT, import reactions were performed in the presence of the oxidant t-BOOH followed by DTT addition to the import reaction after 1 min; the import reaction was mixed gently, and returned to the 25 °C water bath. Cross-linking studies were performed as previously described (5Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Schmidt E. Koehler C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation assays, monoclonal anti-HA or anti-His antibody was coupled to protein A-Sepharose via a rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody. Both bound proteins and coupled antibodies were removed by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis. Microscopy Techniques—Hot13p-GFP in live cells was visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope utilizing a Fluorescein isothiocyanate filter cube set. Yeast cells expressing HOT13-GFP were first grown in rich medium with sucrose as a carbon source. The cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer, counter-stained with 0.5 μm MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes), and washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer three times to remove excess dye. The mitochondrial staining by MitoTracker® Red CMXRos was visualized with a Cy3 filter cube set. Covalent Modification of Intermembrane Space Proteins and Mass Spectrometry—A thiol-trapping approach similar to that used previously for the small Tim proteins (4Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Schmidt E. Koehler C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was used to identify proteins coordinating disulfide bonds in the intermembrane space. Free sulfhydryl groups were blocked with iodoacetamide followed by reduction of putative disulfide bonds with Tris(2-hydrochloride)phosphine hydrochloride and modification with a maleimide cross-linker (31Ghezzi P. Bonetto V. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Proteins from the modified intermembrane space fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins with a molecular mass near 15–20 kDa were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. MALDI peptide fingerprint mass spectra were acquired by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, Voyager DE-STR time-of-flight mass spectrometer from Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA), using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) as the matrix. Fingerprint mass spectra were analyzed with the ProteinProspector (version 4.0.5) analysis software. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—Mitochondria (2.5 mg/ml) were solubilized in 20 mm K+-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.16% n-dodecylmaltoside (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and the solubilized proteins were analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis on a 6–16% linear polyacrylamide gradient. Miscellaneous—Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using nitrocellulose- or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and visualization of immune complexes with 125I-Protein A or via peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera followed by chemiluminescence. Protein concentration was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Where indicated, the total amount of mitochondrial protein is shown in micrograms. Quantification was performed by scanning laser densitometry with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Hot13p Is a New Protein in the Intermembrane Space—The assembly pathway of the small Tim proteins was characterized by in organello import studies and cross-linking (Fig. 1A). The radiolabeled precursor Tim12p was imported into isolated mitochondria followed by cross-linking with MBS. We identified a protein with a molecular mass of ∼15 kDa that cross-linked prominently to Tim12p (Fig. 1A) as well as the other small Tim proteins. 2S. P. Curran, D. Leuenberger, E. P. Leverich, D. K. Hwang, K. N. Beverly, and C. M. Koehler, unpublished observations. A thiol-trapping approach similar to that used previously for the small Tim proteins in combination with mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins in the intermembrane space that might form disulfide linkages with a molecular mass near 15 kDa (4Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Schmidt E. Koehler C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The novel protein coded by the yeast open reading frame YKL084W, referred to as Helper of Tim (HOT) 13, HOT13, was identified with a predicted molecular mass of 13.5 kDa and with 11 cysteine residues (Fig. 1B). Hot13p is conserved among yeast and prokaryotes and is a member of the zf-CHY domain family (32Mulder N.J. Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Barrell D. Bateman A. Binns D. Biswas M. Bradley P. Bork P. Bucher P. Copley R.R. Courcelle E. Das U. Durbin R. Falquet L. Fleischmann W. Griffiths-Jones S. Haft D. Harte N. Hulo N. Kahn D. Kanapin A. Krestyaninova M. Lopez R. Letunic I. Lonsdale D. Silventoinen V. Orchard S.E. Pagni M. Peyruc D. Ponting C.P. Selengut J.D. Servant F. Sigrist C.J. Vaughan R. Zdobnov E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), which has strong similarity to a RING finger domain. Higher eukaryotes contain larger proteins with the zf-CHY domain. Proteins containing RING finger motifs coordinate two Zn2+ ions, and these motifs are thought to facilitate protein-protein interactions (33Matthews J.M. Sunde M. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Hot13p-GFP co-localized with MitoTracker to mitochondria when visualized with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). In addition, Hot13p-HA localized to the intermembrane space in isolated mitochondria (Fig. 1D). When the outer membrane was disrupted by osmotic shock, Hot13p-HA remained associated with the mitochondrial membranes, but protease addition resulted in degradation of both Tim12p and Hot13p, confirming localization within the intermembrane space either in association with the outer or inner membrane. In addition, Hot13p was a peripheral membrane protein, because it was released by carbonate extraction, in contrast to an integral inner membrane protein, the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC). Hot13p-HA also formed higher molecular mass complexes using non-reducing denaturing electrophoresis (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the cysteine residues may form disulfide bonds. HOT13 was not essential for viability, but strains deleted for HOT13 showed a 30% decrease in growth in the presence of the oxidant t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH). 2S. P. Curran, D. Leuenberger, E. P. Leverich, D. K. Hwang, K. N. Beverly, and C. M. Koehler, unpublished observations. We confirmed that Hot13p was the cross-linked protein that bound to the small Tim proteins by performing import assays into mitochondria lacking Hot13p (Δhot13; Fig. 1A) and mitochondria containing Hot13p with a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag (Hot13p-HA; Fig. 2). The cross-linked product, denoted with an asterisk, was not detected in Δhot13 mitochondria (Fig. 1A). In the Hot13p-HA mitochondria, chemical amounts of Tim13p-9XHis were imported followed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-HA antisera (Fig. 2, A and B) or affinity purification with Ni2+-agarose (Fig. 2B). Monoclonal anti-HA was coupled to protein A-Sepharose via rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Under reciprocal purification schemes, Hot13p-HA was cross-linked to Tim13p-9XHis (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2). Specifically, imported Tim13p-9XHis was cross-linked to two bands marked with an arrow (representing the Hot13p-HA-Tim13p-9XHis cross-link; Fig. 2A, lane 3 and 5 and Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4) and a circle. The circle (Fig. 2A, lane 3; Fig. 2B, lane 2) presumably marks a second cross-linked product between Hot13p-HA and Tim13p-9XHis, because this cross-linked product was purified with Ni2+-agarose (Fig. 2B, lane 2) and detected with anti-HA antibody; cross-linking potentially interfered with the interaction between the monoclonal HA antibody and Hot13p-HA resulting in a failed immunoprecipitation for this cross-linked product (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 versus 5). For immunoblotting, monoclonal anti-HA and anti-His antibodies were used followed by detection with anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence; the heavy and light chain antibodies detected in the immunoprecipitation lanes are marked with an asterisk and are shown in the immunoprecipitation control with an unrelated monoclonal antibody (denoted “mock,” Fig. 2A, lane 4). Hot13p thus binds to the small Tim proteins during import. Hot13p Mediates Assembly of the Small TIM Complexes— How might Hot13p affect the TIM22 pathway? We analyzed the steady-state levels of proteins in mitochondria deleted for Hot13p using immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). Specifically, the abundance of the small Tim proteins, Tim8p, Tim9p, Tim10p, Tim12p, and Tim13p as well as Tim22p was decreased ∼80–90% in Δhot13 mitochondria. The abundance of Tim23p also was slightly decreased in Δhot13 mitochondria, but this may be because Tim23p is dependent upon the TIM22 pathway for import (5Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Schmidt E. Koehler C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 17: 4816-4822Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The steady-state levels of control proteins in the outer membrane (porin, Tom40p, and Tom70p), intermembrane space (cytochrome b2), inner membrane (F1α-ATPase and AAC), and matrix (aconitase, Hsp70, and Hsp60) were similar between Δhot13 and WT mitochondria. In addition, the assembly of the TIM22 complexes was examined by blue native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). Mitochondria deleted for Hot13p lacked the 70-kDa Tim8p-Tim13p complex and had significantly reduced amounts of the 70-kDa Tim9p-Tim10p complex and inner membrane 300-kDa TIM22 complex. However, complex III and complex V of the respiratory chain assembled as expected, indicating pleiotropic defects in the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane were not present. Because the TIM22 components do not assemble correctly, they are degraded, presumably by mitochondrial proteases as we have previously shown with mutant Tim8p in deafness-dystonia syndrome (15Roesch K. Curran S.P. Tranebjaerg L. Koehler C.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Further, mitochondrial membrane potential measurements showed that Δhot13 mitochondria and wild-type mitochondria potentials were similar.2 Thus, deletion of HOT13 seems to affect assembly of complexes in the TIM22 import pathway specifically. Previous studies by Tokatlidis and colleagues (18Allen S. Lu H. Thornton D. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 25: 38505-38513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Lu H.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have shown that the Tim9p-Tim10p complex can be reconstituted in mitochondria lacking the endogenous Tim9p-Tim10p complex. Specifically, radiolabeled Tim9p or Tim10p, when imported into temperature-sensitive tim9 or tim10 mitochondria that lack the endogenous Tim9p-Tim10p complex, respectively, assemble into a 70-kDa complex. Unassembled endogenous partner protein is available associated with the membrane (35Luciano P. Vial S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When similar experiments were performed using recombinant Tim9p or Tim10p, the assembled Tim9p-Tim10p subsequently restored import of carrier proteins, indicating that an active Tim9p-Tim10p complex can assemble (35Luciano P. Vial S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Hot13p mediated assembly of the 70-kDa complexes by investigating the assembly of the 70-kDa complexes in Δhot13 mitochondria using in vitro import assays followed by blue-native gel electrophoresis to monitor complex assembly (Fig. 4). Import of the small Tim proteins, Tim9p and Tim10p, was reduced by 35% into isolated Δhot13 mitochondria (Fig. 4A), but Δhot13 mitochondria were competent to import Tim9p and Tim10p. Assembly was then monitored by blue-native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4B). A fraction of the imported Tim10p assembled with available, endogenous Tim9p to form a 70-kDa complex in wild-type mitochondria; however, the 70-kDa Tim9p-Tim10p complex failed to assemble in mitochondria lacking Hot13p. Similar results were obtained with import of the Tim9p monomer.2 When Tim10p was imported under oxidizing conditions in the presence of t-BOOH in wild-type mitochondria, the imported Tim10p also assembled with available Tim9p into a 70-kDa complex.2 These experiments thus suggest that Hot13p is required for the assembly of the 70-kDa Tim9p-Tim10p complex in the intermembrane space. AAC Import Is Affected by Redox Treatment to Mitochondria— The events in which the small TIM complexes bind and transfer substrate prior to the insertion into the inner membrane complex are vague. Because the small TIM complexes contain disulfide linkages, we further investigated whether the import of substrates might be affected by the redox state of the small Tim proteins. We previously generated a collection of yeast strains containing conditional alleles for the essential import components or deletions of the non-essential import genes (Table I). These strains grew at a similar rate to the parental strain on YPD media at 25 °C (28Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Oppliger W. Schmid K. Jarosch E. Dolfini L. Junne T. Schatz G. Tokatlidis K.

The collection was tested for growth sensitivity in YPD supplemented with 1 mmt-BOOH (Fig. 5A). Stains deleted for TIM18 (Δtim18), TIM54 (Δtim54), and with conditional alleles for tim12 (tim12-1), and tim22 (tim22-19) failed to grow in YPD media containing t-BOOH, whereas the strain containing a conditional tim9 (tim9-3) allele showed a decreased growth rate of 25%.

Accordingly, APOBEC3G occurs specifically in human T lymphocytic cell lines that contain this antiviral defense, including H9. Since the substrate specificities of related cytidine deaminases are strongly influenced by their intracellular quantities, we analyzed the factors that control APOBEC3G expression. The levels of APOBEC3G mRNA and protein were unaffected by treatment of proliferating H9 cells with interferons or tumor necrosis factor-α but were enhanced up to 20-fold by phorbol myristate acetate. This induction was mediated at the transcriptional level by a pathway that required activation of the protein kinase Cα/βI isozyme (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Correspondingly, induction of APOBEC3G was blocked by multiple inhibitors that act at diverse steps of this pathway. The PKCα/βI/MEK/ERK pathway also controlled basal levels of APOBEC3G mRNA and protein, which consequently declined when cells were treated with these inhibitors or arrested in the G0 state of the cell cycle by serum starvation.

APOBEC3G 1The abbreviations used are: APOBEC3G, apoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; Vif, viral infectivity factor; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; 4αPMA, 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase 1 and 2; PKC, protein kinase C; PKR, protein kinase R; INF, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription. is a potent antiretroviral deoxycytidine deaminase that occurs in human T lymphocytes and macrophages and that lethally hypermutates the viral-negative DNA strand shortly after the DNA is synthesized by reverse transcriptase (1Yu Q.

Furthermore, APOBEC3G is specifically incorporated into the cores of progeny virions that are produced by these cells, a location that is critical for its antiviral activity (4Mariani R. Chen D.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and nearly all other members of the lentiviral genus of retroviruses encode a viral infectivity factor (Vif). HIV-1 Vif binds specifically to human APOBEC3G and induces its polyubiquitination and rapid degradation by proteasomes (7Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol.

This effect is species-restricted since HIV-1 Vif cannot bind to APOBEC3G from African green monkeys or mice (4Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C.

Although APOBEC3G occurs in T lymphocytes and in several leukemic T cell lines including HUT78 and its derivative H9 that contain this antiviral defense system, it is absent in many other cell lines that have been examined (7Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 19Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Consequently, these other cell lines are permissive for replication of HIV-1(Δvif) that contains an inactivating mutation or deletion of the vif gene (20Gabuzda D.H. Lawrence K. Langhoff E.

Expression of APOBEC3G in these permissive cell lines converts them to the nonpermissive phenotype, as determined by their ability to efficiently inactivate HIV-1(Δvif) but not wild-type HIV-1 (4Mariani R.

Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Recently, another member of the cytidine deaminase family, APOBEC3F, was also shown to have antiretroviral activity (23Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zheng Y.H. Irwin D. Kurosu T. Tokunaga K. Sata T. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6073-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Similarly, the RNA-specific adenosine deaminases, which are induced by interferons in response to double-stranded RNA, inactivate several RNA viruses (25Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). The factors that control expression of APOBEC3G have not previously been investigated. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the APOBEC3G that occurs naturally in T lymphocytes is constitutively active or whether its antiviral function is induced by infection or by signal transduction processes such as the classical innate antiviral responses involving type I interferons (INF) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (25Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 26Herbein G. O'Brien W.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 241-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APOBEC3G occurs in a family of cytidine deaminases that includes APOBEC1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, -3E, -3F, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase. It is encoded on chromosome 22 in a region that also contains the genes or pseudogenes for APOBEC3A to 3F (27Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 28Anant S. Mukhopadhyay D. Sankaranand V. Kennedy S. Henderson J.O. Davidson N.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1904-C1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that phorbol esters cause increases in the amounts of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B mRNAs by an unknown mechanism. Consequently, these enzymes were initially termed phorbolin-1 and phorbolin-2, respectively (29Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 560-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Madsen P. Anant S. Rasmussen H.H. Gromov P. Vorum H. Dumanski J.P. Tommerup N. Collins J.E. Wright C.L.

Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) activates several protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and -independent intracellular signaling pathways (31Brose N. Rosenmund C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4399-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 33Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied PKC-dependent pathway involves activation of Ras and the downstream kinases Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (collectively termed MEK), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (34Lee Jr., J.T. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2002; 16: 486-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chang F. Steelman L.S. Lee J.T. Shelton J.G. Navolanic P.M. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Activated ERK stimulates specific transcription factors that have been shown to up-regulate expression of a diverse array of genes in different tissues (35Chang F. Steelman L.S. Lee J.T. Shelton J.G. Navolanic P.M. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2003; 17: 1263-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 37Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). ERK is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which also includes JNK and p38. The latter are not activated by PMA but respond to stress stimuli and inflammatory cytokines (37Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 38Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

Specific factors have been shown to regulate the expression and to control the functions of APOBEC1 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (39Nakamuta M. Oka K. Krushkal J. Kobayashi K.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of the well studied APOBEC1 enzyme is controlled by APOBEC1 complementation factors, which recruit it to a specific site in the apolipoprotein B mRNA (41Dance G.S. Sowden M.P. Cartegni L. Cooper E. Krainer A.R. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is only when APOBEC1 is expressed in excess of the APOBEC1 complementation factors that it deaminates other mRNAs (44Sowden M. Hamm J.K. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3011-3017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Yamanaka S. Balestra M.E. Ferrell L.D. Fan J. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. Proc.

Interestingly, overexpression of APOBEC3G and other cytidine deaminases can cause mutagenesis and cellular toxicity (45Yamanaka S. Balestra M.E. Ferrell L.D. Fan J. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8483-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 46Yoshikawa K. Okazaki I.M. Eto T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Nagaoka H. Honjo T.

Thus, there is precedence for the hypothesis that cellular factors and expression levels of cytidine deaminases can regulate their functions. Here we describe our initial characterization of the factors that control APOBEC3G expression levels in T cells. Interestingly, APOBEC3G mRNA synthesis is dynamically controlled by a protein kinase cascade that is induced by extracellular signals and that is inhibited when cells become arrested in the G0 stage of the cell cycle. Cell Culture and Reagents—H9 cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). PMA (100 nm–1 μm), an inactive phorbol ester, 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (4αPMA) (100 nm) (Calbiochem), TNF-α (50 ng/ml) (R&D Biosystems), INF-α (1 μg/ml), INF-γ (1 μg/ml) (Peprotech, Inc.), and INF-β (1 μg/ml) (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) were added to the culture media of H9 cells for 2–24 h. H9 cells were treated with PKC inhibitors Calphostin C (100 nm), PKC inhibitor 20-28 (also known as myristolated pseudosubstrate 20-28) (20 μm), Ro-32-0432 (200 nm), or Gö6976 (50 nm) or specific MEK inhibitors PD98059 (50 μm) and U0126 (20 μm) (Calbiochem) for 1 h prior to and for the duration of PMA treatment. Cyclohexamide (10 μg/ml) or actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added to the media of H9 cells in culture 1 h prior to mock treatment or treatment with PMA for up to 16 h. Northern Blot Analysis and qRT-PCR—RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were described previously (48Tailor C.S. Nouri A. Lee C.G. Kozak C. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). [32P]-labeled cDNA probes were used to detect APOBEC3G, protein kinase R (PKR), or the S2 ribosomal protein mRNAs (used as a loading control). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed according to standard protocols (49Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNAs of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and APOBEC3G were amplified using 2× SYBR Green master mix (2× PCR buffer, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 0.005% SYBR Green, 2× Rox reference dye, 16% Me2SO, 0.04 units/μl Platinum Taq polymerase) and an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The sensitivity of the PCR was tested by amplification of the target from serially diluted cDNAs generated from reverse transcription of human reference RNA (Stratagene). qRT-PCR amplification within samples was normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification levels as an endogenous control. Each sample was assayed in triplicate using the primer pair 5′-TCAGAGGACGGCATGAGACTTA-3′, 5′-AGCAGGACCCAGGTGTCATT-3′ specific for APOBEC3G and the primer pair 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGT-3′, 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Data analysis and calculations were done following the 2-ΔΔCT comparative method outlined in Ref. 62Biosystems Applied ABI Prism 7700 User Bulletin Number 2. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA1997Google Scholar. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was described previously (50Marin M. Tailor C.S. Nouri A. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8085-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaVO3, and 25 mm NaF) and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were adjusted to equal protein concentrations by using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts were used for Western immunoblotting. APOBEC3G was detected using a rabbit peptide antibody (a gift from Warner Greene, University of California, San Francisco). MAPKs were detected using antibodies for MEK-1 and ERK-1 and phospho-specific antibodies for detecting the phosphorylated forms of both MEK and ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Activation of p38 was monitored using phospho-specific antibodies for p38 MAPK (a gift from Bruce Magun, Oregon Health and Science University). Equivalent loading of proteins was shown using a mouse antibody specific for α-tubulin (Sigma). Control of APOBEC3G Expression by Specific Protein Kinase C Isozymes—Northern blot analyses in stringent conditions and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) were both used to evaluate APOBEC3G mRNA levels in cells. Furthermore, because sequence similarities exist among APOBEC family members (27Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), we used oligonucleotide primers that were specific for APOBEC3G, and we cloned and sequenced multiple PCR products from independent reactions and confirmed that they all corresponded to APOBEC3G. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, APOBEC3G mRNA levels in H9 cells were unaffected by treatments with INF-α,-β, or-γ, which were active as indicated by their inductive effects on PKR mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Similarly, TNF-α had no effect on the APOBEC3G mRNA level, although it was also active in these cells as indicated by its ability to phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK (data not shown). In contrast, PMA induced strong increases in APOBEC3G mRNA levels within 2 h that continued until at least 10 h after treatment. This effect was specific for PMA because an inactive phorbol ester, 4αPMA, had no effect on APOBEC3G mRNA levels (Fig. 2B). Prolonged exposure to PMA causes elimination of PKC (33Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which may explain the diminished effect of PMA on APOBEC3G expression levels at 24 h after treatment (Fig. 1).Fig. 2APOBEC3G mRNA levels are regulated by PKC and MEK1/2.A, H9 cells were treated with the general PKC inhibitors, PKC inhibitor 20-28 (100 nm) or Calphostin C (50 nm), or with the PKCα/βI-specific inhibitors, Gö6976 (200 nm) and Ro-32-0432 (100 nm), for 1 h prior to the addition of PMA (100 nm). B, H9 cells were treated with the specific MEK inhibitors U0126 (20 μm) or PD98059 (50 μm) or mock-treated with Me2SO alone for 1 h prior to the addition of PMA (100 nm) or 4αPMA (100 nm), an inactive phorbol ester. The Me2SO concentrations were equal in all of the cultures. RNA was isolated from cells at the indicated times and was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR for APOBEC3G mRNA levels. C, Northern blot analysis of H9 cells treated with U0126 (20 μm) or mock-treated for 1 h prior to the addition of PMA (100 nm) using a [32P]-labeled DNA probe specific for APOBEC3G. The Northern blot was subsequently probed with a [32P]-labeled DNA probe for the S2 ribosomal RNA loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PMA was previously shown to increase mRNA levels of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B (29Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 560-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PMA mimics the second messenger diacylglycerol that binds to and activates PKC. There are 11 known PKC isozymes, 9 of which are PMA-sensitive (α, βI, βII, θ, γ, δ, ϵ, η, μ) (33Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To determine whether enhancement of APOBEC3G mRNA levels by PMA treatment is mediated by PKC, general PKC inhibitors (Calphostin C, PKC inhibitor 20-28) as well as inhibitors specific for PKCα/βI (Gö6976, Ro-32-0432) were incubated with H9 cells 1 h prior to and for the duration of PMA or a mock treatment. All PKC inhibitors abolished the induction of APOBEC3G mRNA by PMA (Fig. 2A). Inhibitors that are highly selective for PKCα/βI isozymes were as effective as general PKC inhibitors at preventing PMA enhancement of APOBEC3G mRNA, suggesting that PKCα/βI isozymes are solely responsible for this effect. MEK Regulates APOBEC3G mRNA Levels—Activation of PKCα/βI is critical for the regulation of mRNA levels for many genes in numerous cell lines (34Lee Jr., J.T. McCubrey J.A.

To evaluate the possible role of MEK as a downstream target of PMA treatment, H9 cells were treated for 1 h with specific MEK inhibitors U0126 or PD98059 (51Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J.

These MEK inhibitors efficiently blocked the PMA-induced increase in APOBEC3G mRNA (Fig. 2, B and C). Indeed, APOBEC3G mRNA levels in H9 cells treated with U0126 or PD98059 declined below the basal level within 4 h after treatment and continued to decline over a 24-h period (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that MEK-dependent signal transduction is necessary both to maintain the basal level of APOBEC3G and to enhance the APOBEC3G mRNA level in response to PMA. We also did Western immunoblot analyses of H9 cell extracts using a previously characterized antiserum made to a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of APOBEC3G. This antiserum is highly specific for APOBEC3G (results not shown) (7Stopak K. de Noronha C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol.

Serum starvation arrests cultured cells at the G0/G1 transition of the cell cycle and causes dephosphorylation and consequent inactivation of MEK, whereas progression to G1 coincides with MEK activation (7Stopak K. de Noronha C.

Presenilins play an important role in amyloid β-precursor processing, NOTCH receptor signaling, and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which presenilins regulate apoptosis are not fully understood. Here, we report that presenilin-1 (PS1) regulates the proteolytic activity of the serine protease Omi/HtrA2 through direct interaction with its regulatory PDZ domain. We show that a peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PS1 dramatically increases the proteolytic activity of Omi/HtrA2 toward the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins and β-casein and induces cell death in an Omi/HtrA2-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, ectopic expression of full-length PS1, but not PS1 lacking the C-terminal PDZ binding motif, potentiated Omi/HtrA2-induced cell death. Our results suggest that the C terminus of PS1 is an activation peptide ligand for the PDZ domain of Omi/HtrA2 and may regulate the protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 after its release from the mitochondria during apoptosis. This mechanism of Omi/HtrA2 activation is similar to the mechanism of activation of the related bacterial DegS protease by the outer-membrane porins.

Presenilins are highly conserved in evolution, being present also in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and are transcribed in many different cell types, both within the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. PS1 is a polytopic integral membrane protein composed of eight hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments, with N-terminal and C-terminal tails facing the cytoplasm. It is believed to be a catalytic subunit of a stable, high molecular mass γ-secretase complex, which contains also the three essential cofactors nicastrin, anterior pharynx defective 1, and presenilin enhancer 2 (5Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar). In this complex the PS1 holoprotein (∼44 kDa) undergoes constitutive endoproteolytic processing between TM6 and TM7 and, therefore, exists as a stable heterodimer composed of N-terminal fragment and C-terminal fragment (6Thinakaran G.

The mature Omi/HtrA2 carries an IAP binding motif at its N terminus in addition to the serine protease domain.

In addition, Omi/HtrA2 can promote apoptosis in a caspase-independent mechanism through its ability to cleave IAPs in the cytoplasm (17Srinivasula S.M. Gupta S. Datta P. Zhang Z. Hegde R. Cheong N.

In addition to its role in apoptosis we have recently shown that Omi/HtrA2 has a vital role in the mitochondria. The mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) mutant mice suffer from a neurodegenerative disease that causes muscle wasting and death by 6 weeks of age as a result of a point mutation in a noncatalytic serine residue (S276C) in the Omi/HtrA2 protein (20Jones J.M. Datta P. Srinivasula S.M. Ji W. Gupta S. Zhang Z. Davies E. Hajnoczky G. Saunders T.L. Van Keuren M.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Meisler M.H. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The mutation does not affect the processing or localization of the mutant Omi/HtrA2 protein but renders it proteolytically inactive. The loss of Omi/HtrA2 protease activity increases the susceptibility of mitochondria to induction of the permeability transition and increases the sensitivity of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to stress-induced cell death. A defining feature of the HtrA protease family is the combination of a catalytic serine-protease domain with at least one PDZ domain (12Pallen M.J. Wren B.W. Mol.

They are named after the three proteins where they were originally found: postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) (23Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains are defined by a unique sequence of 80–100 amino acids able to recognize specific C-terminal sequences in target proteins (26Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 27Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Recent structural and biochemical evidence suggested that the PDZ domain in the bacterial HtrA protease DegS modulates the activity of the protease domain upon binding to specific activation peptides derived from the C termini of the OMP proteins (28Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Here we report that peptides derived from the C termini of human Presenilins modulate the protease and apoptotic activities of Omi/HtrA2 by binding to its PDZ domain. Because mutations in Presenilins increase neuronal cell death, our findings suggest that activation of cytosolic Omi/HtrA2 by mutant Presenilins could be in part responsible for their increased apoptotic activity. Cell Culture—Cells were cultured either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (HeLa and MEFs), DMEM/F-12 (293T cells), or RPMI 1640 (MCF-7 cells), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg·ml–1 penicillin, and 100 μg·ml–1 streptomycin sulfate. MEFs were isolated at E15 from mnd2/mnd2 embryos (20Jones J.M. Datta P. Srinivasula S.M. Ji W. Gupta S. Zhang Z. Davies E. Hajnoczky G. Saunders T.L. Van Keuren M.L. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Meisler M.H.

The human Omi/HtrA2-expressing mnd2-Omi/HtrA2 MEFs were generated by stable transfection of the immortalized mnd2 MEFs with a retroviral expression vector containing the full-length human Omi/HtrA2 cDNA (MSCV-hOmi). The mnd2-vector cells were generated from the immortalized mnd2 MEFs by stable transfection with the empty retroviral expression vector MSCV. HeLa cells expressing C-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length Omi/HtrA2 or only the PDZ domain of Omi/HtrA2 in the mitochondria were generated by stable transfection of HeLa Tet-Off™ (BD Biosciences) with the expression plasmid pTRE2-Omi/HtrA2 or pTRE2-Omi/HtrA2-MTS-PDZ, respectively.

DegS-ΔMA and RseA (residue 120 to end) were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from Escherichia coli as a template and cloned in-frame into pET28a. The variants of GST having C-terminal tail of PS1 were generated by PCR using appropriate primers and cloned into pET28a. N-terminal GFP-tagged PS1 constructs were generated by PCR using appropriate primers and cloned into pEGFP vector. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. Peptide Synthesis—All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase techniques using a Symphony Multiplex synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc., Tucson, AZ) or a 9050 Pepsynthesizer Plus automated peptide synthesizer (Perseptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) with N-Fmoc/tert-butyl chemistry. For this procedure, Fmoc amino acids (4 equivalents) were activated with a mixture of 1-hydroxybenzo-triazole/2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (4 equivalents each) and diisopropylethylamine (8 equivalents) in dimethylformamide solvent. The Fmoc protecting group was removed with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide. Deprotection of the amino acid side chains and cleavage of the peptide from the resin was performed by a 2.5-h incubation of the peptide in a mixture containing 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, and triisopropylsilane. For peptides containing cysteine and/or methionine, the deprotection mixture consisted of 94.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, 2.5% ethanedithiol, and 1% triisopropylsilane. Peptides were purified by reversephase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 Vydac column using the 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solvent system (aqueous buffer, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in HPLC grade H2O-organic phase, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile). The peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All the peptides were at least 95% pure, as determined by HPLC. Transfections and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on 12-well plates were transfected with the required plasmids. The transfections were done using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the plasmids for transfection were prepared by using Qiagen columns. After 24–48 h of transfection, cells were observed using fluorescence microscope. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—HeLa Tet-Off™ cells stably expressing FLAG-Omi/HtrA2 and FLAG-Omi/HtrA2-PDZ under the control of the Tet-Off system were induced for 48 h, in DMEM medium without tetracycline. Cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing (1 mg/ml) dimethyl-3,3-dithiobispropionimidate·2HCl (DTBP) (protein cross-linker), diluted from freshly prepared stock solution (50 mg/ml), and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Subsequently cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were lysed by passing 30 times through a 23.5-gauge needle and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein G-Sepharose and incubated with FLAG antibody (1:200) at 4 °C for 4 h. The immunocomplexes were precipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with PS1 antibody (Ab14) (kind gift from Dr. Sam Gandy, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). In some experiments, 293T cells were co-transfected with constructs encoding GFP or C-terminal GFP-tagged full-length PS1, and FLAG-tagged mature Omi/HtrA2. 36 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with the cross-linker DTBP and then lysed in IP buffer as above, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with a FLAG antibody or an Omi/HtrA2-specific antibody. In other experiments, endogenous PS1 was immunoprecipitated with the PS1-Ab14 antibody from 293T cells after incubation with the cross-linker DTBP, and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with an Omi/HtrA2-specific antibody. Cell Death Assays—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well and treated with PTD or PTD-PS1-C15 peptides followed by staining with propidium iodide (PI). Cells showing PI staining, loss of cell volume, loss of refractility, and membrane blebbing were scored as apoptotic. At least 200 cells were counted in each well. The data represent mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Cell death induced by transient transfection of the GFP-tagged PS1 constructs was determined as above. Omi/HtrA2 Interacts with the C-terminal Tail of PS1—The 3- to 4-residue PDZ binding motif located at the extreme C terminus in bacterial outer membrane porins (OMP) is an important regulator of the enzymatic activity of the bacterial HtrA protease DegS (28Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Because Omi/HtrA2 shares extensive sequence and structural homology with DegS (28Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we reasoned that its enzymatic activity might be regulated by a similar mechanism. Computer searches for mammalian membrane proteins with PDZ binding motifs similar to those present in the OMP proteins identified PS1 and PS2, as likely regulators for the serine protease activity of Omi/HtrA2. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of the last 15 residues of the cytoplasmic tail of PS1, which contains a consensus PDZ binding motif (FYI-COOH), to interact with Omi/HtrA2 by in vitro GST-pull-down assays. For this purpose we generated variants of GST having residues from the cytoplasmic tail of PS1 fused to the C terminus of GST (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, 15 residues of the C terminus of PS1 fused to GST (GST-PS1-C15) were able to precipitate endogenous Omi/HtrA2 from 293T cell extracts. However, no interaction was seen when the last 3 residues of PS1 were deleted (GST-PS1-ΔC3), or when only the last 3 residues of PS1 were used (GST-PS1-C3). These results indicate that the C-terminal 15 residue tail of PS1 interacts with Omi/HtrA2 and that the PDZ binding motif and residues adjacent to it are required for this interaction. To further investigate the interaction between Omi/HtrA2 and PS1, in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. For this purpose, we used HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Omi/HtrA2 and Omi/HtrA2-PDZ domains (Fig. 1C). Endogenous PS1 was immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody from both the full-length Omi/HtrA2- and Omi/HtrA2-PDZ-expressing cells, but not the vector control (Fig. 1C). We also co-transfected 293T cells with constructs encoding N-terminal GFP-tagged full-length PS1 and FLAG-tagged mature Omi/HtrA2. As predicted, the GFP-PS1 fusion protein was also able to bind the ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged Omi/HtrA2 (Fig. 1D, fifth lane) and the endogenous Omi/HtrA2 (Fig. 1D, second lane). Furthermore, we immunoprecipitated endogenous PS1 from 293T cells with a PS1-specific antibody and probed the immunoprecipitates with an Omi/HtrA2-specific antibody (Fig. 1E). Endogenous Omi/HtrA2 was immunoprecipitated with the PS1 antibody (fifth lane) but not with the nonspecific antibody (fourth lane), indicating that endogenous Omi/HtrA2 interacts specifically with endogenous PS1. Combined, these results demonstrate that PS1 does indeed interact with Omi/HtrA2 via the PDZ domain. C-terminal Presenilin Peptides Regulate Omi/HtrA2 Protease Activity—Recent structural information suggests that the active sites of Omi/HtrA2 and the bacterial homolog DegS are present in a nonfunctional state when their PDZ domains are not bound to the activation peptides (28Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Binding of the activation peptides to the PDZ domain induces a conformational change in the flexible L3 loop, which triggers reorientation of the activation domain yielding a functional active site, thereby promoting degradation of the substrates. To test whether the C terminus of PS1 is an activation peptide for Omi/HtrA2, we assayed the activity of purified mature Omi/HtrA2 with 35S-β-casein and IAPs as substrates, in the presence or absence of a peptide corresponding to the last 15 residues of the C terminus of PS1 (PS-C15). As predicted the PS-C15 peptide drastically increased the protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 toward these substrates, indicating that binding of this peptide to the PDZ domain could indeed modulate the protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 (Fig. 2B). The PDZ domains usually recognize 3–4 residue motifs that occur at the C terminus of target proteins, although in some rare cases specificity of recognition extends beyond 4 residues. To determine the optimal number of amino acid residues required for recognition of Omi/HtrA2 PDZ domain, we used peptides corresponding to the last 3, 8, and 15 residues of PS1 and its homolog PS2 (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also used GQYYFV-COOH peptide, recently reported to bind Omi/HtrA2 PDZ domain and increase protease activity (30Martins L.M. Turk B.E. Cowling V. Borg A. Jarrell E.T. Cantley L.C. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49417-49427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the 15-residue peptides patterned after PS1 and PS2 significantly increased the protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 against 35S-β-casein, whereas the 3-residue or 8-residue peptides had no or slight effect, respectively (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, the previously described GQYYFV-COOH peptide showed no effect on Omi/HtrA2 protease activity under these conditions. Essentially similar results were obtained with XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 as substrates. The PS1-C15 peptide had no enzymatic activity when assayed without Omi/HtrA2 and had no effect on the activity of an Omi/HtrA2 mutant without PDZ domain (data not shown). Combined, the above data indicate that the PDZ domain regulates Omi/HtrA2 protease activity and that the 3-residue PDZ binding motif in PS1 or PS2 is not sufficient for this effect but adjacent residues are required to relieve the inhibition of the PDZ domain. Because there was no significant difference between the protease-promoting activity of PS1-C15 and PS2-C15 peptides, we decided to use the PS1-C15 peptide for further studies. To determine the effective concentration of the PS1 peptide, we incubated Omi/HtrA2 together with substrates and increasing concentrations of this peptide. PS1 peptide caused a dose-dependent increase in Omi/HtrA2 protease activity toward β-casein, XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 substrates (Fig. 2C). PS1 peptide showed a marked protease stimulatory activity at 10 μm concentration. Similar concentrations of peptides were used recently to demonstrate activation of DegS by OMP peptides (28Wilken C. Kitzing K. Kurzbauer R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Cell. 2004; 117: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To further investigate the activity of the last 15 residues of PS1 in a context of a globular protein, we fused this peptide or shorter variants of this peptide to the C terminus of GST (Fig. 1B). Next we tested the effect of purified GST and the GST-PS1 fusion variants on protease activity of Omi/HtrA2. As shown in Fig. 3, GST protein having the last 15 amino acid residues (GST-PS1-C15) of PS1 at its C terminus markedly enhanced the protease activity of Omi/HtrA2. However, GST or the GST variant with only the last 3 residues of PS1 (GST-PS1-C3) had no such effect on protease activity of Omi/HtrA2. No effect was also seen with the GST-PS1-ΔC3 variant, in which the 3-residue PDZ binding motif at the extreme C terminus of the PS1 peptide is deleted (Fig. 3). Combined, these results indicate that the last 3 amino acids in the PS1 peptide are important for interaction with the PDZ domain of Omi/HtrA2, but adjacent residues are also required. Furthermore, the presence of the PS1 peptide in the context of a globular protein such as GST does not affect their activity toward Omi/HtrA2. C-terminal Peptide of PS1 Activates DegS Protease Activity— DegS is a bacterial trimeric serine protease related to Omi/HtrA2. Binding of tripeptides derived from the C termini o"

Under anaerobic conditions, glucose is converted to equimolar amounts of glycerol and pyruvate, which are both secreted from the parasite. As we have shown previously, glycerol transport in T. brucei occurs via specific membrane proteins (Wille, U., Schade, B., and Duszenko, M. (1998) Eur. J. Biochem. 256, 245–250). Here, we describe cloning and biochemical characterization of the three trypanosomal aquaglyceroporins (AQP; TbAQP1–3), which show a 40–45% identity to mammalian AQP3 and -9. AQPs belong to the major intrinsic protein family and represent channels for small non-ionic molecules. Both TbAQP1 and TbAQP3 contain two highly conserved NPA motifs within the pore-forming region, whereas TbAQP2 contains NSA and NPS motifs instead, which are only occasionally found in AQPs. For functional characterization, all three proteins were heterologously expressed in yeast and Xenopus oocytes. In the yeast fps1Δ mutant, TbAQPs suppressed hypoosmosensitivity and rendered cells to a hyper-osmosensitive phenotype, as expected for unregulated glycerol channels. Under iso- and hyperosmotic conditions, these cells constitutively released glycerol, consistent with a glycerol efflux function of TbAQP proteins. TbAQP expression in Xenopus oocytes increased permeability for water, glycerol and, interestingly, dihydroxyacetone. Except for urea, TbAQPs were virtually impermeable for other polyols; only TbAQP3 transported erythritol and ribitol. Thus, TbAQPs represent mainly water/glycerol/dihydroxyacetone channels involved in osmoregulation and glycerol metabolism in T. brucei. This function and especially the so far not investigated transport of dihydroxyacetone may be pivotal for the survival of the parasite survival under non-aerobic or osmotic stress conditions.

This function and especially the so far not investigated transport of dihydroxyacetone may be pivotal for the survival of the parasite survival under non-aerobic or osmotic stress conditions. The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei undergoes a complex life cycle including two dividing stages, i.e. the long slender form in blood, lymphatic fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid of its mammalian host and the procyclic form in the mid-gut of the tsetse fly. Due to the lack of a functional Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation capabilities, the bloodstream forms depend on glycolysis for ATP production, with glycerol as an alternative substrate (1Michels P.A. Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Bakker B. Michels P. Opperdoes F. Westerhoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Glycolysis in trypanosomes differs markedly from the corresponding pathway in higher eukaryotes. Most strikingly, the first seven glycolytic reactions occur in a peroxisome-like organelle called glycosome (3Opperdoes F. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, glucose is converted into pyruvate, which is disposed by facilitated diffusion (4Wiemer E.A. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The concurrently formed NADH cannot leave the glycosome and is reoxidized during the formation of glycerol-3-phosphate from dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphat enters the mitochondrion, in which it is oxidized by glycerophosphate oxidase. This enzyme uses molecular oxygen (alternative respiration) and is inhibited by salicylhydroxamic acid. Finally, the newly formed dihydroxyacetone phosphate re-enters the glycosome and can be glycolytically converted. Obviously, suppression of glycolysis by blocking the release of pyruvate or glycerol is a potential therapeutic approach against sleeping sickness (2Bakker B. Michels P. Opperdoes F. Westerhoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Wiemer E.A. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2000; 106: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5500-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic conditions or in the presence of salicylhydroxamic acid, glucose degradation results in equimolar amounts of pyruvate and glycerol to maintain the redox balance within the glycosome (7Clayton C. Michels P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this case, glycerol is formed from glycerol-3-phosphate by glycerokinase, which in trypanosomes leads to the formation of ATP (8Steinborn K. Szallies A. Mecke D. Duzsenko M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To drive this reaction to ATP formation, glycerol has to be readily released. Consequently, in the presence of salicylhydroxamic acid, the addition of 5 mm glycerol to the medium reverses the glycerol diffusion gradient across the membrane and results in cell death. A therapeutic exploitation of the glycerol sensitivity of the parasite, however, has not yet been successful in situ (5Bakker B.M. Westerhoff H.V. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Brohn F.J. Clarkson A.B. Acta Trop. 1978; 35: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, more information is required to understand how the parasite copes with non-aerobic conditions, regarding metabolism and glycerol transport. We have shown previously that glycerol uptake is consistent with facilitated diffusion through a transporter protein (10Wille U. Schade B. Duszenko M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This investigation gave clear evidence for an additional nonsaturable channel, which remained active after inhibition of the transporter. As we now know, glycerol facilitators are members of the superfamily of major intrinsic protein and fall into the aquaporin branch. Aquaporins facilitate permeation of water (orthodox aquaporins) or of small non-ionic solutes, such as glycerol and urea (aquaglyceroporins). Aquaporins of both types are present throughout all kingdoms of nature and participate in diverse biological processes (11Agre P. King L. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Nielsen S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 542: 3-16Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification and cloning of three aquaglyceroporins from T. brucei (TbAQP1, TbAQP2, and TbAQP3) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaglyceroporin; TbAQP, trypanosomal AQPs; DHA, dihydroxyacetone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. and describe their functional expression and their biochemical characterization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Strains and Media—T. brucei bloodstream forms (strain 427; clone MITat 1.2) were either propagated in Sprague-Dawley rats and purified from blood using a DEAE-cellulose column (12Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) or cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere using modified minimum essential medium as described previously (13Hamm B. Schindler A. Mecke D. Duszenko M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 40: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Procyclic forms, obtained from MITat 1.2 using a standard transformation protocol (14Overath P. Czichos J. Haas C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), were also grown in a modified minimum essential medium (15Hesse F. Selzer P.M. Muhlstadt K Duszenko M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Yeast strains used in this study were W303-1A (MATa Leu2-3/112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11/15 adec2-1 can1-100 gal SUC2) and YSH295 (MATa Leu2-3/112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11/15 adec2-1 can1-100 gal SUC2 fps1Δ:LEU2), kindly provided by Dr. Stefan Hohmann (Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden). Cells were grown on medium containing 2% peptone and 1% yeast extract (YEP) supplemented with 2% glucose or on synthetic medium for the selection of transformants (16Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York2000: 13.1.2-13.1.7Google Scholar). The phenotype was analyzed by a plate growth assay (see Fig. 4). Cloning of Aquaglyceroporin Genes from T. brucei and Heterologous Expression in S. cerevisiae—The complete cDNAs of TbAQP1–3 were cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR using RNA obtained from bloodstream form and primers against the spliced leader sequence (5′-CGC TAT TAT TAG AAC AGT TTC TG-3′) or against the poly-A tail (5′-CCC GGG T (20)VNN-3′) along with primers derived from aquaporin-like sequences published by the TIGR data base (www.tigr.org). The open reading frames were cloned into pBSKS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced (GATC GmbH, Konstanz, Germany). A list of primers used is available upon request. PCR products were also cloned into SmaI-cut pRS416 (17Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 102: 19-27Crossref Google Scholar) to give rise to yeast expression vectors (MET17-inducible). EGFP fusions of TbAQP1–3 were constructed by cloning HindIII-cut PCR products obtained with primers carrying HindIII-sites immediately adjacent to sequences flanking the respective open reading frames into HindIII of pRS416 with an egfp gene for which the stop codon was replaced by a HindIII site. Glycerol Efflux Experiments of TbAQP1, TbAQP2, and TbAQP3 in S. cerevisiae under Iso-osmotic and Hyperosmotic Conditions—Cells were grown at iso-osmotic conditions overnight in synthetic medium until an optical density of 1 OD at λ = 600 nm was obtained. Part of this culture was harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 3,500 × g, 10 min), resuspended in the same medium containing 5% NaCl (hyperosmotic stress), and further incubated at room temperature and 160 rpm for 2 h. Determination of intracellular glycerol was performed by filtration (18Albertyn J. Hahmann S. Prior B. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the determination of extracellular glycerol, an aliquot of the cell-free supernatant was used. To determine the dry weight of yeast, aliquots of cells were collected onto Whatman GF/C filters and dried at 37 °C for 1 week. Expression of TbAQP1, TbAQP2, and TbAQP3 in X. laevis Oocytes—For expression in Xenopus oocytes, TbAQP1, TbAQP2, and TbAQP3 genes were subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pT7T5 expression vector, which contains 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus γ-globin gene. After linearization with SmaI, cDNAs were transcribed in vitro with 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C in the presence of 25 nm rNTPs, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, and 300 μm cap analogue m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G. Template plasmids were removed by digestion with 10 units of RNase-free Dnase I for 15 min at 37 °C. 10 ng of each cRNA were injected into defolliculated oocytes of stages V–VI. After injection, oocytes were kept at 17 °C in ND96 storage solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mMCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (19Wagner C.A. Friedrich B. Setiawan I. Lang F. Broer S. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Kinetic Glycerol Uptake of TbAQPs in Oocytes—For transport assays, 8–10 oocytes were washed and placed in 0.5 ml of fresh ND96 buffer. Glycerol uptake was started by replacement of the ND96 solution by ND96 containing 1 mm unlabeled glycerol and 1 μCi/ml of [U-14C] glycerol. Uptake of radiolabeled glycerol was stopped at defined time points by washing the cells three times in ND96 solution (at about –3 °C) containing 100 mm unlabeled glycerol (20Ma T. Frigeri A. Hasegawa H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21845-21849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Walsh M. Smits H. Scholte M. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual oocytes were dissolved in 1 ml of 10% SDS and subject to scintillation counting. Standard Oocytes Swelling Assay—Xenopus leavis oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water (control), 50 nl of water containing 10 ng of cRNA (TbAQP1, TbAQP2, or TbAQP3), or 50 nl of water containing a combination of 10 ng (TbAQP1, TbAQP2, and TbAQP3) and 2.5 ng of AQP1 as described previously (22Hansen M. Kun J. Schultz J. Beitz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4874-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To measure water permeability, oocytes were transferred into 1:3 diluted ND96 medium. Solute permeability was assayed in iso-osmotic ND96 in which 65 mm NaCl were replaced by 130 mm non-ionic test solute or 96 mm NaCl were replaced by the salt of an ionic test solute. Swelling assays were carried out at room temperature and were video-monitored. The relative oocyte volume was calculated from the covered area. Osmotic water permeability (Pf, μm/s) was calculated from the oocyte surface area (S = 0.045 cm2), the initial slope of the relative volume increase (d(V/V0)/dt in s–1), the molecular water volume (Vw = 18 cm3/mol), and the osmotic gradient (osmin-osmout) by the following equation: Pf = V0 × d(V/V0)/dt[S × Vw × (osmin-osmout)]. The initial swelling rates (d(V/V0)/dt in s–1) were used to compare solute permeabilities. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed according to Jungwirth et al. (23Jungwirth H. Bergler H. Hoegenauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36419-36424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Total RNA from procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes (the latter from exponentially growing or stationary phase parasites) was prepared as described in the Qiagen RNeasy handbook. RNA samples (15 μg of each) were denatured and separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 1.2 m formaldehyde. rRNA was used to monitor RNA loading. The gels were transferred to a Hybond-N filter and hybridized with a probe containing about 500 bp from the coding region of the TbAQP genes or of the β-tubulin gene as control. Northern blots were visualized by autoradiography. Glycerol and Protein Determination—The glycerol concentration was determined enzymatically (24Bermeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Metabolites 1: Carbohydrates. 6. Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1984: 504-506Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford method (25Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 246-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with serum albumin as a standard. We have cloned three genes from T. brucei with similarity to major intrinsic proteins using a reverse transcriptase-PCR approach. The sequences have been submitted to the EMBL data base as TbAQP1–3 (accession numbers: AJ697889, AJ697890, and AJ697891). The open reading frames code for proteins of 321 (TbAQP1), 312 (TbAQP2), and 304 (TbAQP3) amino acids, which are very similar to each other (77% identity, Fig. 1A). TbAQP1 and -3 possess two canonical NPA motifs, whereas TbAQP2 contains unusual NSA/NPS motifs as part of the pore region and a leucine residue instead of the highly conserved arginine residue following the second NP(A/S) motif (Fig. 1A, asterisk). All three TbAQPs contain characteristically elongated N termini of up to 80 amino acids. Sequence alignments and analysis of the phylogenetic tree suggest that these proteins are more closely related to aquaglyceroporins, e.g. human AQP3, -7, and -9, than to orthodox aquaporins (Fig. 1B). To characterize channel activity of TbAQPs, the corresponding proteins were N-terminally fused with GFP and functionally expressed in an S. cerevisiae fps1Δ mutant, which lacks a functional glycerol channel. Expression of GFP alone served as a control. As shown by fluorescence microscopy, GFP-TbAQPs were clearly located within the cellular membrane of the yeast (Fig. 2). For a functional characterization, TbAQP-expressing cells were grown overnight in isotonic medium. Subsequently, intra- and extracellular glycerol concentrations were determined. As shown in Fig. 3, control cells produced very little glycerol, which was equally distributed between the cells and the surrounding medium, whereas TbAQP1- and TbAQP3-transformed fps1Δ mutant cells showed a dramatic increase of glycerol production, which was almost exclusively secreted into the medium. Notably, yeast TbAQP2-transformants produced twice as much glycerol as compared with TbAQP1 and -3, which was also mainly secreted, although in this case, some glycerol was retained intracellularly (note the different scales between TbAQP1/3 and TbAQP2 in Fig. 3).Fig. 3Glycerol efflux experiments of yeast fps1Δ mutant cells transformed with an empty vector (A), with TbAQP1 (B), with TbAQP2 (C), or with TbAQP3 (D). Intra- and extracellular glycerol concentrations were determined under iso-osmotic and hyperosmotic conditions. The values given are mean ± S.D. of three independents experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further characterize this phenomenon, the experiment was repeated under hypertonic conditions (5% NaCl for 2 h), which was described to produce a very high accumulation of glycerol in S. cerevisiae (18Albertyn J. Hahmann S. Prior B. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Due to the absence of a functional glycerol channel, control cells showed indeed a high retention of glycerol, although some glycerol appeared also in the medium, indicating that glycerol leaked out through the membrane. TbAQP1- and TbAQP3-transformed fps1Δ mutant cells, however, showed similar results as those obtained under iso-osmotic conditions, i.e. these cells were unable to accumulate glycerol and released it constitutively into the medium. This behavior is similar to that described for fps1Δ yeast cells expressing the glycerol facilitator from Escherichia coli (GlpF) and indicates a non-regulated high glycerol channel activity (26Hedfalk K. Bill R. Mullins J. Karlgren S. Filipsson C. Bergstrom J. Tamas M. Rydstrom J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14954-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Tamas M. Luyten K. Sutherland F. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B. Kilian S. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TbAQP2-transformed fps1Δ mutant cells showed a similar phenotype as fps1Δ mutant cells expressing TbAQP1 and TbAQP3. However, a significant amount of glycerol was retained within the cytosol, regardless of the ionic strength of the medium (Fig. 3C). In summary, the results are consistent with a role of TbAQPs in glycerol efflux. In addition, TbAQP2 appears to affect glycerol production and its intra- and extracellular distribution in S. cerevisiae in a different way as compared with TbAQP1 and -3. To analyze the phenotype of TbAQP1, -2, and -3, respective transformants were grown and then spotted in serial dilutions onto agar plates with different osmolytes (Fig. 4). Fps1 is involved in glycerol transport in S. cerevisiae. This regulated glycerol channel is active under hypotonic conditions but inactive under hypertonic conditions (28Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skkibe W. Prior B. Ramos J. Thevelien J. Hohmann S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus, growth of fps1Δ mutant cells was limited under hypoosmotic conditions but did not show any phenotype under hyperosmotic conditions (27Tamas M. Luyten K. Sutherland F. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B. Kilian S. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TbAQPs expressed in fps1Δ mutant cells suppressed hypoosmosensitivity. In addition, these cells grew unaffected under hypertonic conditions if the respective osmolyte was 1 m glycerol. Growth was drastically reduced, however, if 1 m sorbitol or 5% NaCl was applied instead of glycerol. This phenotype of hyper-osmosensitivity for other osmolytes than glycerol was also described for yeast mutants lacking either the N- or the C-terminal regulatory domains of Fps1, indicating that TbAQPs are non-regulated glycerol channels (26Hedfalk K. Bill R. Mullins J. Karlgren S. Filipsson C. Bergstrom J. Tamas M. Rydstrom J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14954-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Tamas M. Luyten K. Sutherland F. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B. Kilian S. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For further functional characterization, TbAQPs were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Glycerol Uptake—Glycerol uptake was measured by incubation of oocytes expressing the different TbAQPs with 1 mm glycerol (1 μCi/ml [14C]glycerol). As shown in Fig. 5, control oocytes mediated only little glycerol uptake (57.9 pmol/oocyte within 40 min), consistent with simple membrane diffusion. In contrast, oocytes injected with 10 ng of any of the TbAQPs accumulated glycerol (about 240 pmol in 40 min) rapidly, with very similar transport kinetics. To confirm these results and for comparisons with other aquaglyceroporins, glycerol permeability was tested using the oocyte swelling assay. The swelling rate in a 130 mm glycerol gradient was similar among all three TbAQPs (Fig. 6) and about 10-fold higher as compared with water-injected control oocytes. This was in good agreement with the result of [14C]glycerol uptake in the same time interval of 1 min (Fig. 5). These results were comparable with those obtained using aquaglyceroporins from other protozoa, e.g. Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii (22Hansen M. Kun J. Schultz J. Beitz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4874-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Pavlovic-Djuranovic S. Schultz E. Beitz E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Water Permeability—To analyze water transport, oocytes expressing TbAQPs were exposed to hypotonic shock using a 1:3 diluted medium, which generates an osmotic gradient of 140 mosm/kg across the oocyte membrane (22Hansen M. Kun J. Schultz J. Beitz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4874-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Expression of TbAQPs in Xenopus oocytes equally led to a 6–7-fold increase of the swelling rate as compared with control oocytes (Fig. 7). From the calculated Pf values (150–180 μm/s), TbAQPs can be characterized as channels expressing an intermediate water permeability between typical aquaglyceroporins, e.g. AQP3 (Pf ≈ 70 μm/s), and orthodox aquaporins, e.g. AQP1 (Pf ≈ 290 μm/s). Selectivity Profile for Other Solutes—Beside water, aquaglyceroporins usually facilitate permeation of other small uncharged solutes. We thus measured the swelling rates of TbAQP-expressing oocytes in the presence of a variety of polyols such as urea, dihydroxyacetone, alanine, and pyruvate. Although permeability for polyols was restricted, erythritol and ribitol led to about half the swelling rate of glycerol in TbAQP3-expressing oocytes (Fig. 6). Urea passed the pores of TbAQP2 and -3 but was hardly transported by TbAQP1 (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, dihydroxyacetone (DHA) was excellently transported by all TbAQPs; when compared with glycerol, the transport rate was about 2-fold higher for TbAQP2, 1.5-fold higher for TbAQP1, and about equal for TbAQP3. Interestingly, a concentration of 0.2 m DHA is toxic for yeast cells (30Molin M. Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1415-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In glucose-containing medium, 0.2 m DHA led to a slightly decreased growth rate of the fps1Δ deletion strain, whereas growth of TbAQP-transformed fps1Δ was drastically reduced (Fig. 7). These results are consistent with a role of TbAQPs for DHA permeation and stress the importance of aquaglyceroporins for secretion of toxic metabolites. Northern blot analysis using total RNA isolated from different life cycle stages and TbAQP genes as probe showed a stage-specific regulation of their transcripts. TbAQP1 was slightly expressed in log phase, highly expressed in stationary phase, and virtually the only one expressed in procyclic trypanosomes. TbAQP2 was scarcely expressed throughout the life cycle, whereas transcripts of TbAQP3 were only detectable in bloodstream form parasites (Fig. 8). The importance of aquaporins can be inferred from their wide distribution throughout nature from bacteria to human. Single cell organisms may possess only one type, like P. falciparum (22Hansen M. Kun J. Schultz J. Beitz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4874-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), or several of them, e.g. S. cerevisiae. Metazoa usually express numerous isoforms, e.g. 11 AQP isoforms in mammalians (30Molin M. Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1415-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of glycosomes in T. brucei, the energy metabolism of this parasite is unique. Especially important is the sensitivity for glycerol under anaerobic conditions, which can be mimicked by salicylhydroxamic acid. We have cloned TbAQP1, TbAQP2, and TbAQP3. Experimental evidence for the function of TbAQPs as glycerol facilitators was obtained by complementation studies of functionally expressed TbAQPs in an S. cerevisiae fps1Δ mutant, which suppressed the hypoosmotic sensitivity of this strain. In addition, these transformants showed a hyperosmotic phenotype similar to a yeast fps1Δ mutant expressing either GlpF or Fps1 with N or C termini deletions (26Hedfalk K. Bill R. Mullins J. Karlgren S. Filipsson C. Bergstrom J. Tamas M. Rydstrom J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14954-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Tamas M. Luyten K. Sutherland F. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B. Kilian S. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TbAQP transformants further showed incapacities to accumulate glycerol under isotonic and hypertonic conditions, indicating a glycerol efflux function of TbAQPs. The existence of channels involved in glycerol efflux stresses the role for glycerol release depending on oxygen supply. This may not only be important under anaerobic conditions, but also under a diminution of oxygen, because glycerol production was observed even under aerobic conditions (6Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5500-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Participation of TbAQPs in glycerol catabolism was inferred from glycerol influx experiments. As judged from both uptake of radiolabeled glycerol and standard oocyte swelling assays, TbAQPs expressed in Xenopus oocytes transport glycerol efficiently, comparable with AQP3 and AQP9 (31Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, glycerol serves as an alternative substrate (6Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5500-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and inhibits glucose uptake efficiently (50% at 0.8 mm glycerol (2Bakker B. Michels P. Opperdoes F. Westerhoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)); it also competes for ATP (32Bakker, B. (1998) Control and regulation of glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei. Ph.D. thesis, the University of Amsterdam, AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). Therefore, the glycerol blood concentration of about 50 μm could be relevant as an energy source for trypanosomes. TbAQPs are aquaglyceroporins, which are able to transport water and other small solutes. The Pf values of oocytes expressing TbAQPs are in the range of aquaporins with intermediate water permeability, such as T. gondii (29Pavlovic-Djuranovic S. Schultz E. Beitz E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that T. brucei live under constant conditions in blood and are thus not exposed to osmotic stress. However, it is well known that erythrocytes possess a high density of AQP1 in their plasma membrane, which shows a high capacity for water transport. This aquaporin seems to be fundamental to respond to abrupt changes in extracellular osmolarity, e.g. when blood cells travel through the renal medulla (33Nelson D. Cox. M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Worth Publishers, New York2000: 410-411Google Scholar). This may also be important for trypanosomes within their mammalian host. However, osmoregulation may become pivotal for survival of trypanosomes also during the course of transmission and during their life within the insect vector. Transport of other solutes by TbAQPs was restricted (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, uptake of DHA in oocytes expressing TbAQPs was similar to or even better than glycerol. This result was confirmed by experiments with TbAQP-transformed fps1Δ mutant yeast. So far, the physiological relevance of the DHA transport is unknown, but a simple explanation would be that DHA may be used as energy source. However, this seems not to be the case since detailed searches of the trypanosome gene data bank (TIGR and Sanger) for enzymes related to DHA consumption (i.e. glycerol dehydrogenase and dihydroxyacetone kinase) gave negative results. Moreover, trypanosomes incubated in buffer containing different DHA concentrations as the sole energy source did not survive (data not shown). In literature, DHA has been related to anaerobic glycerol metabolism and osmoregulation, but cell toxicity has also been described (30Molin M. Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1415-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Sun J. van den Heuvel J. Soucaille P. Qu Y. Zeng A.P. Biotechnol. Prog. 2003; 19: 263-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The expression profile of TbAQP transcripts suggests a distinct importance of the respective proteins throughout the life cycle. We interpret these data as follows. Although TbAQP3 seems to be the main AQP in the logarithmically growing slender bloodstream form, the procyclic form relies on the expression of TbAQP1. Stationary phase trypanosomes, equivalent to stumpy bloodstream forms, still express some TbAQP3 but also a huge amount of TbAQP1. This may reflect either the onset of the differentiation process or, more likely, the specific need for aquaglyceroporins during the transmission process. TbAQP2 is scarcely expressed in all three life stages examined. Since this AQP shows significant changes in the NPA and the charged amino acid motifs and thus the formation of the pore, it may be a candidate for an organelle localization. Alternatively, it could be expressed only under defined stress conditions. In conclusion, we report the characterization of three aquaglyceroporins from T. brucei. These proteins constitute channels with a high glycerol and an intermediate water permeability, which may be mainly involved in glycerol uptake and release and in osmoregulation. In addition, their transcripts seem to be regulated in a stage-specific fashion. We also studied permeability of TbAQPs for DHA, which was in the same range (TbAQP3) or even more prominent as the glycerol transport (TbAQP1 and -2). Since the metabolic function of DHA in T. brucei has not been experimentally addressed yet, experiments are underway to improve our understanding of the relevance of this metabolite in the biology of trypanosomes. We are most grateful to Dr. Stefan Hohmann (Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden) for providing the yeast strains."

ATP binding after mismatch recognition by MutS serves as a switch that enables MutL binding and the subsequent initiation of mismatch repair. However, the mechanism of this switch is poorly understood. We have investigated the effects of ATP binding on the MutS structure. Crystallographic studies of ATP-soaked crystals of MutS show a trapped intermediate, with ATP in the nucleotide-binding site. Local rearrangements of several residues around the nucleotide-binding site suggest a movement of the two ATPase domains of the MutS dimer toward each other. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments confirm such a rearrangement, showing increased affinity between the ATPase domains upon ATP binding and decreased affinity in the presence of ADP. Mutations of specific residues in the nucleotide-binding domain reduce the dimer affinity of the ATPase domains. In addition, ATP-induced release of DNA is strongly reduced in these mutants, suggesting that the two activities are coupled. Hence, it seems plausible that modulation of the affinity between ATPase domains is the driving force for conformational changes in the MutS dimer. These changes are driven by distinct amino acids in the nucleotide-binding site and form the basis for long-range interactions between the ATPase domains and DNA-binding domains and subsequent binding of MutL and initiation of mismatch repair.

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) 1The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMPPMP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; Taq, Thermus aquaticus; ABC, ATP-binding cassette.1The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMPPMP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; Taq, Thermus aquaticus; ABC, ATP-binding cassette. is an essential safeguard of genomic stability in organisms. When mismatch repair is lost, the mutation frequency is greatly enhanced, which, in mammals, ultimately leads to cancer. The Escherichia coli MMR recognizes and repairs base mispairings and unpaired bases. The MMR system is composed of several proteins that act sequentially in the repair cascade. The MutS protein recognizes mismatches and then binds the second protein, named MutL. This protein will then activate the endonuclease MutH, which nicks the newly synthesized DNA strand at hemimethylated GATC sites. This single-stranded nick serves as an entry point for exonucleases and helicases that remove the new strand including the mismatched base. Finally, polymerase III and DNA ligase will repair the removed stretch of DNA (for reviews see Refs. 1Bellacosa A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1076-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and 2Marti T.M. Kunz C. Fleck O. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).All MutS homologs show an ATPase activity that is crucial for mismatch repair in vivo, but its role remains controversial. The MutS proteins appear to behave as molecular switches that use nucleotide binding to alternate between distinct active states. In one model, ATP binding induces a state in which MutS slides away from the mismatch to allow new molecules to bind the mismatch. This increases the local concentration and triggers the repair process (3Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 4Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In a second model, ATP binding is used to aid in discrimination between homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA (5Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol.

In contrast to the first model, the MutS-MutL complex does not move away from the mismatch but directs the subsequent steps of the repair cascade while tethered to the DNA. Both models are substantially different from a third model that predicts that MutS is a motor protein that uses the ATPase activity to translocate along the DNA in search of a signal for strand discrimination (7Blackwell L.J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), revealing that the functioning of the ATPase activity is more complex than previously realized. Moreover, ATP binding and DNA binding have been described as influencing each other. DNA binding promotes ADP to ATP exchange and enhances ATPase activity (3Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Finally, both activities are required for complex formation with MutL (5Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol.

Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and E. coli (17Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) MutS-DNA complexes show that the DNA binding domains and the ATPase domains are located at either end of the complex, separated by more than 60 Å, which raises the question how the two activities communicate with one another.Little is known about the effects of DNA binding on the conformation of MutS. Crystal studies on Taq MutS showed that, in the presence of DNA, the whole molecule is well defined, whereas in absence of DNA a large part of the protein (>50%), mainly consisting of the DNA-binding domains, becomes disordered and “invisible” in the electron density (16Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Accordingly, limited proteolysis of E. coli MutS shows less degradation in the presence of DNA (14Joshi A. Sen S. Rao B.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that mismatch binding holds the MutS dimer in a more closed and robust conformation.More data are available on the nucleotide-induced conformational changes in MutS. Limited proteolysis of bacterial, yeast, and human MutS homologs has shown that the degradation pattern of MutS is altered in the absence or presence of ADP or ATP (4Gradia S. Subramanian D.

Electron micrographs of human MutSα (hMutSα) show a clear difference between the different nucleotide-bound states (4Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In the presence of ADP, hMutSα shows an open clamp conformation. In the presence of ATPγS, the clamp is closed, forming a more disc-like shape. Small angle x-ray scattering data confirm the opening and closing of the MutS clamp (19Kato R. Kataoka M. Kamikubo H. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the presence of AMPPNP, the Thermus thermophilus MutS dimer shows the smallest radius of gyration, whereas in the presence of ADP the dimer is in the most extended conformation, with the apoprotein showing an intermediate state.To elucidate how ATP binding causes the observed conformational changes in MutS, we soaked pre-existing crystals of MutS in complex with a mismatched DNA (17Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) in ATP solution. Previous attempts by W. Yang and co-workers (5Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) to obtain a crystal structure of Taq MutS binding ATP did not succeed, because ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP in the crystal. More recently, the structure of Taq MutS in complex with ADP-beryllium fluoride, an ATP analogue, was published (20Natrajan G. Lamers M.H. Enzlin J.H Winterwerp H.H. Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4814-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both structures show small rearrangements throughout the molecule when compared with the nucleotide free structure, yet none of these explains the large conformational changes observed in the biochemical experiments.Here we present the structure of E. coli MutS in complex with ATP. The structure does not show large conformational changes and presents, most likely, a trapped intermediate of a pre-hydrolysis state. However, despite the absence of major movements in this structure, small alterations in and around the nucleotide-binding site suggest that, upon ATP binding, the two ATPase domains of the MutS dimer move closer together. Using analytical ultracentrifugation we demonstrate that ATP binding indeed enhances the affinity of the ATPase domains; conversely, ADP binding decreases the affinity between the two domains. Finally, we discuss how these local changes in the ATPase domains of the MutS dimer are transmitted through other regions in the MutS-DNA complex, causing MutS to release the mismatch and/or enabling it to bind MutL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Sample Preparation—ATP, ADP, AMPPNP, and ATPγS were obtained from Fluka. All other chemicals were purchased from Merck. All mutants were derived from plasmid pMQ372 (kindly provided by M. Marinus) and pM800 for ΔC800 MutS (17Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H.

Single site mutations were introduced by a method adapted from the Exsite kit (Stratagene). All MutS proteins and DNA substrates were prepared as described previously (20Natrajan G. Lamers M.H.

Then, increasing volumes (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 μl) of an ATP containing solution (1 mm ATP, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2), were added to crystal-containing drops (∼2 μl) with 5-min intervals. Crystals were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline ID14-EH2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. Data were processed using the HKL suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Oxidation of NADH was followed for 5 min in a Beckman spectrophotometer at 340 nm. For determination of the effect of homo- and heteroduplex DNA on MutS ATPase activity and its dependence on salt concentration, 5 mm ATP containing 0.01 MBq/μl [α-32P]ATP was incubated with 5 μm MutS and a 30-base pair DNA oligomer (20 μm) containing a single GT mismatch (17Lamers M.H.

Reactions were quenched with 25 volumes of 0.5 m EDTA, and 1 μl of this mixture was spotted on a polyethyleneimine cellulose-TLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and developed in 1 m orthophosphoric acid, pH 3.8. A strong stimulation of the MutS ATPase activity was observed upon inclusion of DNA in the assay, notably with heteroduplex DNA around physiological salt concentrations (up to 6-fold stimulation at 150 mm NaCl, data not shown). Our results are very similar to the ATPase activities recently reported for E. coli MutS (26Acharya S. Foster P.L. Brooks P. Fishel R. Mol.

Winterwerp H.H. Sixma T.K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 5 μm MutS and 0-50 μm [35S]ATPγS. Affinities reported in Table II represent total binding and are therefore a summation of nucleotide binding in both sites of the MutS dimer. ATP-induced release of DNA was measured as described previously (10Lamers M.H. Winterwerp H.H. Sixma T.K.

Equilibrium sedimentation of full-length and ΔC800 MutS was performed in 50-μl volumes in sample cells fitted with a 3-mm centerpiece. Sample cells contained 7 μm protein in the absence or presence of nucleotides (50 μm) in 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2. The reference cell contained the identical solution without MutS. Data were collected at 280 nm, 20 °C, 10,400 rounds/min with a delay of 24 h to reach equilibrium. Theoretical molecular weights, partial specific volume (vbar), and molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm were calculated using the program Sednterp (29Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M.

All data were analyzed using the program Ultraspin (www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk).RESULTSCrystal Structure of the ATP-bound MutS-G:T Complex—Previously (17Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) we solved the crystal structure of a C-terminal deletion construct of MutS, termed ΔC800, in complex with substrate DNA. This construct lacks a nonconserved region at the C terminus but retains most functions of the full-length protein, being able to bind to mismatched DNA, hydrolyze ATP, and complement a MutS deficient strain in vivo, albeit with slightly reduced levels (17Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In the ΔC800 structure an ADP molecule (ΔC800-GT-ADP) is present in only the monomer that directly binds the mismatched base (monomer A) (17Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). To understand the role of ATP binding and its effects on the conformation of MutS, we soaked ATP into pre-grown crystals of the ΔC800-GT-ADP complex. Soaking of the crystals in the nucleotide solution did not lead to any macroscopic changes of the crystals such as cracking, and no large changes in unit cell dimension were observed when compared with the ΔC800-GT-ADP (data not shown). Soaking experiments with ATP, ATP-vanadate, ATP-aluminum fluoride, and AMPPNP resulted in essentially identical structures; we have described only the ATP structure here. The ΔC800-GT-ATP structure, on the whole, does not show major changes from the previously determined structure with ADP (ΔC800-GT-ADP). Contrary to what can be expected from the biochemical data, no rearrangement of domains or release of the DNA is visible (Fig. 1A). The ATP molecule is bound in the nucleotide-binding site in a conformation characteristic for P-loop hydrolases (30Geourjon C. Orelle C. Steinfels E. Blanchet C. Deleage G. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 539-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), yet hydrolysis of ATP did not take place here. This suggests that the ΔC800-GT-ATP structure represents a trapped state. Apparently, the complex is caught within the crystal contacts and cannot carry out the movements required to complete the active site or cause conformational changes as observed in biochemical experiments. The only changes observed are restricted to the ATPase domains where several residues have been affected by the newly bound ATP molecules (Fig. 1, D-F).In monomer A we find clear density for ATP-Mg2+ (Fig. 1, B and C). To accommodate the newly bound ATP, asparagine A616 (AsnA616), located at the tip of the P-loop, has rotated away from its original position to make place for the γ-phosphate. Simultaneously, histidine A728 (HisA728) has rotated toward AsnA616. In this new position, AsnA616 and HisA728 form a hydrogen bond and stabilize each other's orientation (Fig. 1E). The rotation of AsnA616 exposes the γ-phosphate of the ATP to a serine in the opposing monomer B. This serine (SerB668) is conserved in the MutS homologs and is located in a loop (residues 659-670) that is equivalent to the signature motif of the ABC membrane transporters. Previously, no electron density was observed for this loop in the structure of ΔC800-GT-ADP, even though the remainder of the complex showed well defined electron density. In the new structure with ATP, SerB668 shows clear density, indicating that its position is stabilized by the presence of ATP, whereas the loop on which it resides is more ordered and shows partially interpretable density.In monomer B (not contacting the mismatched base), which has no nucleotide in the previous structure with ADP, clear electron density is present that fits the base and sugar of the nucleotide. However, the tail of the nucleotide containing the three phosphates is flexible and can be placed in two different conformations, both of which are different from the position of the ATP in monomer A. Also, there is no density present that could fit a magnesium ion. In addition, the movements of AsnB616 and HisB728, as observed in monomer A, are not seen here. In fact, the side chain of AsnB616 and the adjacent backbone are disordered and show no electron density. Finally, the serine from the opposing monomer (SerA668) and the loop on which it resides show weaker electron density than observed in the other nucleotide-binding site.In conclusion, the two ATP-binding sites both bind ATP (Fig. 1, B and C) but show differences in conformation (Fig. 1, E and F), in agreement with the previously described asymmetry of the ATPase domains (10Lamers M.H. Winterwerp H.H. Sixma T.K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J.

Biol. 2000; 302: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An ADP molecule is found in the nucleotide-binding site of the ΔC800-GT-ADP structure monomer A, which contacts the mismatch directly. The other monomer (B) does not make any contacts to the mismatch and has an empty nucleotide-binding site. In the MutS-GT-ATP structure, this asymmetry is retained with monomer A binding ATP “specifically,” whereas monomer B binds ATP in an apparent “nonspecific” manner.ATP Binding, Hydrolysis, and DNA Release—To further analyze the function of the three residues that were affected by the presence of ATP in the crystal structure, we mutated each to alanine, both in full-length MutS and in ΔC800. N616A and H728A are located within or close to the nucleotide-binding site, respectively, and S668A is located further away from its own nucleotide-binding site but contributes to the opposing site in trans (see Fig. 1) (5Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The two mutations, N616A and S668A, both show an ∼4-fold reduction in ATPase activity, whereas the H728A mutation renders the protein virtually inactive (Table II). However, the effects of the three mutations on ATP binding are somewhat different; N616A and H728A both show a reduced affinity for ATPγS, whereas S668A shows an affinity slightly stronger than wild-type MutS. The effects of these mutations on ΔC800 are similar to the results obtained with the full-length product, confirming that the C-terminal deletion does not affect the conformation of the ATPase domains.Similar to the ATPase activities, the binding to mismatched DNA is affected in the three mutants. N616A and S668A show a somewhat reduced DNA binding and no longer release it in the presence of ATPγS as readily as wild-type protein. H728A has an even weaker affinity for DNA, which improves slightly in the presence of ATPγS. Finally, although the ATPase activity of wild-type MutS in the presence of mismatched DNA is stimulated 6-fold, this stimulation is reduced for N616A and S668A and completely lost in H728A. Hence, this suggests that the residues that were affected by the binding of ATP in the MutS crystal structure play a role not only in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis but also in inducing the conformational changes that signal between ATPase domains and DNA-binding domains.Oligomerization of MutS—The ATPase domain of MutS belongs to the family of ABC ATPases. For several members of this family it has been shown that the ATPase domains dimerize upon binding of ATP (36Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

Mutations in the JMD of c-Kit and Flt3 are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and acute myeloid leukemias, respectively. Additionally, autophosphorylated Tyr559 in the JMD of the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor (CSF-1R) binds to Src family kinases (SFKs). To investigate SFK function in CSF-1 signaling we established stable 32D myeloid cell lines expressing CSF-1Rs with mutated SFK binding sites (Tyr559-TFI). Whereas binding to I562S was not significantly perturbed, Y559F and Y559D exhibited markedly decreased CSF-1-dependent SFK association. All JMD mutants retained intrinsic kinase activity, but Y559F, and less so Y559D, showed dramatically reduced CSF-1-induced autophosphorylation. CSF-1-mediated wild-type (WT)-CSF-1R phosphorylation was not markedly affected by SFK inhibition, indicating that lack of SFK binding is not responsible for diminished Y559F phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, cells expressing Y559F were hyperproliferative in response to CSF-1. Hyperproliferation correlated with prolonged activation of Akt, ERK, and Stat5 in the Y559F mutant. Consistent with a defect in receptor negative regulation, c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and CSF-1R/c-Cbl co-association were almost undetectable in the Y559F mutant. Furthermore, Y559F underwent reduced multiubiquitination and delayed receptor internalization and degradation. In conclusion, we propose that Tyr559 is a switch residue that functions in kinase regulation, signal transduction and, indirectly, receptor down-regulation.

CSF-1 functions through a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R), expressed on the surface of target cells. Recently, CSF-1R knockout mice were found to have a similar, but more severe phenotype, compared with the op/op mice, indicating that the CSF-1R is the main mediator of CSF-1 signaling (7Dai X.M.

These receptors are characterized by five immunoglobulin-like regions in the extracellular ligand-binding portion, a single spanning transmembrane region, a juxtamembrane domain (JMD), a kinase domain interrupted by a kinase insert (KI), and a carboxyl-terminal domain. Upon ligand binding, CSF-1R homodimerizes and autophosphorylates on six tyrosines in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor.

These molecules further propagate the CSF-1 signal through activation of Ras/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and STAT proteins. Two additional autophosphorylation sites have been described for v-fms (18Mancini A. Niedenthal R. Joos H. Koch A. Trouliaris S. Niemann H. Tamura T.

Precisely how the signal from the CSF-1R is transduced to these downstream targets and how they transmit the signal to the nucleus is not well understood. Following ligand binding, the CSF-1R is rapidly internalized and degraded. This process begins with multiubiquitination of the CSF-1R mediated by c-Cbl (20Lee P.S. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y.G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3616-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), an E3-type ubiquitin ligase (21Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). CSF-1R presumably then migrates to clathrin-coated pits, is internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, sorted into lysosomes, and degraded, as has been shown for other RTKs (22Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). c-Cbl appears to be important for both receptor internalization and degradation; c-Cbl overexpression leads to an increase in EGFR internalization (23Levkowitz G.

Recently, we showed that SFKs are activated by CSF-1 and serve as alternate activators of the Ras/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways in cells expressing a CSF-1R mutant lacking the KI (26Lee A.W.

SFKs have been reported to activate the Ras/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and STAT pathways (26Lee A.W. States D.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, it has also been suggested that SFKs have a negative regulatory role in growth factor signaling, through reduction of Akt activity (36Baran C.P. Tridandapani S. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K.

To investigate the role of SFKs in CSF-1 signaling, Tyr559 has been mutated in previous studies to Ala or Phe. The Y559A mutant showed normal in vitro kinase activity as well as normal ligand-induced receptor internalization (38Myles G.M. Brandt C.S. Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4843-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SFK binding was not investigated. The Y559F mutant exhibited decreased SFK binding, receptor phosphorylation and activity, and Stat3 phosphorylation (32Marks D.C. Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. Novak U. Ward A.C. Kanagasundarum V. Hoffmann B.W. Hamilton J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is puzzling that mutation of the same residue to different amino acids should have such a different effect. In addition to providing binding sites for interacting proteins, the JMD of RTKs may play a role in regulation of kinase function. Duplications, deletions, and point mutations in the JMD of Flt3 and c-Kit are commonly found in acute myeloid leukemias and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, respectively, causing constitutive receptor activation (39Scheijen B. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3314-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support an autoinhibitory role of the JMD in RTKs. In vitro peptide binding studies demonstrate that unphosphorylated c-Kit JMD can inhibit its own kinase activity (40Chan P.M. Ilangumaran S. La Rose J. Chakrabartty A. Rottapel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3067-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal studies of the inactive, non-type III RTKs, Eph (41Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Cell. 2001; 106: 745-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and MuSK (42Till J.H. Becerra M. Watty A. Lu Y. Ma Y. Neubert T.A. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as well as type III RTKs, Flt3 (43Griffith J. Black J. Faerman C. Swenson L. Wynn M. Lu F. Lippke J. Saxena K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and c-Kit (44Mol C.D. Dougan D.R. Schneider T.R. Skene R.J. Kraus M.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31655-31663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) reveal that there is an intimate relationship between the JMD and the kinase domain. For example, in c-Kit, the closest relative to the CSF-1R, the JMD forms a hairpin that is partially buried in the interface between the NH2- and COOH-terminal kinase lobes. This alters the position of a helix important for catalytic function (αC), prevents the activation loop from extending into an active conformation, blocks nucleotide binding, and allows Tyr823 to bind as a pseudosubstrate. It is easy to see how phosphorylation of the JMD tyrosines (Tyr568/Tyr570) can induce a conformational change that will disrupt some of the tight interactions between the JMD and kinase domain. In support of this possibility, the active c-Kit structure shows a vastly different conformation compared with the inactive structure (45Mol C.D. Lim K.B. Sridhar V. Zou H. Chien E.Y.T. Sang B. Nowakowski J. Kassel D.B. Cronin C.N. McRee D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31461-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To more fully elucidate the role of the JMD in CSF-1R signaling, we focused on the SFK binding motif. Stable IL-3-dependent 32Dcl23 cell lines expressing JMD CSF-1R mutants were established. In agreement with previous findings (17Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 32Marks D.C. Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. Novak U. Ward A.C. Kanagasundarum V. Hoffmann B.W. Hamilton J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), mutation of Tyr559 significantly reduced SFK binding. We also found that the Y559F mutant exhibited substantially decreased CSF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting it may have a similar role as proposed for Tyr568/Tyr570 of c-Kit. Despite this decrease in receptor autophosphorylation, cells expressing Y559F displayed a CSF-1-dependent hyperproliferative phenotype. Y559F showed a marked reduction in c-Cbl binding, resulting in diminished CSF-1-induced c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistently, the Y559F mutant showed decreased CSF-1-induced multiubiquitination of Y559F and delayed receptor degradation. Consequently, Y559F and to a lesser extent Y559D, which exhibits an intermediate phenotype compared with the WT and Y559F receptors, transduced a low, but persistent activation of down-stream signaling pathways, including Akt, ERK, and Stat5. Thus, hyperproliferation occurred as a result of the disruption of the balance between positive and negative signals. In summary, our studies support the model that the JMD of the CSF-1R has a dual role: autoinhibition in the unliganded state, and upon ligand binding and autophosphorylation, provision of docking sites for interacting proteins. Antibodies and Reagents—Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD) and Sigma. Recombinant human CSF-1 was a gift of the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant mouse IL-3 was purchased from Pepro Tech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). SU6656 and MG-132 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Chloroquine and methylamine were obtained from Sigma. JMD peptides used in the competitive GST pull-down assay were synthesized by the University of Michigan Protein Structure Facility (Ann Arbor, MI). The JMD peptides, spanning residues 553–567 of the mouse CSF-1R, were synthesized with Tyr559 in the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated state. Peptides were dissolved in Me2SO. CSF-1R 422, 423, and 425 antibodies have been previously described (26Lee A.W. States D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6779-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the combination is referred to as anti-CSF-1R antibodies in the text. Anti-extracellular domain (ECD)-Fms (referred to as anti-ECD-Fms in the text) and anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) (4G10) antibodies were purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Akt, Tyr(P) (PY99), ubiquitin, c-Cbl, Stat3, Stat5, GST, and Fyn antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-specific antibodies for CSF-1R, Akt, ERK, Stat3, and Stat5 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-SHC antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA); anti-ERK and goat anti-mouse HRP antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (S. San Francisco, CA); donkey anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody was from Amersham; and NeutrAvidin-HRP was from Pierce. Cell Culture and Transfections—IL-3-dependent murine 32Dcl23 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5–10% WEHI-conditioned media as a source of IL-3. 32D cell lines expressing WT-CSF-1R have been previously described (46Lee A.W. Blood. 1999; 93: 537-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The JMD CSF-1R mutants were constructed by replacing the internal StuI fragment of the murine CSF-1R cDNA with the corresponding fragment containing point mutations, produced using a two-step PCR method (47Lee A.W. Nienhuis A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16472-16483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All PCR-amplified segments were sequenced in their entirety and on both strands. The CSF-1R mutant cDNAs were inserted into pMSCV-IRES-puro and transiently transfected into BOSC23 cells. Viral supernatants obtained after 48 h were used to transduce 32Dcl23 cells. Clones were selected using 1 μg/ml puromycin and screened by 125I-CSF-1 binding as described (26Lee A.W. States D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6779-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). JMD clones designated as (lo) expressed similar receptor levels as the WT (hi) clone, which was used as a control in all experiments except where indicated. JMD clones described as (hi) expressed higher levels (∼1.5–2-fold) of receptors compared with the WT (hi) clone. Unless otherwise indicated, JMD (lo) clones were used in all experiments. For clones of interest, RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and the sequence of the JMD verified. Protein Analysis—Except where noted, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (26Lee A.W. States D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6779-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay were loaded for each immunoblot of total cell lysate (TCL) as shown. In all cases, quantitation of receptor levels in receptor immunoprecipitations was carried out on duplicate samples subjected to the same processing. For most experiments, the anti-ECD-Fms antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the CSF-1R. Western blots of the receptor were probed sequentially with anti-ECD-Fms and then anti-CSF-1R (422/423/425) antibodies to eliminate possible differences in antibody recognition. For downstream substrate activation experiments, cells (2 × 106/ml) were starved for 3 h in a 24-well plate. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 10 nm CSF-1 for the times indicated in the figures and then transferred to ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.2 mm Na3VO4. After two washes, cells were lysed as described (26Lee A.W. States D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6779-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For CSF-1R kinase assays, lysates from starved cells were first pre-cleared by incubation with rabbit serum-bound protein A-Sepharose for 45 min. Then, lysates were incubated with anti-ECD-Fms pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose for 6 h at 4 °C with rocking, followed by extensive washing of the immune complexes. The complexes were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 200 μm ATP. The kinase assay buffer was removed and the beads were washed once with HBS (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) and immunoblotted as described in the figure legends. For CSF-1R/c-Cbl co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were either treated with methylamine or chloroquine, in combination with MG-132, for 1 h prior to CSF-1 stimulation at 37 °C, or cells were stimulated at 4 °C for 20 min. Lysis was with an equal volume of 2× TNE lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) as previously described (48Ota J. Sato K. Kimura F. Wakimoto N. Nakamura Y. Nagata N. Suzu S. Yamada M. Shimamura S. Motoyoshi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. 750 μg of cell lysate was incubated with anti-ECD-Fms or anti-c-Cbl antibodies followed by capture with protein A-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing, 2× Laemmli was added; the samples were boiled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Quantitation of immunoblot results was carried out as described previously (26Lee A.W. States D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6779-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) by scanning multiple exposures with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and quantitating band intensities with NIH Image 1.62 software. GST Pull-down Assay—GST pull-down assays were performed essentially as previously described (26Lee A.W. States D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6779-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Pre-cleared 32D cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST-Fyn-SH2 bound to GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C with rocking followed by extensive washing of complexes. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli. CSF-1R proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-ECD-Fms antibodies. Peptide competition assays were performed as described above except that, after preclearing, the lysates were incubated with Me2SO or the indicated amount of unphosphorylated or phosphorylated JMD peptide at 4 °C for 1 h before incubation with GST-Fyn-SH2. Biotinylation and Internalization Assay—After stimulation, cells were immediately placed on ice and washed multiple times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-PEO4-Biotin (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to label the remaining cell surface proteins. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by incubating cells with stop buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm glycine) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed again with stop buffer and then lysed with 1× lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. CSF-1Rs were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. Immune complexes were sequentially blotted with anti-CSF-1R antibodies, to determine receptor degradation, and with NeutrAvidin-HRP, to detect CSF-1Rs remaining on the cell surface after stimulation. Cell Proliferation Studies—Cells were washed multiple times (1× with RPMI, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 2 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution) before seeding at 7.5 × 104 cells/ml in 96-well plates in RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 nm CSF-1 or 5 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-3 were added to each well. Cells were split 1:10 every 2 days into fresh media supplemented with the appropriate growth factor and studies were carried out for 6 days. Living cells were counted every 24 h using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer. Additionally, an MTS assay (Cell Titer 96 AQueous Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, Madison, WI) was performed every day according to the manufacturer's instructions, to test for metabolically active cells. For SU6656 growth studies, cells were pretreated with SU6656 for 1 h before addition of CSF-1. MTS activity was analyzed after 48 h. CSF-1R Modeling—The JMD and kinase domain of the mouse CSF-1R were modeled on the autoinhibited FLT3 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1RJB) using SWISS-MODEL (version 36.0003) (49Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 50Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar, 51Schwede T. Kopp J.

Mutation of Tyr559 Significantly Reduces SFK Association with CSF-1R—To investigate the role of SFK in CSF-1 signaling, we performed a mutagenesis study of the SFK binding site in the JMD of the CSF-1R (Fig. 1A). Investigations of the PDGF, Eph, and MuSK receptors point to an additional, autoinhibitory role for the JMD (41Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B. Ong S.H. Tong J. Pawson T. Sicheri F.

A Tyr to Phe substitution at residue 559 is predicted to eliminate binding by the SH2 domain of SFKs but at the same time may lock the receptor in an inactive conformation, a possibility proposed for analogous mutations in the Eph receptor (55Binns K.L.

Although the LRR domains on NgR1 are necessary for binding to the myelin proteins, the exact epitope(s) involved in ligand binding is unclear.

Further, we have defined the molecular epitope of 7E11 to be DNAQLR located in the third LRR domain of rat NgR1.

Nogo is a member of the Reticulon family and occurs in three forms, NogoA, NogoB, and NogoC, that are generated from alternate splicing (2GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M.

NogoA, -B, and -C all contain a 66-amino acid extracellular domain (Nogo66) that alone can inhibit neurite outgrowth and induce growth cone collapse (2GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2000; 409: 346-444Google Scholar, 3Chen M.S. Huber A.B. van der Haar M.E. Frank M. Schnell L. Spillman A.A. Christ F. Schwab M.E.

MAG is a type I membrane protein composed of five extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (6McKerracher L. David S. Jackson D.L. Kottis V. Dunn R.J. Braun P.E.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 757-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar), whereas OMgp is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that contains 8 LRR domains (10Wang K.C. Koprivica V. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Guo Y. Neve R.L. He Z. Nature. 2002; 417: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Nogo66, MAG, and OMgp inhibit neurite outgrowth by interacting with a neuronal protein termed Nogo66 receptor or the Nogo receptor (NgR1, Refs. 8Domeniconi M. Cao Z. Spencer T. Sivasankaran R.

NgR1 is a glycoprotein that contains 8 LRR domains, a LRR cap region in the respective N and C termini, and a stalk region composed of 100 amino acid residues (11Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). All 8 LRR domains in the NgR1 are necessary for binding to Nogo, MAG, and OMgp; however, the exact epitope(s) on NgR1 that interacts with these myelin proteins is unknown (8Domeniconi M. Cao Z.

Nature. 2002; 417: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Because NgR1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, it is not a signaling molecule (12McGee A.W. Strittmatter S.M. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Lee D.H.S. Strittmatter S.M. Sah D.W.Y. Nat. Rev. Drug Dis. 2003; 2: 1-7Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75, has been identified as a co-receptor for NgR1, and transduces a signal upon interaction with the myelin ligands (14Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 15Wong S.T. Henley J.R. Kanning K.C. Huang K.H. Bothwall M. Poo M.M. Nat.

The downstream signaling pathway involves RhoA activation (17Fournier A.E. Takizawa B.T. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 23: 1416-1423Crossref Google Scholar, 18Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6263-6265Crossref Google Scholar), which in turn regulates the cytoskeletal protein assembly and mediates inhibitory effects on neurite growth (13Lee D.H.S. Strittmatter S.M. Sah D.W.Y. Nat. Rev. Drug Dis. 2003; 2: 1-7Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Filbin M.T. Nature Neurosci. 2003; 4: 1-11Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 20Yiu G. He Z. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 1-7Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A rational strategy to promote CNS axonal regeneration and hence functional recovery after CNS injury is to inhibit the interactions of Nogo, MAG, and OMgp with NgR1 (13Lee D.H.S. Strittmatter S.M. Sah D.W.Y. Nat. Rev. Drug Dis. 2003; 2: 1-7Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, molecules that modulate the interaction of an individual myelin protein with NgR1 have been evaluated for the ability to promote CNS axonal regeneration. Successful examples include the anti-NogoA antibody, IN-1 (21Schnell L. Schwab M.E. Nature. 1990; 343: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 22Schnell L. Schwab M.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1156-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and the Nogo66 antagonist peptide, NEP1–40 (23GrandPre T. Li S. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2002; 417: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), both of which reversed CNS myelin-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth, promoted axonal regeneration, and improved functional recovery in an animal model of spinal cord injury (21Schnell L. Schwab M.E. Nature. 1990; 343: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 22Schnell L. Schwab M.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1156-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24Li S. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4219-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these reagents only target a single myelin protein, Nogo, which may not be sufficient to facilitate maximal CNS axonal regeneration because other inhibitors such as MAG and OMgp are present in the CNS myelin environment. Recently, a soluble fragment of NgR1 containing the ligand-binding domain (sNgR310) was shown to block both Nogo66 and MAG-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth (9Liu B.P. Fournier A. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Science. 2002; 297: 1190-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 25Fournier A.E. Gould G.C. Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When an Ig-fusion protein containing this soluble NgR fragment (sNgR310-Fc) was administered intrathecally to rats with spinal cord injury, enhanced axonal growth in the cortical spinal and raphespinal tracts, accompanied by improved functional recovery were observed. 2S.

Strittmatter, unpublished data. sNgR310-Fc treatment led to a more significant increase in sprouting complexity and in the number of cortical spinal tract fiber sprouts than NEP1–40, which may be attributed to its ability to neutralize the interaction of all three myelin ligands with NgR1. 2S. Li, J. Kim, B. P. Liu, M. Li, B. Ji, L. Walus, W. Li, A. Jirik, S. Rabacchi, E. Choi, D. Worley, D. W. Y. Sah, B. Pepinsky, D. Lee, J. Relton, and S. M. Strittmatter, unpublished data. To better understand the functional properties of NgR1, we have generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb). This antibody, 7E11, blocks the interactions of Nogo, MAG, and OMgp with NgR1 and reverses the inhibitory effects of CNS myelin on neurite outgrowth in primary neurons and is the first reported neutralizing anti-NgR1 antibody. Through epitope mapping for this antibody, we have defined a key epitope on NgR1 that may be critical for ligand binding. 7E11 is a valuable reagent for assessing the role of NgR1 in CNS axonal regeneration. Our data suggest that neutralizing anti-NgR1 antibodies may be a useful therapeutic for treating CNS injuries, such as spinal cord injury, traumatic head injury, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. Soluble NgR310-Fc (sNgR310-Fc) and sNgR344-Fc—The generation of sNgR310-Fc was described by Li et al.2 Soluble NgR344-Fc (sNgR344-Fc) was similarly generated, except that the cDNA encoding amino acid residues 27–344 of rat NgR1 was fused in-frame to the rat IgG1 hinge and Fc was contained in the expression plasmid vector PV90 (27Brezinsky S.C.G. Chiang G.G. Szilvasi A. Mohan S. Shapiro R.I. MacLean A. Sisk W. Thill G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 277: 139-153Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After sequence verification, the plasmid was transfected into CHO-DG44 cells. Secreted sNgR344-Fc in the conditioned medium was purified on Protein A-Sepharose. The purity of the protein obtained was ∼95% as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. N-terminal sequence analysis verified that the secreted sNgR344Fc protein began with Cys27. Recombinant Proteins—The generation of the AP-Nogo66 cDNA construct was described by Fournier et al. (17Fournier A.E. Takizawa B.T. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 23: 1416-1423Crossref Google Scholar). AP-Nogo66 was expressed in CHO-DG44 cells, and purified by sequential chromatography steps on TMAE-fractogel and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. AP-OMgp (10Wang K.C. Koprivica V. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Guo Y. Neve R.L. He Z. Nature. 2002; 417: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Sha Mi of Biogen Idec. MAG-Fc was obtained fromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rat IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory (West Grove, PA). CNS Myelin—White matter from bovine brains (Pel-Freeze Biologicals, Inc.) was isolated and homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose including protease inhibitors (Roche). The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation on a sucrose density gradient containing 0–0.85 m sucrose at 32,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The white interface was collected and osmotically shocked twice with cold water. The pellet was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose and again subjected to the sucrose gradient centrifugation and water shock treatment. The final pellet was extracted for 1 h with 1% octyl glucoside and protease inhibitors, centrifuged at 32,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed against PBS, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C until use. Only freshly thawed myelin was used in the experiments. NgR cDNA—Mouse NgR1, human NgR1, and human NgR3 cDNAs have been described previously (28Barton W.A. Liu B.P. Tzvetkova D. Jeffery P.D.

Kaupmann K. Mayer H. Sommer B. Mir A.K. Frentzel S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and provided by Dr. Stephen M. Strittmatter (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Human NgR2 cDNA (28Barton W.A. Liu B.P. Tzvetkova D. Jeffery P.D. Fournier A.E. Sah D. Cate R. Strittmatter S.M. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Zhaohui Shao of Biogen Idec. Antibody Generation—The high sequence homology between rat and mouse NgR1 (∼88% at the amino acid level) potentially increases the difficulty for generating anti-NgR1 antibodies in mice using rat NgR1 protein as the antigen. NgR1 sequence analysis using the Vector NTi software revealed several regions of high antigenicity that could serve as immunogens for antibody generation. To maintain the specificity of the antibody, only sequences that shared <25% identity with any other peptide sequences as revealed by BLAST searches against the sequence databases were considered as antigens. Even though there may be sequences of higher or similar antigenicities, such sequences were not selected as antigen because of their homologies with other proteins. One of the peptides with unique specificity and corresponding to amino acid residues 110–125 on NgR1, LDLSDNAQLRVVDPTT, was chosen. The peptide was synthesized (Invitrogen), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde and used to immunize 8-week-old female RBF mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME). Immunization and subsequent fusion to the FL653 myeloma cell line were performed according to standard procedures (30Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual: Portable Protocol No. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Hybridomas were screened by ELISA on plates coated with rat sNgR310-Fc or control rat Ig and FACS analysis using COS-7 cells that express rat NgR1. Parental untransfected COS-7 cells were used as a specificity control in the FACS analysis (see below). Positive hybridomas were subcloned by limiting dilution, and from these clones, a clone named 7E11 was identified for subsequent screening. Hybridomas were maintained in 1.1× supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with AAT (Sigma), hybridoma cloning factor (IGEN, Gaithersburg, MD), and low immunoglobulin fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Logan, UT). The antibody was purified by Protein A-Sepharose chromatography and the purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (>90% pure). Antibody isotyping showed that 7E11 is an IgG1 molecule. FACS Analysis—COS-7 cells expressing rat NgR1 or parental COS-7 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 7E11 at various concentrations in PBS containing 4% normal goat serum, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. Cells were washed and incubated with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated affinity purified F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG Fc(γ) specific secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) in PBS. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum, and subjected to FACS analysis. Protein-based Binding Assays—sNgR344-Fc (0.5 μg/50 μl/well) in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, was immobilized in 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) at 37 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% ovalbumin at 25 °C for 3 h. The protein ligands, 30 nm alkaline phosphatase (AP)-Nogo66, 30 nm AP-OMgp, or 33 nm rat MAG-human Fc (R & D Systems) was added to wells containing serial dilutions of 7E11 or sNgR310-Fc in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% ovalbumin, and incubated at 25 °C for 18 h. Plates were washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% ovalbumin and bound AP-Nogo66 or AP-OMgp were detected by measuring AP activity using p-nitrophenyl phosphate under standard conditions (Pierce). Bound MAG-human Fc was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) and developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine under standard conditions (Pierce). Neurite Outgrowth Assay—Labtek culture slides (4 wells) were coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine in PBS (Sigma). CNS myelin prepared from bovine white matter was confirmed to contain OMgp, MAG, and Nogo66 by Western analysis as described below. Different concentrations of CNS myelin in PBS, 6, 9, and 15 ng/mm2, were spotted as 3 μl drops. Each well contained 3 drops of CNS myelin and 1 drop of PBS control. Fluorescent microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were added to the myelin/PBS to facilitate demarcation of the drops (2GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2000; 409: 346-444Google Scholar). Labtek slides were then rinsed and coated with 10 μg/ml laminin (Invitrogen). DRGs from post-natal day 3 (or day 4) Sprague-Dawley rats were dissociated with 1 mg/ml collagenase type 1 (Worthington Bioscience), triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes, and preplated for 1 h to enrich for neurons. Cells were plated at 23,000 cells/well in Ham's F-12 culture medium containing 5% heat inactivated donor horse serum (JRH Bioscience, Logan, UT), 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience), and 50 ng/ml murine nerve growth factor (JRH Bioscience), and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 6 h. Test reagents were added immediately after plating. At the end of the experiment, cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 20% sucrose, blocked with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and 0.1% Triton-X-100, and stained for the neuronal marker β-III tubulin using an anti-β-III-tubulin antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ) diluted at 1:500 in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. A secondary goat anti-mouse IgG Fc (γ) specific Alexa-594 antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used at a dilution of 1:300 (1 μg/ml) in PBS. Slides were washed with PBS and sealed with a coverslip with Gelmount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Digital images (5×, 1 image/drop, 6 images/data point) were acquired and the images were analyzed using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Co., West Chester, PA) for quantification of neurites. Total neurite outgrowth per field was obtained and normalized to the number of neurons per field. Epitope Mapping for 7E11—The LDLSDNAQLRVVDPTT peptide was suspended in distilled water at 500 μg/ml. For each digestion, 40 μg of the peptide was treated with either 8 μl of immobilized trypsin on glass beads (Sigma) or 0.2 μg of sequencing grade endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science). All digestions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the immobilized trypsin was removed by centrifugation. The resulting cleavage products were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h with 400 μg of 7E11 Fab. The 7E11 Fab-peptide complex was desalted on a G-25 column to separate the complex from the unbound peptide fragments. The 7E11 Fab-peptide complex was subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C4 column that was eluted with a 0–70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to separate the 7E11 Fab from the bound peptide. The fragments associated with the 7E11 Fab were collected and subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The peptide sequences were determined by liquid chromatography-MS/MS using CID fragmentation analysis. sNgR310 was also digested with trypsin and analyzed in a similar way. Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells expressing rat, mouse, or human NgR1, or human NgR2 or NgR3 were either lysed directly in 100 mm Tris·HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, pH 6.8, or treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, 1U/106 cells, Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cell lysates and the supernatant fractions of PI-PLC treatments were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gradient gel under reducing conditions. Protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 2% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST), the polyvinylidene difluoride blots were incubated with 7E11 (5 μg/ml) in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk for 3 h. Blots were washed with TBST three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000, Bio-Rad). The blots were again washed three times with TBST and developed using the Odyssey system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NK). CNS myelin (20 μg) were run on SDS-PAGE gels (4–20% Novex Tris glycine gels, Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose filter. Blots were reversibly stained and visualized with Memcode Blue (Pierce) followed by blocking with a 10% nonfat dry milk solution in TBST at 25 °C for 3.5 h. Blots were then incubated with 5 μg/ml of the following antibodies at 25 °C for 2 h: goat monoclonal anti-MAG antibody (R & D System), rabbit polyclonal anti-NogoA antibody (obtained from Dr. Stephen M. Strittmatter) (31Wang X. Chun S.J. Treloar H. Vartanian T. Greer C.A. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5505-5515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal anti-OMgp antibody (obtained from Dr. Sha Mi, Biogen Idec). Blots were washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100,000, Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratory) and developed using a Femto Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). mAb 7E11 Recognizes Rat and Human NgR1—7E11 mAb was generated using a synthetic peptide derived from amino acid residues 110–125 in the rat NgR1 sequence (Fig. 1A). These residues are located in the LRR3 domain on NgR1. 7E11 bound to this synthetic peptide and sNgR344-Fc immobilized on Maxisorp plates with EC50 values of ∼0.55 and 0.75 nm, respectively (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, 7E11 recognized rat NgR1 expressed on COS-7 cells by FACS (Fig. 1C). Western blot analyses using COS-7 cells expressing rat, mouse, and human NgR, respectively, showed that 7E11 recognized both rat and human NgR1, either in the total cell lysate fraction (Fig. 2A) or the supernatant fraction after PI-PLC treatment (Fig. 2B). 7E11 did not recognize mouse NgR1, human NgR2, or human NgR3 (Fig. 2, A and B). In the rat NgR1 and human NgR1 cell lysate fractions, two stained bands were observed that may represent alternate glycosylation forms of NgR1. A 15-kDa band was specifically found in the human NgR1-PI-PLC fraction, which may be generated by contaminating proteases during the PI-PLC treatment (Fig. 2B). Western blot analyses indicate that 7E11 is a sensitive and highly specific anti-NgR1 antibody.Fig. 2Analysis of 7E11 specificity by Western blotting. COS-7 cells expressing rat, human, or mouse NgR1, human NgR2, or human NgR3, or untransfected control cells were either directly lysed (A) or PI-PLC treated at 37 °C for 1 h (B) and subjected to Western blot analysis using 7E11.

For these studies, ELISA plates were coated with sNgR344-Fc or control rat Ig, and the binding of MAG-Fc, AP-OMgp, and AP-Nogo66 in the presence or absence of 7E11 was studied in detail. 7E11 inhibited the binding of all three myelin proteins, MAG-Fc, AP-OMgp, and AP-Nogo66, to immobilized sNgR344-Fc in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 14, 4.5, and 120 nm, respectively (Fig. 3, A–C). 7E11 had no effect on the binding of MAG, OMgp, and Nogo66 to the control rat Ig protein. The efficacy of sNgR310-Fc protein in promoting CNS axonal regeneration and behavioral motor function recovery in an animal model of spinal cord injury has been demonstrated previously.2 We next compared the potency of 7E11 relative to the sNgR310-Fc in the same series of binding studies with MAG-Fc, AP-OMgp, and AP-Nogo66 and obtained the respective IC50 values of 734, 60, and 8600 nm. In these assay systems, 7E11 is a more potent inhibitor than sNgR310-Fc with at least 15-fold differences in the relative IC50 values for each myelin inhibitor (Table I). Thus, 7E11 represents the first specific anti-NgR1 antibody that inhibits NgR1 binding to Nogo, MAG, and OMgp.Table IComparison of IC50 (nM) values of 7E11 and sNgR310-Fc in inhibiting MAG-Fc, AP-OMgp, and AP-Nogo binding to sNgR344-FcMAG-FcAP-OMgpAP-Nogo7E11144.5120sNgR310-Fc734608600 Open table in a new tab 7E11 Promotes DRG Neurite Outgrowth on CNS Myelin— The functional ability of 7E11 to prevent CNS myelin-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons was next evaluated. In the absence of CNS myelin, DRG neurons sent out long neurites after 6 h in culture (Fig. 4A). In contrast, concentration-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth was observed when the neurons were cultured on a dried-down CNS myelin substrate. Half-maximal inhibition was observed with ∼9 ng/mm2 CNS myelin"

Upon cellular activation, there is translocation of intracellular pools of CD11b/CD18 to the plasma membrane in concert with enhanced cellular adhesion. Although much is known about the function of CD11b/CD18, how this protein is transported within the cell is less well defined. Here we report that CD11b/CD18 specifically binds to BAP31, a member of a novel class of sorting proteins regulating cellular anterograde transport. Through experiments aimed at identifying CD11b/CD18-binding proteins, we produced a monoclonal antibody termed E1B2 that recognizes a 28-kDa membrane protein that co-precipitates with CD11b/CD18. Microsequence analysis of the E1B2 antigen revealed that it is BAP31. Co-association of CD11b/CD18 and BAP31 was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation and protein binding assays. Additional experiments revealed that the binding of BAP31 to CD11b/CD18 was not dependent on divalent cations nor mediated by the I-domain of CD11b. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion chimeras, we determined that binding of CD11b/CD18 to BAP31 is mediated through interactions with the cytoplasmic tail of BAP31. Immunolocalization studies revealed colocalization of BAP31 and CD11b/CD18 within neutrophil secondary granules. Subcellular fractionation studies in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) revealed similar patterns of redistribution of BAP31 and CD11b/CD18 from fractions enriched in secondary granules to the plasma membrane following stimulation with formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP). Given the known sorting properties of BAP31, these findings suggest that BAP31 may play a role in regulating intracellular trafficking of CD11b/CD18 in neutrophils.

The diversity of ligands that bind to CD11b provides a molecular basis for its important role in many different biological events such as leukocyte adhesion/migration, phagocytosis, and pathogen invasion. The identification and characterization of CD11b/CD18-binding proteins have been central in understanding the role of CD11b/CD18 during different physiological events. In neutrophils, CD11b/CD18 is mainly present in secondary granules under resting conditions. Upon cellular activation, CD11b/CD18 is translocated from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane. This increased surface expression in concert with activation-induced avidity changes serves as a basis for enhanced cellular adhesion. Although the localization of CD11b/CD18 within neutrophils and its translocation following cell activation are well documented (23Calafat J. Kuijpers T.W. Janssen H. Borregaard N. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. Blood. 1993; 81: 3122-3129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Repo H. Rochon Y.P. Schwartz B.R. Sharar S.R. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J.

To identify new cellular proteins that bind to CD11b/CD18, we employed an antibody-based approach. We produced a mAb termed E1B2 that binds to a 28-kDa membrane protein that physically associates with CD11b/CD18. The antigen represented by E1B2 was identified as BAP31, a member of a family of proteins that associate with membrane IgD in B cells (26Adachi T. Schamel W.W. Kim K.M. Watanabe T. Becker B.

In this report, we characterize the interaction of BAP31 with CD11b/CD18 and its subcellular localization in PMN. The potential role of BAP31 in regulating intracellular trafficking of CD11b/CD18 in PMN is also discussed. Cells—Human colonic epithelial T84 cells were grown and passaged as described previously (30Madara J.L. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on plastic culture dishes or permeable collagen-coated polycarbonate supports (31Parkos C.A.

HL-60 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum. For the analysis of changes in antigen expression, HL-60 cells were cultured for 7 days in RPMI 1640 medium with or without 1.25% Me2SO (32Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc.

The polyclonal antibody against human CD11b (R7928A) and the antibody against human CD18 (R7928E) were prepared in rabbits using the peptide of the C terminus of CD11b and CD18, respectively, as described previously (40Jesaitis A.J. Buescher E.S. Harrison D. Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Livesey S. Linner J. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiactin antibody and the secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, and 6- and 12-nm gold particles were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Labs (West Grove, PA). Monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing mice with T84 cell membrane fractions as described previously (31Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Antibodies were screened for binding to CD11b/CD18-coated microtiter wells that had been preincubated with detergent lysates of T84 cell membranes. Specifically, CD11b/CD18 (∼100 μg/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethylamine, 100 mm Tris, 1% N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, pH 7.4) was diluted 20-fold with HBSS and added to Linbro 96-well microtiter plates (ICN Biomedical, Aurora, OH) (50 μl/well) followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was then blocked by addition of 1% BSA in HBSS for 30 min. T84 cell membranes, prepared as described previously (41Kaoutzani P. Parkos C.A. Delp-Archer C. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1327-C1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were solubilized in HBSS containing 1% Triton X-100 (4 °C). The lysate was diluted with HBSS (final concentration of detergent, <0.25%) and added to CD11b/CD18-coated plates for incubation (37 °C, 1 h). Microtiter wells were then washed extensively with HBSS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by incubation with individual hybridoma supernatant (50 μl/well) for 1 h at room temperature (R.T.). Wells were then washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG followed by color development. BSA-coated plates were used as controls. Immunofluorescence—For double staining human PMN and HL-60 cells with anti-BAP31 and anti-CD11b antibodies, cells were applied to glass slides and allowed to adhere and spread for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (15 min, R.T.) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (20 min, R.T.). After blocking non-specific protein with 5% normal goat serum in HBSS for 30 min, cells were then incubated with anti-BAP31 mAb CC-1 (rat IgG) and anti-CD11b mAb LM2/1 (mouse IgG) (1 h, R.T.) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies, accordingly. Epithelial cell monolayers were fixed and permeabilized in cold methanol (20 min, –20 °C). After blocking monolayers were incubated with primary antibodies including anti-E-cadherin and anti-BAP31 antibodies (CC-1 or CC-4) for 1 h at R.T. After washing, monolayers were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (30 min, R.T.). Washed cell monolayers were then mounted in ProLong antifade embedding solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Monolayers or slides were visualized on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) (42Hopkins A.M. Walsh S.V. Verkade P. Boquet P. Nusrat A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 725-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Images shown are representative of at least three experiments, with multiple images taken/slide. As a control for background labeling, control monolayers were incubated with comparable concentrations of normal mouse IgG and secondary antibody. Immunoelectron Microscopy—800 μl of a suspension of PMN (5 × 107/ml) were layered on the top of 200 μl of 8% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixative in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and pelleted for 3 min at 3000 rpm. After removal of the supernatant, 200 μl of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixative were added and fixed for 4 h at R.T. For cryoprotection, the cell pellet was infiltrated in 2.3 m sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.15 m glycine followed by mounting on an aluminum pin and freezing in liquid N2. Sectioning and labeling of ultrathin frozen sections were performed as described previously (43Zimmer K.P. Buning J. Weber P. Kaiserlian D. Strobel S. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 128-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Frozen sections (50 nm) were prepared with an ultracryomicrotome (Leica EM) at –110 °C and placed onto a formvar/carbon-coated copper grid. After blocking with 10% fetal calf serum, sections were incubated with respective primary antibody for 45 min, washed, and incubated for 45 min with the appropriate gold-conjugated secondary antibody. To prevent cross-reactivity, double labelings were performed with gold-conjugated antibodies from different species. The grids were contrasted and embedded in 2% methylcellulose solution (1 ml of methylcellulose contained 0.1 ml of 3% uranylacetate) and were examined with an electron microscope (Philips 201, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cross-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using mAb E1B2 and anti-CD11b antibody LM2/1. Lysates of detergent-solubilized cells were precleared with mouse IgG-Sepharose followed by incubation with mAb E1B2- and LM2/1-conjugated Sepharose 4B, respectively. After six washes, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min followed by centrifugation and collection of bead-free supernatants. Eluted samples of E1B2-Sepharose and LM2/1-Sepharose were then analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Western blots probed with a polyclonal anti-CD11b antibody R7928A (for E1B2 antibody immunoprecipitation) and anti-BAP31 antibody (for CD11b antibody immunoprecipitation), respectively. As a control, immunoprecipitated products were probed with anti-CD47 mAb PF3.1 (44Liu Y. Buhring H.J. Zen K. Burst S.L. Schnell F.J. Williams I.R. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10028-10036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in PMN were also performed by using mAb E1B2 with mAb TS1/22, mAb 4G1, and mAb 13, respectively. The products immunoprecipitated by mAb TS1/22 or 4G1 were probed with anti-CD18 antibody R7928E. Protein Purification and Microsequencing—The antigen defined by E1B2 IgG was immunopurified from large scale cultures of T84 cells (∼1010 cells). Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. The lysate was sequentially subjected to low speed (2,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and high speed (180,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) centrifugation followed by passage through a 0.2-μm filter. The extract was then pumped at a flow rate of 20 ml/h sequentially through a column of mouse IgG-Sepharose (4 ml, 2 mg of IgG/ml of beads) followed in tandem by a column of E1B2-Sepharose (6 ml, 2 mg of IgG/ml of beads). The E1B2 column was then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline consisting of 0.1% Triton X-100 and eluted with high pH buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2,2mm CaCl2,50mm triethylamine, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 10.5). Fractions of 2 ml were collected and neutralized with 0.2 ml of 2.0 m Tris (pH 7.0) and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For protein microsequencing, the peak fraction of immunopurified protein was concentrated (YM10, Amicon Inc.) and subsequently was denatured, reduced, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel followed by electrophoretic transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA). The transferred protein was visualized by stain with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce, catalog no. 24590) followed by excision of the band and submission to the Emory Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA) for N terminus amino acid sequencing. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins of the Extracellular Domain of bap31—GST fusion proteins of the BAP31 intravesicular domain (bapN, residues 68–102) and the BAP31 cytoplasmic domain (bapC, residues 124–246) were generated, respectively. For bapN, the forward primer was 5′-GGATCCCGCGAAATTCGGAAGTATGAT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CTCGAGATTCCTCTGGGCACGGAAAAG-3′. For bapC, the forward primer was 5′-GGATCCTCGCAGCAGGCCACGCTG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CTCGAGCTCTTCCTTCTTGTCCATGGG-3′. The primers included BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). Amplified products were obtained using the human carcinoma library (Clontech, BD Biosciences) as template and by cycling 30 times: 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. After digestion, cDNA products of bapN and bapC were inserted downstream of the GST moiety in the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The expressed GST-BAP31 extracellular domain was purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione, and the purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Binding Assays—Purified E1B2 antigen (10 μg/ml), GST-bapN (10 μg/ml), GST-bapC (10 μg/ml), and FBG (10 μg/ml) were first immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates as described before. After blocking with 2% BSA in HBSS, purified CD11b/CD18 (5 μg/ml in HBSS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) was added to plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with HBSS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, bound CD11b/CD18 was verified using anti-CD11b mAb LM2/1 followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and color development. For inhibition experiments, CD11b/CD18 was first immobilized in microtiter wells. After blocking, purified BAP31 was added to wells in the absence or presence of inhibitors. Bound BAP31 was detected by anti-BAP31 mAb CC-1 followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and optical density measurement. In experiments with EDTA treatment, HBSS- was used instead of HBSS. Subcellular Fractionation of PMN—Freshly isolated, unstimulated PMN or 10-7m fMLP-stimulated (37 °C, 30 min) PMN (2 × 108/condition) were resuspended in 5 ml of nitrogen cavitation buffer followed by nitrogen cavitation (15 min, 400 psi, 4 °C). The lysate was centrifuged (1000 × g), and the supernatant was subjected to isopycnic sucrose density gradient fractionation on linear 20–55% sucrose gradients in a Beckman SW-28 swinging bucket rotor (100,000 × g; 3 h, 4 °C) as described previously (45Parkos C.A. Cochrane C.G. Schmitt M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6541-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose gradients were then collected in 1.5-ml fractions and analyzed for sucrose density, protein, plasma membrane (alkaline phosphatase), primary granules (myeloperoxidase (MPO)), and specific (secondary) granules (lactoferrin) (45Parkos C.A. Cochrane C.G. Schmitt M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6541-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To better define the distribution of BAP31 and CD11b/CD18 in the different granule populations within PMN, we employed three-layer Percoll gradient subcellular fractionation (Percoll densities of 1.050, 1.090, and 1.120 g/ml) to separate specific (secondary) granules from gelatinase (tertiary) granules exactly as described previously (46Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Lactoferrin and gelatinase were used as marker proteins for secondary granules and tertiary granules, respectively (47Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Statistics—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. and were compared by Student's t test. E1B2 mAb Recognizes a Cell Membrane Protein That Specifically Binds to CD11b/CD18 —By screening mAbs against the binding complex of CD11b/CD18 and all T84 cell membrane proteins, we identified a mAb termed E1B2. The hybridoma supernatant from E1B2 clone strongly bound to microtiter wells that were preincubated with CD11b/CD18 and lysates of T84 cell membrane fractions. In contrast, there was no binding when E1B2 was incubated with microtiter wells that were preincubated with BSA and T84 cell membrane lysate or CD11b/CD18 alone. As shown in Fig. 1, immunofluorescence labeling indicates that the E1B2 antigen is strongly expressed in both T84 cells (A) and human PMN (B). In T84 cells, the E1B2 antigen mainly localized to basolateral aspects of cell membranes and in submembranous vesicular organelles. In labeled suspensions of PMN, mAb E1B2 is visualized in granular cytoplasmic structures. Without cell permeabilization, there was no apparent staining with mAb E1B2 in both T84 cells and PMN (data not shown), suggesting that the epitope of mAb E1B2 is not accessible to extracellular labeling. In Fig. 1C, Western blot analysis indicated that E1B2 antigen represents a ∼28-kDa protein in both human PMN and T84 cells. The binding of CD11b/CD18 to the E1B2 antigen was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Cross-immunoprecipitations of E1B2 antigen and CD11b/CD18 from detergent lysates of T84 cells mixed with purified CD11b/CD18 were then probed with mAb E1B2 or anti-CD11b polyclonal antibody (R7928A), respectively (Fig. 2A). In parallel, because the antigen is expressed in PMN, we performed similar cross-immunoprecipitation experiments using Triton X-100 lysates of human PMN (Fig. 2B). Western blot results from T84 cell lysates mixed with purified CD11b/CD18 and human PMN lysates alone both indicated that the E1B2 antigen could be pulled down by anti-CD11b antibody and that integrin CD11b/CD18 could be pulled down by E1B2 IgG, respectively. As a control, CD47, an Ig superfamily membrane protein expressed in both epithelial cells and neutrophils, was not detected in either immunoprecipitated product by anti-CD47 mAb PF3.1 (33Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting the association of E1B2 antigen with CD11b/CD18 is specific. Experiments were also performed to examine whether the E1B2 antigen associates with other integrins in PMN. In these experiments, a PMN lysate was first immunoprecipitated with mAb TS1/22 (for CD11a), mAb 4G1 (for CD11c), or mAb 13 (for β1). The immunoprecipitates were then probed with mAb E1B2. As shown in Fig. 2C, no E1B2 antigen was detectable in immunoprecipitates of CD11a/CD18, CD11c/CD18, or β1 integrin. The Antigen for mAb E1B2 Is BAP31—The antigen defined by mAb E1B2 was immunopurified from large scale cultures of T84 cells using an affinity E1B2-Sepharose column. The purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N terminus amino acid sequencing. We obtained the N-terminal sequence, SLQWTAVATFLY, which is identical t"
https://openalex.org/W2018536350,"A chronic imbalance in DNA precursors, caused by one-carbon metabolism impairment, can result in a deficiency of DNA repair and increased DNA damage. Although indirect evidence suggests that DNA damage plays a role in neuronal apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, very little is known about the role of base excision repair of misincorporated uracil in neuronal survival. To test the hypothesis that repair of DNA damage associated with uracil misincorporation is critical for neuronal survival, we employed an antisense (AS) oligonucleotide directed against uracil-DNA glycosylase encoded by the UNG gene to deplete UNG in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. AS, but not a scrambled control oligonucleotide, induced apoptosis, which was associated with DNA damage analyzed by comet assay and up-regulation of p53. UNG mRNA and protein levels were decreased within 30 min and were undetectable within 6-9 h of exposure to the UNG AS oligonucleotide. Whereas UNG expression is significantly higher in proliferating as compared with nonproliferating cells, such as neurons, the levels of UNG mRNA were increased in brains of cystathionine β-synthase knockout mice, a model for hyperhomocysteinemia, suggesting that one-carbon metabolism impairment and uracil misincorporation can induce the up-regulation of UNG expression.

It is well established that damage to DNA can lead to mutations, chromosomal rearrangement, oncogenic transformation, and cell death (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Genomic stability in the brain is of particular interest because terminally differentiated neurons cannot divide and must stay active for the lifetime of the animal. In addition, neurons have a high level of metabolic activity and accordingly produce high amounts of reactive oxygen species (2Kandel E.R. Principles of Neural Science. Elsevier, New York1989: 19-32Google Scholar). The importance of DNA repair to the nervous system is illustrated by the neurological abnormalities observed in patients with hereditary diseases associated with defects in DNA repair, such as xeroderma pigmentosum and ataxia telangiectasia (3Rolig R.L. McKinnon P.J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recently, DNA-damaging agents have been shown to activate death programs in terminally differentiated postmitotic neurons (4Park D.S. Morris E.J. Stefanis L. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, neuroblastoma cells become extremely UV-sensitive after terminal differentiation (5McCombe P. Lavin M. Kidson C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1976; 29: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and neurons are more vulnerable than astrocytes to DNA-damaging conditions such as ionizing radiation (6Gobbel G.T Bellinzona M. Vogt A.R. Gupta N. Fike J.R. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and camptothecin (7Morris E.J. Geller H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), possibly because functionally mature neurons are generally deficient in the repair of their DNA (8Hanawalt P.C. Gee P. Ho L. Hsu R.K. Kane C.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and therefore more sensitive to DNA damage. A number of terminally differentiated cell systems, including neurons, have been demonstrated to have attenuated DNA repair at the global genome level (9Nouspikel T. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Since neurons have an elevated rate of metabolism, particularly oxidative metabolism, which may result in accumulation of numerous lesions in the genome and compromise transcription (10Brooks P.J. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it would be logical to suggest that a mechanism exists to maintain the integrity of those genes needed for viable cell function. Primary neurons can repair strand breaks, but the process is slower than in astrocytes, and neurons are more prone to apoptosis (6Gobbel G.T Bellinzona M. Vogt A.R. Gupta N. Fike J.R. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon terminal differentiation of neurons, there is a sharp decrease in global genomic repair. However, repair of active genes has been found to be maintained or even enhanced by differentiation (11Ho L. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells have been shown to repair transcribed genes using the specialized repair pathway termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR), 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled repair; Z, N-benzyloxycarbonyl; BER, base excision repair; OGG1, oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1; AS, antisense oligonucleotide; S, scrambled oligonucleotide; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; 3AB, 3-aminobenzamide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcriptase. which targets repair systems to transcribed genes (9Nouspikel T. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of this type of DNA repair are not yet fully understood. Several DNA repair systems, including base excision repair (BER) may be involved in TCR (12Le Page F. Randrianarison V. Marot D. Cabannes J. Perricaudet M. Feunteun J. Sarasin A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5548-5552PubMed Google Scholar). Among the factors that promote genetic instability and carcinogenesis, the impairment of homocysteine/folate (one-carbon metabolism) is considered to be an important risk factor associated with an unbalanced diet or genetic defects. A growing body of evidence suggests that the disturbance of this metabolism is also involved in neuronal abnormalities. The disturbance of one-carbon metabolism is thought to cause a chronic DNA precursor imbalance by blocking synthesis of purines and thymidine (13Scott J.M. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1999; 58: 441-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fenech M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 475: 51-67Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Ballestar E. Esteller M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thymidylate synthase converts dUMP to TMP. However, when this reaction is blocked, it depresses thymidylate synthesis and results in the accumulation of excess dUTP and in increased dUMP misincorporation into DNA during replication or repair. Hydrolytic deamination of cytosine residues in DNA also generates aberrant uracil (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). If unrepaired, the resulting premutagenic U:G or U:A mispairings lead to transition mutations. To protect the cell from these consequences, all organisms studied to date have uracil-DNA glycosylase activity, responsible for the excision of uracil residues and initiation of the BER pathway (16Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The BER pathway repairs lesions involving modifications to the DNA bases. The specificity of BER is provided by DNA glycosylases with precise substrate specificities. The apyrimidinic site generated as a result of uracil removal is thereafter repaired by sequential actions of an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, a phosphodiesterase, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase (17Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). A uracil-DNA glycosylase called UNG that is encoded by the UNG gene is the major enzyme that has been shown to remove uracil from DNA (18Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Slupphaug G. Olsen L.C. Helland D. Aasland R. Kokran H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5131-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although several other enzymes with uracil-DNA glycosylase activity have been described (20Storb U. Stavnezer J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R725-R727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although indirect evidence suggests that DNA damage and repair mechanisms play critical roles in neuronal survival (3Rolig R.L. McKinnon P.J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the involved mechanisms are poorly understood. Very little is known about the role of BER in general and the uracil-BER in particular in neuronal survival. Whereas genetic instability, as a consequence of one-carbon metabolism impairment is thought to be linked with proliferating cells and carcinogenesis, the mechanism of neuronal cell death caused by this disturbance remains to be clarified. In the present study, we demonstrate that UNG is essential for the survival of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons and that depletion of UNG results in a DNA damage response that triggers p53-dependent apoptosis. In addition, we show that UNG expression is increased in the brains of cystathionine β-synthase knockout mice, a well known mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia (21Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) associated with one-carbon metabolism disturbance, suggesting that one-carbon metabolism impairment and uracil misincorporation can induce a compensatory up-regulation of UNG expression in the brain (22Aprelikova O.N. Tomilin N.V. FEBS Lett. 1982; 137: 193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Haug T. Skorpen F. Aas P.A. Malm V. Skjelbred C. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Synthesis—18-Mer oligonucleotides were used in this study. The antisense (AS) sequence 5′-ACA AGG TGT TTA CCC GCA-3′ is complementary to bases 484-501 of human UNG mRNA (GenBank™ accession number X79093). Scrambled (S) oligonucleotide 5′-CAC ACT GCG TGT GTA AAC-3′ with bases identical to that of the antisense, but with a scrambled sequence, was used as a control. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Cell Cultures, Experimental Treatments, and Assessment of Cell Survival—Primary hippocampal cell cultures were established from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats or from embryonic day 16 p53+/- (heterozygous) female mice. +/+ or -/- p53 neurons were obtained from mouse embryos resulting from heterozygous matings (C57BL/6 background, provided by Jackson laboratories). Genotyping was performed on each individual embryo by PCR. The primers used were as follows: p53EX6 (CCCGAGTATCTGGAAGACAG) and p53EX7 (ATAGGTCGGCGGTTCAT) to detect the wild-type allele and p53NEO3 (AGAGCAGCCGATTGTCTGTTGT) and p53NEO4 (GCCCGGCATTCTGCACGCTT) to detect the targeted allele mated with heterozygous p53 males (24Dietrich P. Rideout H.J. Wang Q. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 24: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were plated according to procedures described previously (25Mattson M.P. Murrain M. Guthrie Z.P.B. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociated by mild trypsination and trituration, cells were seeded onto plastic dishes precoated with polyethyleneimine at a density of 100 neurons/mm2 in neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement, 1 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine; and 0.001% gentamycin sulfate. All experiments were performed with 7-9-day-old cultures, at which time the cultures contain 90-95% neurons. Concentrated stocks of AS and S oligonucleotides were prepared in saline, and cells were exposed to 20 μm AS or S. Concentrated stocks of pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(Z-VAD)-fluoromethyl ketone; Calbiochem) were prepared in Me2SO. 3-Aminobenzamide (3AB) (Sigma), a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, was prepared in sterile water, pH 7.2, immediately before use. The p53 inhibitor pifitrin-α (PFTα) was synthesized as described previously (26Zhu X. Yu Q.S. Cutler R.G. Culmsee C.W. Holloway H.W. Lahiri D.K. Mattson M.P. Greig N.H. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 5090-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A mixture of cyclohexanone, thiourea, and iodine (0.02, 0.04, and 0.02 mm, respectively) was stirred in a 110 °C oil bath for 12 h. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was cooled, dissolved in boiling water, and extracted with ether to remove ketone and iodine to yield 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole as white crystals that were characterized by 1H NMR. Equivalents of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole and 2-bromo-4′-methylacetophone (1 mm) were then mixed in dry benzene and stirred at room temperature for 2 days. Thereafter, the precipitate was filtered from the reaction mixture and washed in benzene to afford 1-(4-methyl-phenyl)-2-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2-imino-3(2H)-benzothiazolyl)-ethanone hydrobromide as white crystals that were subjected to full chemical characterization. PFTα was prepared as a concentrated stock in Me2SO, and cultures were pretreated with 200 nm of PFTα for 1 h. Me2SO at a final concentration 0.1% was used as the vehicle for PFTα and Z-VAD. Neuronal survival was quantified by counting undamaged neurons in premarked microscope fields before and at indicated time points after exposure to experimental treatments via methods described previously (27Kruman I.I. Kumaravel T.S. Lohani A. Pedersen W.A. Cutler R. Kruman Y. Haughey N. Lee J. Evans M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1752-1762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons that died in the intervals between examination points were usually absent, and the viability of the remaining neurons was assessed by morphological criteria. Neurons with intact neurites and soma with a smooth round appearance were considered viable, whereas neurons with fragmented neurites and vacuolated soma were considered nonviable. The C17.2 multipotent murine neural progenitor cell line was maintained in plastic culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 5% horse serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C, as described previously (28Ryder E.F. Snyder E.Y. Cepko C.L. J. Neurobiol. 1990; 21: 356-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). For experimental analyses, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated culture dishes. Immediately prior to experimental treatments, the growth medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. The cultures were treated for 24 h with 20 μm methotrexate (Sigma). Proliferation of C17.2 cells and cell viability were quantified by cell counting after staining with trypan blue, using a digital camera (Hamamatsu). Cell densities were expressed as a percentage of control. Flow cytometry of C17.2 cells was performed as described earlier (29Huschtscha L.I. Jeitner T.M. Andersson C.E. Bartier W.A. Tattersall M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by incubation with 0.25% trypsin for 3 min. The cell suspension was fixed in 70% ethanol. Prior to propidium iodide staining (50 μg/ml in the dark for 30 min), suspended cells were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with RNase (100 μg/ml). DNA content and ploidy were assessed with a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer, and cell cycle distributions were analyzed using Multicycle (Phoenix Flow Systems). Assessments of DNA Damage and Apoptosis—DNA damage was assessed using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis “comet assay” method (27Kruman I.I. Kumaravel T.S. Lohani A. Pedersen W.A. Cutler R. Kruman Y. Haughey N. Lee J. Evans M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1752-1762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Morris E.J. Dreixler J.C. Cheng K.Y. Wilson P.M. Gin M. Geller H.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26 (286-289): 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The comet assay has been shown to be a sensitive and reliable measure of DNA strand breaks associated with incomplete excision repair sites and alkali-labile sites. Following experimental treatments, neurons were scraped, and cell suspensions were embedded into 0.5% low melting agarose on slides (Trevigen). After treatment with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% Me2SO, 2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 10), the slides were transferred to a horizontal electrophoresis unit containing buffer (1 mm EDTA and 0.3 m NaOH, pH 12.4), and electrophoresis was performed at 25 V and 300 mA for 30 min. The slides were then stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed using an epifluorescence microscope and the comet assay image analysis software (Komet 4.0 Kinetic Imaging Ltd.). Nuclei with damaged DNA have the appearance of a comet with a bright head and a tail, whereas nuclei with undamaged DNA appear round, with no tail. Olive tail moment is one of the parameters that is commonly measured with the comet assay. It represents the product of the amount of DNA in the tail (expressed as a percentage of the total DNA) and the distance between the centers of mass of the head and tail regions as the measure of DNA damage. For each experiment regime, 100 nucleoids or comets were assessed in each of 3-4 samples. Apoptosis was quantified in cultures after exposure to experimental treatments. Cells were fixed and stained with fluorescent DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342, and the percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclei was calculated as described previously (31Kruman I.I. Culmsee C. Chan S.L. Kruman Y. Guo Z. Penix L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6920-6926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—The cultures were immunostained with an antibody specific for p53 phosphorylated on serine 15 (S15 polyclonal antibody; 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or microtubule-associated protein 2 (monoclonal antibody; 1:2000; Sigma) followed by exposure to anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1: 200 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for p53 detection. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used to detect microtubule-associated protein 2 expression. Cells were then imaged using a Zeiss CLSM 510 confocal microscope with a × 40 water immersion objective. Relative levels of immunoreactivity (average pixel intensity/neuron) were quantified as described previously (31Kruman I.I. Culmsee C. Chan S.L. Kruman Y. Guo Z. Penix L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6920-6926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice and Brain Tissue Preparation—Experiments were performed in CBS knockout mice (21Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), which were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. To minimize the potential influence of differences in genetic background, heterozygous CBS-deficient (CBS+/-) mice were bred, and comparisons were performed between CBS(-/-) mice and wild-type (CBS+/+) littermates. Genotyping was performed by PCR as described previously (21Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Homozygous CBS male mice 1-2 months old and littermate wild-type (WT) control male mice of the same age were euthanized and decapitated, and plasma was collected for measurement of total homocysteine levels. Brains and thymuses were removed and used for UNG gene transcript analyses. Gene Transcript Analysis by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 cultured neurons at the indicated time points after exposure to AS or from thymus or brain tissue of homozygous CBS-/- or wild-type CBS+/+ mice or thymus from Sprague-Dawley rats by homogenizing the cells in a guanidine thyocyanate solution (Trizol; Invitrogen) according to the method described previously (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Using primers corresponding to the coding regions of UNG, PCR amplification of this reverse-transcribed cDNA was carried out to generate cDNA fragments for each probe. The 298-bp UNG PCR fragment was obtained using 5′-CCG CTT TTG CTG GGA CCT G-3′ and 5′-AAC ATC ATG GCT TTC TTT TAC C-3′. Conditions were developed and used in the dynamic range of each assay (data not shown) to reflect quantitative differences between samples. As a negative control, we employed heat-inactivated reverse transcriptase prior to PCR cycling or water instead of a sample. The negative control experiments were performed with each analysis. The 198-bp mouse S16 ribosomal protein primers (5′-CAC TGC AAA CGG GGA AAT GG-3′ and 5′-TGA GAT GGA CTG TCG GAT GG-3′) were used to provide an internal control for the amount of template in the RT-PCR (33Warner M. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 12: 3560-3576Google Scholar). All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The level of UNG mRNA was measured by RT-PCR with the ribosomal 16 S mRNA as the internal control. Each lane contained 10 μg of RNA. Western Blotting—Total cellular lysates were obtained by washing the neurons in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspending the cell pellets in cell lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 10-50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (8-12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature; probed overnight at 4 °C with antibodies raised against UNG (rabbit polyclonal, 2 μg/ml; Imgenex), phospho-p53 (S15 rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), or β-actin; and then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce) and exposed to autoradiographic film. Measurements of Homocysteine Levels—Homocysteine concentrations in plasma samples were quantified using an IMX® immunoassay analyzer (Abbott Laboratories) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel, and p values were obtained using analysis of variance and Fisher's post hoc test. In all cases, statistical significance was determined at the 0.05 level. To test the hypothesis that uracil-DNA glycosylase, as a part of the BER mechanism responsible for DNA repair associated with uracil misincorporation, is critical for neuronal survival, we employed an AS oligonucleotide directed against the mRNA of human uracil-DNA glycosylase encoded by the UNG gene. UNG is highly conserved and is characterized by high homology between the rodent and human enzymes (34Karran P. Cone R. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The selection of target sites for antisense oligonucleotides was based on functional and structural considerations. We chose the transcriptional start site as one of the potentially most vulnerable positions (35Tu G.C. Cao Q.N. Zhou F. Yedy I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25125-26131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A control scrambled oligonucleotide (S) had a base composition identical to that of AS but with a scrambled sequence. The cultures contained 90-95% of the neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein 2-positive cells (data not shown). A 24-h treatment of hippocampal neurons with 20 μm AS, but not with 20 μm S, significantly reduced neuronal survival (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine the effect of the AS on UNG mRNA levels, we performed RT-PCR analysis using primers corresponding to the coding regions of UNG and the ribosomal 16 S protein as an internal control, PCR amplification of this reverse-transcribed cDNA was carried out to generate cDNA fragments for each probe. The 298-bp UNG PCR fragment was obtained using primers 5′-CCG CTT TTG CTG GGA CCT G-3′ and 5′-AAC ATC ATG GCT TTC TTT TAC C-3′. The 198-bp ribosomal 16 S PCR fragment was obtained using primers 5′-CAC TGC AAA CGG GGA AAT GG-3′ and 5′-TGA GAT GGA CTG TCG GAT GG-3′ and used as the internal control (33Warner M. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 12: 3560-3576Google Scholar). Untreated rat emryonal hippocampal neurons expressed UNG (Fig. 1C). The level of UNG mRNA, measured by RT-PCR, was found to be decreased already within 0.5 h and remained at undetectable levels through 9 h of treatment with the UNG AS and then reappeared after 12-18 h of AS exposure. mRNA levels of UNG were not different from the mRNA levels in untreated rat hippocampal neurons. As a positive control, we used UNG expression in the rat thymus, since UNG expression is known to be high in proliferating tissues (23Haug T. Skorpen F. Aas P.A. Malm V. Skjelbred C. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). These differences were significant because the reaction conditions were developed in the dynamic range of the assay to reflect quantitative differences in the samples. To determine the effect of the AS on UNG protein, we performed immunoblot analyses with a UNG antibody on whole-cell extracts of rat hippocampal neurons treated with AS. Untreated rat emryonal hippocampal neurons expressed UNG (Fig. 1D). The protein level of UNG was found to be decreased already within 0.5 h and remained at undetectable levels through 3 h of treatment with the UNG AS and then reappeared as weak bands at 6 and 9 h of AS exposure compared with untreated control. As positive and negative controls, we used UNG expression in the rat thymus and brain, since UNG expression is typically significantly higher in proliferating (thymus) as compared with nonproliferating (brain) tissues (23Haug T. Skorpen F. Aas P.A. Malm V. Skjelbred C. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, results of both RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses demonstrate the depletion of mRNA and protein levels of UNG with UNG AS treatment. To determine whether or not neurons that died in response to depletion of UNG with AS treatment underwent apoptosis, we evaluated nuclear chromatin morphology in the cells. The dying neurons exhibited chromatin condensation as assessed by Hoechst staining, consistent with an apoptotic mode of cell death (Fig. 2A). To confirm that UNG depletion triggers neuronal apoptosis, we co-treated cultures with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (10 μm) and UNG AS. Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone prevented the death of neurons exposed to UNG AS, demonstrating a requirement for caspase activation in the cell death process (Fig. 2B). We have shown previously that neuronal apoptosis associated with one-carbon metabolism impairment is accompanied by p53 up-regulation (27Kruman I.I. Kumaravel T.S. Lohani A. Pedersen W.A. Cutler R. Kruman Y. Haughey N. Lee J. Evans M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1752-1762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kruman I.I. Culmsee C. Chan S.L. Kruman Y. Guo Z. Penix L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6920-6926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of cultured hippocampal neurons to UNG AS, but not with S, resulted in a significant increase in the levels of activated (phosphorylated on serine 15) p53 that occurred within 5-7 h after exposure to AS (Fig. 3, A-C), a time course that clearly preceded morphological signs of apoptosis such as nuclear chromatin condensation (Fig. 2B) or fragmentation of neurites (Fig. 1A). The neuronal death was completely prevented when cultures where pretreated with the p53 inhibitor PFTα (200 nm) (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that p53 activation is involved in neuronal death induced by UNG AS. To confirm the involvement of p53 in neuronal death initiated by UNG suppression, we quantified neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal neurons derived from mice with targeted deletion in the p53 gene (p53-/- mice) and from wild-type (p53+/+) mice, as assessed by cell counts of Hoechst-stained cultures. Embryos obtained from parental p53+/- mice were dissected and processed independently. From each"
https://openalex.org/W1976408398,"The two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases belong to an emerging class of enzymes involved in oxidation reactions in a number of metabolic and biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. One component is a NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase, which provides a reduced flavin to the second component, the proper monooxygenase. There, the reduced flavin activates molecular oxygen for substrate oxidation. Here, we study the flavin reductase ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 gene product, both reported to be involved in the last step of biosynthesis of the natural antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor. For the first time we show that ActVA-ORF5 is a FMN-dependent monooxygenase that together with the help of the flavin reductase ActVB catalyzes the oxidation reaction. The mechanism of the transfer of reduced FMN between ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 has been investigated. Dissociation constant values for oxidized and reduced flavin (FMNox and FMNred) with regard to ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 have been determined. The data clearly demonstrate a thermodynamic transfer of FMNred from ActVB to ActVA-ORF5 without involving a particular interaction between the two protein components. In full agreement with these data, we propose a reaction mechanism in which FMNox binds to ActVB, where it is reduced, and the resulting FMNred moves to ActVA-ORF5, where it reacts with O2 to generate a flavinperoxide intermediate. A direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of such species within ActVA-ORF5 is reported.

A direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of such species within ActVA-ORF5 is reported. There is a great variety of monooxygenases catalyzing oxygen activation and oxygen transfer reactions in the living world. The most extensively studied ones are the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases (1Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) and the enzymes belonging to the methane monooxygenase family (2Baik M.H. Newcomb M. Friesner R.A. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2385-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), both using an iron center for O2 activation. Also physiologically important are the flavin-dependent monooxygenases. These systems can be divided into two groups. The first one consists in enzymes with FAD or FMN as prosthetic groups, in which reduction of the flavin by reduced pyridine nucleotides, NADH or NADPH, and oxidation of substrates are carried out on a single polypeptide chain (3Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Valentine J.S. Foote C.S. Greenberg A. Liebman J.F. Active Oxygen in Biochemistry. Blackie Academic & Professional, 1995: 37-83Crossref Google Scholar). A second class of enzymes that utilize the flavin, FAD or FMN, as a cosubstrate rather than a prosthetic group recently emerged. A separate NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase is, thus, required to supply reduced flavins that bind to the oxygenase component, where they activate O2 for substrate oxidation (Scheme 1) (4Galan B. Diaz E. Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this two-component system, NAD(P)H oxidation and the hydroxylation reaction are catalyzed by separate polypeptides. For years, the only prototype for this class of monooxygenases was the luciferase enzyme, which has been the subject of numerous studies (3Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Valentine J.S. Foote C.S. Greenberg A. Liebman J.F. Active Oxygen in Biochemistry. Blackie Academic & Professional, 1995: 37-83Crossref Google Scholar, 5Meighen E.A. Microbiol.

However, it is only recently that the importance of such systems in oxidative metabolism, in particular within microorganisms, has been realized.If we except the enzymes involved in the luciferase reaction, the flavin reductases associated with the oxygenase component display strong sequence homologies (4Galan B. Diaz E. Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These flavin reductases have been extensively studied from a biochemical (7Kendrew S.G.

On the other hand, much less is known on the structure and the enzymatic mechanisms of the monooxygenase component.The monooxygenase components can be further divided into two groups on the basis of the type of the flavin used in the reaction. The first group consists in FADH2-utilizing monooxygenases, which are represented by several well characterized systems such as 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase (HpaB) of Escherichia coli (13Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol monooxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia (14Gisi M.R. Xun L. J.

Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) belong to that family but have not been characterized yet. The second group consists in FMNH2-utilizing monooxygenases, which have been much less investigated in terms of their structure, mechanism, and substrate specificity. Examples of such FMN-dependent systems are those involved in the synthesis of the antibiotic pristinamycin in Streptomyces pristinaespiralis (19Blanc V. Lagneaux D. Didier P. Gil P. Lacroix P.

The system participates in the last step of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor (Scheme 2), which consists of the hydroxylation of the precursor dihydrokalafungin and the coupling of two molecules of the hydroxylated product (25Cole S.P.

Actinorhodin biosynthesis involves about 20 proteins whose corresponding genes are localized in the same region of the chromosome (27Fernandez-Moreno M.A. Martinez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of the actVB gene resulted in the accumulation of dihydrokalafungin without any production of actinorhodin (25Cole S.P. Rudd B.A. Hopwood D.A. Chang C.J. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purification and characterization of ActVB demonstrated that ActVB was a NADH:FMN oxidoreductase, therefore suggesting that it serves to provide reduced FMN to a monooxygenase involved in dihydrokalafungin oxidation catalysis (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The same phenotype was observed when a second region of the chromosome, named actVA, was inactivated (26Caballero J.L. Martinez E. Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This region contains six open reading frames (ORFs) (26Caballero J.L. Martinez E. Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we identify ActVAORF5 as the monooxygenase associated with ActVB. Overexpression in E. coli allowed us to purify it and to characterize the FMN-dependent activation of molecular oxygen by the ActVAActVB system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—FMN, NADH, 1,5-dihydroanthraquinone (DHAQ) were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich. Other reagent-grade chemicals were obtained from Euromedex. Deazaflavin (5-Deaza-5-carbariboflavin) was a gift from Philippe Simon (Grenoble, France).Construction of ActVA-ORF5 Expression Plasmid—Plasmid pIJ2305 containing the whole actV region (28Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was isolated from S. coelicolor with the Plasmid Midiprep kit (Qiagen). ActVA-ORF5 gene was amplified by PCR from pIJ2305 using the primer 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAGCGAGGACACGATGACC-3′ (EcoR1 and NdeI restriction sites are underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGCCATCGTTGCTCCTCCT-3′ (the BamH1 restriction site is underlined). The PCR product was digested by EcoR1-BamH1, and the resulting fragment was ligated into pUC18 (pUC18-ActVA). This plasmid was sequenced to confirm that no changes had been introduced in the actVA-ORF5 sequence during PCR. The NdeI-BamH1 fragment derived from pUC18-ActVA was subsequently cloned into pT7-7 at the same restriction sites, resulting in the plasmid named pActVA used for the overexpression of the actVA-ORF5 gene product.Overexpression and Purification of ActVA-ORF5—E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS harboring pActVA was grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm in a 3-liter flask containing 1 liter of Luria and Bertani medium in the presence of 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression of ActVA-ORF5 was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 380 μm when an A600 nm = 0.4 was reached. After 5–6 h of growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol (buffer A). All the following steps except cell disruption were performed at 4 °C. Extraction of soluble proteins was performed by lysozyme treatment (0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, incubation time 45 min at room temperature) followed by French press disruption. The resulting cell extract was clarified by ultracentifugation at 45,000 rpm for 90 min (rotor TI 50.2 Beckman), and the supernatant was used as crude extract for purification. Crude extract (700 mg in proteins) was loaded onto a 60-ml Q-Sepharose XL column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with 60 ml of buffer A plus 25 mm NaCl, and the proteins were eluted with a linear 0–500 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions containing ActVA, eluted with 120 mm NaCl, were pooled and concentrated to 2 ml by ultrafiltration using a 10,000 Mr regenerated cellulose membrane (Amicon). 30% of the total protein fraction was lost in this step, probably due to irreversible adsorption to the membrane. The concentrated fraction was loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (120 ml, from Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer A and then eluted with the same buffer. Fractions containing pure ActVA, about 95% as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, concentrated as described above, and stored at –80 °C.Preparation of ApoActVB—Overexpression and purification of His-tagged ActVB was carried out as previously reported (10Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All the following steps were performed at 4 °C. Purified His-tagged ActVB (2 mg) was loaded onto a 1 ml Ni-NTA column (Amersham Biosciences) and treated with 1.5 column volumes of 2 m KBr and 2 m urea at acidic pH (29Hefti M.H. Milder F.J. Boeren S. Vervoort J. van Berkel W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Renaturation on the column was achieved with 4 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, and the protein was recovered with 3 column volumes of 500 mm imidazole, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol. Because apoActVB was unstable in the presence of imidazole, the protein solution was immediately loaded onto a Nap 10 column and eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol. The yield of the overall process was about 40%.Analytical Determinations—The native molecular mass of ActVA was determined with an analytical Superdex 200 gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), chymotrypsin (20.1 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used as markers of molecular mass. The void volume was determined with ferritin (450 kDa). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Flavin Binding to ActVA-ORF5 and ActVB—UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard 8453 photodiode array instrument at 18 °C. Kd values of FMNox for ActVB and ActVA were calculated from the variation of the absorbance values at the selected wavelengths using Equation 1,(Ax−Ao)/(Af−Ao)=([FMNtot]×[proteinfree])/(Kd+[proteinfree])(eq.1) where Ao is the initial absorbance, Ax is the absorbance after a given addition of the protein, and Af is the absorbance at the end of the titration. Making the hypothesis that ActVA and ActVB contain one binding site per monomer, [FMNbound] and [proteinfree] were calculated from the total concentrations of FMN ([FMNtot]) and protein ([proteintot]) using Equations 2 and 3.[FMNbound]=(Ax−Ao)/(Af−Ao)×[FMNtot](eq.2) [proteinfree]=[proteintot]−[FMNbound](eq.3) ActVA fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 18 °C with a Jasco FP 6500 spectrofluorimeter using a 1-cm square cuvette (Helma). The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm. The measured fluorescence spectra were corrected from inner filter effects due to FMNox or FMNred absorption during excitation as well as during emission. The corrected fluorescence (Fcorr) was calculated according to the method described in (30Tu S.C. McCormick D.B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using Equation 4,Fcorr=Fobs×[∑x=1x=10∑y=1y=10[(10−(ϵex[FMN]xL/10))×(10−(ϵem[FMN]yL/10))]](eq.4) where L is the cuvette full path length (1 cm), [FMN] the total concentration of FMN, ϵex is the extinction coefficient of FMN at excitation wavelength (295 nm), and ϵem is the extinction coefficient of FMN for each emission wavelength between 300 and 400 nm. Because the inner filter effect is not homogenous in the entire cuvette, we divided it into 100 identical points and defined their position by x and y coordinates, making the hypothesis that their surfaces are infinitely small. For each position and each wavelength between 295 and 400 nm, the factors representing the inner filter effect were calculated and were subsequently summed to determine an F corrected (Fcorr) value. Fcorr precisely corresponds to the intrinsic protein fluorescence. Kd values were calculated from the variation of the corrected fluorescence intensity at 338 nm (Fcorr) using Equations 1, 2, and 3.Anaerobic Experiments—Anaerobic experiments were performed in a Jacomex glove box equipped with a UV-visible cell coupled to a Uvikon XL spectrophotometer by optical fibers (Photonetics system). All the solutions were incubated anaerobically 2 h before the beginning of each experiment. For FMN reduction, an FMN stock solution (500 μm) was anaerobically and quantitatively photoreduced by 30 min of irradiation with a commercial slide projector placed at a distance of 3 cm in the presence of 2 μm deazaflavin and 10 mm EDTA. For oxidation of reduced flavin, as a standard procedure aerated water was prepared for each experiment by bubbling 100% oxygen gas for 30 min into an air-tight Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of water. FMNred oxidation was performed in the anaerobic glove box by injecting 5 μl of the oxygen-saturated water (1 mm) into a 100-μl air-tight spectrophotometric cuvette with an Hamilton syringe.RESULTSActVA-ORF5 as the Potential Flavin-dependent Hydroxylase—Among the six genes present in the actVA region (26Caballero J.L. Martinez E. Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), only ORF5 displays sequence homologies with flavin-dependent hydroxylases. This becomes particularly obvious when the sequence of the corresponding protein is compared with the product of the tdsC gene from Paenibacillus spA11–2 (31Konishi J. Ishii Y. Onaka T. Maruhashi K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the product of the pheA gene (32Kim I.C. Oriel P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Supplemental Fig. 1). TdsC is an FMN-utilizing monooxygenase associated with TdsD, a NADH:FMN oxidoreductase, and involved in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (31Konishi J. Ishii Y. Onaka T. Maruhashi K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A similar system is found in Rhodococcus erytropolis with DszC acting as a FMN-utilizing monooxygenase and DszD as a NADH:FMN oxidoreductase displaying strong sequence homologies with ActVB (24Xi L. Squires C.H. Monticello D.J. Childs J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, this analysis suggests that actVA-ORF5 gene product might be the monooxygenase associated with ActVB for the last step of actinorhodin biosynthesis.Purification of ActVA-ORF5—The details of the methods used to clone and express the actVA-ORF5 gene in E. coli and purify the corresponding protein are given in the experimental section. Briefly, E. coli Bl 21 (DE3) pLysS strain was transformed with the expression vector pActVA-ORF5 derived from pT7-7 containing the actVA-ORF5 gene. Bacterial soluble extracts were subjected to an anion exchange chromatography, and the enriched fractions, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis, were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column. The protein was obtained 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). No proteolysis occurred all through the purification process (data not shown). Determination of its N-terminal sequence (SEDTHT) confirmed that the purified protein was indeed the product of the actVA-ORF5 gene. For the sake of simplicity, in the following this protein is named ActVA. Analysis by mass spectroscopy showed that the protein, with a molecular mass of 39,715 Da, lacked the N-terminal methionine. Chromatography of pure ActVA on a calibrated Superdex 200 gel filtration column showed that the protein was dimeric in solution, with an experimental mass of about 77,000 Da (data not shown). Finally, no evidence for a protein-bound chromophore could be obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy.At room temperature the protein spontaneously precipitated in the presence of 250 mm NaCl. Thus, the following experiments using pure ActVA were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer in the absence of additional salt.ActVA-ORF5, an Active Monooxygenase System—The precursor of actinorhodin is dihydrokalafungin. However, this compound is not commercially available and difficult to obtain either from natural sources (25Cole S.P. Rudd B.A. Hopwood D.A. Chang C.J. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or by chemical synthesis (33Brimble M.A. Stuart S.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1. 1990; 4: 881-885Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we used 1,5-dihydroanthraquinone (DHAQ) as a substrate analog to check whether the ActVA protein was indeed able to catalyze an hydroxylation reaction in combination with ActVB. The assay mixture under aerobic conditions contained 200 μm NADH, 5 μm FMN, 50 μm DHAQ, 11 nm ActVB, and various amounts of ActVA in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. After 1 h at 30 °C, DHAQ and its oxidation products were extracted with MeOH and analyzed by electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1, a peak at m/z = 255 was observed besides the peak at m/z = 239 corresponding to DHAQ. This proved the formation of a product corresponding to DHAQ plus one oxygen atom (+16), thus deriving from DHAQ by monooxygenation. This peak was absent from the mass spectrum when one of the following components of the system was excluded from the reaction mixture: FMN, NADH, ActVB or DHAQ (data not shown). In addition, a control reaction carried out within an anaerobic glove box did not result in the production of the oxygenated product either (data not shown). In conclusion, taken together, these preliminary experiments reported here clearly indicate that the product of the actVAORF5 gene is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase.Fig. 1ActVA-ActVB hydroxylase activity. ActVB (11 nm) and ActVA (5 μm) were aerobically incubated with FMNox (5 μm), NADH (200 μm), and DHAQ (1,5-dihydroanthraquinone) (50 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, for 1 h at 30 °C. Products were then extracted with methanol and analyzed by electrospray-mass spectrometry. The electrospray mass spectrum of the organic extract and the structure of DHAQ are shown (m/z = 239).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interaction of FMN with ActVA and ActVB; Dissociation Constants—To determine the mechanism of the transfer of reduced flavins between ActVB and ActVA, the dissociation constant (Kd) values for reduced and oxidized FMN with ActVB and ActVA proteins were determined.As reported previously, a significant proportion (20–30%) of the purified ActVB polypeptides contained one bound FMN (10Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Removal of FMN for the production of ActVB in the pure apoprotein form, named apoActVB, was thus achieved first before the binding experiments. The use of the His-tagged form of ActVB bound to a Ni-NTA column allowed a fast and efficient procedure for the preparation of apoActVB, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein bound to the Ni-NTA column was treated first with a solution containing 2 m urea and 2 m KBr. This was followed by renaturation, elution with imidazole, and desalting. The protein obtained from that process retained its ability to bind FMN, as judged from the appearance during incubation of apoActVB with FMN, of an absorption band centered to 457 nm, characteristic of the ActVB·FMN complex (10Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ApoActVB was shown to be active as a flavin reductase in a standard assay using NADH and riboflavin or FMN as substrates, with Km values for flavins (data not shown) comparable with those obtained with the as-isolated enzyme (10Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data showed that apoActVB was fully active, well folded, and could, thus, be used in our following investigations.Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible spectrum of the oxidized form of FMN (FMNox) under three different conditions. The λmax value of the low energy visible band is 445 nm for free FMNox, 438 nm for FMNox in the presence of an excess of ActVA, and 457 nm for FMNox in the presence of an excess of ActVB. This showed that FMNox bound to ActVB, as previously demonstrated (10Filisetti L. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but also to ActVA. Therefore, the λmax value could be used as an indicator for whether FMNox is free or bound to ActVA or ActVB.Fig. 2Light absorption spectra of FMNox. 10 μm FMNox was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, alone (□), in the presence of 200 μm ActVA (○), or 40 μm ActVB (♦). OD, optical density.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As shown in Fig. 3, aerobic titration of FMNox with increasing amounts of ActVA resulted in a shift of the FMNox visible absorption band from 445 to 438 nm. An isosbestic point was observed at 458 nm. A plot of bound FMN versus free ActVA, calculated from the fractional absorbance change at 440 nm, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” gave a Kd value of 19.4 ± 6.3 μm for FMNox with regard to ActVA (inset of Fig. 3).Fig. 3Spectrophotometric titration of FMNox with ActVA. 10 μm FMNox in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, was titrated with ActVA.

The serogroup A capsule biosynthetic genetic cassette consists of four open reading frames, mynA–D (sacA–D), that are specific to serogroup A, but the functions of these genes have not been well characterized. mynC was found to encode an inner membrane-associated acetyltransferase that is responsible for the O-acetylation of the CPS of serogroup A.

Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A is responsible for the massive epidemics of meningococcal meningitis and septicemia that periodically affect sub-Saharan Africa, China, South America, and other parts of the world. The serogroup A capsular polysaccharide (CPS) 1The abbreviations used are: CPS, capsular polysaccharide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. that confers serogroup specificity is composed of repeating units of α1→6-linked ManNAc 1-phosphate that is O-acetylated (1Liu T.Y. Gotschlich E.C. Jonssen E.K. Wysocki J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2849-2858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is evidence of other glycosidic linkages (2Bundle D.R. Smith I.C.P. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2275-2281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the principal linkage between monomer ManNAc residues in this polysaccharide is the α1→6 phosphodiester bond involving the hemiacetal group of carbon 1 and the hydroxyl group of carbon 6 of the mannosamine residues. Serogroup A CPS is structurally distinct from the other disease-causing meningococcal serogroups, B, C, Y, and W-135, which are composed of or contain sialic acid (1Liu T.Y. Gotschlich E.C. Jonssen E.K. Wysocki J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2849-2858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhattacharjee A.K. Jennings H.J. Kenny C.P. Martin A. Smith I.C. Can. J.

Interestingly, the serogroup B CPS is not O-acetylated. The genes encoding the putative CPS O-acetyltransferases OatC and OatWY, responsible for the O-acetylation of meningococcal serogroup C and serogroups W-135 and Y, respectively, have been recently identified (5Claus H. Borrow R. Achtman M. Morelli G. Kantelberg C. Longworth E. Frosch M. Vogel U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Other pathogens such as pneumococcal serotype 9V, Salmonella enterica serovar typhi Vi, Staphylococcus aureus serotypes 5 and 8, and Escherichia coli K1 (6Orskov F. Orskov I. Sutton A. Schneerson R. Lin W. Egan W. Hoff G.E. Robbins J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) also express O-acetylated capsules. The biological importance of O-acetylation of CPS appears to be species- or subspecies-dependent. In some pathogens, O-acetylation of capsules is involved in immune recognition (6Orskov F. Orskov I. Sutton A. Schneerson R. Lin W. Egan W. Hoff G.E. Robbins J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Szu S.C. Li X.R. Stone A.L. Robbins J.B. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4555-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For meningococcal serogroup A CPS, there is a dramatic reduction in the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide observed upon removal of the O-acetyl groups by chemical treatment (8Berry D.S. Lynn F. Lee C.H. Frasch C.E. Bash M.C. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The general genetic organization of CPS genes of N. meningitidis is similar to that of other bacterial systems such as Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli K1, etc., that are classified (9Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 10Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) as group II capsules. It is usually composed of a unique biosynthetic genetic cassette and conserved genes involved in translocation of the CPS. The genetic cassette responsible for the biosynthesis of the serogroup A capsule is composed of an ∼5-kb nucleotide sequence located (Fig. 1) between ctrA, the outer membrane capsule transporter, and galE, the UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (11Swartley J.S. Liu L.J. Miller Y.K. Martin L.E. Edupuganti S. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four open reading frames (designated mynA–D or sacA–D) are cotranscribed as an operon (11Swartley J.S. Liu L.J. Miller Y.K. Martin L.E. Edupuganti S. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are not found in the genomes of other meningococcal serogroups or in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Separated from ctrA by a 218-bp intergenic region, mynA is predicted to encode a 372-amino acid protein that has homology to the E. coli UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase. MynB has been hypothesized to be the capsule polymerase, linking individual UDP-ManNAc monomers together, whereas MynD has been predicted to be involved either in CPS transport assembly or in cross-linking of the capsule to the meningococcal cell surface (11Swartley J.S. Liu L.J. Miller Y.K. Martin L.E. Edupuganti S. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that mynC (744 bp) encodes an O-acetyltransferase (247 amino acids) that transfers acetyl groups to the ManNAc residues of the serogroup A CPS.

Brain/heart infusion medium (37 g/liter) with 1.25% fetal bovine serum was used when kanamycin selection was required. The antibiotic concentrations used for E. coli strains were 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 300 μg/ml erythromycin, and those for N. meningitidis were 80 μg/ml kanamycin, 60 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 3 μg/ml erythromycin. E. coli strain DH5α cultured on LB medium was used for cloning and propagation of plasmids. Meningococci were transformed by the procedure of Janik et al. (14Janik A. Juni E. Heym G.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1976; 4: 71-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains were transformed with a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of Meningococcal Non-polar mynC Mutant NmA001— An internal 745-bp fragment of mynC, produced by PCR amplification using primers SE57 and SE61 (11Swartley J.S. Liu L.J. Miller Y.K. Martin L.E. Edupuganti S. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the chromosomal DNA of strain F8229 as a template, was cloned into pCR2.1 to yield pGS201. The aphA-3 fragment obtained from pUC18K (15Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and HincII digestion and filled in with Klenow polymerase was inserted into the unique SspI site of mynC in pGS201 to generate pGS202. The correct orientation of aphA-3 was confirmed by colony PCR and direct sequence analysis of pGS202. An ScaI-linearized pGS202 plasmid was used to transform meningococcal serogroup A strain F8229 to generate NmA001. The correct homologous recombination of the aphA-3 cassette into the mynC coding sequence was confirmed by PCR with cassette-specific primers and chromosome-specific primers. Overexpression and Purification of Meningococcal MynC—The complete coding sequence of mynC was obtained by PCR amplification using primers SG005 (NdeI) and SG006 (XhoI) (Table I). The PCR product, digested with NdeI and XhoI, was subsequently cloned into pET20b(+) cut with the same enzymes to yield pGS203, resulting in a C-terminal His6 fusion. Plasmid pGS203 was purified and subjected to DNA sequence analysis to confirm the intact mynC sequence and the C-terminal His tag fusion. pGS203 was then transformed into E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. One liter of LB culture of the MynC-overexpressing strain was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 5 h. The harvested cells were resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme), left on ice for 30 min, and sonicated 10 times for 30 s with 30-s cooling intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The overexpressed protein was purified under native conditions on Ni-NTA matrices following the supplier's protocol with a modification in column washing. Briefly, the crude extract was incubated with 2 ml of 50% suspension of Ni-NTA-agarose for 1 h before packing into a column. The column was washed with 5 ml each of 10, 20, and 40 mm imidazole in lysis buffer without lysozyme and then eluted with 5 ml of buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The MynC protein was also extracted and purified using a B-PER protein extraction kit (Pierce), containing a lysis reagent with a proprietary mild nonionic detergent in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified MynC fractions obtained by either method were concentrated separately using Centricon YM-3 centrifugal filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) after SDS-PAGE analysis and dialyzed in storage buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.05), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Complementation of the NmA001 Mutant—An intact copy of mynC under the control of the tac promoter was constructed on a meningococcal shuttle vector. Full-length mynC with a C-terminal His tag was amplified from pGS203 using primers SG007 (HindIII) and SG008 (EcoRI) (Table I). The amplified PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 to yield pGS204. The mynC insert was subsequently released from pGS204 with HindIII and EcoRV digestion and ligated into the HindIII and SmaI sites of pFLAG-CTC to generate pGS205 with mynC under the control of the lac promoter. The construct was confirmed by PCR using vector-specific primers YT79 and YT80. The pGS205 plasmid was then cut with BglI, filled in with Klenow, and ligated into the EcoRV site of the meningococcal shuttle vector pYT250(ErmR), yielding pGS206. The pGS206 construct was methylated with HaeIII methylase, and the reaction mixture was used directly to transform wild-type strain F8229 and non-polar mynC mutant NmA001, yielding NmAwtc1 and NmAnpc1, respectively. Meningococcal Membrane and Cytosolic Preparations—Meningococcal membranes and cytosol were separated by the method of Clark et al. (16Clark V.L. Campbell L.A. Palermo D.A. Evans T.M. Klimpel K.W. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from the complemented meningococcal mynC strain NmAnpc1. Briefly, the pellet from a 500-ml culture of NmAnpc1 carrying pGS206, induced overnight with 1 mm IPTG, was used to prepare the inner and outer membranes and cytosolic fractions. The pellet was suspended in 2 ml of buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, and 20% sucrose (pH 8.0) with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell suspensions were diluted with 20 ml of Tris buffer to generate spheroplasts and were sonicated three times each for 30 s in an ice bath with 30-s resting intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was freeze-thawed once at –70 °C before ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet, containing the meningococcal membrane fraction, was washed with Tris buffer. The level of contamination of the membrane fraction with cytoplasmic components was assessed by determining the activity of a cytoplasmic enzyme, malate dehydrogenase (17de Maagd R.A. Lugtenberg B.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 1083-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for both fractions. The membrane fractions were 97–98% pure. The cytosolic proteins were precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid and suspended in 2 ml of 1 m Tris (pH 6.8). Total membrane was solubilized with 2 ml of 2% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature using an orbital shaker. Soluble inner membrane components and insoluble outer membrane components were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The outer membrane pellet was suspended in 500 μl of 1 m Tris (pH 6.8). The diluted inner membrane proteins were precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet thus obtained was suspended in 500 μlof1 m Tris (pH 6.8). Subcellular fractions were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The loadings were standardized based on the same amount of starting meningococci (500 ml of meningococcal culture pellet at A550 = 1 contains ∼2.5 × 1011 cells) and analyzed by Western blotting. To examine the nature of the membrane association of MynC, membrane solubilization experiments were performed as described (18Finberg K.E. Muth T.R. Young S.P. Maken J.B. Heitritter S.M. Binns A.N. Banta L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4881-4889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane pellets were extracted with 5 ml of buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% sucrose, and 0.2 m KCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, or 6 m urea for 30 min at room temperature (urea), at 30 °C (Triton X-100), or on ice (buffer alone and buffer with NaCl). Samples were centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C after the extraction. Proteins in the soluble fractions were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitates obtained were washed two times with acetone, dried, and resuspended in 1 m Tris (pH 6.8) before an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. CPS Extraction and Structural Characterization—CPS was extracted from 2 liters of meningococcal cultures using the standard method of Gotschlich et al. (19Gotschlich E.C. Liu T.Y. Artenstein M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1969; 129: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, the overnight cultures were treated with a final concentration of 1% Cetavlon, a polycationic detergent that precipitates the polyanionic polysaccharides. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in water, and CaCl2 was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm to separate the polysaccharide from the detergent. Nucleic acids were precipitated from the solution by adding 25% (v/v) ethanol, followed by centrifugation. CPS in the supernatant was subsequently precipitated by ethanol at a final concentration of 80% (v/v). Contaminating protein, traces of Cetavlon, and other low molecular mass contaminants were removed with proteinase K digestion and extensive dialysis against a buffer composed of 10% ethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Tris. CPS was further purified by Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column using 50 mm ammonium formate elutions. Column fractions were tested for neutral sugar estimation by phenol sulfuric acid assay (20Dubois M. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40800) Google Scholar). Void volume fractions were pooled and concentrated by speed vacuuming and analyzed by deoxycholate-PAGE and Alcian blue staining (21Reuhs B.L. Carlson R.W. Kim J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3570-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compositional and NMR Analyses of CPSs—Compositional analysis of purified CPS was performed on the alditol acetate derivatives of the sugars after removing the phosphate groups by hydrogen fluoride treatment of the purified serogroup A CPS. The alditol acetate derivatives were analyzed by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using a 30-m SP2330 capillary column (Supelco) (22Stevenson T.T. Furneaux R.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 11: 195-211Google Scholar). Lyophilized wild-type or mutant CPS powder (5 mg) was dissolved in D2O (99.999 atom % D; Sigma) to a uniform concentration of 5 mg/ml. Solutions were agitated with vortexing for 10 min at room temperature, followed by low speed centrifugation at 7200 × g for 10 min to eliminate undissolved material. Aliquots (600 μl) of the supernatant were transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes and placed in a sonication bath for 10 min to eliminate air bubbles trapped on the inner wall of the NMR tube. NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Unity 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm pulsed field gradient triple resonance probe and a high precision temperature controller (+0.1 °C) and under the control of VNMR Version 6.1B or on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm pulsed field gradient inverse detection heteronuclear probe running under VNMR Version 6.1C and Solaris Version 2.8. One-dimensional proton NMR spectra were collected at 25 °C using a standard one-pulse experiment. The transmitter was set at the HDO frequency (4.78 ppm). Standard spectral acquisition conditions are as follows: collection of 64K data points over a spectral window of 8000 Hz, acquisition time of 4.096 s, and a relaxation delay of 26 s, giving a recycle time of 30 s. Typically, 64 scans were averaged. Spectra were Fourier-transformed after applying a 0.2-Hz line broadening function. Integrations were performed using subroutines built into the VNMR software. Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography—The cell-surface hydrophobicity of meningococcal strains was tested using a modified method of Karlyshev et al. (23Karlyshev A.V. Linton D. Gregson N.A. Lastovica A.J. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Disposable plastic columns packed with octyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) to a height of 2 cm were washed with 10 ml of buffer A (0.2 m ammonium sulfate in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8)). Meningococci collected from overnight plate cultures were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline to an absorbance of 10, and a 100-μl aliquot was gently pipetted onto the surface of the column and eluted with 5 ml of buffer A. A 100-μl cell suspension diluted directly into 5 ml of buffer A was also prepared as a control. The A600 of both the column flow-through and control samples was determined. Results were calculated as the A600 of the flow-through divided by that of the control and are expressed as a percentage of cells adsorbed to the column. Serum Bactericidal Assay—A serum bactericidal assay was performed as described previously (24Kahler C.M. Martin L.E. Shih G.C. Rahman M.M. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5939-5947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using pooled normal human serum at a final concentration of 10% (v/v) with a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. Heat-inactivated normal human serum was used as a control. Immunoblots—Serogroup A wild-type and mynC mutant NmA001 CPSs were resolved on 15% deoxycholate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a transfer buffer of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine (pH 8.3), and 20% methanol. An identical gel was stained with Alcian blue to visualize capsules. Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris/Tween buffer (0.5 m Tris (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Serogroup A capsule-specific mAb 14-1-A (13Zollinger W.D. Boslego J. Froholm L.O. Ray J.S. Moran E.E. Brandt B.L. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1987; 53: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used as the primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution, whereas alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG + IgM (Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA) was used at 1:5000 dilution. All incubations were done at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were developed in 20 ml of alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.1 m Tris (pH 9.5), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) containing 40 μl of 10% nitro blue tetrazolium in 70% N,N-dimethylformamide and 30 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (50 mg/ml in N,N-dimethylformamide). Colony immunoblots were processed similarly using nitrocellulose membranes. After the meningococci were lifted, the membranes were allowed to air-dry for 30 min at room temperature and then blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris/Tween buffer. Protein samples for Western blots were resolved by a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. Anti-pentahistidine monoclonal antibodies were used as primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilutions. Whole Cell ELISA—ELISAs were performed using the methods reported previously (11Swartley J.S. Liu L.J. Miller Y.K. Martin L.E. Edupuganti S. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Aliquots (50 μl) at 1:9 dilution of meningococcal suspensions (A550 = 0.1) were applied to microtiter plates and dried overnight at 37 °C. mAb 14-1-A was used at 1:30,000 dilution, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody (Organon Teknika Corp.) was used at 1:10,000 dilution. All incubations were performed at 37 °C. Colorimetric Estimation of Capsule O-Acetylation—O-Acetylation of purified CPSs was also measured colorimetrically according to the method described by Hestrin (25Hestrin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 180: 249-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of CPS samples (500 μl) were incubated with an equal volume of 0.035 m hydroxylamine in 0.75 m NaOH for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by the addition of 1 m of perchloric acid (500 μl) and 70 mm ferric perchlorate in 0.5 m perchloric acid (500 μl). The pink color resulting from the presence of O-acetyl groups was quantified at 500 nm with a known amount of ethyl acetate as the standard. p-Nitrophenyl Acetate Assay—Acetylesterase activity was tested with the synthetic substrate p-ni"
https://openalex.org/W1968278144,"Casein kinase 2 (CK2) was one of the first protein kinases to be discovered and has been suggested to be responsible for as much as one-fifth of the eukaryotic phosphoproteome. Despite being responsible for the phosphorylation of a vast array of proteins central to numerous dynamic cellular processes, the activity of CK2 appears to be unregulated. In the current study, we identified a protein kinase activity in rat liver supernatant that is up-regulated by inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). The substrate for the inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase was identified as a phosphatidylcholine transfer protein-like protein. Using the phosphorylation of this substrate in an assay, we purified the inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase and determined it to be CK2. Bacterially expressed recombinant CK2, however, showed very high basal activity and was only modestly activated by IP6 and not regulated by IP. We found that an endogenous component present in rat 4liver supernatant was able to inhibit both recombinant and liver-purified CK2 basal activity. Under these conditions, recombinant CK2 catalytic activity could be increased substantially by IP4, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5), and IP6. We concluded that, contrary to the previously held view, CK2 can exist in a state of low constitutive activity allowing for its regulation by inositol phosphates. The ability of the higher inositol phosphates to directly stimulate CK2 catalytic activity provides the first evidence that these signaling molecules can operate via a direct control of protein phosphorylation.

Numerous studies over the last 20 years have established inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP, inositol 4-phosphate; IP2, inositol 1,4 bisphosphate; IP4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; IP5, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate; IP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; IP7, diphosphoinositide pentakisphosphate; IS6, inositol hexasulfate; CK2, casein kinase-2; rCK2, recombinant CK2; PCTP, phosphatidylcholine transfer protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; cpm, cycles per minute; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry; RS4, fraction 4 from the resource S column; RS4inac, heat-inactive fraction 4 from the resource S column.1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP, inositol 4-phosphate; IP2, inositol 1,4 bisphosphate; IP4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; IP5, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate; IP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; IP7, diphosphoinositide pentakisphosphate; IS6, inositol hexasulfate; CK2, casein kinase-2; rCK2, recombinant CK2; PCTP, phosphatidylcholine transfer protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; cpm, cycles per minute; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry; RS4, fraction 4 from the resource S column; RS4inac, heat-inactive fraction 4 from the resource S column. as a classical second messenger molecule (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). However, IP3 is only one of a vast array (numbering potentially as high as 60) of inositol phosphate isomers found within cells (2Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In contrast to IP3, the biological function of the majority of these inositol phosphates is either unknown or poorly understood. Of particular interest is the phosphorylated product of IP3, namely inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), which shows many of the hallmarks of a second messenger molecule. Early studies focused on a role for IP4 in calcium mobilization; however, the cloning of GAP1IP4BP, which shows high affinity binding to IP4 (3Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F.

Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) suggest that IP4 function may extend beyond calcium signaling. Of the higher inositol phosphates, possibly the most enigmatic is inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Found in all mammalian cells in micromolar concentrations (6Pittet D. Schlegel W. Lew D.P. Monod A.

In an attempt to address the question of novel signaling properties of the inositol phosphates, we tested the possibility that protein kinases may exist that are regulated directly by inositol phosphates. The rationale was that, of the established second messenger molecules (e.g. cAMP, cGMP, diacylglycerol, and calcium), the inositol phosphates are unique in that they do not appear to directly activate a protein kinase. In our initial studies, we partially purified a protein kinase from porcine brain that was able to phosphorylate the synaptic vesicle-associated protein pacsin/syndapin I in an IP6-dependent manner (18Hilton J.M. Plomann M. Ritter B. Modregger J. Freeman H.N. Falck J.R. Krishna U.M. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16341-16347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This was the first demonstration of an inositol phosphate-regulated phosphorylation and supported a role for IP6 in the control of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Importantly, the kinase that was identified in porcine brain was only activated by IP6 and isomers of IP7. No activated phosphorylation was observed using the lower inositol phosphates, in particular IP3 or IP4 (18Hilton J.M. Plomann M. Ritter B. Modregger J. Freeman H.N. Falck J.R. Krishna U.M. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16341-16347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have continued with our investigation of inositol phosphate-regulated protein phosphorylation. We report here that phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP)-like protein, purified from a rat liver supernatant preparation, is a substrate for a protein kinase that is regulated by IP4, IP5, and IP6. Purification of the inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase revealed the identity of the kinase to be the ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2). Our data demonstrate that CK2, far from being constitutively active as previously thought, is in fact under tight inhibitory control and that, under these conditions, inositol phosphates are able to activate CK2 catalytic activity. Materials—All inositol polyphosphates (with the exception of IP4 and the isomers of IP4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (Poole, Dorset, UK). d-inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and the isomers of IP4 were synthesized at the University of Bath. [γ-32P]Adenosine 5′-trisphosphate (specific activity, 111 TBq/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human bacterially expressed recombinant CK2 (rCK2) was obtained from New England Biolabs. Goat polyclonal anti-CK2α antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Assay for Inositol Phosphate-regulated Protein Kinase Activity—Aliquots (5-μl) of fractions from the chromatography columns were incubated in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μm [32P]ATP (1–10 cpm/fmol ATP) in the presence or absence of inositol phosphates in a final volume of 25 μl. Following a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of (2×) Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was then dried and exposed for autoradiography. Where recombinant CK2 was used, 1.25 units of kinase were mixed with α-casein (10 μg/assay) and 2.5 μl of heat-inactivated Resource S fraction 4 (or corresponding TE buffer containing 2.5 mm Tris, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, in controls) and incubated in reaction buffer containing 1 μm [32P]ATP (1–10 cpm/fmol ATP) in the presence or absence of inositol phosphates (25 μm). Following 20 min of incubation at 37 °C (within a linear range of phosphorylation reaction), the reaction was stopped and processed as described above. To make a heat-inactivated preparation, 200-μl aliquots of Resource S fraction 4 were heated for 5 min at 60 °C, cooled on ice, and centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 × g to separate denatured proteins. Aliquots of the supernatant fraction were used in CK2 assays. Fractionation of High Speed Liver Supernatant on Resource S (Cation-exchange) Column—Two rat livers (28–32 g) were homogenized in 150 ml of TE buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 360,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (20 ml) was applied to a 6-ml Resource S (Amersham Biosciences) cation-exchange column and washed with 3 column volumes of TE buffer containing 1 mm DTT. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 3 ml/min in a total volume of 24 ml. Fractions (3-ml) were collected and assayed for kinase activity. The majority of inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase activity eluted at 0.25–0.5 m NaCl (i.e. fractions 3 and 4). Fractionation on Heparin-Sepharose—Fractions 3 and 4 from the Resource S chromatography (containing inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase activity) were combined and 5 ml applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (5-ml) (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 2 column volumes of TE buffer containing 1 mm DTT and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–2 m NaCl in 10 column volumes. Fractions (2.5-ml) were collected and assayed for kinase activity. During this fractionation procedure, the inositol phosphate kinase activity was lost when individual fractions were assayed (see “Results”). To reconstitute kinase activity, the fractions were combined (2.5 μl of each fraction) and then used in the kinase reaction. In this way, it was determined that the inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase was eluted with 0.9–1.1 m NaCl (fractions 10 and 11), and the ∼33-kDa substrate protein was eluted with 0.7–0.9 m NaCl (fractions 8 and 9). Fractionation on Hydroxyapatite—The fractionation procedures described above using Resource S and heparin-Sepharose were repeated 6 times and the kinase fractions combined (total volume, 30 ml) and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris, 5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.35, containing 1 mm DTT and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Similarly, the substrate fractions were combined and dialyzed against the same buffer. The kinase sample (30-ml) was loaded onto an hydroxyapatite column (1-ml) (Bio-Rad), and the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 5mm Tris, 5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.35, containing 1 mm DTT. Proteins were eluted from the column with the linear gradient at 0–1 m KH2PO4 in 20 column volumes. Inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase activity was identified in fractions 4–6, which were eluted by 0.15–0.3 m KH2PO4. The substrate sample (30-ml) was also fractionated on a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column using the same conditions. In this case, the substrate protein was eluted by 0.35–0.45 m KH2PO4. Fractionation on Mini-Q Anion-exchange Column (SMART System)—Fractions eluted from the hydroxyapatite column and containing the inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase activity (fractions 4–6, total volume 3 ml) were diluted into 10 ml of TE buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT and applied to a mini-Q column (0.2-ml) (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with the same buffer (2 column volumes) and eluted first with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl (5 column volumes) and further with 0.3–0.6 m NaCl (10 column volumes) in TE buffer containing 1 mm DTT. Fractions (200-μl) were collected and assayed for kinase activity. The inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase activity was eluted from the column with 0.36–0.42 m NaCl (fractions 8 and 9). It should be noted that the inositol phosphate-regulated activity was labile, and to maintain the kinase with a low basal activity and thus in a state able to be regulated by inositol phosphates, the purification had to be carried out over a short period of 2 days. Mass Spectrometry—Gel plugs (0.8 mm × 1 mm) excised from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, using an automated spot picker (ProPic, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Cambridge, UK), were reduced with 10 mm DTT and alkylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide before in situ tryptic digestion with Promega modified sequencinggrade porcine trypsin using an automated digestion robot (ProGest, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Peptides, extracted from the digested gel plugs with 21 μl of 0.1% formic acid, were analyzed by either MALDI-TOF and/or LC-MS/MS. For MALDI-TOF, 5-μl aliquots of the extracted peptides were desalted with C18 Zip tips (Millipore, Watford, UK), and 0.5-μl aliquots and an equal volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid in 1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile were loaded on to a MALDI target plate using an automated spotting robot (ProMS, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Peptide mass analysis was then performed on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer ([email protected] R, Micromass, Manchester, UK) using a mass range of 900–3000 Da. Mass spectrometric data were analyzed automatically by ProteinLynx software, and protein identity was determined by submission to the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL data bases. The extracted peptides (5 μl) were also analyzed by on-line capillary LC-nanospray MS/MS using a 3-μm 100 Å Pepmap C18 75 μm × 150 mm capillary column (Dionex UK Ltd., Camberly, UK) and a Waters CapLC system. The samples were auto-injected onto a precolumn (5-μm, 100-Å Pepmap C18, 300 μm × 5 mm) and washed with 0.1% formic acid (30 μl/min for 3 min). The peptides were back-flushed onto the analytical column and eluted with a linear gradient (5–40% at 1%/min) of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient was generated at a flow rate of 6 μl/min and then split to allow elution of the column at 200 nl/min into the nanospray source of a Micromass Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer in +ve. MassLynx™ data-directed scan switching was used to select multiply charged peptide ions for MS/MS analysis using collision-induced dissociation. The fragment ion spectra were analyzed automatically by ProteinLynx Global Explorer™, and protein identity was determined by submission to the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL data bases. Alternatively, spectra were manually sequenced de novo and submitted for an NCBI BLAST search using the nonredundant protein data base. Synthesis of IP4—d-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were synthesized as described by Riley et al. (19Riley A.M. Mahon M.F. Potter B.V.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1997; 36: 1472-1474Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structure was confirmed by standard spectroscopic methods (NMR and MS) and was confirmed as being homogenous. Cloning and Phosphorylation of Bacterially Expressed Phosphatidylcholine Transfer PCTP-like Protein—Mouse (C57/BL/6J) liver total RNA was isolated using TRI-reagent (Sigma). The RNA (400 μg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was used in conjugation with primers corresponding to the C- and N-terminal coding sequences of mouse PCTP-like protein (forward primer, 5′-GGGGGATCCGCCACCATGGAAAAGCCAGCTGCCTCAAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGGGAATTCTCAGGTGAGCGAGGTGTCATC-3′) to amplify the PCTP-like protein coding region with BamHI and EcoRI sites at the N and C termini, respectively. PCTP-like protein was then cloned into pGEX-2T at the BamHI/EcoRI sites to produce a bacterial fusion protein where glutathione S-transferase (GST) was fused to the N terminus of the full-length PCTP-like protein. GST-PCTP-like protein attached to glutathione-agarose beads (1.65 mg/ml) was used in kinase reactions consisting of 20 μl of packed beads in kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μm [32P]ATP (1–10 cpm/fmol ATP) and recombinant CK2 (6 units/reaction) in a final reaction volume of 45 μl. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min and was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. Proteins were then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the fusion proteins before exposure to obtain an autoradiograph. Miscellaneous Procedures—Silver staining was performed using a Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus kit. Western blotting with the anti-CK2 α-subunit antibody was carried out using standard procedures. Protein assays were conducted using the Bradford protein assay reagents (Sigma). Statistics were derived using the Student's paired t test. Identification of Inositol Phosphate-mediated Phosphorylation—A high speed supernatant preparation from rat liver was fractionated over a Resource S cation-exchange column, and each fraction was tested in a protein kinase assay for the presence of inositol phosphate-regulated protein phosphorylation (see “Experimental Procedures”). For the majority of phosphoproteins, the presence of inositol phosphates in the assay did not affect the extent of phosphorylation (Fig. 1). However, in fractions 2–4, an ∼33-kDa phosphoprotein exhibited a higher level of phosphorylation in the presence of IP6 (Fig. 1A) and IP4 (data not shown). Further analysis revealed that phosphorylation of the 33-kDa protein was specificity-increased by IP4, IP5, and IP6 but not the lower inositol phosphates (Fig. 1B). Importantly, in control experiments, inositol hexasulfate (IS6) did not increase phosphorylation of the 33-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). Separation of the Inositol Phosphate-regulated Kinase from Its 33-kDa Substrate—Resource S fractions containing the inositol phosphate-regulated phosphorylation were pooled and further fractionated on a heparin-Sepharose column. Testing each fraction in a kinase assay with IP6 revealed no detectable phosphorylation, except for a very weak signal in fraction 9 (Fig. 2). It was concluded that this chromatographic step had separated the kinase and substrate, which were now present in distinct fractions. This was tested by mixing fractions in an attempt to reconstitute the phosphorylation activity. It was found that, by mixing fraction 9 with fraction 11, the inositol phosphate-regulated phosphorylation of the 33-kDa protein was restored (Fig. 2). Similar data were obtained when mixing fraction 8 and fraction 11 (data not shown). It was concluded that the inositol phosphate-regulated kinase and the substrate protein were contained in fractions 8–9 and fraction 11. To determine which fractions contained the kinase and which contained the substrate, each fraction was heat-inactivated at 60 °C for 5 min. This procedure was designed to inactivate the kinase activity. Heat inactivation of fraction 8 did not affect the kinase reaction when mixed with fraction 11. However, heat inactivation of fraction 11 completely prevented phosphorylation of the 33-kDa protein when mixed with fraction 8 (data not shown). Similarly, heat inactivation of fraction 9 did not affect the kinase reaction when mixed with fraction 11, but heat inactivation of fraction 11 completely prevented phosphorylation (data not shown). It was concluded from these studies that fractions 8 and 9 from the heparin-Sepharose column contained the substrate for an inositol phosphate-regulated kinase that was present in fraction 11. Purification and Identification of the Substrate Protein for the Inositol Phosphate-regulated Kinase—Fractions 8 and 9 from the heparin-Sepharose chromatography were pooled and further fractionated on a hydroxyapatite column. The presence of the substrate protein in the eluate was determined in kinase reactions where the inositol phosphate-regulated kinase was added (see previous paragraph). Phosphorylation of the 33-kDa protein peaked in fractions 8 and 9 from the hydroxyapatite column (Fig. 3A). This corresponded to the elution of a protein band at 33 kDa that aligned exactly with the phosphorylated band in the kinase reactions (Fig. 3B). MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic peptide fragments of the 33-kDa protein resulted in 10 peptides covering 46% of the amino acid sequence, which matched exactly the PCTP-like protein (Fig. 3C). Further confirmation of the identity of the protein substrate was obtained from sequence analysis by LC-MS/MS of six peptides (Fig. 3C, underlined). Purification and Identification of the Inositol Phosphate-regulated Kinase—Fraction 11 from the heparin-Sepharose column, which was shown to contain kinase activity (see Fig. 2), was further fractionated on a hydroxyapatite column. Each fraction was then assayed for inositol phosphate-regulated kinase activity using purified PCTP-like protein as a substrate. The inositol phosphate-regulated kinase activity peaked in fractions 4–6 (data not shown). These fractions were pooled and further fractionated on a mini-Q anion exchange column. The inositol phosphate-regulated kinase activity eluted from this column in fractions 8 and 9 (Fig. 4A). The elution of this kinase activity corresponded exactly with the elution of three protein bands at ∼37, 35, and 25 kDa (Fig. 4B). MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic peptides of the 25-kDa band produced 10 peptides corresponding to 47% of the amino acid sequence that matched exactly with the β-subunit of CK2 (Fig. 4C). This identity was confirmed by LC-MS/MS sequencing of 2 peptides (Fig. 4C, underlined). Similar analysis of 35-kDa bands identified these protein bands as containing a mixture of α- and α′-subunits of CK2. The presence of both α- and α′-subunits was confirmed by LC-MS/MS sequencing for three tryptic peptides (data not shown) and further determined by Western blotting using an antiserum against the α-subunit of CK2 (Fig. 4D). The phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein by CK2 was further confirmed in studies using recombinant PCTP-like protein expressed as a GST fusion protein in kinase reactions with bacterially expressed recombinant CK2 (Fig. 4E). In these experiments, GST was not detectably phosphorylated by recombinant CK2. In contrast, GST-PCTP-like protein was phosphorylated by CK2 in a manner that was sensitive to the presence of IP6 (Fig. 4E). Determination of the Presence of an Inhibitory Regulator of CK2—From the above studies, we would predict that the activity of recombinant bacterially expressed CK2 heterotetramer (rCK2) would be sensitive to inositol phosphates. However, using either PCTP-like protein or α-casein as a substrate, it was found that rCK2 activity was increased only modestly by IP6 (20–60%) and not at all by IP4 (Fig. 5A). In these experiments, rCK2 constitutive activity was very high, a characteristic normally associated with this enzyme. In contrast, the constitutive activity of endogenous CK2 present in the rat supernatant fractions (particularly in the first Resource S fractions) appears low. This conclusion is based on the fact that PCTP-like protein phosphorylation in these fractions is almost undetectable in the absence of inositol phosphates (see Fig. 1). These data suggest the presence of a negative regulator of CK2 that is able to diminish CK2 constitutive activity in these rat liver fractions. We reasoned that, under conditions where CK2 constitutive activity was low (because of the presence of the negative regulator), inositol phosphates were able to increase CK2 catalytic activity, possibly by displacing the negative regulator. To test this possibility, we heat-inactivated fraction 4 from the Resource S column, which appeared to contain CK2 activity in a low basal state (see Fig. 1). This procedure removed endogenous protein kinase activity (Fig. 5, B and C). In the presence of heat-inactivated RS4, it was found that the basal activity of rCK2 was reduced by 83.1% (Fig. 5B). Under these conditions, the addition of IP6 was able to increase rCK2 activity by ∼2.5-fold (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that rCK2 could be regulated in an inositol phosphate-sensitive manner and that this was dependent on low constitutive activity mediated by a heat-insensitive component present in a rat liver supernatant fraction. It was also noted that, during the purification of liver CK2, the ability of the kinase to be regulated by inositol phosphates was labile (see “Experimental Procedures”). A loss of regulation of the liver-purified CK2 was characterized by an increase in the basal catalytic activity and could be minimized only when the purification process was carried out over a short time period. This suggested that the regulator-CK2 interaction was weak and readily lost during purification. This conclusion was supported by the finding that liver-purified CK2, which had lost the ability to be regulated by inositol phosphates, could be restored to a regulated state by the addition of heat-inactivated RS4 (Fig. 5C). This restoration correlated with a decrease in the basal activity observed in the presence of heat-inactivated RS4 (Fig. 5C). Using rCK2 in the presence of heat-inactivated RS4, we were able to test the ability of various inositol phosphates to stimulate rCK2 activity. It was found that IP4, IP5, and IP6 were able to stimulate rCK2 phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein (Fig. 6) and α-casein (data not shown), with IP6 giving the largest response. The lower inositol phosphates (most notably among which is IP3) were unable to stimulate rCK2 activity. Importantly, the control compound IS6 was also unable to stimulate rCK2 activity (Fig. 6). These data are qualitatively similar to the data presented in Fig. 1B and lend further evidence to the fact that CK2 is the inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase responsible for PCTP-like protein phosphorylation in rat liver supernatant fractions. Despite CK2 being one of the first protein kinases to be discovered nearly 50 years ago (20Burnett G. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 969-980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which this ubiquitous kinase is regulated has remained obscure (21Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have demonstrated the existence of an inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase in a rat liver supernatant fraction. Purification of this protein kinase identified it as CK2. We found that the ability of CK2 to be regulated by the inositol phosphates is dependent on the kinase being maintained in a state of low basal activity. This is achieved by a putative negative regulator that co-purifies with CK2. In the presence of the negative regulator, CK2 basal activity is low, and under these conditions, inositol phosphates can increase the catalytic activity of the kinase. These studies provide the first evidence for the existence of a signaling mechanism that controls CK2 activity. CK2 is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that exists as a heterotetramer of two α- and two β-subunits. The α-subunit is the catalytic subunit and is the product of two different genes encoding α and α′. The β-subunit is noncatalytic and is involved in substrate recognition and stabilization of the kinase complex. This heterotetramer can exist containing two identical α-subunits (i.e. α2β2 or α′2β2) or with nonidentical α-subunits (i.e. αα′β2). The ubiquitous expression of CK2 and its pleiotropic nature has led to the suggestion that one-tenth to one-fifth of the eukaryotic phosphoproteome is the result of CK2-mediated phosphorylation (23Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Many of the substrates for CK2 are involved in key dynamic cellular functions, such as gene transcription/translation, cell cycle regulation, and various aspects of signal transduction (23Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, despite CK2 holding a central position in the phosphorylation and regulation of proteins involved in dynamic cellular events, its own activity appears to be unregulated. The apparent constitutive activity of CK2 has prompted the postulation that changes in the phosphorylation status of CK2 substrates would depend on regulated dephosphorylation (24Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Our studies originally set out to determine whether a protein kinase existed that might be directly regulated by inositol phosphates. We investigated whether endogenous protein kinases contained in rat liver supernatant could be stimulated by inositol phosphates. In these experiments, we were relying on the putative inositol phosphate-regulated kinase(s) co-purifying over one chromatography step (i.e. the Resource S column) with their substrate proteins. Using this approach, we identified a 33-kDa protein that was increased in its phosphorylation state by IP4, IP5, and IP6. This protein was identified as PCTP-like protein and was subsequently used in an assay to purify the inositol phosphate-regulated kinase. The final step in purification revealed that the elution of CK2 (identified by mass spectrometry and immunoblots) corresponded with the elution of the inositol phosphate-regulated protein kinase activity. Definitive evidence that CK2 catalytic activity could be regulated by inositol phosphates was obtained by using bacterially expressed recombinant rCK2, which was shown to be regulated by inositol phosphates with a profile (i.e. IP4 < IP5 < IP6) that was the same as that observed for phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein in the early Resource S fractions from rat liver. One of the most unexpected findings to come from our studies was that CK2, contrary to established opinion, can exist in a state where it has very low constitutive activity. In fractions of liver supernatant derived from the first chromatography step, the phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein is low or often undetectable. Only in the presence of inositol phosphates is phosphorylation of PCTP-like protein observed. This would indicate that in these fractions CK2 has very low constitutive, or basal, activity. We reasoned that this may be due to the presence of an endogenous negative regulator in these fractions that is able to inhibit basal CK2 activity. Only in the presence of the negative regulator are inositol phosphates able to increase the catalytic activity of CK2, possibly by simply “displacing” the negative regulator. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that a heat-inactivated fraction containing the putative negative regulator could be used to decrease the constitutive activity of recombinant rCK2 and, in so doing, impart inositol phosphate sensitivity to rCK2. The identity of this negative regulator has yet to be fully established. It is clear, however, that it is not one of the subunits of the kinase heterotetramer, because rCK2 (which consists of human ααβ2) has characteristically high constitutive activity when assayed in the absence of fractions containing the negative regulator. This conclusion is relevant, because there is accumulating evidence pointing to the importance of the noncatalytic β-subunit in modulation of kinase activity as well as substrate specificity and CK2 complex formation (25Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5003-5010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The negative regulator does not appear to be a phosphatase, because the kinase assays were carried out in β-glycerol phosphate to inhibit phosphatase activity and also heat treatment (which would be expected to inactivate phosphatases) had no effect on the negative regulator. Furthermore, it is not a small regulatory molecule that would easily be lost in dialysis. It is important to note that maintaining liver-derived CK2 with low constitutive activity during purification is difficult, suggesting that the regulator-kinase interaction is labile. This point may provide an explanation for the fact that this phenomenon has not been reported before. Further studies are currently in progress to fully establish the molecular identity of the inhibitory regulator of CK2. Any regulatory process for CK2 would have to reflect the ubiquitous nature of this protein kinase and be accessible to a multitude of distinct stimuli that would target the numerous responses influenced by CK2 phosphorylation. The involvement of inositol phosphates as a regulator of CK2 would meet many of the criteria expected of a broad range regulator of cellular function. Of particular interest is the fact that IP4 is able to increase the activity of CK2. This inositol phosphate is the product of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase, which phosphorylates IP3 to IP4 (2Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The large increase in cellular levels of IP3 on the activation of phospholipase C-β, through the stimulation of G-protein coupled receptors, is associated with a sharp increase in the levels of IP4 (27Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2138-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Fisher S.K. Heacock A.M. Seguin E.B. Agranoff B.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 54-63PubMed Google Scholar, 29Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On removal of the stimulus, IP4 is dephosphorylated by the same inositol phosphatase that dephosphorylates IP3, namely inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (30Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that IP4, but not IP3, can regulate the activity of CK2. This suggests that CK2 could be under the regulated control of changes in IP4 and that this process may offer a potential novel signaling pathway for IP4. Whereas IP4 represents a potential second messenger mechanism for the regulation of CK2, our study also demonstrated that IP6 can regulate CK2 activity. In fact, IP6 appears more effective than IP4. In contrast to IP4, IP6 is present in high concentrations (10–60 μm) in all eukaryotic cells (6Pittet D. Schlegel W. Lew D.P. Monod A. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18489-18493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Szwergold B.S. Graham R.A. Brown T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and these levels do not appear to change following cellular stimulation (31Hughes P.J. Michell R.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 383-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, interest in IP6 as a potential regulatory molecule in specific cellular processes has been recently resurrected by studies demonstrating that IP6 can bind with high affinity to a number of proteins involved in endo- and/or exocytosis (10Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 214-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

This growing literature has forced a rethink of the cellular significance of IP6 in a diverse array of cell functions (2Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Our finding that IP6 can regulate CK2 activity adds to this literature and suggests that IP6 may have a signaling role in the direct control of protein phosphorylation. In this study we identified PCTP-like protein as a substrate for CK2. However, the cellular function of PCTP-like protein is currently unknown. With only 17% amino acid identity with the rat phosphatidylcholine transfer protein, it is not clear if PCTP-like protein has any activity associated with lipid transfer between intracellular compartments. It will be interesting to test whether phosphatidylcholine transfer protein or other lipid transfer proteins are also substrates for CK2 and whether the phosphorylation of these proteins are regulated by inositol phosphates. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest that CK2, rather than being constitutively active, exists in a state with low basal activity. In this state, the kinase activity can be controlled by inositol phosphates. In this way, CK2-mediated phosphorylation may be regulated by a signaling process akin to second messenger-regulated protein kinase pathways. We thank Dr. S. J. Mills for some synthetic work and Dr. Katie Ridd for help with the cloning of PCTP-like protein."
https://openalex.org/W1972364582,"SUMO is a small ubiquitin-like protein that becomes covalently conjugated to a variety of target proteins, the large majority of which are found in the nucleus. Ulp1 is a member of a family of proteases that control SUMO function positively, by catalyzing the proteolytic processing of SUMO to its mature form, and negatively, by catalyzing SUMO deconjugation. In Drosophila S2 cells, depletion of Ulp1 by RNA interference results in a dramatic change in the overall spectrum of SUMO conjugates, indicating that SUMO deconjugation is substrate-specific and plays a critical role in determining the steady state targets of SUMO conjugation. Ulp1 normally serves to prevent the accumulation of SUMO-conjugated forms of a number of proteins, including the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase EPRS. In the presence of Ulp1, most SUMO conjugates reside in the nucleus. However, in its absence, SUMO-conjugated EPRS accumulates in the cytoplasm, contributing to an overall shift of SUMO from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The ability of Ulp1 to restrict SUMO conjugates to the nucleus is independent of its role as a SUMO-processing enzyme because Ulp1-dependent nuclear localization of SUMO is even observed when SUMO is expressed in a preprocessed form. Studies of a Ulp1-GFP fusion protein suggest that Ulp1 localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex. We hypothesize that, as a component of the nuclear pore complex, Ulp1 may prevent proteins from leaving the nucleus with SUMO still attached.

The regulation of protein function by reversible post-translational modification is an effective means for regulating protein stability, activity, subcellular localization, and interaction specificity. One such modification involves the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SUMO) 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier protein; NPC, nuclear pore complex; EPRS, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase; MRS, methionyl-tRNA synthetase; MSC, multiaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; ds, double-stranded; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; POD, PML oncogenic domains.1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier protein; NPC, nuclear pore complex; EPRS, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase; MRS, methionyl-tRNA synthetase; MSC, multiaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; ds, double-stranded; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; POD, PML oncogenic domains. (also called Smt3), to its target proteins via a series of enzymatic steps that closely resemble the reactions of the ubiquitylation pathway (1Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T.

Callis J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite the sequence and structural homology between SUMO and ubiquitin, it is clear that sumoylation and ubiquitylation have distinct functional consequences. Ubiquitylation most frequently results in degradation of the substrate protein through targeting to the 26 S proteasome (4Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The consequences of sumoylation are diverse and target-specific, with no evidence to suggest a role in promoting protein degradation. Conjugation of SUMO to RanGAP1 is required to target it to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), where it makes a stable interaction with the Ran-binding protein RanBP2 (5Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T.

Sumoylation of PML is essential for its recruitment to discrete intranuclear foci called PML oncogenic domains (PODs) (8Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A.

For some sumoylation targets, including Smad4 and IκBα, this modification appears to increase protein stability by blocking ubiquitin-mediated degradation (12Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y.

Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Finally, an increasing number of DNA binding transcription factors have been identified as substrates for sumoylation (14Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Freiman R.N. Tjian R. Cell. 2003; 112: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of transcription factors can alter their activity in multiple ways. For example, in the cases of Dorsal, c/EBP, c-Myb, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor, SUMO alters transcription factor activity by modifying an inhibitory domain within the factor (16Kim J.

SUMO is conjugated to its targets through a three-step pathway that is analogous to the ubiquitin conjugation pathway. This pathway requires the heterodimeric SUMO-activating enzyme SAE1/SAE2, which activates the SUMO C terminus, as well as the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which transfers activated SUMO to the final conjugation target (29Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the final conjugate, an isopeptide bond links the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and a lysine side chain in a target protein (6Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 33Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In a number of cases, sumoylation is stimulated by SUMO ligases, which assist Ubc9 in target selection (34Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 35Azuma Y. Dasso M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 130-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). SUMO conjugation is modulated by SUMO-specific proteases. Like ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like modifiers, SUMO is synthesized as an inactive precursor that must be proteolytically processed before it can enter the conjugation pathway (14Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Maturation of SUMO involves the removal of one or more C-terminal amino acids following a Gly-Gly motif. In addition to carrying out this processing reaction, members of the SUMO protease family are responsible for deconjugation of SUMO from its substrates through hydrolysis of the isopeptide linkage. In yeast, two SUMO proteases have been identified, Ulp1 and Ulp2 (36Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 37Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell.

Yeast Ulp1 is an essential gene product that is responsible for both processing SUMO into its active form and deconjugating SUMO from its target proteins (36Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Ulp2 is not required for cell viability and appears to act on a subset of sumoylated substrates that are distinct from the SUMO-conjugated proteins recognized by Ulp1 (37Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 38Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, there are at least six predicted members of the SUMO protease family (1Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 39Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These proteases all contain a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic region and a divergent N terminus that appears to be involved in regulating substrate selection and intracellular localization. Mounting evidence suggests a connection between SUMO conjugation/deconjugation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Yeast Ulp1 and the human SUMO protease SENP2 have both been shown to interact with components of the NPC (38Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40Takahashi Y. Mizoi J. Toh E.A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem.

Dasso M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19961-19966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The nuclear pore component RanBP2 has been shown to function as a SUMO ligase in vertebrates (43Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and vertebrate Ubc9 has been found to localize to the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC (44Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Finally, disruption of the SUMO conjugation machinery in yeast results in impaired cNLS-dependent nuclear protein uptake (45Stade K. Vogel F. Schwienhorst I. Meusser B. Volkwein C. Nentwig B. Dohmen R.J. Sommer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). While most sumoylation targets are nuclear proteins, in this study we identify two primarily cytoplasmic enzymes, namely the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) and methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS), as substrates for sumoylation. In metazoans, about 9 of the ∼20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including EPRS and MRS, associate with one another and additional factors to form an ∼1.5 MDa protein complex termed the multiaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) (46Francklyn C. Perona J.J. Puetz J. Hou Y.M. RNA. 2002; 8: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). While the MSC is primarily localized to the cytoplasm (the site of translation), a small fraction of the MSC is also found in the nucleus (47Nathanson L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31559-31562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that Ulp1 is required to maintain the normal spectrum of SUMO conjugates in Drosophila cells. In untreated S2 cells, the majority of SUMO conjugates reside in the nucleus. However, upon depletion of Ulp1 by RNA interference, a large fraction of SUMO appears in the cytoplasm in the form of high molecular mass SUMO-conjugated proteins, including SUMO-conjugated EPRS. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that Ulp1 is found at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear membrane where it probably associates with nuclear pore complexes. We hypothesize that as a component of the nuclear pores, Ulp1 may deconjugate SUMO-conjugated proteins as they leave the nucleus thereby preventing the escape of SUMO from the nucleus. Antibodies—Antibodies used for immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting are as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5, mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science); mouse monoclonal antibody mAb414 against nuclear pore complex proteins (BAbCO); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2, goat anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate, goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate, goat anti-mouse Cy3 conjugate, sheep anti-mouse FITC conjugate, goat anti-rabbit TRITC conjugate (Sigma); rabbit polyclonal anti-Dorsal; rabbit polyclonal anti-EPRS was raised against Escherichia coli expressed EPRS rep domain; rabbit polyclonal anti-SUMO was raised against E. coli expressed HA-SUMOGG. DNA Constructs and dsRNA Production—In previous publications (18Bhaskar V. Smith M. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Bhaskar V. Valentine S.A. Courey A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4033-4040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we used the term Smt3 for the Drosophila member of the SUMO family. We have now switched to using the term SUMO. Accordingly, “Smt3” has been replaced with “SUMO” in the names of all the constructs. The pRM-Ulp1-GFP vector was created by amplifying the ulp1 cDNA (without the stop codon) from the expressed sequence tag (EST) clone GH02751 by using PCR primers containing XbaI sites and ligating it into the XbaI site of pRM-GFP (48Bhaskar V. Valentine S.A. Courey A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4033-4040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A GST-GFP expression construct was created by amplifying the GFP open reading frame (ORF) from pRM-GFP using primers containing EcoRI (5′) and XhoI (3′) and inserting it into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length SUMO-expressing construct pRM-HA-SUMOFL and preprocessed SUMO-encoding vector pRM-HA-SUMOGG were generated by amplifying each ORF from pGEX-HA-SUMOFL or pGEX-HA-SUMOGG using primers containing a 5′-BamHI site and 3′-SalI site followed by insertion into the pRM-Ha3 vector. The pRM-HA-SUMOΔGG construct was generated by amplifying HA-SUMOΔGG from pPAC-HA-SUMO using primers containing EcoRI (5′) and BamHI (3′), and the resulting fragment was inserted into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pRM-ha3. The pPAC-FLAG-SUMO construct was created by amplifying the full-length SUMO open reading frame from pPAC-HA-SUMO followed by insertion into the SacI site in pPAC-FLAG. Construction of the following vectors has been described previously: pPAC-HA-SAE1, pPAC-HA-SAE2, pPAC-HA-SUMO, pPAC-HA-Ubc9, pRM-HA-Ubc9, pGEX-HA-SUMOGG, pGEX-HA-SUMO-GFP, pPAC-FLAG-Ulp1, pPAC-Dorsal, pPAC-Twist, pDE5–37tkluc, p-37Rluc (18Bhaskar V.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was generated by in vitro transcription (Megascript kit; Ambion) using PCR-derived templates containing flanking T7 promoters. The 720-bp control dsRNA template was created by amplifying the GST ORF from pGEX-4T1 using primers that included the T7 promoter. Similarly, the Lamin Dm0 dsRNA template was generated by amplifying a 740-bp segment from the EST clone LD46046 and the Ulp1 dsRNA template was created by amplifying a 660-bp segment from pPAC-FLAG-Ulp1. SUMO dsRNA was prepared as described previously (18Bhaskar V. Smith M. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All PCR products were generated using Pfu DNA polymerase. Protein Purification and Enzyme Assays—The GST-tagged expression vectors pGEX-HA-SUMOGG, pGEX-HA-SUMO-GFP, pGEX-Ulp1, pGEX-GFP, and pGEX-4T1 were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified on glutathione-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of GST-Ulp1 was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 25 °C for 3 h. GST-HA-SUMOGG, GST-HA-SUMO-GFP, GST-GFP, and GST were expressed by induction with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. GST fusions were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Immobilized GST-GFP was treated with thrombin to yield GFP. The SUMO-processing assays were performed at 30 °C for 6 h and included 150 ng of GST-HA-SUMO-GFP and 350 ng of GST-Ulp1 (or GST). Approximately 150 ng of purified GST-HA-SUMOGG and GFP were included for comparison. The reaction mixtures contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer and were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot (anti-HA and anti-GFP). For the in vitro deconjugation assay, 529SU cells (S2 cells stably transformed with Cu2+ inducible expression constructs encoding HA-Ubc9 and FLAG-SUMO) were treated with 500 μm CuSO4. After a 24-h induction, the cells were pelleted, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and unreacted NEM was consumed by incubation with 2 mm l-cysteine and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 6 h and contained 20 μg of cleared 529SU lysate and 3 μg of crude GST-Ulp1 (or GST) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The reactions were stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to 6 and 12% SDS-PAGE. FLAG-SUMO conjugates and free FLAG-SUMO were visualized by Western blot using the anti-FLAG antibody. Cell Culture, Transfections, and RNAi—Drosophila S2 cells were cultured at 24 °C in Schneiders insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Intermountain Scientific). Transfections were performed on cells growing in 6-well plates, using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Localization of HA-tagged SUMO pathway components was carried out by individually transfecting 250 ng of pPAC-HA-SAE1, pPAC-HA-SAE2, pPAC-HA-Ubc9, or pPAC-HA-SUMO and harvesting cells for immunofluorescence 24 h post-transfection. To visualize the subcellular localization of Ulp1, cells were transfected with 200 ng of pRM-Ulp1-GFP, induced with 500 μm CuSO4 18-h post-transfection, and harvested for fluorescence microscopy 24-h post-induction. In addition, 1.5 μg of lamin Dm0 dsRNA (or 1.5 μg of control dsRNA) was cotransfected with 200 ng of pRM-Ulp1-GFP. Expression of Ulp1-GFP was induced with 500 μm CuSO4 three days post-transfection, and cells were harvested for immunofluorescence microscopy 24 h post-induction. For Ulp1 RNAi experiments, cells were left untreated, transfected with 2 μg of Ulp1 dsRNA, 2 μg of SUMO dsRNA, or 2 μg of control dsRNA and harvested 5 days later. These cells were then either left untreated or were heat-shocked at 37 °C for 1 h and then analyzed by anti-SUMO Western blot. To assess cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 2C), the cells were permeabilized in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NEM, 0.01% digitonin, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The samples were incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. In addition, cells were left untreated or were transfected with 1 μg of control dsRNA or 1 μg of Ulp1 dsRNA and harvested 5 days later for immunofluorescence using the anti-SUMO antibody/TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Also, cells were transfected with 500 ng of pRM-HA-SUMOFL or pRM-HA-SUMOGG with or without 1 μg of Ulp1 dsRNA. SUMO expression was induced with 500 μm CuSO4 3 days post-transfection, cells were harvested 24 h later and subjected to immunofluorescence using the anti-HA antibody/FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. To evaluate sumoylation of Dorsal, 529SU cells were left untreated or were transfected with 1 μg of pPAC-Dorsal in addition to 1 μg of GST dsRNA or 1 μg of Ulp1 dsRNA. The cells were induced with 500 μm CuSO4 24 h post-transfection and harvested 24 h post-induction. The cells were lysed directly in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. For reporter assays each transfection consisted of 500 ng pDE5–37tkluc, 50 ng p-37Rluc (internal control), 3 ng pPAC-Twist, 9 ng pPAC-Dorsal, and the indicated amounts of pRM-HA-Ubc9, pRM-HA-SUMOFL, pRM-HA-SUMOGG, and/or pRM-HA-SUMOΔGG. The luciferase activity was determined by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from cells using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Residual genomic DNA was degraded with RNase-free DNase and RT-PCR was performed using the Access RT-PCR kit (Promega) using primers specific for ulp1, dorsal, or sumo mRNA. Identification of FLAG-SUMO Conjugates—S2 cells were transfected with the pPAC-FLAG-SUMO expression vector. Two days later, cells were harvested and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. The immunoprecipitate was fractionated by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and anti-FLAG immunoblotting. Coomassie Blue-stained bands that appeared in the presence of transfected FLAG-SUMO (see Fig. 2A) were excised, and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. Tryptic peptide masses determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE-RP operated in the delayed extraction and Reflector mode) were used to search the Drosophila data base (51Fernandez J. Gharahdaghi F. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). p200 and p120 matched Drosophila EPRS (CG5394 protein in the Drosophila genome data base) and Drosophila MRS (CG15100 protein in the Drosophila genome data base), respectively, each with greater than 99% probability. Unambiguous identifications were not obtained for p140 and p160. N-terminal Edman degradation sequencing (Applied Biosystems Procise cLC sequencer) of HPLC-purified tryptic peptides confirmed the identification of p200 and p120. Four tryptic peptides from the p200 digest were sequenced and found to match predicted EPRS tryptic fragments, and four tryptic peptides from the p120 digest were sequenced and found to match predicted MRS tryptic fragments. Additional evidence in support of the identifications was provided by the apparent SDS-PAGE molecular masses of p200 and p120, which agree to within 5–10% with the calculated molecular masses of EPRS and MRS after correction for the mass of a single SUMO adduct. Furthermore, the identity of EPRS as a SUMO-conjugated protein was confirmed by probing Western blots of Drosophila cells before and after heat shock, before and after SUMO/Ubc9 overexpression, and before and after Ulp1 or SUMO RNAi with anti-EPRS and anti-SUMO antibodies (see Fig. 2, C, D, E, and F). Fluorescence Microscopy and Western Blotting—For fluorescence microscopy, S2 cells were attached to poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips and fixed in methanol at –20 °C for 10 min. In Fig. 5, C and D, Ulp1-GFP or GFP-expressing cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilized either by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice or by incubation with 10 μg/ml digitonin for 10 min on ice. The cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three additional PBS washes, the cells were incubated with the indicated fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. DNA staining was performed by incubating the cells with 500 ng/ml DAPI for 15 min. Following three additional PBS washes, the coverslips were dried briefly and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope. Images were acquired with an Optronics cooled CCD camera and captured with Adobe Photoshop. In addtion, Ulp1-GFP was also visualized in unfixed S2 cells using a Bio-Rad MRC laser scanning confocal microscope and images were processed using Confocal Assistant software. For Western blotting, samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 10 min and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked for 1 h using 1% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) in TBS, and subsequent steps were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were processed by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to ECL hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences).

https://openalex.org/W2141961630,"Little is known about the role of the integrin-associated protein (IAP, or CD47) in neuronal development and its function in the central nervous system. We investigated neuronal responses in IAP-overexpressing cortical neurons using a virus-gene transfer system. We found that dendritic outgrowth was significantly enhanced in IAP (form 4)-transfected neurons. Furthermore, synaptic proteins including synaptotagmin, syntaxin, synapsin I, and SNAP25 (25-kDa synaptosomal associated protein) were up-regulated. In accordance with this finding, the release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate and the frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations (glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission) were increased. Interestingly, the overexpression of IAP activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and this activation was required for the IAP-dependent biological effects. After down-regulation of the endogenous IAP by small interfering RNA, MAPK activity, synaptic protein levels, and glutamate release decreased. These observations suggest that the IAP plays important roles in dendritic outgrowth and synaptic transmission in developing cortical neurons through the activation of MAPK.

Growing evidence has suggested that cell adhesion proteins and associated proteins such as the neural cell adhesion molecule, cadherin, and integrins play an important role in the formation, maintenance, and function of synapses (1Uchida N.

(5Chan C.S. Weeber E.J. Kurup S. Sweatt J.D. Davis R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7107-7116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that many different integrins, including α3 and α5, are expressed in the brain and are associated with synapses. In contrast, little is known about integrin-associated protein (IAP) 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, integrin-associated protein; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; DIV, days in vitro; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SNAP25, 25-kDa synaptosomal associated protein; TUJ1, class III β-tubulin. -dependent regulation in neuronal function, although IAP physically associates with integrins including α2β1, αVβ3, and αIIbβ3 (6Gao A.G.

Blood. 1999; 94: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of IAP in non-neuronal cell populations has been well studied. For example, IAP plays an essential role in host defense by participating in the migration and activation of leukocytes in response to bacterial infection (9Lindberg F.P. Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D. Beaudet A.L. Brown E.J. Science. 1996; 274: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). IAP is a receptor for the C-terminal cell-binding domain of thrombospondin (10Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thrombospondin stimulates the integrin-dependent adhesion, spreading, and motility of endothelial cells, leukocytes, and smooth muscle cells (10Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D.

Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IAP is a ligand for the transmembrane signal-regulatory protein (12Seiffert M. Brossart P. Cant C. Cella M. Colonna M. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ullrich A. Buhring H.-J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and is involved in macrophage function. In platelets, a peptide from the C-terminal cell-binding domain of thrombospondin induces aggregation (13Dorahy D.J. Thorne R.F. Fecondo J.V. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1323-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and spreading on immobilized fibrinogen or collagen (7Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that IAP is involved in neuronal function. Memory retention and long-term potentiation were reduced in IAP-deficient mice (14Chang H.P. Lindberg F.P. Wang H.L. Huang A.M. Lee E.H. Learn. Mem. 1999; 6: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody to IAP significantly impaired memory retention and reduced the amplitude of long-term potentiation in dentate gyrus neurons (15Chang H.P. Ma Y.L. Wan F.J. Tsai L.Y. Lindberg F.P. Lee E.H. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, little is known as to the possible effects of IAP on neuronal development and function at the molecular level. In the present study, we investigated the roles of IAP in cultured cortical neurons with respect to dendritic outgrowth, neurotransmitter release, and the underlying intracellular signal transduction. There are four alternatively spliced forms of IAP that differ only at their intracytoplasmic carboxyl termini (16Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Plas D. Reynolds S. Peters M.G. Brown E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we focused on the effects of IAP form 4 because it is an abundant isoform expressed primarily in neurons (17Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). By using overexpressing IAP through virus-mediated gene transfer, we found that dendritic outgrowth was significantly enhanced. Synaptic proteins including synaptotagmin, synapsin I, SNAP25, and syntaxin were up-regulated. Glutamate release and Ca2+ oscillations, which are glutamate-mediated spontaneous synaptic transmissions (18Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in cortical neurons, were reinforced by overexpression. These IAP-induced effects required activation of the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, MAPK activity, synaptic protein expression, and glutamate release were decreased after down-regulation of endogenous IAP by small interfering RNA (siRNA), suggesting that IAP is important to synaptic function in developing cortical neurons. Cell Culture—Dissociated cortical cultures were prepared from a postnatal 2- or 3-day-old rat (SLC, Sizuoka, Japan) cortex as described previously (18Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cortical neurons were plated at a density of 5 × 105/cm2 on polyethyleneimine-coated plates (Corning) or cover glasses (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) attached to flexiPERM (In Vitro Systems and Services, Osterode, Germany). The culture medium consisted of 5% precolostrum newborn calf serum, 5% heated-inactivated horse serum, and a 90% mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 15 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 30 nm Na2SeO3, and 1.9 mg/ml NaHCO3. Preparation of Synaptosomes—Synaptosomes were prepared according to a previous report (19Ishimoto T. Fujimori K. Kasai M. Taguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The cerebral cortex was removed under anesthesia. Cortex sections were rinsed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (0.35 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) using a loose fitting potter homogenizer. Homogenate was centrifuged for 1 min at 2,000 × g, and the supernatant was recentrifuged for 5 min at 23,000 × g (P2 fraction). This pellet was resuspended with buffer A and transferred to a discontinuous gradient of 15 and 5% Ficoll in buffer A. After centrifugation at 43,000 × g, synaptosomes were collected from the 5 to 15% interface. All of these procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Viral Constructs—The Sindbis virus, a bicistronic vector plasmid (pSinEGdsp), was provided by Dr. Kawamura (Niigata University, Niigata, Japan). The plasmid was derived from pSinRep5 (Invitrogen) and had two subgenomic promoters followed by a multiple cloning site for an arbitrary gene insertion and an enhanced GFP open reading frame; thus, the virus can produce arbitrary protein and enhanced GFP independently in the infected cell (20Kawamura M. Namba H. Otsu Y. Hayashi Y. Takei N. Nawa H. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Neurochemistry. 6. Research Signpost Inc., Kerala, India2003: 105-120Google Scholar). IAP form 4 cDNA, amplified by reverse transcription PCR with specific primers (5′-AATTTTCTAGAATGTGGCCCTTGGCGGCGGC-3′ and 5′-TATATGCATGCTTATTCGTCATTCATCATCCC-3′), was inserted into the XbaI and SphI sites of the multiple cloning site. The plasmid was linearized by PacI, and mRNA was synthesized in vitro using an mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Subsequently, baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with the mRNA and 26 S helper mRNA by electroporation (1250 V/cm, 50 μF, single pulse) using Gene Pulser2 (Bio-Rad). The cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum for 24 h at 37 °C, and the supernatant was collected as the pseudovirion-containing solution. Adenovirus—cDNAs of nuclear localization signal-possessing LacZ, Myc/His-tagged rat IAP form 4 were subcloned into the SwaI site of the cosmid vector pAxCAwt under the control of the CAG promoter (21Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar, 22Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). These cosmid vectors and the EcoT221-digested DNA-terminal protein complex of Ad5-dlX, which is a human type 5 adenovirus lacking the E3 region, were cotransfected into HEK 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. The recombinant adenoviruses AxCAANLS-LacZ and AxCAAIAP-Myc/His, generated by homologous recombination in HEK 293 cells, were isolated. As the recombinant adenoviruses did not contain the E1A region, PCR amplification of this region was performed to ensure no contamination by the wild-type adenovirus (Ad5-dlX). The recombinant adenoviruses, which showed no PCR amplification of E1A, were used. These adenoviruses were propagated in HEK 293 cells and purified by cesium gradient centrifugation. The viral titer was determined by a plaque-forming assay on HEK 293 cells. The viral infection was carried out at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Immunocytochemistry—Cultured neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Neurons were permeabilzed with 0.2% Triton-X in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. Then, primary antibodies (anti-MAP2 (1:2000) from Sigma and anti-synaptotagmin (1:1500) from Calbiochem) with 1% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline were applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor, Molecular Probes) were applied for 1 h at 4 °C. Fluorescent images were captured by an inverted microscope (TE300, Nikon) with a monochrome charge-coupled device camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu) or a microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) with a charge-coupled device (cool SNAPfx, Zeiss). Monochrome images were turned into color and analyzed using software (AQUACOSMOS from Hamamatsu or Slide Book™ 3.0 from Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). The images of GFP were analyzed with the same software. Detection of Amino Acid Neurotransmitters—The amount of amino acids released from neurons was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) as reported (23Numakawa T. Yokomaku D. Kiyosue K. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Numakawa Y. Taguchi T. Hatanaka H. Yamada M. J. Biol.

To induce exocytosis in neurons, we used a high KCl (HK+) solution consisting of 85 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Before HK+ (1 min) stimulation, basal fractions (1 min) were collected. U0126, an inhibitor of MEK (upstream of MAPK), was purchased from Promega. The experiments were performed at least four times with independent cultures to confirm reproducibility. Representative data from a sister culture (n indicates the number of wells of a plate) are shown in Figs. 1 and 5.Fig. 5Activation of the MAPK pathway in cultured neurons with IAP overexpression.A, basal activity of MAPK/ERK (p44 or p42) was significantly increased by IAP overexpression. Section a, the time course of MAPK activation (pERK, phosphorylated ERK) in IAP/GFP-infected cultures.

B, no change in Akt activation (pAkt) was observed in IAP-overexpressing cultures. Furthermore, IAP overexpression did not activate the BDNF receptor TrkB (pTrkB). The expression of TUJ1 was not altered. The data from 24 h after infection are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ca2+Imaging—Ca2+ imaging was carried out as reported (18Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on polyethyleneimine-coated cover glasses (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) attached to flexiPERM. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μm Fluo-3 AM. The dye intensity was monitored using a confocal laser microscope (TMD-300 controlled by RCM 8000; Nikon) or fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200 controlled by the Slide Book™ 3.0, Zeiss). The emitted fluorescence was guided through a 20× or 40× objective. Image data were obtained every 2 or 4 s. The data were stored and analyzed with RCM 8000 or Slide Book™ 3.0. All imaging experiments were performed at least four times with separate cultures. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8), 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylarsine oxide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (23Numakawa T. Yokomaku D. Kiyosue K. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Numakawa Y. Taguchi T. Hatanaka H. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28861-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the measurement of exogenous IAP on adenovirus gene transfer, tagged Myc protein was detected. Incubation with 0.2 μg/ml anti-Myc monoclonal antibody diluted with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 containing 1% (w/v) skim milk was performed for 12 h at 4 °C. Furthermore, immunoblottings were carried out with the anti-synaptotagmin antibody (1:1000, mouse monoclonal; BD Transduction Laboratories), the anti-synapsin I antibody (1:1000, rabbit anti-serum; Chemicon), the anti-syntaxin antibody (1:3000, mouse monoclonal; Sigma), the anti-SNAP25 antibody (1:3000, mouse monoclonal; Synaptic System), the anti-GFP antibody (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), the anti-IAP antibody (1:1000, goat polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the anti-Bad antibody (1:500, mouse monoclonal; BD Transduction Laboratories), the anti-Bcl-2 antibody (1:500, mouse monoclonal; BD Transduction Laboratories), and the anti-TUJ1 antibody (1:5000, mouse monoclonal; Berkeley Antibody Company). In addition, the anti-phospho-Trk antibody (1:1000) was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc., whereas the anti-Akt (1:1000) and anti-phospho-Akt (1:1000) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-Trk (1:1000), anti-MAPK (1:1000), and anti-phospho-MAPK (1:1000) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. To quantify the amount of MAPK after Western blotting, we measured the density of immunoblots with image analysis software (Science Lab 98 Image Gauge, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). siRNA Transfection—The siRNA transfections were performed as reported (25Numakawa T. Nakayama H. Suzuki S. Kubo T. Nara F. Numakawa Y. Yokomaku D. Araki T. Ishimoto T. Ogura A. Taguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41259-41269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We used 23-nucleotide siRNA duplexes with two 3′-overhanging nucleotides of the rat IAP mRNA coding region (5′-AATGACACTGTGGTCATCCCTTG-3′). Both sense and antisense strands were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. The siRNA (5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG-3′, named Scramble II (Dharmacon Research Inc.) was used as a control. Transfection of both siRNAs (final 2 mg/ml) was performed using NeuroPORTER™ (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.). We carried out the siRNA transfer 48 or 72 h prior to the glutamate release assay or the collecting of samples for immunoblotting. The transfection was performed at 3 or 4 days after the initiation of cortical cultures. Endogenous IAP Increases during Neuronal Maturation and Exists in Synapses—We first examined the change in the expression of endogenous IAP during neuronal development. We determined IAP levels in cultured cortical neurons prepared from postnatal 2-3-day-old rats during maturation in vitro from DIV 3 (i.e. 3 days in vitro) to DIV 11. To estimate synaptic maturation, the synaptic proteins synapsin I, SNAP25, and syntaxin were also quantified. There was a large increase in IAP, synapsin I, and SNAP25 expression from DIV 3 to DIV 5, followed by increase until DIV 11 (Fig. 1A). Syntaxin also increased (Fig. 1A). TUJ1 (class III β-tubulin) was examined as a neuronal marker (Fig. 1A). Synaptosomes from the adult rat cortex contained IAP (section a in Fig. 1B). The expression of IAP in the synaptosomes increased during brain maturation (postnatal days 15 to adulthood) (section b in Fig. 1B). IAP Enhances Dendritic Outgrowth in Developing Cortical Neurons—We examined whether IAP was involved in the dendritic outgrowth of cultured cortical neurons using a Sindbis virus-mediated IAP overexpression system. The transfection of IAP was performed 1 h after the plating of the cells. Eighteen hours later, we observed dendritic outgrowth (Fig. 2A). The outgrowth was markedly enhanced in IAP-infected neurons (section b in Fig. 2A), but no such effect was observed in GFP-infected neurons (control) (section a in Fig. 2A). A Sindbis virus vector that had the GFP gene only was used as a control. The percentage of cells that had dendrites twice the length of the diameter of the cell body was determined (section c in Fig. 2A). The result indicated that IAP markedly enhances dendritic outgrowth in developing cortical neurons. Furthermore, we assessed the number of dendrites from IAP- or control virus (GFP only)-infected neurons. At 24 h (DIV 2) after the viral infection (DIV 1), the IAP-infected neurons had many more dendrites than did the control neurons (sections a and b in Fig. 2B). The number of primary dendrites (from the cell body) that were four times the length of the cell diameter or longer was significantly increased (section c in Fig. 2B). A similar difference was recognized in the number of intersections of dendrites and a circle with a radius twice as long as the shortest diameter of the cell body (section d in Fig. 2B). In contrast, the dendritic outgrowth of IAP-overexpressing mature neurons infected at DIV 14 was not enhanced (the primary dendrite number 48 h after infection for GFP (control) was 7.40 ± 1, and for IAP it was 7.32 ± 1.34, n = 78, where n indicates the cell number selected from three independent cultures). In this assay, the number of axons was excluded (see supplementary Fig. 1 in the on-line version of this article). Presynaptic Sites Are Increased by IAP Overexpression—To determine the presynaptic sites, we performed immunostaining with an anti-synaptotagmin antibody (shown as a red presynaptic marker in Fig. 3, A and B,section a), an anti-MAP2 antibody (shown as a blue dendritic marker in Fig. 3, A and B,section b), and a GFP (shown as green axons in Fig. 3, A and B,section c). The number of terminals of presynapses (synaptotagmin and GFP double-positive vesicle-like buttons on MAP2-positive neurons) was increased by IAP overexpression (see sections c in Fig. 3, A (control) and B (IAP/GFP-infected)). Plots of the data obtained from 46 sections (per 50-μm section of dendrites) are shown in Fig. 3C. In this experiment, the glutamatergic terminals were predominant (see supplementary Fig. 2 in the on-line version of this article). The MAP2-positive, GFP-non-positive neurons were chosen as postsynapse neurons. Presynaptic Function Is Increased by IAP Overexpression—To see presynaptic function, we performed a highly concentrated viral infection and confirmed that 80% of all cells were GFP-positive (Fig. 4A). The proportion of GFP-positive neurons in control- and in IAP-infected cultures was similar, that is, GFP-positive/MAP2-positive cells per field was 80 ± 16% for controls and 78.4 ± 14% for IAP overexpression (n = 9 for both cell groups). After infection, we determined the expression of presynaptic proteins, because such proteins are essential for exocytotic transmitter release. As expected, the levels of synaptotagmin, synapsin I, syntaxin, and SNAP25 were significantly increased in IAP-overexpressing cells as compared with the control cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that IAP enhances the presynaptic machinery. The infection efficiency was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4B). It was also confirmed that IAP was overexpressed (Fig. 4B). No significant change in TUJ1 (negative control) and GFP expression was observed following control or IAP infection (Fig. 4B). The up-regulation of synaptic proteins suggested that neuro-transmitter release increases with IAP. We went on to measure glutamate, an excitatory transmitter, in cortical cultures. The amount of basal glutamate from IAP-infected neurons was increased at 24 h after infection at DIV 4 compared with the uninfected cells (section a in Fig. 4C). In contrast, the basal release of glutamate in control-infected cultures was no different from that in uninfected cultures, indicating that IAP overexpression results in an elevation of glutamate release (section a in Fig. 4C). We also measured HK+ (high potassium, 50 mm KCl)-evoked glutamate release and found that the release was enhanced in IAP-infected cultures at 24 h after infection (section a in Fig. 4C). Both the basal release and the HK+-evoked release were also enhanced by IAP at 48 h after infection (section b in Fig. 4C). In contrast, an inhibitory transmitter, GABA, was unchanged (section c in Fig. 4C), suggesting that IAP might be specifically involved in the excitatory transmission. In these experiments, the highly concentrated viral infection did not influence the survival of cultured cortical neurons (see supplementary Fig. 3 in the on-line version of this article). IAP Activates the MAPK Pathway—We then investigated the intracellular signal transduction necessary for the effects of IAP. We examined the possible involvement of ERK (p44/42 MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathways, because these pathways have important roles in synaptic transmission (23Numakawa T. Yokomaku D. Kiyosue K. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Numakawa Y. Taguchi T. Hatanaka H. Yamada M. J. Biol.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found that the basal activity of MAPK (phosphorylated ERK, activated MAPK form) was significantly increased in IAP-infected cultures at 24 and 36 h after infection (section a in Fig. 5A). In contrast, the activation of MAPK in control-infected cultures was not different from that in uninfected cultures (sections b and c in Fig. 5A). Quantification of the level of activated MAPK at 24 h after viral infection was carried out (section d in Fig. 5A). No significant change in the level of non-activated MAPK was observed following control or IAP infection (section e in Fig. 5A). The PI 3-kinase pathway (pAkt and Akt) was not activated (Fig. 5B). Neurotrophins play a fundamental role in the support of survival, development and the regulation of neuronal transmission and plasticity (30Lindholm D. Dechant G. Heisenberg C.P. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 31Minichiello L. Klein R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2849-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 32Schwartz P.M.

However, when the activation of the BDNF-specific TrkB receptor was examined, the overexpression of IAP did not activate TrkB (Fig. 5B). Thus, the involvement of BDNF in the IAP-dependent effect was unlikely. These results suggested that the MAPK pathway is important for IAP-induced biological effects. We tested the effect of U0126 (an inhibitor of MEK upstream of MAPK) on the IAP-enhanced glutamate release. The IAP-enhanced release was completely suppressed (section a in Fig. 6A). The inhibitory effect of U0126 on MAPK activation was confirmed (section b in Fig. 6A). IAP-induced dendritic outgrowth was also blocked by U0126 (Fig. 6B). These results indicated that the IAP-enhanced glutamate release and dendrite outgrowth require the activation of the MAPK pathway. Spontaneous Glutamatergic Transmission Is Reinforced in IAP-infected Cortical Neurons—As described above, overexpression of IAP enhanced the outgrowth of dendrites, the expression of synaptic proteins, and the release of glutamate, suggesting that IAP influences glutamatergic transmission. Then, we monitored Ca2+ oscillations in developing cortical neurons. Spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations appear to affect processes that are central to the development and plasticity of the central nervous system, and several patterns of Ca2+ dynamics are known (35Ogura A.

https://openalex.org/W2046087785,"Human xylosyltransferase I (XT-I) is the initial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycan linker region in proteoglycans. Here, we tested the importance of the DXD motifs at positions 314–316 and 745–747 for enzyme activity and the nucleotide binding capacity of human XT-I. Mutations of the 314DED316 motif did not have any effect on enzyme activity, whereas alterations of the 745DWD747 motif resulted in reduced XT-I activity. Loss of function was observed after exchange of the highly conserved aspartic acid at position 745 with glycine. However, mutation of Asp745 to glutamic acid retained full enzyme activity, indicating the importance of an acidic amino acid at this position. Reduced substrate affinity was observed for mutants D747G (Km = 6.9 μm) and D747E (Km = 4.4 μm) in comparison with the wild-type enzyme (Km = 0.9 μm). Changing the central tryptophan to a neutral, basic, or acidic amino acid resulted in a 6-fold lower Vmax, with Km values comparable with those of the wild-type enzyme. Despite the major effect of the DWD motif on XT-I activity, nucleotide binding was not abolished in the D745G and D747G mutants, as revealed by UDP-bead binding assays. Ki values for inhibition by UDP were determined to be 1.9–24.6 μm for the XT-I mutants. The properties of binding of XT-I to heparin-beads, the Ki constants for noncompetitive inhibition by heparin, and the activation by protamine were not altered by the generated mutations.

Glycosyltransferases represent a large group of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the highly variable sugar structures found in bacteria, plants, and animal cells. They transfer activated sugars, such as UDP-sugars, to specific acceptor molecules, which can be proteins, sugars, or lipids. In the last decade, a large number of glycosyltransferases involved in many biosynthetic pathways have been cloned (1Fukuda M. Bierhuizen M.F. Nakayama J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the structural properties and catalytic mechanisms is still challenging and complex, as the glycosyltransferases share virtually no sequence homology. But most eukaryotic glycosyltransferases cloned to date show a common protein structure, as they are type II transmembrane proteins localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (2Joziasse D.H. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One large group of glycosylated proteins found in animal cells is the proteoglycans. These abundant glycoproteins are polyanionic molecules present in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface and serve a wide range of functions. Proteoglycans are increasingly implicated as important regulators in many biological processes, such as extracellular matrix deposition, cell membrane signal transfer, morphogenesis, cell migration, normal and tumor cell growth, and viral infection (4Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys.

Virol. 1994; 75: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans mediate diverse cellular processes through interaction with a variety of protein ligands. Electrostatic interactions with the glycosaminoglycan chains attached to the core protein are involved in most of these bindings (7Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological activity of proteoglycans is intimately related to glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. The sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin, and dermatan sulfate are bound to the proteoglycan core protein by a xylose-galactose-galactose binding region (7Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Xylosyltransferase I (XT-I 1The abbreviations used are: XT-I, xylosyltransferase I; XT-II, xylosyltransferase II; rXT-I, recombinant xylosyltransferase I; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; contig, group of overlapping clones. ; EC 2.4.2.26) is the chain-initiating enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan-containing proteoglycans (8Schwartz N.B.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7477-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of d-xylose from UDP-d-xylose to specific serine residues of the core protein and is a regulatory factor in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (10Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 269-314Google Scholar). XT-I activity was found to be present in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of various species (11Hoffmann H.P. Schwartz N.B. Roden L. Prockop D.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1984; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and we have shown that the enzyme is secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum into the extracellular space together with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (12Götting C.

As XT-I is the initial enzyme in the biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycan linkage region (10Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 269-314Google Scholar) and as it is secreted into the extracellular matrix to a great extent, XT-I activity was proposed to be a diagnostic marker for the determination of enhanced proteoglycan biosynthesis and tissue destruction (13Weilke C. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). XT-I activities in synovial fluid were found to be significantly increased in chronic inflammatory joint diseases (14Kleesiek K. Reinards R. Okusi J. Wolf B. Greiling H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1987; 25: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies have shown that serum XT-I activity is a confirmed biochemical marker for the determination of fibrotic activity in systemic sclerosis (12Götting C. Sollberg S. Kuhn J. Weilke C.

Kuhn J. Tinneberg H.R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 8: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, we purified human XT-I from 2000 liters of culture supernatant conditioned by JAR choriocarcinoma cells (17Kuhn J. Götting C. Schnölzer M. Kempf T. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and cloned the corresponding mammalian XT-I cDNAs (18Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we identified another gene in the mammalian genomes coding for a novel protein, which was shown to be highly homologous to XT-I (18Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic activity of this protein, which was termed xylosyltransferase II (XT-II), is not yet known. To date, little structural information is available concerning the catalytic site of XT-I. Recently, a DXD motif was found to be conserved in 13 families of glycosyltransferases (19Breton C.

Biol. 2000; 10: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The DXD motif in glycosyltransferases was proposed to be involved in the coordination of a divalent metal ion that is required for the binding of the nucleotide-sugar (21Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro S. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, mutations of the DXD motif in the Fringe signaling molecule did not alter photolabeling by a UDP analog, but did eliminate the biological activity of Fringe (25Munro S. Freeman M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These findings, which were supported by other studies (26Li J. Rancour D.M. Allende M.L. Worth C.A. Darling D.S. Gilbert J.B. Menon A.K. Young Jr., W.W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that not all DXD motifs are functionally equivalent. Amino acid sequence analysis of mammalian XT-I revealed two DXD motifs located in the N- and C-terminal regions of this glycosyltransferase. In this study, we analyzed the importance of these motifs for the enzyme activity of human XT-I. We mutated residues within both DXD motifs to determine their importance to XT-I activity and nucleotide binding. Our results show that the DXD motif at positions 745–747 is required for obtaining full enzyme activity, but is not critical for the binding of UDP.

PCR Amplification and Cloning of Human XT-I cDNA—Synthetic oligonucleotide primers including 5′-HindIII and 3′-XbaI restriction sites (upper primer, 5′-gcaagcttagacagcaacaacgag-3′; and lower primer, 5′-gagtctagacctgagccggccatc-3′, with restriction sites underlined) were designed based on the XT-I cDNA sequence (18Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The primers were used to amplify the XT-I cDNA (2434 bp) from pCG227 (18Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) under standard PCR conditions with Pfu DNA polymerase. The resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and inserted into the HindIII/XbaI sites of plasmid pMIB-V5-A, resulting in pCG255-1. The constructed pCG255-1 plasmid encodes a soluble form of an XT-I/V5 epitope fusion protein and was transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli TOP10 cells. Clones containing the correct vector were identified by single and double restriction digestion, followed by agarose gel analysis, and were confirmed by double-strand DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI 310 DNA sequencing system with the dye terminator cycle sequencing kit. Multiple clones were sequenced to compensate for misreading. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Codons were altered using a method based on the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The sequences of the sense and antisense mutated primers are indicated in Table I, and the constructed vectors are listed in Table II. Mutated DNA was double strand-sequenced to confirm the single codon change and to ensure that no additional changes were introduced. The various mutants were individually expressed in High Five insect cells as described below. At least two vectors encoding each XT-I variant and two independent transfection experiments were performed for the analysis of these mutants. In addition, all vectors encoding XT-I variants with altered enzyme activity were remodified to the wild-type enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. These revertants were then expressed in High Five insect cells to ensure full restoration of enzyme activity.Table IPrimers used for the generation of the mutated vectors derived from pCG255-1PrimerSequenceMutationXTGly3Up5′-CAACAAGAACGTGCAGTGGGGCGAGGACTCCG-3′D314GXTGly3Lo5′-CGGAGTCCTCGCCCCACTGCACGTTCTTGTTG-3′D314GXTGly4Up5′-TGCAGTGGGACGAGGGCTCCGTGGAGTACATG-3′D316GXTGly4Lo5′-CATGTACTCCACGGAGCCCTCGTCCCACTGCA-3′D316GXTGly1Up5′-TCCGAGGTCGGCACTGGCTGGGATGCCAAGGAGAG-3′D745GXTGly1Lo5′-CTCTCCTTGGCATCCCAGCCAGTGCCGACCTCGGA-3′D745GXT1E1Up5′-GAGGTCGGCACTGAATGGGATG-3′D745EXT1E1Lo5′-CATCCCATTCAGTGCCGACCTC-3′D745EXTTrp10U5′-CTGACGACGATGCCAAGGAGAGG-3′W746DXTTrp11L5′-CCTCTCCTTGGCATCGTCGTCAG-3′W746DXTTrp12U5′-CTGACAACGATGCCAAGGAGAGG-3′W746NXTTrp13L5′-CCTCTCCTTGGCATCGTTGTCAG-3′W746NXTTrp14U5′-CTGACGGGGATGCCAAGGAGAGG-3′W746GXTTrp15L5′-CCTCTCCTTGGCATCCCCGTCAG-3′W746GXTGly2Up5′-GGCACTGACTGGGGTGCCAAGGAGAGGCTATTCCG-3′D747GXTGly2Lo5′-CGGAATAGCCTCTCCTTGGCACCCCAGTCAGTGCC-3′D747GXT1E2Up5′-GAGGTCGGCACTGAATGGGAAG-3′D747EXT1E2Lo5′-CTTCCCATTCAGTGCCGACCTC-3′D747E Open table in a new tab Table IIPlasmids used in this study and their relevant propertiesPlasmidRelevant propertypCG255Modified insect expression vector pMIB-V5-His for expression of soluble rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG256pCG255 encoding D314G in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG259pCG255 encoding D316G in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG253pCG255 encoding D745G in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG276pCG255 encoding D745E in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG263pCG255 encoding W746D in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG261pCG255 encoding W746N in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG262pCG255 encoding W746G in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG254pCG255 encoding D747G in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-HispCG279pCG255 encoding D747E in rXT-I-(Δ1-148)-V5-His Open table in a new tab Heterologous Expression in High Five Insect Cells—Insect cell expression was done in High Five insect cells grown in Xpress medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml gentamycin. Transient expression experiments of the recombinant XT-I (rXT-I) variants were performed in 3-ml High Five insect cell cultures (2 × 106 cells) seeded in a 60-mm tissue culture plate, transfected with each recombinant pMIB-V5-His vector, and grown at 27 °C. At 48 h post-transfection, the culture medium containing the recombinant protein was collected and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 × g. The supernatant was enriched 50-fold by ultrafiltration using Microcon 3000 tubes, and the XT-I/V5 epitope fusion proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. A stable High Five/pCG255-1 insect cell clone expressing rXT-I-(Δ1–148)-V5-His was generated as described in detail (28Kuhn J. Müller S. Schnölzer M. Kempf T. Schön S. Brinkmann T. Schöttler M. Götting C. Kleesiek K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Recombinant Bikunin—Recombinant bikunin was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) as described previously (29Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The purified protein was then used as an acceptor in the XT-I activity assay. XT-I Activity Assay—The method for determination of XT-I activity is based on the incorporation of d-[14C]xylose with recombinant bikunin as the acceptor. The reaction mixture for the assay contained, in a total volume of 100 μl, 50 μl of XT-I solution, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm KF, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1.0 μm UDP-d-[14C]xylose, and 1.5 μm recombinant bikunin (13Weilke C. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were placed on nitrocellulose discs. After drying, the discs were washed for 10 min with 10% trichloroacetic acid and three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. Incorporated radioactivity was quantified after the addition of 5 ml of scintillation mixture using a LS5000TD liquid scintillation counter. Enzyme activity is expressed in units (1 unit = 1 μmol of incorporated xylose/min). The linear range of the XT-I activity assay was determined as 0.02–3.5 milliunits/liter (13Weilke C. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To measure within the linear range, samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1% human serum albumin. The assay linearity and dilution procedure were validated using an enriched human XT-I solution prepared as described previously (30Götting C. Kuhn J. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Protein Chem. 1998; 17: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of effectors on XT-I activity, commercial preparations were used: heparin and pharmaceutical heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa and protamine sulfate from salmon. To investigate the influence of UDP, the samples were incubated with the effecting reagents for 1 min, and XT-I activity was then assayed as described above. For quantification of the Michaelis-Menten constants for xylosylation of bikunin by different XT-I mutants, various concentrations of the acceptor protein were incubated with rXT-I-containing solutions and UDP-[14C]xylose under assay conditions. The transfer rates were measured as a function of the acceptor concentrations, and Km and Vmax values were calculated on the basis of nonlinear regression analysis. For the determination of the interaction of heparin (mean molecular mass of 15,000 Da) and UDP with the XT-I mutants, the apparent Km and Vmax values with and without the addition of inhibitor at different concentrations were used to calculate the Ki values. Determination of Total Protein Concentration—The total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. Free amino acids in the samples were removed prior to protein determination by ultrafiltration with Microcon 3000 tubes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody Production—Anti-XT-I antibodies were produced as described previously (17Kuhn J. Götting C. Schnölzer M. Kempf T. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the synthetic peptides CSRQKELLKRKLEQQEK and CQFSEVGTDWDAKER (deduced from the XT-I sequence) were synthesized, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used for immunization. Rabbit anti-XT-I IgG polyclonal antibody was prepared by injection of the above antigen, followed by booster injections at 3-week intervals, four times in total, into rabbits. SDS-PAGE—For SDS-PAGE, 12.1 μl of concentrated High Five cell culture supernatant were added to 4.7 μl of sample buffer (1.00 m Tris-HCl, 1.17 m sucrose, 0.28 m SDS, 2.08 mm EDTA, 0.88 mm Serva Blue G-250, 0.70 mm phenol red, and 0.10 m dithiothreitol, pH 8.5) and heated for 10 min at 99 °C. After the sample had been loaded, SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 4–12% BisTris-polyacrylamide gel with MOPS running buffer (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris, 3.47 mm SDS, and 1.03 mm EDTA, pH 7.7). Protein bands were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was carried out using a semidry electroblotting apparatus. After transfer, nonspecific antibody-binding sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-V5 antibodies at 1:500 dilution, and bound antibodies were detected using 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Alternatively, anti-XT-I antibodies were used in 50 mm PBS, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.5 ml/liter Tween 20, pH 7.4, at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h for detection of human XT-I variants. Bound anti-XT-I IgG antibody was detected using a second horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 1:1000 dilution. The blot was developed using 4-chloro-1-naphthol. If an increased sensitivity was needed to detect the rXT-I-V5-His protein, alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-V5 antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution, and the bound antibodies were detected using the Western Breeze kit and a digital imaging system according to the manufacturers' instructions. Binding to UDP-Beads—A 50-μl aliquot of fresh UDP-beads was washed with PBS to remove stabilizing reagents and contaminants and was then resuspended in 50 μl of PBS. The UDP-beads were mixed with 50 μl of 10–50-fold enriched culture supernatant from High Five insect cells expressing the XT-I variants containing either 5 mm MnCl2 or 5 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of 25 mm UDP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation and washed once with PBS. The beads were then centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 × g and boiled in sample buffer for 10 min. The samples were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed as described above. The bound rXT-I-V5-His fusion proteins were then detected after Western blotting using anti-V5 antibodies. Binding to Heparin-Beads—A 20-μl aliquot of heparin-agarose beads was washed twice with PBS to remove unbound heparin molecules and resuspended in 50 μl of PBS. 150 μl of cell culture supernatant containing the XT-I mutants were added and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with rotation. The beads were then separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 1 min, and the XT-I activity of the supernatant was measured and compared with that of the untreated specimen. All samples were properly diluted with PBS supplemented with 1% human serum albumin to measure within the linear range of the XT-I activity assay. The relative amount of XT-I bound to the heparin-beads was derived from the remaining activity of the XT-I mutant in the supernatant and the corresponding untreated control. To exclude a potential inhibition of the XT-I variants in the XT-I activity assay by heparin released from the heparin-beads, a 20-μl aliquot of heparin-beads was incubated with 100 μl of PBS for 1 h. The beads were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the pelleted agarose beads were removed. 20 μl of culture supernatant containing XT-I were added to the supernatant, and XT-I activity was monitored and compared with appropriate controls. Analysis of XT-I Amino Acid Sequences—The hydropathy plot of human XT-I was performed with the Winpep software (31Hennig L.

https://openalex.org/W1974811866,"Based on phage display optimization studies with human growth hormone (GH), it is thought that the biopotency of GH cannot be increased. This is proposed to be a result of the affinity of the first receptor for hormone far exceeding that which is required to trap the hormone long enough to allow diffusion of the second receptor to form the ternary complex, which initiates signaling. We report here that despite similar site 1 kinetics to the hGH/hGH receptor interaction, the potency of porcine GH for its receptor can be increased up to 5-fold by substituting hGH residues involved in site 1 binding into pGH. Based on extensive mutations and BIAcore studies, we show that the higher potency and site 1 affinity of hGH for the pGHR is primarily a result of a decreased off-rate associated with residues in the extended loop between helices 1 and 2 that interact with the two key tryptophans Trp104 and Trp169 in the receptor binding hot spot. Our mutagenic analysis has also identified a second determinant (Lys165), which in addition to His169, restricts the ability of non-primate hormones to activate hGH receptor. The increased biopotency of GH that we observe can be explained by a model for GH receptor activation where subunit alignment is critical for effective signaling.

The growth hormone receptor (GHR) 1The abbreviations used are: GHR, growth hormone receptor; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GHBP, growth hormone-binding protein; RU, refractive index unit; WT, wild type; hGHR, human growth hormone receptor; pGH, porcine growth hormone; ECD, extracellular domain.1The abbreviations used are: GHR, growth hormone receptor; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GHBP, growth hormone-binding protein; RU, refractive index unit; WT, wild type; hGHR, human growth hormone receptor; pGH, porcine growth hormone; ECD, extracellular domain. was the first class 1 cytokine receptor to be characterized, and the interaction between the human receptor and its ligand has been particularly well characterized (1Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 2Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The GHR has served as a paradigm for the ligand-induced dimerization mechanism that is believed to result in the activation of paired Janus kinases bound to the membrane proximal box 1 sequence of the receptor by a process of transphosphorylation. In the case of the GHR, JAK2 is the proximal effector, and once activated, it phosphorylates selected tyrosines in the receptor cytoplasmic domain, providing docking sites for SH2-domain containing signaling proteins and adaptors. Several important pathways are activated by this process, including the STAT5a/b, the ERK, and Akt pathways (3Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In a series of elegant investigations, a Genentech group demonstrated that the 4-helix bundle hormone possesses two non-identical binding surfaces, but binds to similar receptor binding sites in an ordered sequence, with the initial binding site possessing a higher affinity (site 1). Site 2 binding is stabilized by a further inter-receptor interaction involving the “dimerization domain” in the lower of the two cytokine homology modules (4Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 5De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5133-5140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both site 1 and site 2 interactions are critically dependent on a key tryptophan contributed by the upper cytokine module (Trp104), with a second precisely oriented tryptophan (Trp169) from the lower module also contributing critically to site 1 binding (2Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 7Bernat B. Pal G. Sun M. Kossiakoff A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These tryptophans form the center of a hydrophobic binding surface (hot spot), which is the basis for the hormone-receptor interaction, with surrounding residues packing around these tryptophans to ensure high affinity interactions with the relevant hormone residues. Systematic mutagenesis has shown that essentially, the minihelix and loop between helices 1 and 2, together with residues in the center of helix 4 comprise the first hormone binding site 1 (1Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 2Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Residues at the amino terminus of the first helix and helix 3 comprise the second and smaller binding site on the hormone (5De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 6Chen C. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5133-5140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Simulation of the process of bivalent hormone-dependent dimerization of receptor subunits shows that increasing site 1 affinity will shift the dose-response curve leftwards, whereas increasing site 2 affinity increases the maximum response (8Ilondo M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Matthews D.J. Topping R.S. Cass R.T. Giebel L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9471-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Genentech group therefore sought to increase the potency of human GH by increasing the affinity of both site 1 and site 2 for the receptor using phage display. However, despite a 400-fold increase in site 1 affinity, or a 40-fold increase in site 2 affinity, no increase in potency of hGH was observed in a cell proliferation assay (10Pearce K.H. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Teeri T. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This led these workers to conclude that hGH is evolutionarily “optimized,” because site 1 affinity in particular was sufficient to trap the hormone at the cell surface long enough for efficient dimerization with the second receptor subunit following its diffusion in the plane of the membrane to the receptor 1-hormone complex. This optimization is evidently very effective, because it was necessary to lower site 1 affinity by around 100-fold to observe a significant increase in the EC50 for cell proliferation (10Pearce K.H. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Teeri T. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). While developing a cell proliferation assay for porcine GH based on stable expression of the pGH receptor, we noted that the biopotency of human GH was 5-fold greater than that of pGH. In an effort to understand the mechanisms responsible for this difference, and to create higher potency pGH analogues with economic potential, we have substituted site 1 binding residues from hGH residues into pGH. This also allowed us to identify species-specific determinants for hGH binding. We find that, contrary to hGH, it is possible to improve the biopotency of pGH, both by increasing on-rate and by decreasing off-rate constants. Our observations are consistent with a model for GH receptor activation that involves a hormone-induced conformational change within a constitutive dimer, rather than hormone-induced receptor dimerization. Such a model has been proposed recently based on FRET and BRET data, and the ability to create constitutively active receptors independent of hormone by relative rotation of receptor subunits. 2R. J.

Gene Splicing by Overlap Extension mutagenesis (12Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) was employed to construct four cluster mutants based on the sequence comparison shown in Fig. 1, where residues in site 1 of hGH and the equivalent residues in pGH are highlighted. The primers listed below were used for the mutagenesis of the target residues R41K/Insert44F/I45L in group 1 (G1), T62S/G63N/K64R/D65E/A67T in group 2 (G2), K165R/L168M/H169D/A172V in group 3 (G3), and V178I/M179V/K180Q/del.183R/F184S in group 4 (G4).

Two separate fragments containing mutated bases were amplified from the pGH-pEC611 template by PCR using high fidelity thermostable polymerase, Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The first fragment was amplified with primers a and b. Primer b introduces a sequence change at the 3′ end of the PCR product. The second fragment was amplified with primers c and d, with primer c introducing the same mutation, but in the 5′ end of the PCR product. These two products share a segment of identical sequence, the overlap region. When these intermediate products are mixed, melted, and re-annealed, the two complementary mutant sequences generated from separate PCR anneal, facilitating overlap extension by DNA polymerase. This allows the creation of full-length pGH mutant DNA during the subsequent PCR with primers a and d. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described by QuikChange (Stratagene) to create a series of individual pGH mutants within the four groups described above. The following primers were used, where mutated bases are bolded and underlined. The primers are: G1–3For (R42K): 5′-TCCCGGAGGGACAGAAGTACTCCATCCAGAACG-3′; G1–3Rev (R42K): 5′-CGTTCTGGATGGAGTACTTCTGTCCCTCCGGGA-3′ G1–4For (45F/I46L): 5′-GACAGAGGTACTCCTTCCTGCAGAACGCCCAGGCTG-3′; G1–4For (45F/I46L): 5′-CAGCCTGGGCGTTCTGCAGGAAGGAGTACCTCTGTC-3′; G2–2For (T62S/G63N): 5′-CCATCCCGGCCCCCAGCAACAAGGACGAGGCCCAG-3′; G2–2Rev (T62S/G63N): 5′-CTGGGCCTCGTCCTTGTTGCTGGGGGCCGGGATGG-3′; G2–4For (K64R/D65E): 5′-GCCCCCACGGGCAGGGAAGAGGCCCAGCAGAGATC-3′; G2–4Rev (K64R/D65E): 5′-GATCTCTGCTGGGCCTCTTCCCTGCCCGTGGGGGC-3′; G2–5For (A67T): 5′-ACGGGCAAGGACGAGACCCAGCAGAGATCGG-3′; G2–5Rev (A67T): 5′-CCGATCTCTGCTGGGTCTCGTCCTTGCCCGT-3′; G3–1For (K165R): 5′-CTGCTCTCCTGCTTCAGGAAGGACCTGCACAAG-3′; G3–1Rev (K165R): 5′-CTTGTGCAGGTCCTTCCTGAAGCAGGAGAGCAG-3′; G4–1For (V177I): 5′-GAGACATACCTGCGGATCATGAAGTGTCGCCG-3′; G4–1Rev (V177I): 5′-CGGCGACACTTCATGATCCGCAGGTATGTCTC-3′; G4–2For (V177I/M178V/K179Q): 5′-GACATACCTGCGGATCGTGCAGTGTCGCCGCTTCG-3′; G4–2Rev (V177I/M178VK179/Q): 5′-CGAAGCGGCGACACTGCACGATCCGCAGGTATGTC-3′; G4–6For (F184S): 5′-CATGAAGTGTCGCCGCAGCGTGGAGAGCAGCTGTG-3′; G4–6Rev (F184S): 5′-CACAGCTGCTCTCCACGCTGCGGCGACACTTCATG-3′; G4–7For (del.R183/F184S): 5′-CATGAAGTGTCGC—AGCGTGGAGAGCAGCTGTG-3′; G4–7Rev (del.R183/F184S): 5′-CACAGCTGCTCTCCACGCT—GCGACACTTCATG-3′. To facilitate bacterial expression of pGHBP, a number of third bases in the wild type pGHBP DNA were mutated to the preferred bacterial codons, where the mammalian codon was only rarely used in Escherichia coli. There were codons 21 (GGG to GGT), 25 (ACA to ACC), 28 (GTC to GTG), 29 (CTT to CTG), 30 (GTC to GTG), 31 (AGA to CGT), 38 (AGA to CGT), and 174 (AGA to CGT). In addition, to facilitate coupling to the BIAcore chip, pGHBP(S201C), pGHBP(S237C), and hGHBP(S201C) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis from pGHBP and hGHBP cDNAs in pCDNA3.1(+) with the following primers. The mutated bases corresponding to amino acid substitutions are bolded and underlined. The primers are: S219C-pGHBP-For: 5′-CAGTTCCGGTGTACTGCTTGAGACTG GATAAAG-3′; S219C-pGHBP-Rev: 5′-CTTTATCCAGTCTCAAGCAGTACACCGGAACTG-3′; S237C-pGHBP-F- or: 5′-CACTTCCTCAGATGTGCTAATAAGCTTGTGAAGAAG-3′; S237C-pGHBP-Rev:5′-CTTCTTCACAAGCTTATTAGCACATCTGAGGAAGTG3′; S219C-hGHBP-For: 5′-CATCAGTTCCAGTGTACTGCTTGAAAGTGGATAAG-3′; S219C-hGHBP-Rev: 5′-CTTATCCACTTTCAAGCAGTACACTGGAACTGATG-3′. Expression in E. coli also required the removal of the mammalian signal sequence. This was achieved by introducing an NdeI site and a START codon (ATG) at the 5′ end and a STOP codon (TAA) and a HindIII site at the 3′ end of the pGH, pGHBP, and hGHBP sequences in pCE611(pGH), pCDNA3.1(pGHBP), and pCDNA3.1(hGHBP). The following primers were used to achieve this by site-directed mutagenesis. The restriction sites are bolded and underlined, and start and stop codons are in italics: pGH-For: 5′-GAAACAGCATATGTTCCCAGCCATGCCGC-3′; pGH-Rev: 5′-CAGCCAAGCTTCTATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTC-3′; PGHBP-For: 5′-CAGGCTCACATATGGCTTTTTCTGGGAGTGAAGCC-3′; pGHBP-Rev: 5′-TTCACAAGCTTATTAGCTCATCTGAGGAAGTGTTAC-3′; hGHBP-For: 5′-CAGGCTCACATATGTTTTCTGGAAGTGAGGCC-3′; hGHBP-Rev: 5′-TTCACAAGCTTATTAGCTCATCTGAGGAAGTGTTAC-3′. After each mutation was confirmed by autosequencing using the ABI Prism big dye terminator version 3.0 (Australian Genome Research Facility), the mutant cDNAs were digested with the relevant restriction enzymes such that the mutated region was excised. The pET-20b(+) expression vector (catalog number 69739-3, Novagen, Madison, WI) was also cut with the same enzymes followed by ligation of the mutant DNA segment. The mutant cDNA segments in the expression vector were again sequenced between the subcloning sites to eliminate any spurious mutations. pGH and pGH Mutants—All constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and isolated colonies from agar plates were grown in 3-ml cultures, then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The clones expressing the highest level of recombinant proteins were selected by PAGE using Coomassie Blue and used immediately for protein expression. Selected bacterial clones expressing pGH and pGH mutants were used to initiate fermentation by inoculation in 50 ml of LB medium at 37 °C, followed by an overnight culture at 15 °C. This culture was then diluted into 500 ml of TB medium and grown in 2 × 2-liter flasks at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7–0.9. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to 1 mm. Growth was continued for an additional 3–4 h to A600 of 1.5–1.6, after which the cells were pelleted for 10 min at 6,000 × g, re-suspended in 20 ml of cold water containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and stored at -70 °C for less than 2 weeks. For preparation of inclusion bodies, frozen precipitate was thawed and the cells were lysed by passage twice through a French Press at 1000 p.s.i. The lysate was washed by centrifuging sequentially with 100 ml of cold water, 100 ml of washing buffer 1 (1 m NaCl, 25 mm Na3BO3, pH 9.0), and 100 ml of washing buffer 2 (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m urea and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8). In each case the pellets were resuspended by gentle homogenization with a Polytron, and the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE (not shown) revealed that the molecular weight of the recombinant protein was identical to pGH wild type. The inclusion body pellets were then re-suspended in 10 ml of denaturation buffer (10 mm glycine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm sodium borate, pH 9.1), 4 volumes of 6 m guanidine HCl was added, and the ixture was stirred for 1 h. After this, the suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was diluted with 5 volumes of 4 m urea, 1 mm glycine, 25 mm Na3BO3 (pH 9.1), such that the refolding was initiated, and this was facilitated by agitating gently to allow air oxidation, for 5 h at 4 °C. Oxidation was followed by dialysis against 8 liters of 1 m urea, 25 mm Na3BO3 (pH 9.1) and 2× 8 liters of 25 mm Na3BO3 (pH 9.1) for 36 h at 4 °C. The refolded oxidized protein was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose (catalog number 17051010, Amersham Biosciences) column (1.6 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with 25 mm Na3BO3 (pH 9.1) at 4 °C. Elution was carried out with a continuous NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in the equilibration buffer at 2 ml/min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm, and monomer content was determined by 14% SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Fractions judged to be greater than 95% pure monomer were selected for further analysis. pGHBP and hGHBP—Recombinant porcine GHBP WT, pGHBP(S201C), and pGHBP(S237C) were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described in Wan et al. (13Wan Y. Zheng Y.Z. Harris J.M. Brown R. Waters M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wild type hGHBP and hGHB(S201C) cDNA coding sequence for residues 1–237 was ligated into the pET20b(+) vector and transformed into E. coli, BL21 CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (catalog number 230245, Stratagene) according to the instruction manual (revision 050004). Subsequent expression and purification of these proteins was as described in Wan et al. (13Wan Y. Zheng Y.Z. Harris J.M. Brown R. Waters M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding of purified GHBPs was according to Ref. 14Barnard R. Bundesen P.G. Rylatt D.B. Waters M.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar. All kinetic experiments were carried out on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C. pGHbp and hGHbp were immobilized on Sensor Chips SA (BR-1000–32, BIAcore AB) and changes in refractive index upon binding of hormone were used for kinetic measurements. Preparation of Sensor Chips—To immobilize pGHBP and hGHBP in discrete orientations on the BIAcore sensor chip SA (streptavidin), a cysteine residue was introduced at Ser201 or Ser237 as previously described (1Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In our hands, direct coupling of the free thiol to the sensor chip inactivated the binding protein. Therefore the free thiols were conjugated with Biotin-BMCC (Pierce) to form a mixed disulfide, with excess Biotin-BMCC being removed with a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). After preconditioning sensor chips with three consecutive 1-min injections of 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH, biotinylated GHBPs were immobilized onto the streptavidin at the chip surface until ∼140 RUs (refractive index unit) were immobilized. This was achieved by injecting biotinylated GHBPs (2 × 5 μl of 1 μg/1 ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, buffer) over the chip surface following the BIAcore protocol. The pGHBP(S201C) and pGHBP(S237C) were immobilized on the surfaces of flow cells 2 and 4, respectively, and flow cells 1 and 3 were used as reference for on-line reference subtraction. After immobilization, maximum binding capacity was determined by saturating the biosensor with 240 nm pGH or hGH. Analyses of Binding Kinetics—Association rates were calculated from binding profiles obtained by injecting increasing concentrations of each GH analogue. In all cases, 25 μl of 0.5, 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 nm analogue were injected. Each concentration of the analyte was run three times over the surface of the GHBP Chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Injection time was 5 min, stabilization time was 1 min, and dissociation time was 5 min. High salt buffer-EP was used to prevent long-range electrostatic effects and to mimic physiological ionic strength, and nonspecific binding was reduced by including 0.02% Tween 20. The surface was regenerated by washed for 30 s with 25 μl of 4.5 m MgCl2. Control experiments showed that this was sufficient to remove all the bound hormone and that the surface could be reused more than 100 times without significant change in the binding kinetics. Association and dissociation kinetic constants were calculated by BIAevaluation 3.2 software using a simple 1:1 Langmuir model. A wild type reference was always included to control for any chip variation. The concentration of the hGH, pGH, and analogues were determined by absorbance at 280 nm and BCA analysis. The interleukin-3-dependent cell line, BAF/B03, stably transfected with full-length pGHR or human GH receptor (hGHR) was used for cell proliferation assays (15Behncken S.N. Rowlinson S.W. Rowland J.E. Conway-Campbell B.L. Monks T.A. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27077-27083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both lines express around 6000 receptors/cell at the cell surface by Scatchard analysis. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 10% Serum Supreme (a fetal bovine serum alternative supplied by BioWhittaker) and 5 mm hGH. In preparation for the assay, 80% confluent BAF/B03 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in assay buffer (RPMI 1640 with 1% serum supreme, without hGH), and incubated for 12–14 h. Cells were then pelleted, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and re-suspended to 6 × 105 cells/ml in assay buffer. 50 μl of cell suspension was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. This was followed by 100 μl of pGH or pGH mutants (at 8 different concentrations: 100, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, 0.625, and 0.1 ng/ml) to each of triplicate wells. Cells were then incubated for 36–40 h at 37 °C, after which 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was used to determine cell viability and number as described previously (15Behncken S.N.

Curve fitting was performed using Prism 3 and derived EC50 values were compared by analysis of variance. Each mutant was assayed three times, and the mean values are reported. Protein Data Bank structures 1HWG, 3HHR, and 1A22 were used as templates for constructing a model of pGH/pGHBP, with pGH and pGHBP protein sequences being obtained from NCBI. Sequences were read into InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and aligned using structurally conserved regions within the homology module. For pGH and pGHBP, 10 structures were built using the modeler function with a high level of refinement. The structures were minimized using Discover3 and the CFF91 forcefield. Model structures were scored with a combination of ProCheck, ProStat, and Verify, and also assessed visually. Models of the highest affinity mutants were also created using the Biopolymer module. The pGH-pGHBP complex model was created using 3HHR as a template. pGH and pGHBP were superimposed onto 3HHR to check for bumps. These were removed by manual rotation of torsions. The complex was then minimized, and analyzed by ProCheck and compared with 3HHR. This process was then performed for mutant structures. Molecular dynamic simulations were performed in the Discover3 module of InsightII. Minimized pGH and pGH-Group 1 were equilibrated at 300 K, before generating 50 structures using 2000 fs of molecular dynamic. The structures were analyzed in the DeCipher module of InsightII, to assess the mobility of the minihelix. Mobility was measured as the distance between 3 residues located on the same side of the helix. Biopotency of Analogues in a pGH Receptor-based Assay—The 5-fold biopotency difference that prompted this study is shown in Fig. 2A, which compares the potencies of hGH and pGH against the pGH receptor in the BaF cell assay. To address the basis for this difference, we expressed and purified 20 pGH analogues each possessing different combinations of the key binding elements of hGH identified for site 1 binding to receptor 1 (1Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This resulted in 4 groups of mutants, corresponding to the minihelix between helices 1 and 2 (G1), R41K/Inserted 44F/I45L; the extended loop between helices 1 and 2 (G2), T61S/G62N/K63R/D64E/A66T; the central part of helix 4 (G3), K165R/L168M/H169D/A171V; and the carboxyl-terminal end of helix 4 (G4), V177I/M178V/K179Q/del.182R/F183S (Fig. 1). Variants with individual mutations in each group were also created. The biopotency curves for several of these are shown in Fig. 2, B–D, and the EC50 values are listed in Table I.Table IBiopotency values for pGH mutants and hGH relative to pGH The values shown in this table are means ± S.E.LigandsMutated residuesEC50 relative to PGH wild typePGH WT1.00HGH WT0.19 ± 0.02ap < 0.01 relative to pGHG1 (1)R41K/Ins.44F/I45L0.31 ± 0.01ap < 0.01 relative to pGHG1 (3)R41K0.87 ± 0.02G1 (4)Ins.44F/I45L0.50 ± 0.03bp < 0.05 relative to pGHG2 (1)T61S/G62N/K63R/D64E/A66T0.36 ± 0.03bp < 0.05 relative to pGHG2 (2)T61S/G62N1.17 ± 0.06G2 (4)K63R/D64E1.94 ± 0.06bp < 0.05 relative to pGHG2 (5)A66T0.65 ± 0.08G4 (2)V177I/M178V/K179Q1.15 ± 0.00G4 (3)V177I/M178V/K179Q/del.182R/F183S0.60 ± 0.03G4 (6)F183S0.46 ± 0.01bp < 0.05 relative to pGHG4 (7)Del.182R/F183S0.35 ± 0.03bp < 0.05 relative to pGHG5 (1)G1(1) + G2(2)0.38 ± 0.01bp < 0.05 relative to pGHG5 (2)G1(1) + G2(4)0.85 ± 0.07G5 (3)G1(1) + G4(7)0.22 ± 0.01ap < 0.01 relative to pGHG5 (4)G2(1) + G4(7)0.26 ± 0.03ap < 0.01 relative to pGHG5 (5)G2(1) + G1(4)0.24 ± 0.01ap < 0.01 relative to pGHG5 (6)G1(1) + G4(7) + G2(5)0.22 ± 0.01ap < 0.01 relative to pGHG5 (7)G2(1) + G4(7) + G1(4)0.20 ± 0.01ap < 0.01 relative to pGHa p < 0.01 relative to pGHb p < 0.05 relative to pGH Open table in a new tab Of the four groups of pGH analogues, the most significant reduction in EC50 for cell proliferation were for group 1 (1), R41K/Inserted 44F/I45L; group 2 (1), T61S/G62N/K63R/D64E/A66T; and group 4 (7), del.182R/F183S. There were no biopotency-improved variants in group 3. Interestingly, although neither double nor single mutations showed any significant reduction in the EC50 in group 2, the sum of all mutations in this group showed a highly significant improvement (0.36 ± 0.028) in EC50 relative to pGH WT. To further improve pGH analogue biopotency, the biopotency-improved variants in groups 1, 2, and 4 were combined into group 5 (G5). As seen in Table I, most of the combination mutants in G5 showed that higher biopotency was achieved by the approach, except for G5 (2) where residues decreasing biopotency (K63R/D64E) were included. The most significant improvement in biopotency was seen with the combined analogues G5(3), G5(5), G5(6), and G5(7), which had 4.6-, 4.1-, 4.5-, and 5.1-fold increases in biopotency, respectively, compared with pGH WT (Table I and Fig. 2). The greatest biopotency-improved analogue, G5(7), consisted of 10 mutations: R41K/Inserted 44F/I45L/T61S/G62N/K63R/D64E/A66T/del.182R/F183S. However, a mutant with only 5 residue changes (G5(3)) possessed a biopotency very close to that of G5 (7). For regulatory reasons, it was important to determine whether these increased biopotency pGH mutants cross-react with the hGH receptor. Analysis with the BAF/B03 cell line expressing hGHR revealed that pGH wild type could not activate the hGHR up to 50 nm and this was the case for all pGH analogues except for group 3 analogues and, to a minor extent, for group 5 (7). This is illustrated in Fig. 3 and Table II, which show that pGH mutant G3(1) L168M/H169D/A171V has a 19-fold lower potency for hGH receptor than hGH itself, and mutant G3(2) K165R/L168M/H169D/A171V reaches one-fifth the potency of hGH. However, these mutants are 2–3-fold less potent than pGH in the pGH recep"

Previous studies demonstrated that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe this checkpoint is mediated by a pathway that includes Rad3 (similar to human ATR and ATM) and Cds1 (similar to human Chk1 and Chk2). Here we present evidence that a major downstream target of this pathway is the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2. We also present evidence suggesting that the intra-S-phase checkpoint makes a relatively minor contribution to the survival of cells with damaged DNA. Eukaryotic cells slow their progression through S phase upon DNA damage. The mechanism that leads to this slowing is called the intra-S-phase checkpoint. Previous studies demonstrated that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe this checkpoint is mediated by a pathway that includes Rad3 (similar to human ATR and ATM) and Cds1 (similar to human Chk1 and Chk2). Here we present evidence that a major downstream target of this pathway is the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2. We also present evidence suggesting that the intra-S-phase checkpoint makes a relatively minor contribution to the survival of cells with damaged DNA. Eukaryotic cells actively slow their progression through S phase when their DNA is damaged (for review, see Ref. 1Cobb J.A. Shimada K. Gasser S.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The biological importance of this response, which is called the intra-S-phase checkpoint, is not clear, but it is frequently assumed that this checkpoint provides cells with time to repair the damaged DNA before its replication. Interest in the intra-S-phase checkpoint is enhanced by the strong correlation in several human genetic diseases between loss of the intra-S-phase checkpoint and susceptibility to cancer (2Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In all tested eukaryotic organisms the intra-S-phase checkpoint depends on the function of one or two members of the ATR family of protein kinases (ATR and ATM in vertebrate cells (3Falck J.

Huberman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7472-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). The relative roles of the ATR-like kinases depend on the nature of the damage. For example, in vertebrate cells ATM is primarily responsible for the checkpoint response to damage by ionizing radiation (3Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). In contrast, ATR is the principal mediator of the checkpoint response to ultraviolet light damage and alkylation damage (5Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15387-15392Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Most if not all of the intra-S-phase checkpoint pathways downstream of the ATR family depend on one or another member of the Chk family of protein kinases (Chk1 and Chk2 in vertebrates, Chk1 and Rad53 in budding yeast, Chk1 and Cds1 in fission yeast). The Chk kinases become active when they are phosphorylated by an ATR-family kinase (3Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 4Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Events downstream of the Chk kinases are best understood in vertebrate cells. One of the principal targets of the Chk kinases is the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk2, but Cdk2 is not directly regulated by the Chk kinases. Instead, Cdk2 is inhibited by phosphorylation of its tyrosine 15 (Tyr-15) and activated by removal of the phosphate at Tyr-15. Cdc25A is the phosphatase that activates Cdk2. Phosphorylation of Cdc25A by Chk1 or Chk2 leads to its degradation. Thus, phosphorylated Cdc25A cannot dephosphorylate and activate Cdk2 (3Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J.

Inhibition of Cdk2 may slow S phase by other mechanisms as well. Rad53 is the Chk kinase that is important for the intra-S-phase checkpoint in budding yeast (7Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), and Cds1 is the relevant Chk kinase in fission yeast (9Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U.

Whether DNA-damage-induced activation of Rad53 or Cds1 slows S phase by inhibiting a cyclin-dependent kinase or in some other way is not known.

In the case of fission yeast these studies have demonstrated that the MMS-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint depends on Rad3 (similar to vertebrate ATR), Rad26 (similar to vertebrate ATRIP), and the group of proteins that presumably loads a checkpoint-specific PCNA-like structure onto damaged DNA (Rad17, Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1; similar to the vertebrate proteins with the same names (9Lindsay H.D.

The fission yeast intra-S-phase checkpoint also requires Rad4/Cut5 (10Marchetti M.A. Kumar S. Hartsuiker E. Maftahi M. Carr A.M. Freyer G.A. Burhans W.C. Huberman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7472-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which is similar to vertebrate TopBP1/Cut5, and presumably Swi1, which is similar to budding yeast Tof1 (19Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These proteins appear to act cooperatively to facilitate the activation of Cds1 (similar to vertebrate Chk2 and budding yeast Rad53 but with some of the functions of vertebrate Chk1). In budding yeast the MRX complex is also required for the intra-S-phase checkpoint (8D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2238-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This complex consists of Mre11 (similar to Mre11 in vertebrates and Rad32 in fission yeast), Rad50 (similar to Rad50 in vertebrates and fission yeast), and Xrs2 (similar to Nbs1 in vertebrates and fission yeast). The corresponding complex in vertebrates and fission yeast is called the MRN complex, and it is likewise essential for the intra-S-phase checkpoint in these organisms (2Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Chahwan C. Nakamura T.M. Sivakumar S. Russell P. Rhind N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6564-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The MRX and MRN complexes in budding yeast and vertebrates function upstream of Rad53 and Chk2, respectively (20Usui T. Ogawa H. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Petrini J.H.J. Stracker T.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), but the relationship between the MRN complex and Cds1 in fission yeast has not yet been defined (18Chahwan C. Nakamura T.M. Sivakumar S. Russell P. Rhind N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6564-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The pathways downstream of Cds1 for the intra-S-phase checkpoint in fission yeast have not previously been identified. We suspected that one of these pathways might resemble the vertebrate pathway discussed above. According to this hypothesis, checkpoint-induced activation of Cds1 would lead to phosphorylation of Cdc25 (the fission yeast homolog of vertebrate Cdc25A), which in turn would lead to inhibition of Cdc2 (the fission yeast cyclin-dependent kinase) and, thus, to slowing of S phase. Support for this hypothesis came from our previous finding (10Marchetti M.A. Kumar S. Hartsuiker E. Maftahi M. Carr A.M. Freyer G.A. Burhans W.C. Huberman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7472-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that the upstream portions (from signal generation to activation of Cds1) of the MMS-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint in fission yeast appeared to be identical to the upstream portions of the SdNTP-M checkpoint (which blocks entry into mitosis when cells are kept in S phase as a consequence of starvation for deoxynucleoside triphosphates by treatment with hydroxyurea). If the upstream portions of the SdNTP-M checkpoint and the intra-S-phase checkpoint are identical, then might not the downstream portions (downstream of Cds1) also be similar or identical? It was already known that the downstream portion of the SdNTP-M checkpoint is primarily a consequence of Cds1-mediated inactivation of Cdc25 (22Furnari B. Blasina A. Boddy M.N. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Cdc25 prevents activation of Cdc2 and, thus, prevents mitosis. Because Cdc2 is also required for initiation of DNA replication (23Leatherwood J. Lopez-Girona A. Russell P. Nature. 1996; 379: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Hayles J. Fisher D. Woollard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 25Fisher D.L. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it seemed plausible to us that both the SdNTP-M checkpoint and the intra-S-phase checkpoint might be mediated by the inhibition of Cdc2. For these reasons we have carried out a study in fission yeast to evaluate the potential roles of Cdc25 and Cdc2 in the intra-S-phase checkpoint. We also tested the potential roles of the Wee1 and Mik1 kinases, which are responsible for inhibiting Cdc2 by phosphorylating it on Tyr-15 (26Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 27Lee M.S. Enoch T. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30530-30537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and which also contribute to the SdNTP-M checkpoint (28Christensen P.U. Bentley N.J. Martinho R.G. Nielsen O. Carr A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2579-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Rhind N. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results support the hypothesis that a major portion of the intra-S-phase checkpoint in fission yeast is a consequence of phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of Cdc2, similar to the SdNTP-M checkpoint in fission yeast and vertebrates and similar to the intra-S-phase checkpoint in vertebrates. Strains and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used for this study are listed in Table I. All strains were cultured in YES medium at 30 °C (unless otherwise indicated) with vigorous shaking. YES consisted of 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 3% glucose; histidine, uracil, and adenine were added to 75 mg/liter, whereas leucine was added to 200 mg/liter (all chemicals were from Sigma). For plates, 2% agar (Difco) was added to the medium. The strain labeled SK02 was made by replacing the cds1+ gene with a Kan-MX6 cassette using the methodology described by Bahler et al. (30Bahler J.

Then the cultures were left untreated or treated with 0.0075 or 0.015% MMS (Sigma), and the 0-h samples were collected for flow cytometry by fixing a small aliquot of cells in 70% ethanol. Additional samples for flow cytometry were collected on an hourly basis. For the cdc10 method, cells were grown to 1 × 107 cells/ml overnight at 25 °C, diluted to 5 × 106 cells/ml, and allowed to recover for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were then incubated at 35 °C for 4 h to arrest them with a 1N DNA content. Cells were released from the block by lowering the temperature to 25 °C. 0.015% MMS was added (or not) at the time of release, and samples were collected for flow cytometry at 30-min intervals. Flow cytometric analysis was carried out as described previously (10Marchetti M.A. Kumar S. Hartsuiker E. Maftahi M. Carr A.M. Freyer G.A. Burhans W.C. Huberman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7472-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that FlowJo software (Treestar Inc.) was used to generate the flow histograms. MMS Sensitivity Assays—To measure sensitivity to MMS as a function of time, cells were grown at 25 °Cto1 × 107 cells/ml, diluted to 5 × 106 cells/ml, allowed to grow for another hour, treated with 0.015% MMS, and further incubated at 25 °C. Samples were collected every 2 h. For each time point three different numbers (50, 500, and 5000) of cells were plated onto separate YES-agar plates lacking MMS. The plates were incubated at 25 °C. For each time point the results for all three dilutions were mutually consistent. The surviving colonies on the plates with the largest numbers of resolvable colonies were counted, and the S.D. of the count (the square root of the number counted) was determined. These numbers were then expressed as percentages relative to the initial values at the time of addition of MMS. To measure the ability to grow in the presence of MMS, cells were grown to log phase overnight, counted, and diluted to 1 × 107 cells/ml. 10-Fold serial dilutions were made, and 5 μl of each dilution were spotted onto YES agar plates containing 0.005% or 0.010% MMS. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 4 days, then photographed. A New Method to Evaluate the Intra-S-phase Checkpoint— We previously used two cell synchronization methods ((i) nitrogen starvation and release and (ii) temperature block and release of cdc25 temperature-sensitive mutant strains) to measure the MMS-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint (10Marchetti M.A. Kumar S. Hartsuiker E. Maftahi M. Carr A.M. Freyer G.A. Burhans W.C. Huberman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7472-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nitrogen-starved S. pombe cells arrest with 1N DNA content in a G0-like state. When transferred to rich medium, the cells resume cycling, pass through S phase, and enter G2 phase. However, cells emerge asynchronously from the G0 block, which makes the nitrogen starvation/release method insensitive to partial phenotypes (10Marchetti M.A. Kumar S. Hartsuiker E. Maftahi M. Carr A.M. Freyer G.A. Burhans W.C. Huberman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7472-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cdc25 method produces better synchrony. At high temperatures cells bearing the cdc25 mutation cannot enter mitosis, so the cells arrest in late G2 phase. When the temperature is lowered, the cells pass through mitosis and the subsequent G1 and S phases in good synchrony, thus permitting detection of partial intra-S-phase checkpoint phenotypes (10Marchetti M.A. Kumar S. Hartsuiker E. Maftahi M. Carr A.M. Freyer G.A. Burhans W.C. Huberman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7472-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, in the present study we employed mutants that cannot be synchronized by cdc25 block and release, because these mutants contained their own defects in the Cdc25 pathway. Furthermore, the mutants in the present study were also defective in G0 arrest upon nitrogen starvation. Therefore, we developed an alternative method to measure checkpoint-dependent S-phase delay. For this purpose we optimized a simple assay (suggested to us by Dr. Grant Brown at the University of Toronto) to investigate the intra-S-phase checkpoint in S. pombe cells. The assay involves growing S. pombe cells to log phase in rich medium and treating them or not with low concentrations of MMS, then collecting hourly samples for flow cytometry. In rich medium S. pombe cells have rapid G1 and S phases, and they do not undergo cytokinesis until near the end of S phase. Most of the cell cycle is spent in G2 phase. Consequently, the majority of cells are in G2 phase, the G1 cells (which are binucleate and, thus, have a cellular DNA content of 2N) also contribute to the 2N peak in flow cytometry, and the S phase cells form a shoulder between 2N and 4N, to the right of the 2N peak (Fig. 1, A and B, 0-h time point). When MMS is added, the majority of checkpoint-competent cells, which were in G2 before MMS addition, go through mitosis and then enter S phase. When the replication forks in these cells encounter DNA damage, progression through S phase slows down. Because cytokinesis occurs at a fixed time after mitosis regardless of the length of S phase, when S phase is prolonged most cells undergo cytokinesis while they are still in S phase, thus generating a population of uninucleate S-phase cells. This population forms a shoulder or peak with DNA content less than 2N to the left of the 2N position (Fig. 1, A and B, Wild type, compare low and high MMS with no MMS at the 3- and 4-h time points). Cells deficient in the intra-S-phase checkpoint cannot slow their progression through S phase, and they maintain a normal log-phase-like flow profile even in the presence of MMS. An example is provided in Fig. 1B (cds1Δ panel). The advantages of this simple technique are that (i) potential artifacts arising from synchronization are eliminated, and (ii) there are no restrictions (other than ability to produce an interpretable log phase flow profile) on the types of mutant strains that can be investigated. To enhance detection of partial phenotypes, we used two different concentrations of MMS (low (0.0075%) and high (0.015%)) that produced dose-dependent accumulation of wild type cells in S phase (Fig. 1B). Importance of Cdc2 Phosphorylation for the Intra-S-phase Checkpoint—The Cdc2 protein is the S. pombe cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) that, together with different cyclins, promotes cell-cycle transitions by phosphorylating important cell cycle regulators. The heterodimer of Cdc2 and the cyclin Cig2 (Cdc2/Cig2) promotes the G1/S transition and is normally responsible for initiation of DNA replication (31Mondesert O. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1527-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Cdc2/Cdc13 promotes passage through mitosis (32Berry L.D. Gould K.L. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1996; 2: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to its essential roles in mitosis and DNA replication, Cdc2 is the downstream effector of the SdNTP-M checkpoint and the G2-M checkpoint (the checkpoint that arrests the cell cycle prior to mitosis after DNA damage in G2) (33Rhind N. Furnari B. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Rhind N. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3782-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of Cdc2 in the intra-S-phase checkpoint, we used a strain that carries the cdc2Y15F mutation. As a consequence of this mutation, tyrosine is replaced by non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine at position 15. The encoded protein, Cdc2Y15F, is a constitutively active cyclin-dependent kinase (35Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), and the mutant strain exhibits a “wee” (small cell) phenotype as a result of premature mitosis. S. pombe cells expressing Cdc2Y15F have previously been demonstrated to be defective in both the SdNTP-M and the G2-M checkpoints (33Rhind N. Furnari B. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Rhind N. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3782-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Enoch T. Gould K.L. Nurse P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We tested the cdc2Y15F strain for the intra-S-phase checkpoint using the method described above. Fig. 2C shows the results obtained. In the 2-h MMS-treated samples, this strain showed a slight accumulation of S-phase cells (to the left and right of the 2N peak; see Fig. 1A for interpretation) upon MMS treatment. This small accumulation of S-phase cells mostly disappeared by 4 h. In contrast, robust accumulation of S-phase cells (especially to the left of the 2N peak) was evident in the wild type control cells (Fig. 2A). Thus, in comparison to wild type, cdc2Y15F cells have an intra-S-phase checkpoint that is both weak and transient. These results indicate that phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr-15 is a key step in the MMS-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint as well as in the SdNTP-M and G2-M checkpoints. Because Cdc25 is an activator of Cdc2, we hypothesized that a strain overexpressing Cdc25 should have a phenotype similar to that of the cdc2Y15F strain. For this purpose we employed a Cdc25-overexpressing strain that had previously been shown to have reduced phosphorylation at Cdc2-Tyr-15 (37Gould K.L. Moreno S. Tonks N.K. Nurse P. Science. 1990; 250: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This strain had also been reported to be sensitive to hydroxyurea and deficient in the SdNTP-M checkpoint (38Forbes K.C. Humphrey T. Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1361-1375PubMed Google Scholar, 39Enoch T. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 60: 665-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Consistent with our hypothesis, the Cdc25-overexpressing strain showed only weak, transient accumulation of sub-2N cells 2 h after MMS treatment (Fig. 2B), similar to the phenotype of the cdc2Y15F strain (Fig. 2C). Thus, two independent genetic modifications that caused constitutive activation of Cdc2 kinase both resulted in major loss of the intra-S-phase checkpoint. The tyrosine kinases Wee1 and Mik1 are responsible for phosphorylating Tyr-15 of Cdc2 (26Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We predicted that, because overproduction of Cdc25 (which removes phosphate from Tyr-15) can diminish the intra-S-phase checkpoint (Fig. 2B), then inhibition of Wee1 and Mik1 (which add phosphate onto Tyr-15) should have a similar effect. We found that deletion of mik1+ alone had no effect on the checkpoint (results not shown). The gene encoding the essential Wee1 protein cannot be deleted, so we studied cells bearing a temperature-sensitive mutant allele, wee1-50, at various temperatures. At permissive temperature (25 °C) both wee1-50 single-mutant cells and wee1-50 mik1Δ double-mutant cells were as competent as wild type cells for the intra-S-phase checkpoint (results not shown). Unfortunately, at 30 °C or higher temperatures the single- and double-mutant cells became sick and did not produce interpretable flow cytometry data even in the absence of MMS (results not shown). Thus, our observations show that in the presence of the Wee1 kinase, phosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr-15 by the Mik1 kinase is not important for the intra-S-phase checkpoint. We suspect that in the absence of Mik1 kinase Wee1 kinase is responsible for inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr-15 during the intra-S-phase checkpoint response. However, the essential nature of Wee1 prevented us from testing this possibility. To gain more confidence in our results obtained with the cdc2Y15F and the cdc25OP strains, we decided to test our conclusions using a synchronization technique based on temperature block and release of cdc10 mutants. The Cdc10 protein is a transcription factor, and its function is required for the G1/S transition (40Aves S.J. Durkacz B.W. Carr A. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For this reason, cdc10 mutant cells arrest in G1 at non-permissive temperature (35 °C). When the temperature is reduced to 25 °C, the cells enter and pass through S phase synchronously. We found that when the cdc10-v50, cdc10-v50 cdc25OP, and cdc10-v50 cdc2Y15F strains were incubated at 35 °C for 4 h, most cells accumulated with a 1N DNA content, consistent with arrest in G1 (Fig. 3, 0 min time point). The cdc10-v50 cdc2Y15F strain displayed a broader profile due to its inherent cell cycle defects; nevertheless, a 1N peak was evident. The arrested cultures were shifted to 25 °C and treated or not with 0.015% MMS. Samples for flow cytometry were collected every 30 min. The cdc10-v50 cells (wild type) slowed their progression through S phase upon MMS treatment (Fig. 3A). In this case the untreated culture completed S phase by 120 min, whereas the MMS-treated cells had not completed S phase by 150 min. However, the cells overproducing Cdc25 or expre"
https://openalex.org/W1997736344,"An earlier report in the literature indicated the vitamin D response element (VDRE) in the human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) promoter could be specifically bound by an unidentified transcription factor in addition to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) complex. We confirmed that OK and HeLa cell nuclear extracts formed a specific complex with the hPTH VDRE that was insensitive to competition with other VDRE sequences. However, this factor could be competed for by a consensus NF-Y DNA-binding site, and an anti-NF-Y antibody was able to supershift the bound band. Mutational analysis indicated that the NF-Y-binding site partially overlapped the 3' portion of the VDRE. Transfection studies using an hPTH promoter construct in Drosophila SL2 cells demonstrated strong synergistic transactivation by NF-Y interactions with both the VDRE site and a previously described distal NF-Y-binding site. Finally, mobility shift studies indicated that the VDR heterodimer competed with NF-Y for binding to the VDRE sequence, and NF-Y-stimulated activity of the hPTH promoter could be suppressed in a hormone-dependent manner when the VDR heterodimer complex was coexpressed in SL2 cells. In summary, these findings establish the presence of a proximal NF-Y-binding site in the hPTH promoter and highlight the potential for synergism between distal and proximal NF-Y DNA elements to strongly enhance transcription. Furthermore, findings suggest that the repressive effects of vitamin D on hPTH gene transcription may involve displacement of NF-Y binding to the proximal site by the VDR heterodimer, which subsequently attenuates synergistic transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2153078135,"The nature of coloration in many marine animals remains poorly investigated. Here we studied the blue pigment of a scyfoid jellyfish Rhizostoma pulmo and determined it to be a soluble extracellular 30-kDa chromoprotein with a complex absorption spectrum peaking at 420, 588, and 624 nm. Furthermore, we cloned the corresponding cDNA and confirmed its identity by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry experiments. The chromoprotein, named rpulFKz1, consists of two domains, a Frizzled cysteine-rich domain and a Kringle domain, inserted into one another. Generally, Frizzleds are members of a basic Wnt signal transduction pathway investigated intensely with regard to development and cancerogenesis. Kringles are autonomous structural domains found throughout the blood clotting and fibrinolytic proteins. Neither Frizzled and Kringle domains association with any type of coloration nor Kringle intrusion into Frizzled sequence was ever observed. Thus, rpulFKz1 represents a new class of animal pigments, whose chromogenic group remains undetermined.

Pigments in nature play important roles ranging from camouflage coloration and sunscreen to visual reception and participation in biochemical pathways (1Britton G. The Biochemistry of Natural Pigments. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1983Google Scholar). Considering the spectral diversity of pigment-based coloration in animals one can conclude that blue pigments occur relatively rare (as a rule blue coloration results from light diffraction or scattering rather than the presence of a blue pigment). At least partially this fact is explained by an inevitably more complex structure of blue pigments compared to yellow-reds. To appear blue a compound must contain an extended and usually highly polarized system of the conjugated π-electrons.In many organisms blue coloration is achieved by combining a chromophore with a specific apoprotein, which organizes the chromophore and provides red-shift upon binding. For example, carotenoprotein crustacyanin, a well studied blue pigment from the lobster shell, contains orange carotenoid astaxanthin, which demonstrates a strong bathochromic shift due to noncovalent binding to a protein of lipocalin family (2Cianci M. Rizkallah P.J. Olczak A. Raftery J. Chayen N.E. Zagalsky P.F. Helliwell J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9795-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Several known types of protein-based animal pigments can be distinguished: carotenoproteins (including rhodopsins, where carotenoids feature an unusual covalent bond to apoprotein), heme-, flavin-, or metal-containing proteins, pterins, melanins, ommochromes (1Britton G. The Biochemistry of Natural Pigments. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1983Google Scholar), and members of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. family (3Matz M.V. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Each type is characterized by specific chromogenic groups and protein sequences.In the present work we studied the blue pigment of the scyfoid jellyfish Rhizostoma pulmo. We anticipated to find either a carotenoprotein (being the most widely spread pigment class (1Britton G. The Biochemistry of Natural Pigments. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1983Google Scholar)) or GFP-like chromoprotein (as many fluorescent and colored GFP-like proteins were found earlier in Cnidaria (3Matz M.V. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). However, this work revealed a new class of pigments based on a unique combination of well known Frizzled and Kringle protein domains that are tightly bound to a chromogenic group of an unknown structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Blue Pigment from R. pulmo—Specimens of jellyfish R. pulmo possessing intense blue coloration on the bell margins were collected at the Russian shores of the Black Sea. Colored body pieces were excised and placed for extraction into sea water at 4 °C for 4–7 days (the blue pigment is stable and retains coloration when stored as described for at least several months) so that significant amounts of the pigment were extracted into solution. The resulting solution was chloroform-extracted twice. The aquatic fraction was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. First, ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 60% saturation. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation while the blue pigment remained in solution. Addition of ammonium sulfate up to 100% saturation resulted in precipitation of the blue substance as floating flakes. These flakes were collected by centrifugation and dissolved with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.5.Standard protein denaturing discontinuous SDS-PAGE in 12% gel was used to analyze heated and unheated pigment samples.Gel-filtration was performed using a AKTAprime chromatograph (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were loaded onto Sephadex S-200 and Sephadex S-400 columns (0.7 × 60 cm) and eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. The columns were calibrated using molecular weight GF-200 standards from Sigma including blue dextran (molecular weight: 2 × 106).Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra were generated using Beckman DU520 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence analysis was performed by Varian Carry Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. rpulFKz1 Gene Cloning—Total RNA from small pieces of R. pulmo bell margins were isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Clontech). cDNA was synthesized and amplified with a SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech).The ammonium sulfate-purified protein sample was applied to a 12% SDS-PAGE without boiling, and a colored band of ∼30 kDa was transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane and sequenced on an automatic protein sequencer. Twenty N-terminal amino acid residues were identified, reading SAVPAKMVQLLREKVPLNIE. The following degenerated primers were designed corresponding to the amino acid sequences SAVPAK and SAVPAKMV: 5′-ATGTCTGCTGTTCCNGCNAA and 5′-TCTGCTGTTCCTGCNAA(A/G)ATGGT. Step-out PCR strategy (4Matz M. Shagin D. Bogdanova E. Britanova O. Lukyanov S. Diatchenko L. Chenchik A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) was used to amplify and clone the 3′-fragment and then the 5′-fragment of the corresponding cDNA encoding the blue protein.Antibody Generation—A part of the rpulFKz1 Kringle domain, reading GECKMTTEGGDYRGKVSQTFDGVKCQAWDTQEPHRHSVTAKTHPND, was cloned into the pQE31 (Qiagen) expression vector using BamHI and KpnI cloning sites. Soluble protein was purified using TALON affinity resin (Clontech) and injected into two rabbits three times in the course of 3 months with 1 mg/injection. Anti-serum was used in Western blotting procedures.Western Blotting—Western blots were performed by electrophoretic transfer of proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE to a Hybond-C membrane. Upon electrophoretic transfer, membrane was blocked by 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS buffer, incubated with polyclonal anti-Kringle antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h, washed three times for 5 min each in PBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-rabbit IgG, washed in PBS three times for 5 min each, followed by exposure to horseradish peroxidase (TMB kit, Vector Laboratories).Mass Spectrometry—rpulFKz1 was purified with chloroform extraction and ammonium sulfate precipitation as for N-terminal sequencing, but instead of separating the monomeric subunit by gel electrophoresis, we used gel-filtration to purify the 1 × 108 Da fraction (multimeric form of the protein) on a Sephacryl S-400 column. The purity of the protein was confirmed by gel electrophoreses, which yielded a single band corresponding to a 28-kDa monomeric subunit of the rpulFKz1. The sample was handed to the “Center of Proteomic Researches” (Moscow, Russia) for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry of the trypsin-digested protein.RESULTSIn the summer of 2001 we collected several jellyfish specimens near the Russian shores of the Black Sea, readily identified as R. pulmo (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa) (Fig. 1A). The specimens featured dark blue bell fringe. Primary characterization of the blue pigment was carried out on crude extract. Extraction was performed by placing medusae pieces into filtered sea water and storing for several days at 4 °C. As a result, significant amounts of the pigment transferred from tissue into aqueous phase producing an intensely colored solution.To investigate the chemical nature of the pigment we performed several simple tests. First, phenol extraction of the colored samples was accomplished. This treatment resulted in a complete loss of the blue coloration. Since phenol denatures proteins we concluded that the blue pigment is protein-based. Then we found that treatment with chloroform did not alter the color of the aqueous phase. It is well known that chloroform is not such a strong denaturing agent as phenol, and some proteins with firm tertiary structure remain stable in the presence of chloroform. To examine Rhizostoma blue pigment for the presence of carotenoproteins, we used a common test, cold acetone extraction. Acetone did not extract any colored agents from the jellyfish tissues. We concluded that the blue pigment from Rhizostoma did not belong to the carotenoprotein family.To purify the blue protein we used precipitation with ammonium sulfate. It was determined that in saturated (NH4)2SO4 the pigment precipitated into floating blue flakes. Lower concentrations of ammonium sulfate did not significantly affect the pigment solubility allowing us to remove most of the ballast protein.When unboiled purified protein from the bell fringe was subjected to standard gel-electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the colored bands were clearly visible after the run (data not shown). The color of the pigment changed from blue to red. We attributed the color change of the pigment to SDS-dependent protein denaturing (see below), which could have disturbed the chromophore environment. The pigment migrated with approximate molecular masses of 30 kDa. The migration speed of the pigment changed upon the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to the loading buffer, resulting in a higher apparent molecular mass (∼32 kDa). This indicated that the colored protein possessed multiple sulfide bonds. Boiling did not affect the apparent molecular mass of the pigment. Surprisingly, gel-filtration experiments demonstrated the colored protein to be multimeric in the absence of SDS. When applied to chromatographic columns containing Sephacryl S-200 (fractionation range: 5 × 103 to 2.5×105 Da), the blue protein mostly eluted in the void volume. However, Sephacryl S-400 gel-filtration, which allows separation of globular proteins of up to 8 × 106 Da, resulted in the elution of an individual chromatographic peak, tailing into the low molecular mass zone. Summing up, we must consider a multimeric protein-based pigment with the upper mass limit close to 1 × 107 Da consisting of apoprotein monomers of less than 30 kDa.The absorption spectrum of the purified pigment was obtained, peaking at 588 nm with a shoulder at 555 nm and smaller peaks at 420 and 624 nm (Fig. 2). Upon the addition of SDS the spectrum of rpulFKz1 became a single absorption peak with a maximum at 490 nm. Sample heating resulted in a strong blue shift of the absorption maximum up to 395 nm. No fluorescence in the visible part of the spectrum was detected from any spectral form.Fig. 2Absorption spectra for R. pulmo-purified blue pigment (solid line), pigment in 10% SDS (dashed line), and heated pigment (dotted line) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As the colored band on the SDS-PAGE of the ammonium sulfate-purified sample was well separated from the neighboring protein bands, we decided to obtain the N-terminal sequence for the pigment. We have directly sequenced the first 20 amino acids and designed corresponding degenerated primers. Together with oligo(dT)-containing primer they were used for the amplification of the specific cDNA 3′ fragment. After cloning and sequencing of this fragment, we used the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure (4Matz M. Shagin D. Bogdanova E. Britanova O. Lukyanov S. Diatchenko L. Chenchik A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) to obtain the corresponding 5′ flank of this cDNA. As a result, the sequence of the whole coding region for Rhizostoma blue protein was obtained (GenBank™ accession number AY507144). Standard BLAST analysis revealed two clearly detectable domains within the new protein: a so called Frizzled cysteine-rich domain and a Kringle domain (Fig. 1B). Notably, in R. pulmo pigment the Kringle domain is inserted into the primary structure of the Frizzled sequence. We named the pigment rpulFKz1 to emphasize the origin and domain architecture of the protein (from R. pulmoFrizzled-Kringle-Frizzled).To confirm the identity of the obtained sequence and the jellyfish pigment we performed additional experiments. First, the immunochemical approach was applied. We generated polyclonal antibodies against recombinant polypeptide corresponding to a part of the rpulFKz1 Kringle domain. Protein samples from different Rhizostoma body parts were probed with these antibodies. We confirmed that anti-Kringle antibodies stain the bands that appear colored on acrylamide gels (data not shown). Second, we utilized mass spectroscopy on gel-filtration-purified fragmented jellyfish pigment comparing theoretical and experimental data. One must emphasize that unlike the initial protein sequencing experiments, when SDS-PAGE was used to obtain monomers of the apoprotein, this independent sample consisted of a polymeric fraction with a mean molecular mass of 106 Da. The sample was subjected to trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-TOF analysis. Alignment of experimental mass fingerprints against theoretical digests of rpulFKz1 covered 79% of the protein sequence, proving protein identity (Fig. 1B). The under-representation of 21% of the actual protein sequence by experimental peptide masses has the following reasons: (i) Fz domains are known to be glycosylated, and a potential N-glycosylation site is predicted in the sequence of rpulFKz1 in a peptide missing from the spectrogram (Fig. 1B); (ii) 16% of the protein length is represented by short fragments (molecular mass under 650 Da, 1–6 amino acid residues) and were not aimed to be detected (though 11 residues were detected as parts of longer peptides); (iii) the presence of a covalently bound chromophoric group might change the expected peptide mass.DISCUSSIONBlue proteinaceous pigments are known in a variety of plant and animal species. Upon observing the basic characteristics of rpulFKz1 we started wondering whether similar pigments had ever been described. The unusual shape of the absorption spectrum and the color change in the presence of SDS and after rpulFKz1 heating closely resemble the spectral properties of the pigment named Cassio Blue from the related jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana (5Blanquet R.S. Phelan M.A. Marine Biol. 1987; 94: 423-430Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Considering the similarity of the spectral and biochemical properties one can conclude that rpulFKz1 and Cassio Blue represent the same class of pigments. No primary structure was assigned to the Cassiopea pigment. The authors only inferred that the pigment is based on Cys-rich multimeric glycoprotein consisting of about 30-kDa monomers that carry covalently bound chromophore, which does not belong to any known pigment compounds. Cassio Blue is thought to provide photoprotection for the symbiotic algae in the jelly. As Cassio Blue was visually observed in mesoglea only and not inside cells, it was unclear whether jelly or algae cells are the source of the pigment. rpulFKz1 is also distributed throughout mesoglea, but R. pulmo hosts no algae. Thus, it is very likely that Cassio Blue pigment is of the jellyfish origin.The study of Cassio Blue failed to reveal the chemical nature of its chromophore. Analogously, in the case of rpulFKz1 we only can conclude that the chromogenic group is attached tightly (most probably covalently) to the protein chain and that the chromophore properties are dissimilar to those of common classes of pigments. Some hints about the site of chromophore attachment in rpulFKz1 can be derived from mass spectrometry of its tryptic digest. Three stretches of the protein were not detected in the spectrogram (Fig. 1B). Among other explanations of these results there exists a strong possibility of the chromophore being linked with one of the three stretches identified. Further studies are required to identify chromophore structure and its localization in rpulFKz1 and related pigments.The domain content and structure of rpulFKz1 are of special interest. rpulFKz1 features two well known domains, Frizzled and Kringle. Moreover, in rpulFKz1 the Kringle domain is inserted into the primary structure of the Frizzled domain. More often, these domains constitute separate proteins with very different functions. Frizzled cysteine-rich domains are conserved in diverse proteins and organisms, and all known family members serve as binding domains for Wnt growth factors. Wnts are known to be involved in diverse developmental processes such as cell differentiation, cell polarity, and cell proliferation (6Strutt D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Along with Frizzled-containing membrane receptors for Wnt, there is a class of soluble secreted Frizzled-related proteins that act as Wnt antagonists (7Jones S.E. Jomary C. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Kringles are autonomous structural domains found throughout the blood clotting and fibrinolytic proteins (8Angles-Cano E. Rojas G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Kringle 5, sharing the strongest homology to rpulFKz1, can regulate cell proliferation (9Gonzalez-Gronow M. Kalfa T. Johnson C.E. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To date, the only protein family found to contain both Frizzled and Kringle domains is Ror-like receptor tyrosine kinases, which play a crucial role in the developmental processes of invertebrates and vertebrates (10Yoda A. Oishi I. Minami Y. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To our best knowledge, neither Frizzled and Kringle domains association with any type of coloration nor Kringle intrusion into the Frizzled sequence was ever observed.Both Kringle and Frizzled domains are cysteine-rich, and the positions of the Cys residues are highly conserved. rpulFKz1 contains 14 out of 16 characteristic cysteine residues typically found in the cysteine-rich domains of Frizzleds and Kringles. Two cysteines, which rpulFKz1 lacks, belong to the Frizzled domain and would normally form a S–S bond. The rpulFKz1 Kringle domain possesses the majority of the conserved amino acid residues (Fig. 1B), known to form a ligand-binding cavity in the Kringle domains (11Thewes T. Constantine K. Byeon I.J. Llinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3906-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chang Y. Mochalkin I. McCance S.G. Cheng B. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3258-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Probably, rpulFKz1 ligand specificity is similar to that of other Kringle 5 domains. Comparison of the rpulFKz1 Frizzled domain with other Frizzleds shows that the molecular surface region important for Wnt binding (13Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) is reasonably conserved and is not disrupted by the Kringle domain insertion. Thus, we must not rule out the possibility of the rpulFKz1-Wnt interaction in the jelly that should result in local Wnt inhibition and cell fate alteration. Thus body patterning variations may become visible due to the unique rpulFKz1 properties. Further investigation of the Wnt pathway components interaction in Cnidaria may shed light upon the origin of growth factor-mediated morphogenesis. Pigments in nature play important roles ranging from camouflage coloration and sunscreen to visual reception and participation in biochemical pathways (1Britton G.

https://openalex.org/W2089258196,"Human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) catalyzes the O2-dependent oxidation of heme to biliverdin, CO, and free iron. Previous work indicated that electrophilic addition of the terminal oxygen of the ferric hydroperoxo complex to the α-meso-carbon gives 5-hydroxyheme. Earlier efforts to block this reaction with a 5-methyl substituent failed, as the reaction still gave biliverdin IXα. Surprisingly, a 15-methyl substituent caused exclusive cleavage at the γ-meso-rather than at the normal, unsubstituted α-meso-carbon. No CO was formed in these reactions, but the fragment cleaved from the porphyrin eluded identification. We report here that hHO-1 cleaves 5-phenylheme to biliverdin IXα and oxidizes 15-phenylheme at the α-meso position to give 10-phenylbiliverdin IXα. The fragment extruded in the oxidation of 5-phenylheme is benzoic acid, one oxygen of which comes from O2 and the other from water. The 2.29- and 2.11-Å crystal structures of the hHO-1 complexes with 1- and 15-phenylheme, respectively, show clear electron density for both the 5- and 15-phenyl rings in both molecules of the asymmetric unit. The overall structure of 15-phenylheme-hHO-1 is similar to that of heme-hHO-1 except for small changes in distal residues 141–150 and in the proximal Lys18 and Lys22. In the 5-phenylheme-hHO-1 structure, the phenyl-substituted heme occupies the same position as heme in the heme-HO-1 complex but the 5-phenyl substituent disrupts the rigid hydrophobic wall of residues Met34, Phe214, and residues 26–42 near the α-meso carbon. The results provide independent support for an electrophilic oxidation mechanism and support a role for stereochemical control of the reaction regiospecificity.

The 2.29- and 2.11-Å crystal structures of the hHO-1 complexes with 1- and 15-phenylheme, respectively, show clear electron density for both the 5- and 15-phenyl rings in both molecules of the asymmetric unit. The overall structure of 15-phenylheme-hHO-1 is similar to that of heme-hHO-1 except for small changes in distal residues 141–150 and in the proximal Lys18 and Lys22. In the 5-phenylheme-hHO-1 structure, the phenyl-substituted heme occupies the same position as heme in the heme-HO-1 complex but the 5-phenyl substituent disrupts the rigid hydrophobic wall of residues Met34, Phe214, and residues 26–42 near the α-meso carbon. The results provide independent support for an electrophilic oxidation mechanism and support a role for stereochemical control of the reaction regiospecificity.

Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In humans and other mammals, the heme is cleaved exclusively at the α-meso position to give biliverdin IXα. The biliverdin then is reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase before it is conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the bile (2Schmid R. McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. VI. Academic Press, New York1979: 257-292Google Scholar). Bilirubin is a powerful physiological antioxidant (3Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar), but is neurotoxic at the high concentrations found in Criggler Najar patients and neonatal jaundice (4Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). CO, the second product of the reaction, is a gaseous messenger molecule that is thought to be involved in apoptosis (5Sass G. Soares M.C. Yamashita K.

Finally, the ferrous iron released by heme oxygenase is normally recycled and serves as the major source of this metal for hemoglobin and other hemoprotein synthesis, as only 1–3% of the iron utilized daily in the synthesis of red blood cells is obtained from the diet (11Uzel C. Conrad M.E. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 27-34PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to its other functions, heme oxygenase plays a vital role in maintaining iron homeostasis. In mammals, there are three heme oxygenase isoforms, namely HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3. HO-1 is inducible and present in highest concentration in spleen and liver. It is a stress protein also known as heat shock protein 32 that has been extensively studied because it is induced by a variety of agents, including heme, metals, hormones, oxidizing agents, and drugs (4Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar, 12Choi A.M. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that HO-1 can prevent the inflammatory responses caused by adenovirus vectors in gene therapy (13McCarter S.D. Scott J.R. Lee P.J. Zhang X. Choi A.M. McLean C.A. Badhwar A. Dungey A.A. Bihari A. Harris K.A. Potter R.F. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 1629-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is also a remarkably protective gene against allograft rejection (14Soares M.P. Brouard S. Smith R.N. Bach F.H. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 184: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Visner G.A. Lu F. Zhou H. Latham C. Agarwal A. Zander D.S. Transplantation. 2003; 76: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HO-2 is constitutive and is found in highest concentration in the brain and testes. It may be involved in signaling pathways that involve CO and has been suggested to act as a nitric oxide sink (16Ding Y. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although this latter role remains controversial. HO-3 is also expressed constitutively, but it is a poor catalyst, and its role, if any, is unclear (17McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The mammalian heme oxygenases are membrane bound. However, a truncated human HO-1 construct (265 amino acids, hHO-1) lacking the 23 C-terminal amino acids is fully active and is water soluble (18Wilks A. Black S.M. Miller W.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The successful expression of this truncated hHO-1 in Escherichia coli has greatly facilitated the molecular level characterization of hHO-1. The mechanism of heme oxidation by heme oxygenase has been partially elucidated (19Auclair K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kadish K. Smith K. Guilard R. Porphyrin Handbook. 12. Academic Press, New York2002: 183-210Google Scholar). Heme is converted to biliverdin IXα via two observable intermediates, 5-hydroxyheme and α-verdoheme (Fig. 1). Oxidation of heme to 5-hydroxyheme and of verdoheme to iron biliverdin requires NADPH-P450 reductase and O2. The intervening step in which 5-hydroxyheme is converted to verdoheme only requires O2 and results in the release of CO. The degradation of heme by heme oxygenase is highly regiospecific. In mammals, heme is exclusively cleaved at the α-meso position to give biliverdin IXα (20Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 21O'Carra P. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Sciences B. V., Amsterdam1975: 123-153Google Scholar). However, the heme oxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa oxidizes heme to biliverdin IXβ and IXδ (22Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Torpey et al. (23Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26067-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) attempted in 1996 to use 5-methylmesoheme to block 5-hydroxylation and thus to inhibit the heme oxygenase reaction. Surprisingly, this compound was itself oxidized to biliverdin IXα, albeit without the formation of CO. Equally surprising was the finding that 15-methylmesoheme was exclusively cleaved at the γ position despite the presence of the normally oxidized, unsubstituted α position. Unfortunately it was not possible in these earlier studies to identify the product containing the methyl group and the α- or γ-meso-carbon atom. Nevertheless, the fact that CO was not formed clearly established that this unexpected oxidation did not involve initial removal of the methyl group from the meso-methylheme to give heme itself, which then underwent normal cleavage. To further characterize the mechanism governing the degradation of the meso-substituted heme, we have now examined the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of the 5- and 15-phenylhemes (Fig. 2). A phenyl substituent was employed for these studies because its chromophore would facilitate identification and isolation of the fragment containing the meso-substituent and the meso-carbon atom. This assumes, of course, that the phenyl-substituted hemes are bound and are oxidized by hHO-1. In fact, we report here that 5-phenylheme is oxidized at the α-meso position to give biliverdin IXα with the concomitant release of benzoic acid. In contrast, unlike 15-methylheme, 15-phenylheme is exclusively cleaved at the normal α-meso position. The crystal structures of the 5- and 15-phenylheme complexes with hHO-1 have also been determined to clarify the structural perturbations caused by the phenyl substituent. The results clarify the mechanism of the heme cleavage and the origin of the reaction regiospecificity. Materials—5-Phenylheme, 15-phenylheme, and the biliverdin isomers derived from the dimethyl esters of 5-phenylheme and 15-phenylheme (Fig. 2) were prepared as reported previously (24Robinsohn A.E. Maier M.S. Buldain G.Y. Heterocycles. 2000; 53: 2127-2142Crossref Google Scholar, 25Niemevz F. Alvarez D.E. Buldain G.Y. Heterocycles. 2002; 57: 697-704Crossref Google Scholar, 26Niemevz F. Buldain G.Y. J. Porphyrins Phthalocyanines. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The dimethyl-esterified biliverdin isomers were generated by published procedures (27Crusats J. Suzuki A. Mizutani T. Ogoshi H. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 18O2 and H 182O were from ICON Isotopes (Summit, NJ). Ampicillin, NADPH, Mb, sodium ascorbate, trifluoroacetic acid, and sodium dithionite were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich. Quaternary ammonium cellulose (QA52) was from Whatman Inc. BL21 (DE3) plysS-competent cells were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Methanol (HPLC grade) was from Fisher Scientific, the YMC™ ODS-AQ C18 column (S-5, 120 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm) was from Walters Corp., and the Sephadex G-50 quick spin column was from Roche Applied Science. Enzymes—A truncated human heme oxygenase 1 (hHO-1) retaining amino acids 1–265 but lacking the 23 C-terminal amino acids was used in this study (18Wilks A. Black S.M. Miller W.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Expression and purification were carried out as reported previously except that QA52 resin was used instead of the Q-Sepharose fast flow resin from Amersham Biosciences (28Wilks A. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2889-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The apo-hHO-1 was combined with excess heme, 5-phenylheme, or 15-phenylheme. The reconstituted hHO-1 (heme-hHO-1, 5-hHO-1, 15-hHO-1, respectively) was purified by passage through an Amersham Biosciences PD-10 desalting column pre-equilibrated with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (defined here as the standard buffer). Human P450 reductase and rat biliverdin reductase were expressed and purified by published procedures (29Shen A.L. Christensen M.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol.

UV-visible Spectra of Heme-hHO-1, 5-hHO-1, and 15-hHO-1—The spectra were recorded in standard buffer at room temperature on a Cary Varian model 1E spectrophotometer. Spectrophotometric Monitoring of Bilirubin Formation Using P450 Reductase and Biliverdin Reductase—The reaction mixture contained 6 μg of heme-hHO-1, 4 μm rat biliverdin reductase, 0.4 μm P450 reductase, and 30 μm heme in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. Bilirubin formation was initiated by the addition of NADPH (400 μm). The formation of bilirubin was monitored at 468 nm at 30-s intervals. For 5-phenylheme, the reaction mixture contained 5-hHO-1 and 5-phenylheme, and for 15-phenylheme, 15-hHO-1 and 15-phenylheme. All the reactions were performed at room temperature in standard buffer. Spectrophotometric Monitoring of Fe(III) Biliverdin Formation Using Sodium Ascorbate—Heme-hHO-1, 5-hHO-1, or 15-hHO-1 (10 μm) was incubated at room temperature with sodium ascorbate (3 mm) in 200 μl of standard buffer for 1.5 h. The solution was then passed through a Sephadex G-50 quick spin column pre-equilibrated with standard buffer, and the UV-visible spectrum was recorded. CO Formation Assay Using Horse Deoxymyoglobin as a CO Trap— Heme-hHO-1, 5-hHO-1, or 15-hHO-1 (10 μm) in 1 ml of standard buffer was incubated in air tight vials at room temperature for 10 min with NADPH (400 μm) and P450 reductase (1 μm). Fe(II) Mb (50 μl, 83 μm) was then added to the solution via a syringe to a final concentration of 4 μm. The solution was shaken well, and the UV-visible spectrum was recorded. The Fe(II) Mb (83 μm) was freshly prepared by adding sodium dithionite solution (70 μl, 1 m) to a metMb solution (350 μl, 100 μm) without further purification. HPLC Analysis of Biliverdin Isomers—Heme-hHO-1, 5-hHO-1, or 15-hHO-1 (45 nmol) was incubated with NADPH (3.4 μmol) and P450 reductase (4.5 nmol) in standard buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction volume was 650 μl. The reaction mixture turned reddish in the case of 5-hHO-1 and green in the case of heme-hHO-1 and 15-hHO-1. Methanol was added to a final concentration of 60%, and the resulting mixture was subjected to centrifugation. To the supernatant was added 1 drop of concentrated HCl plus a few drops of acetic acid before the solution was extracted with an equal volume of CH2Cl2. The organic phase was washed with an equal volume of water and was then evaporated under a stream of air. The residual products were dissolved in methanol/5% H2SO4 (v/v), and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 16 h. The resulting dimethyl-esterified products were extracted with CHCl3 and washed with water. The organic phase was dried under a stream of air, and the residue was dissolved in methanol. Before loading onto a YMC™ ODS-AQ C18 column, the concentration of methanol was adjusted to 60–70%. Coupled oxidation with sodium ascorbate was carried out by incubating each of the complexes, i.e. heme-hHO-1, 15-hHO-1, or 5-hHO-1 (45 nmol), with sodium ascorbate (13 mg) in standard buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction volume was ∼320 μl. The degradation products went through the same procedures as above for HPLC analysis. The dimethyl-esterified products were loaded onto a YMC™ ODS-AQ C18 column. HPLC was done with a Varian 1090 solvent delivery system and a Hewlett-Packard 1040A detector at room temperature. Solvents A and B were H2O and methanol, respectively. The running conditions were the following: flow rate, 1.0 ml/min; 30% B for 5 min, 30–70% B in 0.1 min, 70–95% B in 25 min, 95% B for 10 min, 95–30% B in 5 min, and finally 30% B for 20 min. The eluent was monitored at 380 nm and referenced against 598 nm. HPLC Analysis of the Fragment Containing the α-Carbon and Phenyl Group—The heme-hHO-1, 5-hHO-1, or 15-hHO-1 complex (∼7 nmol) was incubated with NADPH (400 nmol) and P450 reductase (0.6 nmol) in standard buffer at room temperature for at least 1 h. Methanol and trichloroacetic acid were then added to the reaction solution to final concentrations of 60 and 10%, respectively. The resulting solution stood on ice for at least 30 min. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a YMC ODS-AQ™ C18 column. HPLC was carried out at room temperature with a Varian 1090 solvent delivery system and a Hewlett-Packard 1040A detector, using the following conditions (solution A, H2O/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; solution B, methanol/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, flow rate, 1.0 ml/min): 10% B for 5 min, 10–30% B in 0.1 min, 30–55% B in 25 min, 55–95% B in 5 min, 95% B for 5 min, 95–10% B in 0.1 min, and 10% B for 15 min. Benzoic acid and benzaldehyde standards were dissolved in a mixture of standard buffer, 60% methanol, 10% trichloroacetic acid. The eluent was monitored at 230 and 254 nm and was referenced against the absorption at 598 nm. Benzoic acid has a maximum absorption at 230 nm and benzaldehyde at 254 nm The incubation of 5-hHO-1 with P450 reductase and NADPH was also performed in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase. The reaction went through the same experimental protocol as above. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the Species Containing the α-Carbon and Phenyl Group—5-hHO-1 or heme-hHO-1 (29 nmol) was incubated with P450 reductase (2.9 nmol) and NADPH (1.8 μmol) at room temperature for 2 h. The final reaction volume was 116 μl. The reaction mixture was injected into a Waters Micromass ZQ Mass Spectrometer. The equipment was run under electrospray ionization in negative ion mode (ES– mode), and the mass spectra were analyzed using the MassLynx™ 3.5 program. The mass spectrum of 5-hHO-1 alone was also obtained as a control. Origin of the Oxygen Atoms in the Benzoic Acid from Oxidation of 5-Phenylheme—Oxidation of 5-phenylheme by hHO-1 was carried out in either 18O2 or H218O. For the reaction in 18O2, 5-hHO-1 (10 μl, 2.95 mm) and P450 reductase (5.8 μl, 274 μm) were added to 100 μl of standard buffer on the bottom of a two-necked flask. One drop of NADPH (30 μl, 0.1 m) was spotted separately on the inner wall. Air was removed by three cycles of purging with argon gas and placing under vacuum. NADPH was then mixed with the enzymes by shaking the flask slightly followed by introduction of 18O2 into the flask. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 0.5 h before it was passed through an ultracentrifugal filter device (10,000 molecular weight cutoff, Millipor Amicon®) to remove the protein before analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). For the reaction in H 182O, a mixture of 5-hHO-1 (5.4 μl, 2.95 mm) and P450 reductase (2.9 μl, 274 μm) was lyophilized for 1 h, dissolved in 50 μlofH 182O, and relyophilized for 1 h. The residue was dissolved in 100 μl of H 182O and was then mixed with 4 μl of NADPH (1 m in H 182O). The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 0.5 h before it was passed through the ultracentrifugal filter device to remove the protein before analysis by LC-MS. LC-MS was performed on a Waters Micromass ZQ coupled to a Waters Alliance HPLC system (2695 Separations Module, Waters 2487 Dual λ Absorbance detector) employing an Xterra® MS C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm). For the chromatography, solvent A was 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in water and solvent B was methanol. The column was eluted with 5% solvent B (95% solvent A) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 230 nm. The MS settings were: mode, ES–; capillary voltage, 2.9 kv; cone voltage, 20 v; source temperature, 130 °C; desolvation temperature, 300 °C. Masses 115–200 were scanned with a scan time of 0.2 s. The control experiment was performed by incubation of 5-hHO-1 (29 nmol) with P450 reductase (2.9 nmol) and NADPH (1.8 μmol) in 100 μl of standard buffer for 0.5 h. Crystallography—Crystals of 15-hHO-1 and 5-hHO-1 were grown under slightly different conditions than those described previously (32Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1836-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method with a well solution of 2.0–1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.9% 1,6-hexanediol, and 10–30% Jeffamine ED-600. Drops consisted of protein stock (5 μl) at 65 mg ml–1 in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, mixed with well solution (5 μl). Crystals were grown at room temperature, and one round of touch seeding using crushed wild-type crystals was necessary to initiate 15-hHO-1 crystal growth. For 5-hHO-1 macro seeding had to be used to obtain crystals of suitable size for data collection. For cryogenic data collection d-(+)-trehalose was used as the cryoprotectant. Cryogenic data collection involved a seven-step transfer to artificial precipitant solution with increased d-(+)-trehalose concentration up to 35% (w/v). Heme-hHO-1 and 5-hHO-1 crystals belong to the monoclinic space group, P21, whereas 15-hHO-1 crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group, P212121. Cell dimensions of all the crystal forms are listed in Table I. Data were collected using an R-AXIS IV imaging plate detector equipped with a rotating copper anode x-ray generator with Osmic optics (Rigaku). For this data set, a 180° scan using 1° frames was collected. Crystals were maintained at –160 °C in a stream of nitrogen (Crystal Logic, Los Angeles). Data were reduced using HKL 2000 (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), and rejections were performed with ENDHKL (Louis Sanchez, California Institute of Technology) in conjunction with SCALEPACK.Table IData collection and refinement statistics15hHO-15h-HO-1Protein Data Bank code1S131T5PCrystal dataRadiation sourceRaxis-IVRaxis-IVSpace groupP212121P21Cell parameters (Å) and β (°)a = 55.0, b = 75.75 c = 107.3, β = 90.00a = 52.91, b = 64.43 c = 60.47, β = 90.02Data collectionDetector distance (nm)140140Molecules per asymmetric unit22Resolution (Å)2.292.11Mosaicity (°)0.671.1Total observations241,896308,112Unique reflections49,10262,102Completeness (%)99.991.8Mean I/σ11.5 (2.1)10.1 (2.0)Rsym (%)5.1 (46.7)5.4 (49.3)Refinement statisticsaRcryst = Σ(|Fobs| - |Fcalc|)/Σ |Fobs|.

The best cross-rotation and translation function solutions were rigid body-refined and fixed in place followed by a search for the remaining molecule in the asymmetric unit. A total of two solutions was found per structure, corresponding to the expected two monomers per asymmetric unit. The final R-factors were 38 and 42% with correlation coefficients of 63 and 52% for 15-hHO-1 and 5-hHO-1, respectively. The structures were further refined in CNS (37Brünger A.T. Adams P.D.

The structures were initially refined by simulated annealing, followed by a few cycles of conjugate gradient minimization and water picking. Finally, temperature factors were refined. No restraints for non-crystallographic symmetry were applied. The program O (38Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Backbone geometry was checked with PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and none of the residues were in the disallowed region. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I, and the Protein Data Bank coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1S13 and 1T5P). UV-visible Spectra of Heme-hHO-1, 5-hHO-1, and 15-hHO-1— Apo-hHO-1 was combined with heme, 5-phenylheme, or 15-phenylheme and the resulting reconstituted heme oxygenase was immediately purified. The UV-visible spectra of the three reconstituted complexes (Fig. 3) show that both heme-hHO-1 and 5-hHO-1 have a Soret absorption maximum at 404 nm, whereas the maximum of the 15-hHO-1 complex is at 408 nm. As the Soret maxima in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 of free heme, 5-phenylheme, and 15-phenylheme are at 364, 388, and 388 nm, respectively, there is a differential shift in the Soret maxima when they are bound in the hHO-1 active site. The shift for 5-phenylheme is 4 nm less than for 15-phenylheme, and both of the phenylhemes undergo a smaller shift than heme itself. These results confirm that the meso-phenyl hemes are able to bind to hHO-1 and suggest that their binding causes some perturbation of the active site. Bilirubin and CO Formation Using P450 Reductase and Biliverdin Reductase—The normal degradation of heme by hHO-1 gives biliverdin IXα and CO. The electrons required for the degradation of heme are provided by NADPH via P450 reductase. Biliverdin IXα is then reduced to bilirubin IXα by biliverdin reductase. As shown in Fig. 4A, these combined reactions cause a decrease in the heme Soret absorption at 404 nm and the accumulation of bilirubin with an absorption maximum at 468 nm. For 5-phenylheme, the reaction gives very similar UV-visible spectral changes (Fig. 4B), i.e. a decrease in the Soret band intensity associated with an increase in absorption at 468 nm. For 15-phenylheme, however, the UV-visible spectral changes are different in that the absorption of both the Soret b"
https://openalex.org/W2036971132,"The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway for degradation of completed and nascent globin chains was evaluated using a cell-free in vitro coupled transcription/translation assay. No decrease in radiolabeled globin chains was observed when ubiquitin, energy regenerating source (or ATP), and E1 and E2 enzymes were added 30 min after the start of translation when globin chain synthesis had plateaued. In contrast, the addition of these components prior to the start of translation resulted in no radiolabeled globin chains after 30 min. The loss of radiolabeled globin chains was dependent on ATP concentration; the higher the concentration, the less the radiolabeled globin chains formed. Prior to the initiation of transcription/translation, cell extract was preincubated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 in the absence of globin chain expression vector after which ubiquitin-protein isopeptidase inhibitor, Ubal, and expression vector were added in the presence of 1.5 mm ATP. Thereafter, radiolabeled monoubiquitylated and multiubiquitylated globin chains with few unmodified globin chains were formed. Our results suggest that polyubiquitylated globin chains are localized to the polysomal fractions. These results suggest that nascent globin chains are potential targets for ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation during or soon after translation and that ATP levels play a role in the balance between polypeptide synthesis and degradation.

In general, cells have the capability of repairing errors of incorrectly folded nascent peptides or removing them during translation as well as degrading unnecessary and/or misfolded cytoplasmic proteins (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The important factors in this process include molecular chaperones and energy-dependent proteases. Much is known regarding protein synthesis during erythropoiesis, but molecular chaperones and energy-dependent degradation including ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of globin chains in erythroid cells are not completely understood, even though characterization of the mammalian ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes was done primarily using reticulocyte extracts (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 335-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In fact, in human erythrocyte differentiation, a combination of selective protein synthesis, degradation, and nuclear extrusion brings about extensive cellular reorganization and dramatic changes in protein composition (3Wefes I. Mastrandrea L.D. Haldeman M. Koury S.T. Tamburlin J. Pickart C.M. Finley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4982-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The roles of ubiquitin in protein degradation as well as some of the enzymes involved were elucidated in biochemical studies using cell-free systems (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 335-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). A major pathway of protein breakdown involves covalent conjugation of proteolytic substrates to ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid polypeptide (4Wilkinson K.D. Urban M.K. Hass A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7529-7532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrate proceeds via a three-step mechanism. Initially, ubiquitin is activated in its C-terminal Gly by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; Hb, hemoglobin; Ubal, ubiquitin aldehyde; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, isopeptide ligase; ERS; energy regenerating source. via an ATP-dependent reaction. Following activation, one of several E2 enzymes (ubiquitin-carrier proteins or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes) transfers ubiquitin from E1 to a member of the ubiquitin protein ligase family, E3, to which the substrate protein is bound, resulting in the formation of a polyubiquitin chain. The polyubiquitin-conjugated protein is then degraded through the 26 S ATP-dependent proteasome complex (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The identification of specific translated proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin system appears to be based on recognition by particular E2 and E3 families of specific motifs in the targeted protein such as the N-terminal amino acid residue or certain amino acid sequences elsewhere in the protein (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 6Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Although the enzymatic mechanism by which ubiquitin is conjugated to protein has been well characterized, the process by which protein substrates, especially incompletely folded nascent polypeptide chains, are recognized co-translationally by the ubiquitin conjugation machinery is unresolved (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 335-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 6Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 7Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). In fact, recently, Turner and Varshavsky (8Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. Science. 2000; 289: 2117-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) showed that the folding of nascent proteins competes with co-translational degradation via the ubiquitin conjugation pathway. Understanding the process of degradation of excess and/or incompletely folded globin chains as well as assembly of globin chains is critical to a comprehensive analysis of formation of stable and functional hemoglobins in vivo. In addition, molecular controls of co-translational, ubiquitin-mediated degradation as well as folding/assembly of globin chains should be relevant to the etiology of the hemoglobinopathies and their therapy. Our previous assembly studies of the formation of Hb A and Hb F using purified globin chain subunits and a cell-free coupled transcription/translation system suggested that α-chains bind to monomeric non-α-chains during or soon after translation but prior to the formation of stable homodimers (9Adachi K. Zhao Y. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13415-13420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Adachi K. Zhao Y. Surrey S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, this binding promotes the formation of functional tetrameric hemoglobin in vivo. Understanding the process of degradation of excess globin chains as well as the assembly of globin chains in vivo is critical for gene therapy for sickle cell disease, because one therapeutic scenario involves the induction of excess globin chains (11Persons D.A. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5022-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, quality control including degradation of free excess or misfolded single globin chains as well as proper folding and assembly of subunits to form functional hemoglobin in cells is necessary to prevent accumulation of single chains, leading to red blood cell destruction. Previous studies showed that human α-globin was degraded by ATP-dependent proteolysis, whereas there was no ubiquitin-mediated degradation of tetrameric hemoglobin (12Shaeffer J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shaeffer J.R. Kania M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4015-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Shaeffer J.R. Cohen R.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in vitro energy-dependent proteolysis of purified α-globin chains was very slow (t½ ∼7 h) and they were poor substrates for ubiquitylation (12Shaeffer J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we evaluated the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in synthesis and degradation of completed as well as nascent globin chains during translation using a coupled transcription/translation cell-free system in vitro. cDNA Expression Vectors for Proteins—The plasmids pcDNA α, pcDNA β, pcDNA γ, pcDNA β-actin, pcDNA platelet factor 4, pcDNA GATA1, and pcDNA histone deacetylase contained the SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase promoter and the full-length cDNAs coding for these proteins. A commercially available wheat germ cell-free transcription/translation system obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) was used to generate radiolabeled polypeptide chains corresponding to the cDNA inserts (9Adachi K. Zhao Y. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13415-13420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Transcription in vitro by SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase generates the mRNAs, which then are translated in the wheat germ cell-free transcription/translation system that contains 15–30 units/ml creatine kinase, 15–30 μm creatine phosphate, and ∼1.5 mm ATP as an energy source as well as a concentration of 20 mm for each amino acid (with the exception of Met), 0.75 mm magnesium acetate, 90–110 mm KCl, and 5–20 mm dithiothreitol. Expression of Proteins in a Wheat Germ Cell-free Transcription/Translation System—The expression of proteins in a cell-free coupled transcription/translation system was performed using a TnT SP6 or T7-coupled wheat germ extract system kit (Promega) containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). A typical 50-μl reaction containing DNA template (2 μg) in the presence of cyano-hemin (5 × 10–6m) (10Adachi K. Zhao Y. Surrey S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was incubated for 30–60 min at 30 °C. Synthesized radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then visualized and quantified following autoradiography using a phosphorimaging analysis system (Storm 84D) (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro transcription/translation reactions to promote ubiquitylation were incubated in a total volume of 15.4 μl including an energy regenerating source (ERS) containing 5 mm Mg2+-ATP, creatine phosphokinase (0.3 units/ml), and creatine phosphate (10 μm) (Boston Biochem, Boston, MA). In addition, ubiquitin (1.5 mm) (Sigma), E1 and E2 enzymes (Boston Biochem, MA), ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis inhibitor MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO) (138 μm), and an inhibitor of deubiquitylation, ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal) (6 μm), which inhibits some deubiquitylating enzymes (5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 6Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 7Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), were added to some of the reactions. After incubation at 30 °C, 5 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer was added to reactions and 15 μl was used for SDS-PAGE analysis of radiolabeled protein bands. Antibody-mediated Isolation of Radiolabeled Bands Using Ubiquitin and β-Globin Chain Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies for ubiquitin and β-globin chains were obtained from Calbiochem and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. For isolation of radiolabeled ubiquitylated β-globin chains using β-globin and ubiquitin antibodies, after translation, 100 μl of in vitro transcription-translation reactions was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal ubiquitin antibody or 10 μg/ml human β-globin antibody to form antigen-antibody complexes. Reactions were incubated with 50 μl of protein G/A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C to bind antibody-antigen complexes. The mixture then was washed with the 500 μl of immunoprecipitating buffer (100 mm KCl, 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) four times and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and then were boiled for 10 min prior to electrophoresis on 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels followed by autoradiography. Generation of Polysome Profiles Using Reactions by Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—10–40% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were prepared in Beckman ultracentrifuge tubes (14 × 89 mm) using a two-chamber gradient mixer. Transcription/translation reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 35S-labeled methionine and 1.5 mm ATP following the addition of β-globin cDNA vector. Reactions then were incubated for an additional 10 min in the presence or absence of puromycin at room temperature and layered onto the gradients. The SW41 rotor and ultracentrifuge were precooled to 4 °C, and then the gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 100 min. Gradients were fractionated into 11 fractions (1 ml per fraction) collected from the top of the tube, and the fractions were monitored for UV absorbance at 254 nm with an ISCO UA-5 detector (Lincoln, NE). Proteins in each fraction were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 5% (w/v)), and pellets were dissolved by 10 μl of SDS (12% (w/v)) loading buffer prior to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels followed by autoradiography. Lack of Ubiquitin-mediated Proteolytic Degradation of Radiolabeled β-Globin Chains after Synthesis in a Cell-free Transcription/Translation System—Our previous results using a β-globin chain expression vector in the presence of hemin showed major radiolabeled bands of ∼16 kDa after SDS-PAGE, which co-migrated with purified human β-globin chains, whereas the expression plasmids lacking cDNA inserts showed no bands (9Adachi K. Zhao Y. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13415-13420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Some radiolabeled bands were observed of higher as well as lower molecular masses than ∼16 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating the production of radiolabeled, ubiquitylated, and partially degraded globin chains, respectively. The degree of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of newly synthesized globin chains was assessed following the addition of ubiquitin and an ERS after radiolabeled chain synthesis had plateaued (30 min) and further translation was terminated by the addition of cycloheximide. The addition of ERS (Fig. 1A) or E1 and E2 enzymes after a 30-min synthesis (Fig. 1B) had little or no effect on the intensities of 16-kDa globin chain bands after an additional 60-min incubation. Incubation in the presence of ubiquitin, ERS, E1 and E2 enzymes resulted in the generation of radiolabeled 52-kDa bands accompanied by decreased intensity of the 22 kDa band (Fig. 1, panel B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that E1 and E2 enzymes catalyzed the conversion of previously synthesized monoubiquitylated globin chains to polyubiquitylated globin bands during the 30–60-min incubation following a 30-min radiolabeled chain synthesis period. Further incubation for up to 6 h showed only an ∼10% decrease in intensity of the 16-kDa globin chain band (Fig. 1C). Results were the same whether or not unlabeled β-globin chains were present during translation. In addition, results using an α- or β-globin chain expression vector were the same, showing little or no ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of previously synthesized radiolabeled globin chains. Ubiquitin-mediated Proteolytic Degradation of Nascent Globin Chains Made in a Cell-free System—Newly translated nascent globin chains must undergo folding, heme insertion, and assembly with partner globin chains to form functional heterodimers and tetramers of Hb (9Adachi K. Zhao Y. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13415-13420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation of nascent globin chains was evaluated by monitoring the effects of the addition of ubiquitin, ERS, or E1 and E2 enzymes at zero time prior to the initiation of transcription/translation and following the incubation at 30 °C in the cell-free system. Radiolabeled β-globin chain levels were assessed by SDS-PAGE following 30- and 60-min incubations with 35S-labeled methionine employing the wheat germ cell-free system containing a β-globin cDNA expression vector. Autoradiographic intensities of radiolabeled β-globin chain bands following 30- and 60-min incubations were the same with or without ubiquitin addition at zero time (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, under the same conditions, the addition of ubiquitin and ERS at zero time resulted in no measurable ∼16-kDa β-chain radiolabeled bands following 30- and 60-min incubations (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). The loss of radiolabeled bands was dependent on ERS concentration. The dilution of ERS led to higher amounts of radiolabeled globin chain bands. Furthermore, the addition of E1 and E2 enzymes to reactions containing ubiquitin and ERS showed no radiolabeled globin chain band; however, higher molecular mass bands were evident (>52 kDa) (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–10). These results of no measurable radiolabeled globin chain band during transcription/translation in the presence of ubiquitin and ERS were the same regardless of whether α-, β-, or γ-globin cDNAs were used (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 1–6, respectively). We next attempted to identify the component(s) in the ERS (e.g. ATP, pyrophosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, creatine phosphate, and dithiothreitol), which was responsible for inhibiting accumulation of radiolabeled bands coded by the cDNA inserts in the transcription/translation reactions. A lack of appearance of radiolabeled bands could be due to the inhibition of polypeptide chain synthesis or to increased degradation of newly synthesized nascent globin chains. The addition of pyrophosphatase alone did not decrease radiolabeled β-globin chain band intensity, although pyrophosphatase and ATP did decrease the band intensity. The addition of >5 mm Mg2+-ATP (∼3.5 times higher than the optimal amount required for protein synthesis) was critical for complete inhibition of radiolabeled globin chain accumulation (Fig. 3). Also noteworthy is that the addition of ERS containing 5 mm Mg2+-ATP and ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and E2 enzymes resulted in no ∼16-kDa radiolabeled band but rather in the generation of radiolabeled ∼52-kDa bands (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). This finding indicates that formation of multiubiquitylated globin chains, which can become substrates for proteolysis, occurred when ERS and >5 mm Mg2+-ATP were present. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of added ATP to 5 mm resulted in a linear decrease in the amount of radiolabeled β-globin chains. These findings suggest that the absence of radiolabeled bands when ubiquitin and ERS are added prior to the initiation of protein synthesis is attributed mainly to increased degradation of newly synthesized nascent globin chains rather than to inhibition of protein synthesis. It is also noteworthy that translation in wheat germ extracts is known to be sensitive to ATP concentration and that either a higher or lower concentration than ∼1 mm causes a significant “decrease” in radiolabeled protein synthesis (15Nakano H. Tanaka T. Kawarasaki Y. Yamane T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such decreases in protein synthesis in the presence of high Mg2+-ATP (e.g. 3–5mm) may be in part the result of increased degradation as shown by our present studies. Effects of Proteasome and Deubiquitylation Inhibitors on Ubiquitin-mediated Proteolytic Degradation of Nascent Globin Chains in the Presence of High (5 mm) and Low (1.5 mm) ATP Levels—We attempted to clarify whether the absence of radiolabeled globin chain bands after the addition of ubiquitin and ERS prior to initiation of translation is dependent on ubiquitylation of nascent globin chains and subsequent proteolytic degradation through the 26 S proteasome. Therefore, we examined the effects of a specific proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and an inhibitor of ubiquitin-protein isopeptidase, Ubal, on radiolabeled globin chain levels. These inhibitors are known to markedly increase the accumulation of ubiquitin protein conjugates coincident with a more decreased rate of proteolytic degradation. Reactions were done in the presence of high ATP (e.g. 5 mm), which should promote degradation. Radiolabeled ∼16-kDa β-globin chain bands were observed in the presence of these inhibitors after 30- and 60-min incubations in the reactions containing ERS (Fig. 2A, lanes 11 and 12). These results were the same as those when using α-cDNA expression vector (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). The addition of E1 and E2 enzymes in the presence of ubiquitin, ERS, and inhibitors prior to transcription/translation led to decreased radiolabeled intensity of the ∼16-kDa β-globin chain band compared with no enzyme addition (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 9 and 10 with lanes 11 and 12). Furthermore, higher molecular mass radiolabeled bands (∼52 kDa) appeared after a 30-min incubation in the presence of the enzymes, ERS, ubiquitin, and inhibitors, which may correspond to multiubiquitylated globin chains (Fig. 2A, lane 9). In addition, preincubation of the cell extract prior to initiation of transcription/translation with MG132 in the absence of expression vector followed by the addition of Ubal and expression vector resulted in the accumulation of monoubiquitylated and multiubiquitylated globin chains. In contrast, in the absence of Ubal under the same conditions, unubiquitylated globin chains were present even after a 60-min incubation. Ubiquitylation of synthesized globin chains was also assessed in the presence of MG132 and Ubal at low ATP (1.5 mm), which should minimize proteolytic degradation. Upon preincubation of the cell extract prior to initiation of transcription/translation with MG132 in the absence of expression vector followed by the addition of Ubal, ∼1.5 mm ATP and expression vector resulted in a ladder of several high molecular mass radiolabeled bands ranging from ∼22 to ∼80 kDa. The ∼22- and ∼52-kDa bands correspond to the expected monoubiquitylated and to four ubiquitylated globin chain bands, respectively (Fig. 4, panel A, lanes 5 and 6). Decreases in the radiolabeled 16-kDa band accompanied by increases in the higher molecular mass bands were dependent on Ubal concentration with higher Ubal concentrations resulting in a decreased 16-kDa band. The intensity of the 16-kDa band decreased with increases in Ubal concentration in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 4, panel B). In contrast, without MG132 preincubation at low concentrations of Ubal, radiolabeled bands were not observed (Fig. 4, panel C, lanes 3 and 4). But at higher Ubal concentrations, a ladder of high molecular mass radiolabeled bands ranging from ∼22- to ∼80 kDa with no 16-kDa band was observed (Fig. 4, panel C, lanes 6 and 7). These results indicate that degradation of ubiquitylated protein is stimulated at low but inhibited at higher concentrations of Ubal as previously reported (14). Also suggested is that, under these conditions, all of the nascent globin chains are potential targets for ubiquitylation. Identification of Radiolabeled Bands Using Ubiquitin and β-Globin Chain Antibodies—We also found endogenous “free” ubiquitin in some of the cell-free systems at ∼1.5 mm by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (data not shown). Endogenous levels of ubiquitin appear sufficient for ubiquitylation of nascent globin chains without additional ubiquitin, because ERS or 5 mm ATP alone without the addition of ubiquitin gave similar SDS-PAGE results in which no radiolabeled globin chains were observed (data not shown). Documentation of ubiquitylated globin chains was shown using β-globin and ubiquitin antibody affinity purification of radiolabeled chains (Fig. 5). The β-globin antibody selectively isolated the 16-kDa non-ubiquitylated and higher molecular mass radiolabeled bands, which should include polyubiquitylated globin chain bands (lane 3), whereas ubiquitin antibody isolated higher molecular mass radiolabeled bands >16 kDa including the 22- and 52-kDa bands (lane 6). The use of non-immune serum showed no enrichment of radiolabeled bands (lanes 2 and 5). Polysome Profiles of Reactions in the Presence and Absence of Puromycin—To determine whether ubiquitylation of nascent polypeptides could be detected on polysomes, polysome profiling was performed using sucrose density gradient analysis of the transcription/translation products after 30-min globin chain synthesis. Because puromycin releases nascent polypeptides from polysomes, we further incubated reaction products after the 30-min synthesis with or without puromycin for an additional 10 min at room temperature (Fig. 6). In the absence of puromycin, higher molecular mass radiolabeled bands were located in the polysome fractions (Fig. 6, fractions 7–11 in panels A and B), indicating the presence of polysome-bound ubiquitylated nascent globin chains. In contrast, after treatment with puromycin, almost all of the radiolabeled high molecular mass bands are no longer present on polysomes (Fig. 6, panel A′, compare fractions 7–11 in panels B and B′). These results further support our contention that polysomal-bound nascent globin chains are ubiquitylated during translation. Proteolytic Degradation of Other Nascent Proteins in the Wheat Germ Cell-free Transcription/Translation System—To verify that proteolytic degradation via ubiquitylation of nascent polypeptides in this system was not specific for globin chains, we evaluated expression vectors coding for β-actin, which was transcribed by SP6, and GATA-1, platelet factor 4 and histone deacetylase-1, which were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase promoters (Fig. 7). Results generated with these non-globin expression vectors in which little or no radiolabeled bands were observed in the presence of ERS and ubiquitin added prior to transcription/translation were similar to results with globin cDNA. In contrast, in the presence of ERS and MG132 and Ubal, mainly decreased levels of non-ubiquitinated full-length radiolabeled protein bands were observed, also similar to results with globin cDNA expression vectors (arrows in Fig. 7). These results suggest that co-translational protein ubiquitylation is a general finding for any protein translated in this system. Ubiquitylation of proteins involves covalent modification that targets proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (4Wilkinson K.D. Urban M.K. Hass A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7529-7532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Substrates for degradation include potentially toxic, aggregation-prone misfolded proteins that can be synthesized de novo as a result of mutation or by errors in translation or transcription. Furthermore, nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome may, in the process of folding, present structural features that serve as degradation signals similar to those recognized by the ubiquitin system in misfolded or otherwise damaged proteins (8Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. Science. 2000; 289: 2117-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Previous experiments bearing on co-translational degradation of nascent proteins used proteasomal inhibitors or cell-free systems (16Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Liao W. Yeung S.C.J. Chan L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Turner and Varshavsky (8Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. Science. 2000; 289: 2117-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) report that over 50% of nascent polypeptide chains never reached full size before destruction by possessive proteolysis. Furthermore, the majority (50–75%) of newly synthesized wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) molecules were rapidly degraded by a pathway involving ubiquitylation and proteasome activity (19Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 20Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that newly exposed nascent polypeptides on polysomes may be “conformationally immature” and therefore targeted for ubiquitylation. In addition, ubiquitin protein conjugates are in a highly dynamic state and ubiquitylation as well as possibly deubiquitylation of polypeptides during translation may be critical to protein fate. It is known that ubiquitylation/deubiquitylation including 26 S proteasomal protein degradation is involved in multiple processes (e.g. cell cycle and division, response to stress and extracellular modulation, morphogenesis of neuronal networks, modulation of cell surface receptors, ion channels and secretory pathways, DNA repair, transcription, immune and inflammatory responses as well as biogenesis of organelles, and apoptosis) (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 335-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 21Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 22Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 23Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Nascent polypeptide chains might be expected to be protected from degradation in vivo, either because they are sterically shielded by chaperones or because their translation time is short compared with the time required for targeting for degradation (8Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. Science. 2000; 289: 2117-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, our results using proteasomal and deubiquitylation inhibitors and cell-free systems suggest that nascent polypeptide chains are recognized as substrates for ubiquitylation during translation and that ATP levels could be a key determinant in the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Finally, our protein synthesis experiments using ubiquitin aldehyde at ATP levels required for protein synthesis (∼1.5 mm) revealed that almost all of the nascent globin chains could be ubiquitylated. Even though the mechanisms of protein folding in cells are still not clear, the folding of proteins in vivo is apparently co-translational (24Komar A.A. Kommer A. Krasheinnkov I.A. Spirin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10646-10651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32175-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the folding of newly synthesized nascent proteins is facilitated by chaperones, which may prevent misfolding and aggregation (22Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). It may be difficult to identify incompletely folded nascent polypeptides without chaperones. Because all of the newly formed globin chains in the absence of chaperones and/or partner chains may be targets for ubiquitylation during and/or soon after translation, deubiquitylation also may be critical for protein fate. This finding is consistent with our results using an inhibitor of deubiquitylation and a ubiquitin-protein isopeptidase inhibitor in which the equilibrium is shifted to favor the formation of the ubiquitin-conjugated form of a nascent polypeptide. Under such conditions, ubiquitylated chains might attain proper folding or chaperone interactions, which could stimulate deubiquitylation of these chains. The molecular basis for recognition of properly folded structures of nascent polypeptides in vivo is not known, but might operate at both the ubiquitylation as well as possibly deubiquitylatin steps during translation. Further characterization of ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation pathways of nascent globin chains, the potential role of ubiquitin as a molecular chaperone for nascent polypeptides (26Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and the relationship between ubiquitylation and molecular chaperones for nascent chains are needed to understand the formation of functional hemoglobin tetramers as well as the co-translational balance between synthesis and degradation for protein quality control in general.
