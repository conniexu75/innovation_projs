https://openalex.org/W2014892893,"Mimicking Caloric Restriction The extended life span and resistance to age-related diseases in animals exposed to caloric restriction has focused attention on the biochemical mechanisms that produce these effects. Selman et al. (p. 140 ; see the Perspective by Kaeberlein and Kapahi ) explored the role of the mammalian ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which regulates protein translation and cellular energy metabolism. Female knockout mice lacking expression of S6K1 showed characteristics of animals exposed to caloric restriction, including improved health and increased longevity. The beneficial effects included reduced fat mass in spite of increased food intake. Thus, inhibition of signaling pathways activated by S6K1 might prove beneficial in protecting against age-related disease."

At these temperatures, metals that catalyze hydrocarbon reforming reactions can also be incorporated so that conventional fuels such as methane can power the cell. One problem, however, has been rapid deactivation by sulfur impurities and carbon buildup. Yang et al. (p. 126 ; see the Perspective by Selman ) report that doping of a barium zirconate-cerate with the rare-earths Y and Yb creates a material that transports both protons and oxygen ions at 750°C. This material, when used with nickel at the fuel cell anode, resists deactivation even when traces of hydrogen sulfide are present, apparently through enhanced ability to supply or remove water during surface reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2029640857,"Distinct classes of protective immunity are guided by activation of STAT transcription factor family members in response to environmental cues. CD4+ regulatory T cells (T(regs)) suppress excessive immune responses, and their deficiency results in a lethal, multi-organ autoimmune syndrome characterized by T helper 1 (TH1) and T helper 2 (TH2) CD4+ T cell-dominated lesions. Here we show that pathogenic TH17 responses in mice are also restrained by T(regs). This suppression was lost upon T(reg)-specific ablation of Stat3, a transcription factor critical for TH17 differentiation, and resulted in the development of a fatal intestinal inflammation. These findings suggest that T(regs) adapt to their environment by engaging distinct effector response-specific suppression modalities upon activation of STAT proteins that direct the corresponding class of the immune response."

However, at the single-electron level, required quantum noise—generated by quantum fluctuations and throwing offset charges into the device—presents a real problem in manipulating the delicate quantum states of the qubits.

Kambris et al.

The infected mosquitoes were less susceptible to the worms owing to chronic upregulation of mosquito immune responses.

However, unbiased synthesis conditions produce a mixture containing two-thirds semiconducting tubes and one-third metallic tubes. Harutyunyan et al. (p. 116 ) show that altering the carrier gas and temperature, in combination with oxidative and reductive species during the synthesis process modifies the catalyst particles during synthesis, which leads to the selective growth of metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes. Thus, the shape and morphology of the catalyst seeds can be tuned to grow carbon nanotubes of a specific chirality."
https://openalex.org/W2026677195,"The chief mechanism used by bacteria for sensing their environment is based on two conserved proteins: a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and an effector response regulator (RR). The signal transduction process involves highly conserved domains of both proteins that mediate autokinase, phosphotransfer, and phosphatase activities whose output is a finely tuned RR phosphorylation level. Here, we report the structure of the complex between the entire cytoplasmic portion of Thermotoga maritima class I HK853 and its cognate, RR468, as well as the structure of the isolated RR468, both free and BeF3− bound. Our results provide insight into partner specificity in two-component systems, recognition of the phosphorylation state of each partner, and the catalytic mechanism of the phosphatase reaction. Biochemical analysis shows that the HK853-catalyzed autokinase reaction proceeds by a cis autophosphorylation mechanism within the HK subunit.

Biochemical analysis shows that the HK853-catalyzed autokinase reaction proceeds by a cis autophosphorylation mechanism within the HK subunit. The results suggest a model for the signal transduction mechanism in two-component systems. The predominant prokaryotic signaling proteins are members of two-component signal transduction systems (TCS) (reviewed by Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Although very widespread in bacteria, where these systems were reported originally, TCSs are found in all domains of life except for animals. The signaling pathways defined by TCSs typically consist of four steps. First, a homodimeric sensor histidine kinase (HK) is autophosphorylated by ATP at a histidine residue. Second, the phosphoryl group is relayed to an aspartate on a cognate response regulator (RR). Third, the phosphorylated RR (P∼RR) interacts with genes or protein targets, triggering cellular responses. Finally, signaling is terminated by P∼RR dephosphorylation by an intrinsic or HK-induced P∼RR autophosphatase activity (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). The signal influences P∼RR levels by modulating autokinase and/or phosphatase activities (Russo and Silhavy, 1993Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J. The essential tension: opposed reactions in bacterial two-component regulatory systems.Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 306-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A single bacterial cell can contain as many as 200–300 HK-RR pairs, but normally, each HK has only one or two cognate RRs, revealing exquisite partner specificity within each HK-RR pair (Laub and Goulian, 2007Laub M.T. Goulian M. Specificity in two-component signal transduction pathways.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Most HKs are homodimeric membrane receptors. Typically, they have a variable, N-terminal, extracellular sensor domain that is connected via transmembrane helices to the C-terminal, cytoplasmic portion, which contains the catalytic machinery. In the class I HKs, which predominate in prokaryotes (Dutta et al., 1999Dutta R. Qin L. Inouye M. Histidine kinases: diversity of domain organization.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the catalytic elements consist of an elongated two-helix dimerization and histidine-containing phosphotransfer (DHp) domain, which is connected to a C-terminal catalytic and ATP-binding (CA) globular domain that phosphorylates the histidine in the first step of the cascade (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). RRs typically consist of a highly conserved receiver domain that hosts the phosphoacceptor aspartate and an effector domain that interacts with targets. However, the effector domain may be missing and its functions taken over by the receiver domain, as in the RR studied here (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Despite there being abundant biochemical and mutational information on TCS signaling, this process is not well understood in structural terms. The atomic resolution structure of the complete cytoplasmic portion of the class I HK that is the product of gene TM0853 of Thermotoga maritima, HK853CP, revealed the domain architecture of the intracellular part of the class I HK dimer (Marina et al., 2005Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In this architecture, the globular CA domains protrude on opposite sides of the HK dimer helical stem. This stem is composed of an N-terminal coiled coil and a four-helix bundle. The localization of the CA domains at the coiled coil-DHp domain junction, far from the phosphoacceptor His260, prevented any conclusions about how the autokinase reaction takes place in HKs from being drawn. More recently, the structure of the complex formed by the two-component pair ThkA-TrrA of T. maritima was determined (Yamada et al., 2006Yamada S. Akiyama S. Sugimoto H. Kumita H. Ito K. Fujisawa T. Nakamura H. Shiro Y. The signaling pathway in histidine kinase and the response regulator complex revealed by X-ray crystallography and solution scattering.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). While the resolution (4.2 Å) of this structure allowed the mapping of the domains, it did not permit detailed analysis of protein-protein interactions and of the signaling process. The structure of the Spo0B-Spo0F complex of Bacillus subtilis was determined at atomic resolution, (Zapf et al., 2000Zapf J. Sen U. Madhusudan Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. A transient interaction between two phosphorelay proteins trapped in a crystal lattice reveals the mechanism of molecular recognition and phosphotransfer in signal transduction.Structure. 2000; 8: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but Spo0B has no autokinase activity, and, therefore, the relevance of this complex for understanding HK-RR pairs is uncertain. High-resolution structures of functional complexes of typical class I HK-RR pairs must be determined to understand the signal transduction process. We now report the structure at 2.8 Å resolution of the complex formed by T. maritima HK853CP and its cognate response regulator RR468 (encoded by gene TM0468). This structure, which may represent a paradigm for the complexes formed by any class I HK with its cognate RR, is shown to be functionally relevant by mutational studies and has allowed clarification of the architecture of the complex, unveiling HK-RR interactions and explaining structurally the exquisite partner specificity of HK-RR pairs. We also determine here the structure of free RR468 either in the absence of ligands (fRR468) or bound to the phosphoryl group mimic BeF3− (BeF3−-RR468) (Lee et al., 2001Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Pelton J.G. Yan D. Berry E.A. Wemmer D.E. Crystal structure of activated CheY. Comparison with other activated receiver domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16425-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The comparison of these structures and of that reported previously for isolated HK853CP (Marina et al., 2005Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with the structures of the RR and HK within the complex reveals important movements in both components and sheds light on phosphorylation state recognition and on the mechanisms of the autokinase and phosphatase reactions. One suggestion that derives from these movements is that the autokinase reaction takes place in cis (that is, ATP bound to one subunit phosphorylates the His residue of this same subunit). This mechanism is confirmed experimentally here for HK853 and for the Staphylococcus aureus HK, PhoR. Thus, the current thinking (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) that the autokinase reaction occurs universally in trans must be revised. We propose a working model for signal transduction that may guide further research into TCS function. For determination of the structure of the complex formed by T. maritima HK853CP and its cognate response regulator RR468, crystals of this complex prepared in the presence of the MgATP analog MgAMPPNP (Casino et al., 2007Casino P. Fernandez-Alvarez A. Alfonso C. Rivas G. Marina A. Identification of a novel two component system in Thermotoga maritima. Complex stoichiometry and crystallization.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were subjected to X-ray synchrotron diffraction. A complete dataset was obtained at 2.8 Å resolution (Table 1). To determine the crystallographic phases, we exploited the anomalous diffraction of Se on crystals of the complex of SeMet-substituted proteins, using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction approach (MAD) (Hendrickson et al., 1990Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. Selenomethionyl proteins produced for analysis by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD): a vehicle for direct determination of three-dimensional structure.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). One molecule of the complex formed by one HK853CP dimer and two RR468 monomers was found in the asymmetric unit of the crystals (Figures 1A and 1B, and Figure S1A available online). The complex, with the expected (Casino et al., 2007Casino P. Fernandez-Alvarez A. Alfonso C. Rivas G. Marina A. Identification of a novel two component system in Thermotoga maritima. Complex stoichiometry and crystallization.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) equimolar stoichiometry, exhibits twofold symmetry. Each CA domain of the HK853CP dimer has one bound molecule of ADPβN (produced by AMPPNP hydrolysis [Marina et al., 2005Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar]), whereas each RR molecule binds one sulfate approximately at the position expected for the phosphate in P∼RR468 (Figure 1A). In an attempt to characterize the changes associated with complex formation and with RR phosphorylation, we determined crystal structures of free RR468 without ligands (fRR468), or of RR468 bound to the phosphoryl group mimic (Lee et al., 2001Lee S.Y. Cho H.S. Pelton J.G. Yan D. Berry E.A. Wemmer D.E. Crystal structure of activated CheY. Comparison with other activated receiver domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16425-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) BeF3− (BeF3−-RR468), at 2.0 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1, Figure S2; see also the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The BeF3− was bound at the expected position for the phosphoryl group at the phosphoacceptor aspartate, Asp53 (Figure S2). The analysis of these three protein structures has clarified the architecture of the complex and has shed light on some of the reactions occurring in TCSs.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsfRR468BeF3−-RR468HK853CP-RR468Se-Met-labeled HK853CP-RR468Crystal ParametersSpace groupP212121P65C2C2C2C2Cell dimensions (Å)a = 34.6, b = 55.5, c = 58.4a = 155.2, b = 155.2, c = 34.5a = 184.0, b = 90.7, c = 69.0a = 185.6, b = 92.6, c = 70.2a = 185.6, b = 92.6, c = 70.2a = 185.6, b = 92.6, c = 70.2Angles (°)α = β = γ = 90°α = β = 90°, γ = 120°α = γ = 90, β = 108.4α = γ = 90, β = 109.0Data Collectionλ (Å)1.0080.9790.9310.979350.979500.95298Resolution (Å)22.1−2.0 (2.11−2.00)29.3−1.8 (1.9−1.8)43.64−2.8 (2.95−2.80)63.88−2.92 (3.00−2.92)55.90−2.92 (3.00−2.92)55.90−2.95 (3.03−2.95)Rmerge (%)aRmerge = (Σ|I−<I>|)/ΣI, where <I> is the average intensity over symmetry equivalent.8.8 (38.3)7.3 (33.3)7.2 (43.3)9.3 (47.1)10.8 (49.2)7.8 (42.7)I/δ(I)14.6 (3.9)23.6 (6.4)16.2 (2.8)13.7 (1.7)12.2 (1.5)15 (1.9)Number of reflections observed/unique40,193/7951 (5,812/1,143)479,700/44,647 (60,798/6,412)116,062/26,588 (17,132/3,875)98,845/23,723 (5,470/1,479)98,896/23,769 (5,738/1,503)95,472/22,826 (5,052/1,306)Completeness99.3 (100)99.7 (99.2)99.7 (100.0)96.9 (83.0)97 (84.4)96.4 (78.0)Redundancy5.1 (5.1)10.7 (9.5)4.4 (4.4)4.2 (3.7)4.2 (3.8)4.2 (3.9)Anomalous Completeness95.9 (74.6)96.3 (80.2)95.9 (73.6)Anomalous redundancy2.1 (2.0)2.1 (2.0)2.1 (2.0)RefinementRwork (%)bRwork = Σ ‖ Fo|−|Fc ‖ /Σ|Fo|.

The crystal structure of the complex shows that the RR468 molecules sit on opposite sides of the DHp domain dimer, below the phosphorylatable His260 (Figures 1A and 1B). In the orientation adopted by the RR468 molecules, the phosphoacceptor Asp53 is aligned with His260, favoring phosphoryl group transfer reactions involving both residues (Figure 1A). This alignment is possible because each RR molecule, which presents the characteristic αβα sandwich fold of the receiver domain of RRs (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar), clings to the helical stem of one HK subunit by clamping the DHp domain α1 helix between first helix (α1) and last loop (β5-α5) of the RR molecule (Figure 1C). In this way, helix α1 of the RR is inserted between the two DHp domain helices (α1 and α2), thus extending the bundle of four helices formed by both DHp domains to six helices (Figure 1C). Each RR molecule also makes lateral contacts with both HK subunits, using two mobile loops that change their orientation depending on whether the RR is phosphorylated or not (see below). One of these loops (β3-α3 loop) protrudes laterally and contacts the CA domain of the same HK subunit that interacts with this RR molecule at the stem level (Figures 1A and 1B). The β3-α3 loop glues together two CA domain loops (α4-β4 loop and ATP lid) that flank the entry of the nucleotide site, locking in place the bound ADPβN molecule (Figure 1D). These RR molecule-CA domain contacts possibly account for the observation that ATP binding influences the affinity of the HK EnvZ for its partner RR, OmpR (Yoshida et al., 2002Yoshida T. Cai S. Inouye M. Interaction of EnvZ, a sensory histidine kinase, with phosphorylated OmpR, the cognate response regulator.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The other RR mobile loop involved in lateral contacts (β4-α4 loop) interacts with the C-end of the DHp domain and with the DHp-CA domain linker belonging to the other HK subunit (HK∗) of the dimer (Figures 1A and 1E). These interactions were inferred previously on the basis of biochemical and mutational data for EnvZ-OmpR (Hsing et al., 1998Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. Mutations that alter the kinase and phosphatase activities of the two-component sensor EnvZ.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2000Zhu Y. Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Phosphatase activity of histidine kinase EnvZ without kinase catalytic domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7808-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Collectively, the contacts between both proteins are not very extensive, as expected for a transient complex, burying ∼1175 Å2 of HK dimer surface per RR molecule. The largest part (885 Å2) of this surface corresponds to the contacts involving the DHp stem below His260. The lateral contacts of RR468 with the CA domain and the DHp-CA domain linker are smaller (150 and 140 Å2, respectively). The comparison of the HK853CP structures in the present complex and in the free form (Figure S1) (Marina et al., 2005Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) suggests not only that HK autophosphorylation occurs in cis, but also possible ways for triggering this autophosphorylation. One key difference between these two structures is the position of the CA domains. In the complex, these domains are displaced toward the phosphoacceptor His260 of the same subunit (Figure 2A) because of a 37° rotation around an axis passing through the DHp domain-CA domain linker (Figures 2A and 2B). This close approach of the phosphoryl donor and acceptor of the same subunit suggests that His260 phosphorylation takes place in cis (Figure 2A and see below). Nevertheless, His260 phosphorylation should be precluded in the present complex because the nucleotide is buried under the ATP lid, which, as already indicated, is fixed in a closed position as a result of its interactions with bound RR468 (Figure 1D). In contrast, the ATP lid was disordered in the free HK853CP structure (Marina et al., 2005Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since the RR468 molecules of this complex appear to represent P∼RR (see below), the RR-triggered ATP lid closure may be a way of preventing futile cycles of P∼RR dephosphorylation and immediate rephosphorylation by the HK. The structural comparisons also suggest possible ways by which extracellular signals can affect the position of the CA domain. The 12 residues at the N terminus of HK853CP are disordered in the complex, whereas they participate in the coiled coil formed by the initial three turns of helix α1 in the free HK (Figures 2B and S1) (Marina et al., 2005Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the entire cytoplasmic portion of a sensor histidine-kinase protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A rotation of these helices of up to 20° (value for the first turn of helix α1 that is visible in the complex) (Figure 2C) appears to underlie the unfolding of these initial three turns. A similar 26° cogwheel rotation was reported in HAMP domains in the transmission of the extracellular signal to the cell interior (Hulko et al., 2006Hulko M. Berndt F. Gruber M. Linder J.U. Truffault V. Schultz A. Martin J. Schultz J.E. Lupas A.N. Coles M. The HAMP domain structure implies helix rotation in transmembrane signaling.Cell. 2006; 126: 929-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A concerted and inverse twist of the α2 helices is also observed in the complex, reflecting the required readjustments of DHp dimer packing to accommodate the helix α1 movements (Figure 2C). These packing changes expose parts of the hydrophobic core of the DHp dimer (particularly the side chains of residues F254, I255, and F312), promoting novel interactions with hydrophobic residues of the CA domain ATP lid (particularly F428 and L444) of the same subunit (Figure S3), which result in the changed position of the CA domain. These CA domain changes may be a prerequisite for autophosphorylation, and the cogwheel motion of the helices may connect the extracellular signal to the HK function (see Discussion). RRs exhibit different conformations depending on whether they are phosphorylated or not (Robinson et al., 2000Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. A tale of two components: a novel kinase and a regulatory switch.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). RR468 in the present complex presents the P∼RR conformation (Figures 2D and S4). This is reflected in the excellent superimposition (Figure 2D) of its structure with that of BeF3−-RR468 (rmsd for the superimposition of all Cα atoms, 0.7 Å). In contrast, the superimposition with fRR468, which represents the non-phosphorylated form, is poorer (rmsd, 1.9 Å) (Figure 2D). The conformational traits that characterize P∼RRs include the hydrogen bonding of the phosphate to a conserved Thr/Ser, an associated characteristic bending of the β4-α4 loop, and the burying of a hydrophobic residue of strand β5 that is exposed in the non-phosphorylated form of the RR. All of these features are present in the RR468 molecules of the complex and in BeF3−-RR468. In the complex, the phosphate is replaced by a sulfate (Figures 2D, 2E, S4, and S5), and the residue involved in the hydrogen bond is T83, whereas the hydrophobic buried residue is V105 (Figure 2D). The sulfate is sandwiched between the γO of the phosphoacceptor Asp53 and the ɛN of His260 of HK853, occupying an essentially equivalent location and replicating the contacts of the BeF3− in BeF3−-RR468 (Figures 2D, 2E, and S5). These contacts include, in addition to the indicated hydrogen bond, the coordination to a Mg that is typically found in the active centers of P∼RRs (Lewis et al., 1999Lewis R.J. Brannigan J.A. Muchova K. Barak I. Wilkinson A.J. Phosphorylated aspartate in the structure of a response regulator protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Figures 2D and 2E). In these RR468 molecules, the β3-α3 loop also has a bent conformation found in P∼RR molecules (Figures 2D and S4). This conformation is known to be important for P∼Asp stability (Zapf et al., 1998Zapf J. Madhusudan M. Grimshaw C.E. Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. Whiteley J.M. A source of response regulator autophosphatase activity: the critical role of a residue adjacent to the Spo0F autophosphorylation active site.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7725-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and allows the accommodation of the bound sulfate in RR468. In contrast, the sulfate cannot be accommodated in fRR468, given its different β3-α3 loop conformation (Figure S6). This characteristic bending of the β3-α3 and β4-α4 loops is essential for the RR468 molecules of the complex to come into contact with the DHp-CA linker and the CA domain of the HK (Figures 1A, 1D, and 1E). Therefore, it is clear that this complex must correspond to the binding of phosphorylated RR468 to HK853. In many TCSs like HK853, the HK can catalyze the dephosphorylation of the P∼RR, in a process that involves the phosphoacceptor His (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). The P∼Asp of P∼RR468 is highly stable in the absence of HK853 (t1/2 for dephosphorylation at 4°C, ∼19 hr) even at the elevated living temperature of T. maritima (t1/2 at 80°C, ∼2 min). However, P∼RR468 was dephosphorylated instantaneously in the presence of wild-type HK853, but not of in the presence of its H260A mutant (Figure S7 and the Supplemental Results). HK-activated dephosphorylation is not believed to be a simple reversal of RR phosphorylation (Stock et al., 2000Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Two-component signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). In the dephosphorylation reaction, the phosphorylatable His would act as an activating base, rendering one water molecule a strong nucleophile for attacking the phosphorus atom of the P∼Asp (Hsing and Silhavy, 1997Hsing W. Silhavy T.J. Function of conserved histidine-243 in phosphatase activity of EnvZ, the sensor for porin osmoregulation in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3729-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Lukat et al., 1991Lukat G.S. Lee B.H. Mottonen J.M. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Roles of the highly conserved aspartate and lysine residues in the response regulator of bacterial chemotaxis.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8348-8354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the water molecule would be interposed between the activating N atom of the imidazole ring and the targeted phosphorus atom. The active center of the present complex agrees with this mechanism of P∼RR dephosphorylation. One O atom of the sulfate sits between the sulfur center and the ɛN of His260 and is aligned with these two atoms. Thus, it may correspond to the proposed water molecule (Figure 2E). In the active center of the complex, the distance between the ɛN atom of His260 and the δO atom of Asp53 (7.9 Å) is 2.6 Å greater than the separation (5.3 Å) between the corresponding atoms in the BeF3−-containing Spo0B-Spo0F complex (Figure S8), which is believed to represent the His-Asp phosphoryl transfer (Varughese et al., 2006Varughese K.I. Tsigelny I. Zhao H. The crystal structure of beryllofluoride Spo0F in complex with the phosphotransferase Spo0B represents a phosphotransfer pretransition state.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4970-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This extra space would be sufficient to accommodate the attacking water molecule. Other sulfate-interacting groups from RR468 (Figure 2E) provide positive charges (ξN of K105; Mg2+) and donate hydrogen bonds (N atoms of I54, M55, and A84 and γO of T83) that should neutralize or shield the negative charge on the phosphate, assisting phosphoryl transfer to the water molecule. Therefore, the entire active center of the complex appears well suited for dephosphorylation. To test the occurrence of the present complex in solution and to corroborate its functionality, we performed site-directed mutagenesis experiments in which we replaced residues predicted by the structure to be important for HK-RR interaction. The HK853 mutations T267D and Y272D and the RR468 mutations I17N and F20N affect residues of helix α1 of each partner (Figure 3A) that are involved in the six-helix bundle formed in the complex. These mutations were not detrimental to the stability or the purification of the proteins (data not shown). The mutant proteins were competent for HK853CP autophosphorylation and RR468 phosphorylation by acetylphosphate (Figure 3), consistent with their proper folding. However, native electrophoresis of HK853CP-RR468 mixtures revealed that Y272D, I17N, and F17N prevented HK-RR complex formation and that T267D drastically decreased complex stability (Figure 3B). In agreement with these effects, each of the four mutations abolished or greatly hampered both the phosphoryl transfer from the HK to the RR (determined as RR468-triggered dephosphorylation of 32P∼HK853CP) and the HK-catalyzed dephosphorylation of P∼RR468 (assessed by electrophoretic quantification of the phosphorylated fraction of RR468). Under the same conditions, these reactions were essentially complete when the wild-type proteins were used (Figures 3C and 3D). Furthermore, the residues identified in elegant mutagenesis and protein engineering experiments to determine the specificity of EnvZ for its cognate RR (Skerker et al., 2008Skerker J.M. Perchuk B.S. Siryaporn A. Lubin E.A. Ashenberg O. Goulian M. Laub M.T.

In summary, the mutational data support the relevance of our present structure for understanding the functionality of complex formation in vivo, not only for the HK853-RR468 pair, but also for other TCSs.Figure 4Sequence and Structure of the HK853CP-RR468 InterfaceShow full caption(A) Structural alignment of HK853 with EnvZ (structures of its two domains given in PDB files 1JOY and IBXD) and with helices α1 and α2 of Spo0B (structure taken from the complex with Spo0F, PDB file 1F51).(B) Structural alignment of RR468 with Spo0F (PDB file 1F51).

(p. 998 , published online 1 October) describe data obtained from several species of sexually dimorphic cichlid fishes found in Lake Malawi that support this model. An orangeblotch color pattern has evolved among the females of rock-dwelling species because it provides effective camouflage against the algae-coated rocks. Blotched males (OB) are rare, possibly because the trait interferes with the normal male color pattern of blue stripes that are important cues for mate selection. The pigmentation pattern that creates this conflict between natural selection in females and sexual selection in males is caused by mutation in the cis -regulatory region of the Pax7 gene and is tightly linked to a dominant female sex determiner. When bred in the lab, the OB males inherit the intact maternal OB haplotype and their OB-carrying chromosome determines female sex in the offspring; the males seem to be sex-reversed by another mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2164540688,"Life Histories to Suit Nematode worms can profoundly manipulate their life histories in several ways. For example, Caenorhabditis elegans has two genders: males and hermaphrodites. Some clues for the evolution of this peculiar mating system have been revealed by Baldi et al. (p. 1002 ), who turned females of a related species, Caenorhabditis remanei , into hermaphrodites by modifying a gene involved in making sperm and another gene required for activating the spermatids. In most animals, the germ line is fully established during adulthood and a reproductive period is determined, at least in part, by aging of the germ line and the viability of oocytes. The reproductive longevity of hermaphrodite C. elegans can be increased at least 15-fold by starvation. Angelo and Van Gilst (p. 954 , published online 27 August; see the Perspective by Ogawa and Sommer ) found that in starved worms, the germline component of the reproductive system is actively killed, with the exception of a small set of preserved stem cells. When the worms are able to feed again, these cells regenerate into an entirely new and functional germ line. But this is not all. Kim et al. (p. 994 , published online 1 October; see the Perspective by Ogawa and Sommer ) show that subsets of the complex mixture of structurally related molecules in dauer pheromone act via distinct G protein–coupled receptors either to initiate longterm effects on development and physiology by modulating the neuroendocrine axis, or to trigger short-term acute effects on behavior by altering neuronal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2012499940,"Stemming Stem Cell Displacement Adult stem cell niches can contain multiple types of stem cells with coordinated regulation, but the mechanisms for these interactions are largely unknown. In the fruit fly testis, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling is needed for the maintenance of the resident germline and somatic stem cells. The signaling inhibitor SOCS36E is a known JAK-STAT target. Issigonis et al. (p. 153 ) now show that SOCS36E functions in the maintenance of the germline stem cell via suppression of JAK-STAT signaling, specifically in the somatic stem cells. This prevents the somatic stem cells from displacing neighboring germline stem cells in an integrin-dependent manner, allowing both stem cell populations to occupy the niche."

Fenofibrate treatment resulted in a reduced contribution of glycolysis to acetyl-CoA production, whereas the cycling of glucose 6-phosphate through the pentose phosphate pathway presumably was enhanced.

How this observation relates to hepatic MUFA synthesis and TG storage in the liver (1.Li Z.Z. Berk M. McIntyre T.M. Feldstein A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5637-5644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) remains to be elucidated. In this respect it is interesting to note that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), the lipogenic enzyme controlling MUFA synthesis, has been reported to be a direct PPARα target gene (25.Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Considering the regulatory role of PPARα under conditions of increased fatty acid influx, specific changes in the hepatic processing of fatty acids are to be expected upon PPARα activation. To gain insight into these changes, we used sophisticated stable isotope techniques to quantify de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid elongation in vivo in mice that were treated with the PPARα agonist fenofibrate. To evaluate the interactions between hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, we also determined relevant hepatic carbohydrate fluxes. To assess the effects of PPARα activation on metabolite concentrations and metabolite fluxes in vivo, male C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River, L'Arbresle Cedex, France) were housed in a light- and temperature-controlled facility (lights on 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., 21 °C).

TGs were hydrolyzed in HCl/acetonitrile (1:22 v/v) for 45 min at 100 °C. Fatty acids were extracted in hexane and derivatized for 15 min at room temperature using Br-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl/acetonitrile/triethanolamine (1:6:2 v/v). Derivatization was stopped by adding HCl, and the fatty acid-pentafluorobenzyl derivatives were extracted in hexane. The fatty acid-pentafluorobenzyl derivatives mass isotopomer distributions were measured using an Agilent 5975 series GC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Gas chromatography was performed using a ZB-1 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed by electron capture negative ionization using methane as the moderating gas. The normalized mass isotopomer distributions measured by GC-MS (m0 − mx) were corrected for natural abundance of 13C by multiple linear regression (35.Lee W.N. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Edmond J. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 20: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) to obtain the excess fractional distribution of mass isotopomers (M0 − Mx) due to the incorporation of [1-13C]acetate. This distribution was used in mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) algorithms to calculate acetyl-CoA precursor pool enrichment (pacetate), fractional palmitate synthesis rates (fC16:0), and the fraction of palmitate and oleate generated by elongation of de novo synthesized palmitate (fC18:0/1(C16DNL)) or by elongation of pre-existing palmitate (fC18:0/1(C16PE)) as described (36.Oosterveer M.H.

Mice were equipped with a permanent jugular vein catheter as described above. After recovery, the mice were fasted from 6:00 to 10:00 a.m. Conscious, unrestrained mice were infused with a solution containing [U-13C]glucose (7 mm), [2-13C]glycerol (82 mm), [1-2H]galactose (17 mm), and paracetamol (1 mg/ml) for 6 h at an infusion rate of 0.6 ml/h as described previously (37.Derks T.G.

Blood glucose concentrations were measured every 30 min. Blood and urine spots were collected every 60 min. Analytical procedures for extraction of glucose from blood spots, derivatization of the extracted compounds, and GC-MS measurements of derivatives were performed according to van Dijk et al.

During stable isotope infusion, both glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) cycling contribute to triple labeled triose phosphate (M3) generated from the infused [U-13C]glucose (M6). Reconversion of triple labeled triose phosphate into blood and UDP glucose via the gluconeogenic pathway in turn results in M3 abundance in these pools. All data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and SPSS for Windows software (SPSS 12.02; SPSS Inc., Chicago). The null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level of probability. Fenofibrate treatment induced a catabolic phenotype, characterized by weight loss without affecting food intake (Table 1). Hepatic Fgf-21 mRNA expression (Table 2) was induced, and FGF-21 plasma concentrations (Table 1) were increased. Plasma NEFA concentrations did not differ between fenofibrate-treated animals and controls (Table 1), whereas plasma TG concentrations were decreased by fenofibrate treatment (Table 1). Fenofibrate treatment induced hepatic peroxisome proliferation, which resulted in increased liver weight and hepatic protein content (Table 1). Hepatic fatty acid oxidation was promoted by fenofibrate treatment, as indicated by the anticipated increase in the expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport, ketogenesis, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation (Table 2) as well as the elevated plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations (Table 1). The expression of genes encoding proteins involved in uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation was also increased (Table 2).TABLE 1General characteristics, plasma, and hepatic metabolite levelsParameterControlFenofibrateBody weight change (%)7.8 ± 1.0−6.4 ± 2.0*Food intake (g/day)4.5 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.4Plasma FGF-21 (ng/ml)1.1 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.6*Plasma NEFA (mmol/liter)0.27 ± 0.040.20 ± 0.01Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (mmol/liter)0.15 ± 0.031.00 ± 0.12*Plasma triglycerides (mmol/liter)0.53 ± 0.040.10 ± 0.01*Liver weight (% body weight)4.8 ± 0.113.2 ± 0.5*Hepatic protein (mg/g)160 ± 3171 ± 2*Hepatic C16 desaturation index0.07 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.02*Hepatic C18 desaturation index1.20 ± 0.104.06 ± 0.20*Hepatic triglycerides (μmol/g)15.4 ± 2.624.6 ± 2.0*Hepatic cholesterol (μmol/g)7.7 ± 0.48.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Hepatic gene expression levelsGeneControlFenofibrateFatty acid mobilization/uptakeFgf-211.0 ± 0.34.4 ± 0.4*Cd361.0 ± 0.17.2 ± 0.7*β-Oxidation and ketogenesisAox1.0 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.5*Cpt-1a1.0 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1*Lcad1.0 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.2*Hmgcs21.0 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.2*Mitochondrial uncouplingUcp21.0 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.2*Ucp31.0 ± 0.2109.8 ± 9.6*Fatty acid synthesisSrebp-1c1.0 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.1Pgc-1ß1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1Acc11.0 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.1*Fas1.0 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1*Elovl61.0 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.1Scd11.0 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.2*Elovl51.0 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.3*Fads11.0 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1*Fads21.0 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.3*Triglyceride synthesisGpat1.0 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1*Dgat11.0 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.2*Dgat21.0 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1*Glucose uptake/glycolysisChrebp1.0 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1*Glut21.0 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1*Gk1.0 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.0*Pk1.0 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.0*Pdk41.0 ± 0.327.0 ± 2.8*GluconeogenesisPgc-1α1.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1Pepck1.0 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1G6pc1.0 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.1G6pt1.0 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.2*Gyk1.0 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.1*PPP and NADPH synthesisG6pdh1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.16Pdgh1.0 ± 0.02.2 ± 0.1*Taldo11.0 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.2*Tkt1.0 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1Me11.0 ± 0.15.9 ± 0.5* Open table in a new tab The catabolic phenotype of fenofibrate-treated mice was associated with an increase in hepatic TG content, whereas cholesterol content remained unaffected (Table 1). The hepatic expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis, e.g. Acc1 and Fas, was higher in these animals, whereas that of Srebp-1c and its co-activator Pgc-1β remained unaltered (Table 2). In addition, the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation, e.g. Elovl5, Scd1, Fads1, and Fads2, as well as TG synthesis (Dgat1 and Gpat), was markedly induced upon treatment with fenofibrate (Table 2). Changes in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and the elongation/desaturation gene expression pattern translated into altered hepatic fatty acid composition (Table 3) with a marked increase in the abundance of MUFA, resulting in increased hepatic Δ9-desaturation indices (Table 1).TABLE 3Hepatic fatty acid profilesFatty AcidControlFenofibrateC14:00.24 ± 0.030.27 ± 0.01C16:1(n-7)1.76 ± 0.224.55 ± 0.56*C16:024.04 ± 0.9834.77 ± 0.95*C18:3(n-6)0.23 ± 0.020.26 ± 0.01C18:2(n-6)20.69 ± 1.0516.09 ± 0.67*C18:3(n-3)0.62 ± 0.070.26 ± 0.04*C18:1(n-9)12.76 ± 1.2828.57 ± 1.21*C18:1(n-7)2.07 ± 0.135.79 ± 0.20*C18:012.32 ± 0.348.50 ± 0.30*C20:4(n-6)11.44 ± 0.2610.82 ± 0.36C20:5(n-3)0.70 ± 0.030.51 ± 0.03*C20:3(n-9)0.14 ± 0.010.61 ± 0.02*C20:3(n-6)1.12 ± 0.045.43 ± 0.22*C20:2(n-6)0.33 ± 0.020.42 ± 0.02*C20:1(n-9)0.36 ± 0.030.55 ± 0.02*C20:00.20 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.00*C22:5(n-6)0.13 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.01C22:6(n-3)7.91 ± 0.266.72 ± 0.16*C22:4(n-6)0.21 ± 0.010.41 ± 0.02*C22:5(n-3)0.58 ± 0.030.85 ± 0.04*C22:00.44 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.01*C24:1(n-9)0.48 ± 0.010.39 ± 0.01*C24:00.37 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.00* Open table in a new tab To establish the physiological relevance of the induction in lipogenic gene expression, we determined de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid elongation and their contributions to hepatic TG in vivo. We therefore infused [1-13C]acetate into mice for 6 h and applied MIDA to quantify fatty acid biosynthesis from 2-carbon precursors and to differentiate between de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid elongation as described (36.Oosterveer M.H. Van Dijk T.H. Tietge U.J. Boer T. Havinga R. Stellaard F. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. Reijngoud D.J. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fenofibrate treatment resulted in a massive increase in de novo lipogenesis (Fig. 1A). Elongation of both de novo synthesized and pre-existing palmitate was also higher in fenofibrate-treated mice, which resulted in an increase in stearate and oleate synthesis (Fig. 1, B and 1C). These results are consistent with the increased expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, elongation, and desaturation upon fenofibrate treatment (Table 1). Moreover, the results from the isotope infusion studies explain the changes observed in the hepatic fatty acid profile (Table 3), i.e. the higher desaturation indices and the ∼50% increase in oleate content. Interestingly, the synthesis rates of TG-associated palmitate, oleate, and stearate (Fig. 1, A–C) were very similar to the values observed for the total hepatic synthetic rates of these fatty acids. Hence, the acetyl-CoA precursor pool enrichments in total and TG-associated palmitate were similar. Strikingly, the acetyl-CoA precursor pool enrichment remained unaffected upon fenofibrate treatment (Fig. 1D), indicative of a similar and rapid turnover of the acetyl-CoA precursor pool. PPARα agonist treatment is reportedly associated with an increased abundance of nuclear SREBP-1c (24.Knight B.L. Hebbachi A. Hauton D. Brown A.M. Wiggins D. Patel D.D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which might be responsible for the observed induction in lipogenic gene expression. On the other hand, lipogenic gene expression might be controlled transcriptionally by ChREBP (40.Kabashima T. Kawaguchi T. Wadzinski B.E. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5107-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To assess whether the induction of the lipogenic genes upon fenofibrate treatment depended on SREBP-1c and/or ChREBP, Srebp-1c−/− and Chrebp−/− mice were treated with fenofibrate. Fig. 2 shows the expression profiles of genes encoding enzymes controlling de novo lipogenesis as well as fatty acid elongation and desaturation in the knock-out mice and their wild-type littermates. In Srebp-1c−/−mice, as compared with their wild-type littermates, the induction of fatty acid synthesis genes upon treatment with fenofibrate was clearly blunted. In Chrebp−/−mice, however, the induction of these genes was maintained. Similarly, the induction of genes encoding enzymes controlling fatty acid esterification as well as NADPH synthesis was blunted in Srebp-1c−/−mice only (supplemental Table 2). In addition to SREBP-1c and ChREBP, the liver X receptor (LXR) is another important transcriptional regulator of lipogenic genes. Expression analysis of Lxrα and its direct target genes Abca1, Abcg5, and Abcg1 did not provide evidence for increased LXR activity upon treatment with fenofibrate (supplemental Table 3). Glucose provides the acetyl-CoA required for fatty acid synthesis via the glycolytic pathway. The interconversions of glucose, Glc-6-P, and glycogen can be quantified by direct labeling of the blood glucose and UDP-glucose pools, whereas the gluconeogenic flux can be estimated by glucose and UDP-glucose biosynthesis from 3-carbon precursors. To assess the contribution of adaptations in hepatic glucose metabolism to the increased lipogenic flux, we determined carbohydrate fluxes in vivo following isotope infusion by analysis of glucose and galactose cycling, whereas we applied MIDA to quantify the gluconeogenic flux through the triose phosphate precursor pool following infusion of labeled glycerol. Fluxes were derived from isotopomer distributions in the blood glucose and urinary UDP-glucose pools as described (38.Van Dijk T.H. Boer T.S. Havinga R. Stellaard F. Kuipers F. Reijngoud D.J. Anal.

https://openalex.org/W2125517883,"Propionylation has been identified recently as a new type of protein post-translational modification. Bacterial propionyl-CoA synthetase and human histone H4 are propionylated at specific lysine residues that have been known previously to be acetylated. However, other proteins subject to this modification remain to be identified, and the modifying enzymes involved need to be characterized. In this work, we report the discovery of histone H3 propionylation in mammalian cells. Propionylation at H3 lysine Lys23 was detected in the leukemia cell line U937 by mass spectrometry and Western analysis using a specific antibody. In this cell line, the propionylated form of Lys23 accounted for 7%, a level at least 6-fold higher than in other leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and THP-1) or non-leukemia cell lines (HeLa and IMR-90). The propionylation level in U937 cells decreased remarkably during monocytic differentiation, indicating that this modification is dynamically regulated. Moreover, in vitro assays demonstrated that histone acetyltransferase p300 can catalyze H3 Lys23 propionylation, whereas histone deacetylase Sir2 can remove this modification in the presence of NAD+. These results suggest that histone propionylation might be generated by the same set of enzymes as for histone acetylation and that selection of donor molecules (propionyl-CoA versus acetyl-CoA) may determine the difference of modifications. Because like acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA is an important intermediate in biosynthesis and energy production, histone H3 Lys23 propionylation may provide a novel epigenetic regulatory mark for cell metabolism.

Eukaryotic histones are rich in multiple post-translational modifications, the combinatory array of which is the basis for epigenetic regulation of gene expression (1.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar). Appropriate histone modifications are required for normal cell growth and differentiation, whereas aberrant histone modifications contribute to tumor formation such as malignant hematopoiesis (2.Rice K.L. Hormaeche I. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6697-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For example, genome-wide alterations of histone modification patterns are found in prostate cancer and are predictive of clinical outcomes (3.Seligson D.B. Horvath S. Shi T. Yu H. Tze S. Grunstein M.

Alteration in histone modification patterns serves as a hallmark of cancer that provides clues for cancer diagnosis and treatment (7.Gal-Yam E.N. Saito Y. Egger G. Jones P.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2008; 59: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Lysine propionylation has recently been identified as a new type of post-translational modification. It was first discovered in human histone H4 enriched for acetylation using anti-acetyl H4 antibodies (9.Chen Y. Sprung R. Tang Y. Ball H. Sangras B. Kim S.C. Falck J.R. Peng J. Gu W. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The propionyl-CoA synthetase of Salmonella enterica was also found to be propionylated at lysine 592, which inactivates the enzyme activity in vivo (8.Garrity J. Gardner J.G. Hawse W. Wolberger C. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30239-30245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments showed that histone acetyltransferase p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) can propionylate histone H4, suggesting that propionylation and acetylation may share the common enzymes that recognize both propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA (9.Chen Y.

The in vivo propionylation of propionyl-CoA synthetase is catalyzed by a protein related to GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (HAT), and the propionyl group can be removed by NAD+-dependent human Sir2 histone deacetylase (sirtuins) in vitro (8.Garrity J.

Moreover, the GCN5-related mammalian HAT PCAF has the ability to propionylate histone H3 with similar efficiency and lysine specificity as it acetylates H3 in vitro (10.Leemhuis H. Packman L.C. Nightingale K.P. Hollfelder F. ChemBioChem. 2008; 9: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear so far whether propionylation is present in histone H3 in vivo. In this work, we report the identification and characterization of histone H3 propionylation in mammalian cells. This modification was specifically detected at H3 Lys23 (H3K23) in the myeloid precursor leukemia cell line U937. The H3K23 propionylation level in U937 cells decreased significantly during monocytic differentiation, suggesting that this modification might be associated with lineage determination. The histone acetyltransferase p300 can catalyze this modification, whereas the histone deacetylase Sir2 catalyzes the removal of the propionyl group in vitro. Because propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, both metabolic products of fatty acid, are differential cofactors for dual functional histone acetyltransferases, we suggest that histone propionylation might be associated with cellular metabolic status. U937T (provided by Dr. Gerard Grosveld) is a derivative of U937 harboring the tet-VP16 fusion gene under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (11.Boer J. Bonten-Surtel J. Grosveld G. Mol.

U937T stable cell lines expressing FLAG-AF10 or FLAG-AF10ΔOM-LZ (where “OM” is octapeptide motif and “LZ” is leucine zipper) were established using the pUHD10S-1 vector (a gift from Dr. Gerard Grosveld).

Cross-reactivity to Lys23 acetylation was minimized by passing the antibody solution through an affinity column loaded with beads cross-linked with the acetylated Lys23 peptide. Peptide dot blotting analysis demonstrated that the purified H3K23 propionylation antibody had a 9-fold affinity over the H3K23-acetylated peptide and a 100-fold affinity over the unmodified peptide (supplemental Fig. 1). Western blot analysis was carried out using the propionylation-specific antibodies with total protein extracts of different cell lines. Histones were digested overnight either with trypsin or Arg-C proteases (enzyme/protein of ∼1:100; Roche Applied Science). After digestion, the peptides were dried with reduced vacuum and then redissolved in 0.1% formic acid. The peptides were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC on a microbore C18 column and subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis or directly subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric experiments were performed using a Bruker Autoflex instrument in the reflectron mode. For regular MALDI-TOF experiments, all spectra were externally calibrated using a peptide standard mixture provided by Bruker. A 1.0-μl aliquot of the peptide solution was mixed with 1.0 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (5 mg/ml in 50:50 acetonitrile/water and 0.1% formic acid; Sigma). Data from a set of 100∼200 laser shots were accumulated to give an acceptable spectrum. For high accuracy mass determination, the spectra of modified histone peptides were calibrated by the lock mass of a co-eluted known histone peptide. LC-MS/MS identification of histone modifications was carried out by nanoelectrospray on a Waters Q-TOF Ultima instrument that was coupled to a Waters capillary HPLC system. A 140-min gradient (mobile phase A, 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) with a flow rate of 6 μl/min was run through a splitter. After splitting, a flow rate of ∼300 nl/min was run through a Waters nano C18 column (150 mm × 75 μm) to the nanoelectrospray source. A 1.8-kV capillary voltage and 45-V cone voltage were optimized for nanoelectrospray. The Q-TOF method utilized consisted of a survey scan mode in the mass range from 300 to 1500 Da during which up to three precursor ions were selected for parallel collision-activated dissociation (collision gas, argon) analysis using an automated data-dependent MS-to-MS/MS and MS/MS-to-MS switching function. Precursor ion selection was based on a normalized threshold of 10 counts/s, and ions of potentially modified peptides were preferentially selected for MS/MS fragmentation. MS/MS experiments used an m/z-dependent collision energy applied linearly from 20 to 42 V from m/z 300 to 1500. Product ion scans were measured in the range from m/z 50 to 2000. The Q-TOF instrument was calibrated with the MS/MS fragmentation ions of the peptide Glu-Fib, resulting in <20 ppm mass accuracy for precursor ions when a lock mass was applied and ±0.02 Da for product ions. Modifications of histones were manually determined with the aid of the Prospector program. Quantitative LC-MS/MS analyses of histone acetylation and propionylation were performed by derivatization of unmodified lysines using d6-acetic anhydride as described previously (13.Smith C.M. Gafken P.R. Zhang Z. Gottschling D.E. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the quadruple resolution was set with a low window (low mass = 2 and high mass = 2) to select precursor ions at approximately ±8 Da for MS/MS fragmentation. The acetylation proportions of Lys18 and Lys23 were calculated by the intensity relative to the total peak value of diacetylated peptide (Lys18/Lys23), Lys18- or Lys23-monoacetylated peptide, and Lys18- and Lys23-unacetylated peptide. The propionylation level was calculated by the intensity of the Lys23 propionylation peak over the total intensity of acetylation and propionylation peaks. In vitro propionylation and acetylation assays were carried out as described previously (9.Chen Y. Sprung R. Tang Y. Ball H. Sangras B. Kim S.C. Falck J.R. Peng J. Gu W. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Basically, 2.5 ng of human recombinant histone H3 (Millipore) was dissolved in 10 μl of acetylation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After the addition of 1 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA or [14C]propionyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) and 0.5 μg of p300 (Upstate), the solution was incubated at room temperature for a given time. The reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography and/or Coomassie Blue staining. For the propionylation/acetylation assay with nonradioactive propionyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA, the reaction mixture incubated for 1 h was subjected to enzymatic digestion with Arg-C, followed by MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS analyses. For the depropionylation assay, histone H3 was first incubated with p300 in the presence of [14C]propionyl-CoA (or [14C]acetyl-CoA as a control) for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by heating at 60 °C for 5 min. 10 μl (100 μg/300 μl of solution) of human Sir2 proteins (sirtuins 1–3; BPS Bioscience) was then added to the solution together with 50 mm NAD+. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of gel loading buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. Meanwhile, a synthetic Lys23-propionylated H3 peptide was incubated with Sir2 proteins and NAD+ for 30 min, and the mixture was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. U937 and HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For induced differentiation, cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium supplemented with 100 nm PMA (or Me2SO as a mock control). After 72 h of treatment, cells were harvested for analysis. Cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and counted. 1 × 106 cells were incubated with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD11b antibody (BD Biosciences) on ice for 30 min in the dark. After washing twice with PBS, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (PBS with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 2% fetal bovine serum) and subjected to FACSCalibur analysis. In the analysis of post-translational modifications of histones isolated from the U937 leukemia cell line, we identified a novel modification, propionylation at histone H3 lysine 23, by mass spectrometry. From LC-MS/MS analysis of histone H3 samples, we observed an unusual peak at m/z 521.82 (2+), which eluted between the peaks at m/z 514.82 (2+) and 535.82 (2+), which corresponded to peptides singly and doubly acetylated at Lys18 and/or Lys23, respectively (data not shown). We then performed HPLC peptide purification of Arg-C-digested histone H3 and conducted MALDI-TOF analysis of the pool of Lys18/Lys23-modified peptides. A peak at m/z 1042.6364 (0.8 ppm) was detected between the peaks at m/z 1028.6168 and 1070.6266, which corresponded to the singly and doubly acetylated peptides as stated above (Fig. 1A). The 14-Da mass increase of the singly acetylated form could result from an additional methylation on either the peptide or the acetyl group, namely propionylation. Fragmentation of the selected ion at m/z 521.82 (2+) by electrospray-LC-MS/MS indicated that Lys18 was free of modification but that Lys23 was attached with a moiety of 56 Da (Fig. 1B). The 56-Da change could be due either to a sum of one acetylation and one methylation or to one propionylation. There has been no precedent that methylation and acetylation can occur at the same amino group, although this possibility exists. Notably, a stable six-membered ring immonium ion at m/z 140.1063 that can be produced only from propionylated lysine was detected (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we analyzed a synthetic Lys23-propionylated peptide with a sequence identical to that of the Arg-C-digested peptide of histone H3 isolated from U937 cells. The MS/MS spectrum of this synthesized peptide was almost identical to that of the peptide from U937 cells (Fig. 1C). A lysine residue acetylated and methylated simultaneously cannot form an immonium ion at m/z 140.1070 (calculated monoisotopic mass) because nitrogen with a positive charge makes no more than four bonds (i.e. NH4+) theoretically (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the modification at Lys23 was conclusively demonstrated to be propionylation. We then determined the relative abundance of propionylation at H3K23 in three leukemia cell lines. To this end, histone H3 was reacted with d6-acetic anhydride in d3-acetyl acid solution, followed by digestion with trypsin and analysis by LC-MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 2A, ∼7% of Lys23 was propionylated in the U937 cell line, whereas only a background level of propionylation was detected in two other leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and THP-1. No significant H3K23 propionylation was detected in two non-leukemia cell lines, HeLa and IMR-90 (supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, the propionylation did not seem to be linked to acetylation because no differences in acetylation were observed at Lys18 or Lys23 among the three leukemia cell lines (Fig. 2A). Western analysis with propionylated H3K23-specific antibody confirmed that Lys23 propionylation was more predominant in U937 cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the Lys23 acetylation levels were similar in the different cell lines. The global H3K79–2me hypomethylation is a characteristic of U937 cells, in which the CALM-AF10 fusion protein affects the association of the H3K79 methyltransferase hDOT1L with chromatin as described in our previous report (6.Lin Y.H. Kakadia P.M. Chen Y. Li Y.Q. Deshpande A.J. Buske C. Zhang K.L. Zhang Y. Xu G.L. Bohlander S.K. Blood. 2009; 114: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We then examined whether the elevated propionylation is related to the decreased level of the AF10 transcription factor (14.Dreyling M.H. Martinez-Climent J.A. Zheng M. Mao J. Rowley J.D. Bohlander S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4804-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) due to the specific presence of the CALM-AF10 fusion gene in U937 cells. However, no change in H3K23 propionylation was observed in U937 cells upon ectopic expression of the wild-type AF10 protein or the mutant AF10 protein with a deletion of the hDOT1L-binding domain OM-LZ (Fig. 3A), which is crucial for AF10-mediated restoration of H3K79 in U937T cells (6.Lin Y.H. Kakadia P.M. Chen Y. Li Y.Q. Deshpande A.J. Buske C. Zhang K.L. Zhang Y. Xu G.L. Bohlander S.K. Blood. 2009; 114: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This result suggests that hyperpropionylation in U937 cells is not caused by down-regulation of AF10. To investigate the possible link between H3K23 hyperpropionylation and CALM-AF10 fusion, CALM-AF10 and its OM-LZ deletion mutant were induced to express in T-REx-293 stable cell lines with tetracycline. Consistent with our previous report (6.Lin Y.H. Kakadia P.M. Chen Y. Li Y.Q. Deshpande A.J. Buske C. Zhang K.L. Zhang Y. Xu G.L. Bohlander S.K. Blood. 2009; 114: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), global hypomethylation of H3K79 was detected upon induction of CALM-AF10 but not the OM-LZ deletion mutant (data not shown). However, the H3K23 propionylation level did not change significantly in response to the induced expression of the CALM-AF10 proteins in the stable cell lines, and neither did the acetylation level (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the H3K23 hyperpropionylation in U937 cells is unlikely associated with the expression of the CALM-AF10 fusion protein. Genome-wide reprogramming of histone modifications is closely associated with cell growth and differentiation in development (15.Hajkova P. Ancelin K. Waldmann T. Lacoste N. Lange U.C. Cesari F. Lee C. Almouzni G. Schneider R. Surani M.A. Nature. 2008; 452: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 16.Reik W. Nature. 2007; 447: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of H3K23 propionylation in cell differentiation, we mimicked monocytic differentiation in U937 cells with PMA induction. Following PMA treatment, U937 cells became adherent and, over the course of several days, differentiated into monocyte/macrophage-like cells. Differentiation of promonocytic U937 cells into monocytes/macrophages is characterized by the elevated expression of the cell-surface marker CD11b (17.Grattage L.P. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 97-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis that 72.9% of the U937 cells became CD11b-positive upon PMA treatment (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with a previous report (18.Ragg S.J. Kaga S. Berg K.A. Ochi A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined the H3K23 modification during monocytic differentiation of U937 cells and the control cell line HL-60 by Western blotting and LC-MS/MS. Interestingly, the propionylation level of H3K23 in U937 cells decreased markedly after PMA induction, whereas the acetylation level remained unchanged (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 3). Furthermore, HL-60 cells did not show such a change during monocytic differentiation, suggesting that the hyperpropionylation of H3K23 in U937 cells is associated with cell differentiation. Previous experiments have shown that the histone acetyltransferase p300 propionylates histone H4 at multiple sites and that PCAF propionylates lysine 14 of histone H3 (9.Chen Y. Sprung R. Tang Y. Ball H. Sangras B. Kim S.C. Falck J.R. Peng J. Gu W. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 10.Leemhuis H. Packman L.C. Nightingale K.P. Hollfelder F. ChemBioChem. 2008; 9: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test whether the histone acetyltransferase p300 can also propionylate lysine 23 of histone H3, we set up an in vitro enzymatic assay with human recombinant histone H3 as a substrate. First, we performed the assay using [14C]propionyl-CoA as the propionyl donor and the acetylation cofactor [14C]acetyl-CoA as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 5(A and C), p300 propionylated histone H3 although with much slower kinetics compared with acetylation. Furthermore, we conducted the same propionylation assay using unlabeled propionyl-CoA, followed by analysis of the H3 substrate with MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 5 (B and D), p300 propionylated lysine 23 of histone H3 as well as three other residues (Lys9, Lys14, and Lys18) known to be acetylation sites. Sir2 protein is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase (19.Schwer B. Verdin E. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 104-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In humans, eight Sir2 homologs (sirtuins 1–8) have been identified. Garrity et al. (8.Garrity J. Gardner J.G. Hawse W. Wolberger C. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30239-30245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) reported that both the bacterial and human Sir2 histone deacetylases can remove propionylation from the propionyl-CoA synthetase. Molecular modeling indicated that the hydrophobic pocket in the active site of Sir2 can readily accommodate the additional methyl of propionyl-lysine (20.Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Following this scenario, we asked whether Sir2 would depropionylate histone H3K23. To this end, we incubated a synthetic Lys23-propionylated peptide with sirtuin proteins in the presence of NAD+ in a time course for up to 1 h. Meanwhile, parallel experiments using synthetic Lys23-acetylated peptide as the substrate were performed to compare the enzyme activities between depropionylation and deacetylation. The peptides were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For the input acetylated peptide (KQLATKacAARC, MH+ 1131.6), a new peak 42 Da smaller in mass appeared after incubation with sirtuin 1 (Fig. 6A), indicating the deacetylation activity of sirtuin 1. Similarly, for the propionylated peptide (KQLATKprAARC, MH+ 1145.5), a new peak with a decrease of 56 Da appeared (Fig. 6B), indicating the depropionylation activity of sirtuin 1. Sirtuins 2 and 3 could also catalyze depropionylation, although sirtuin 3 had a lower enzymatic activity than sirtuins 1 and 2 (supplemental Fig. 5). Notably, the sirtuin 1 depropionylation activity was about half of its deacetylation activity (Fig. 6C). The regulation of gene expression is largely mediated by post-translational modification of histones in chromatin. Although the most abundant types of post-translational modifications (such as acetylation and methylation) that are known to play vital roles in transcriptional silencing and activation have been extensively studied, the existence of rare types of post-translational modifications in histones remains to be characterized. Our work presents the first evidence for the existence of propionylation at mammalian histone H3. We found that lysine 23 in the H3 N-terminal tail is specifically propionylated up to 7% in the U937 leukemia cell line. During the preparation of this manuscript, Zhang et al. (21.Zhang K. Chen Y. Zhang Z. Zhao Y. J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported the detection of Lys23 propionylation in yeast histone H3. Therefore, propionylation at H3K23 constitutes a novel type of histone mark that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human. Histone propionylation is expected to exert functions similar to the widespread acetylation due to the structural similarity of the propionyl and acetyl groups. This modification neutralizes the positive charge of a lysine residue, thus rendering an active local chromatin structure. The added propionyl group may also provide a mark for recognition by chromatin “readers” such as bromodomain-containing proteins that mediate further chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. Propionyl-Lys23 can also exert its effect by inhibiting or stimulating the modification at the neighboring sites. The high abundance of histone H3K23 propionylation in U937 cells and its decrease upon differentiation may imply an important role of this modification in modulating cell differentiation. H3K23 propionylation might regulate transcription of genes crucial for cell growth and differentiation with a mechanism similar to acetylation. However, the genes controlled by propionylation might be different from the targeted genes regulated by other modifications because the dynamics of propionylation in U937 differentiation is different from that of Lys23 acetylation (Fig. 4B) and Lys79 methylation (data not shown). Because the propionylation levels became similar between U937 and other leukemia cell lines after differentiation, hyperpropionylation in U937 cells might be a stage-specific marker in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, which could serve as a diagnostic target for leukemia therapy. The fact that histone propionylation is barely detectable in most mammalian cells suggests its highly restrictive occurrence in specific target genes under certain growth and metabolic conditions. In Salmonella, propionylation of the propionyl-CoA synthetase increases with increased levels of propionyl-CoA when the cells are grown on propionate medium (8.Garrity J. Gardner J.G. Hawse W. Wolberger C. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30239-30245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In animals, the concentration of the acyl-CoAs fluctuates in response to diet and other physiological conditions (22.King M.T. Reiss P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given the regulatory function of acyl donors, propionylation in chromatin is likely to reflect the cellular level of propionyl-CoA, an important intermediate generated from energy metabolism. In this connection, we speculate that genes involved in energy metabolism could be regulated by histone propionylation. The identification of target genes subject to propionylation would help elucidate the biological processes that this modification could modulate. Our findings are in good agreement with previous reports that the addition and removal of propionyl groups can be catalyzed by the same set of enzymes as for acetylation and deacetylation (9.Chen Y. Sprung R. Tang Y. Ball H. Sangras B. Kim S.C. Falck J.R. Peng J. Gu W. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 10.Leemhuis H. Packman L.C. Nightingale K.P. Hollfelder F. ChemBioChem. 2008; 9: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the acetylation level in the U937 cell line is similar to that in other cell lines, we speculate that hyperpropionylation in U937 cells may result from the irregular accumulation of the propionyl donor molecule, propionyl-CoA. The accumulation of propionyl-CoA could arise from either up-regulation of propionyl-CoA synthetase or down-regulation of propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which removes propionyl-CoA by converting it into 2-methyl citrate. It would be of interest to examine the expression levels of these two enzymes directly involved in propionyl-CoA homeostasis in the related leukemia cells. Several lines of evidence are in favor of the existence of distinct propionylation enzymes (or specific regulatory factors) other than acetyltransferase (deacetylase). H3K23 propionylation is found only in the U937 cell line but not in the other two related monocytic leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and THP-1. Despite the striking difference in propionylation levels, the acetylation levels at Lys23 are similar among these cell lines. Additionally, the histone acetyltransferase p300 propionylates four lysine residues (Lys9, Lys14, Lys18, and Lys23) of the H3 histone tail indiscriminately in vitro, and depropionylation by Sir2 is unlikely to be specific for the Lys23 site. A propionyltransferase that acts exclusively on H3K23 has not been found yet. Consistent with the proposed relationship between a specific metabolic state and histone propionylation, the known genetic and epigenetic alterations in U937 cells do not seem to contribute to the prominent propionylation. The U937 cell line is characterized by the presence of a t(10;11)(p13;q14) chromosome translocation leading to the fusion of the CALM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia) gene with the putative transcription factor gene AF10 (14.Dreyling M.H. Martinez-Climent J.A. Zheng M. Mao J. Rowley J.D. Bohlander S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4804-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The CALM-AF10 fusion protein causes global hypomethylation at H3K79 due to the functional perturbation of the responsible histone methyltransferase hDOT1L by the fusion (6.Lin Y.H. Kakadia P.M. Chen Y. Li Y.Q. Deshpande A.J. Buske C. Zhang K.L. Zhang Y. Xu G.L. Bohlander S.K. Blood. 2009; 114: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of CALM-AF10 in T-REx-293 cells results in H3K79 hypomethylation (6.Lin Y.H. Kakadia P.M. Chen Y. Li Y.Q. Deshpande A.J. Buske C. Zhang K.L. Zhang Y. Xu G.L. Bohlander S.K. Blood. 2009; 114: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but has no effect on Lys23 propionylation (Fig. 3A). Therefore, hyperpropionylation is not due to the expression of the leukemogenic fusion protein. Whether the differential propionylation in U937 leukemia cells can instead be attributed to a unique metabolic state associated with their monocytic differentiation stage is an intriguing possibility that warrants further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2019403967,"Pathways for tailoring and processing vitamins into active cofactor forms exist in mammals that are unable to synthesize these cofactors de novo. A prerequisite for intracellular tailoring of alkylcobalamins entering from the circulation is removal of the alkyl group to generate an intermediate that can subsequently be converted into the active cofactor forms. MMACHC, a cytosolic cobalamin trafficking chaperone, has been shown recently to catalyze a reductive decyanation reaction when it encounters cyanocobalamin. In this study, we demonstrate that this versatile protein catalyzes an entirely different chemical reaction with alkylcobalamins using the thiolate of glutathione for nucleophilic displacement to generate cob(I)alamin and the corresponding glutathione thioether. Biologically relevant thiols, e.g. cysteine and homocysteine, cannot substitute for glutathione. The catalytic turnover numbers for the dealkylation of methylcobalamin and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin by MMACHC are 11.7 +/- 0.2 and 0.174 +/- 0.006 h(-1) at 20 degrees C, respectively. This glutathione transferase activity of MMACHC is reminiscent of the methyltransferase chemistry catalyzed by the vitamin B(12)-dependent methionine synthase and is impaired in the cblC group of inborn errors of cobalamin disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2072720484,"CUL4A and CUL4B, which are derived from the same ancestor, CUL4, encode scaffold proteins that organize cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (E3) complexes. Recent genetic studies have shown that germ line mutation in CUL4B can cause mental retardation, short stature, and other abnormalities in humans. CUL4A was observed to be overexpressed in breast and hepatocellular cancers, although no germ line mutation in human CUL4A has been reported. Although CUL4A has been known to be involved in a number of cellular processes, including DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, little is known about whether CUL4B has similar functions. In this report, we tested the functional importance of CUL4B in cell proliferation and characterized the nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is essential for its function. We found that RNA interference silencing of CUL4B led to an inhibition of cell proliferation and a prolonged S phase, due to the overaccumulation of cyclin E, a substrate targeted by CUL4B for ubiquitination. We showed that, unlike CUL4A and other cullins that carry their NLS in their C termini, NLS in CUL4B is located in its N terminus, between amino acid 37 and 40, KKRK. This NLS could bind to importin alpha1, alpha3, and alpha5. NLS-deleted CUL4B was distributed in cytoplasm and failed to promote cell proliferation. Therefore, the nuclear localization of CUL4B mediated by NLS is critical for its normal function in cell proliferation."

Most amber is Mesozoic or Cenozoic in age (dating back as far as 250 million years ago), and the most common class, produced primarily by angiosperms, is formed from distinct complex polyterpenoids. Bray and Anderson (p. 132 ; see the Perspective by Grimaldi ) now find that amber from the Carboniferous, dating to more than 300 million years ago, long before the evolution of angiosperms, has a similar chemistry. Thus, the biosynthetic mechanism for producing complex ambers evolved long before the appearance of flowering plants."
https://openalex.org/W2008814870,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNA) are 20∼25 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that inhibit the translation of targeted mRNA, and they have been implicated in the development of human malignancies. High grade serous ovarian carcinomas, the most common and lethal subtype of ovarian cancer, can occur sporadically or in the setting of BRCA1/2 syndromes. Little is known regarding the miRNA expression profiles of high grade serous carcinoma in relation to BRCA1/2 status, and compared to normal tubal epithelium, the putative tissue of origin for high grade serous carcinomas. Methodology/Principal Findings Global miRNA expression profiling was performed on a series of 33 high grade serous carcinomas, characterized with respect to BRCA1/2 status (mutation, epigenetic silencing with loss of expression or normal), and with clinical follow-up, together with 2 low grade serous carcinomas, 2 serous borderline tumors, and 3 normal fallopian tube samples, using miRNA microarrays (328 human miRNA). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on miRNA expression profiles showed no clear separation between the groups of carcinomas with different BRCA1/2 status. There were relatively few miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the genotypic subgroups. Comparison of 33 high grade serous carcinomas to 3 normal fallopian tube samples identified several dysregulated miRNAs (false discovery rate <5%), including miR-422b and miR-34c. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis performed on selected miRNAs confirmed the pattern of differential expression shown by microarray analysis. Prognostically, lower level miR-422b and miR-34c in high grade serous carcinomas were both associated with decreased disease-specific survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis (p<0.05). Conclusions/Significance High grade serous ovarian carcinomas with and without BRCA1/2 abnormalities demonstrate very similar miRNA expression profiles. High grade serous carcinomas as a group exhibit significant miRNA dysregulation in comparison to tubal epithelium and the levels of miR-34c and miR-422b appear to be prognostically important."
https://openalex.org/W2059617293,"DYRK1A is a serine/threonine kinase that has been linked to mental retardation associated with Down syndrome. In the present report, we describe a previously unknown role for DYRK1A in bone homeostasis. The protein expression of DYRK1A increased during osteoclast differentiation. In vitro studies in osteoclasts revealed that DYRK1A inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Whereas DYRK1A phosphorylated and inhibited the osteoclastogenic transcription factor NFATc1, forced expression of NFATc1 induced DYRK1A expression, suggesting a negative feedback loop. Transgenic mice overexpressing DYRK1A by the extent of the increased gene dosage in Down syndrome exhibited significantly reduced bone mass despite the decreased osteoclastogenesis, which is reminiscent of osteoporotic bone phenotype in Down syndrome patients. In these mice, attenuated osteoblast differentiation and function in the presence of extra DYRK1A overrode the effect of impaired osteoclastogenesis. However, impeded osteoclastogenesis in DYRK1A transgenic mice was proven to be beneficial in protecting bone loss induced by inflammation or estrogen deficiency. These results provide novel insight into the role for DYRK1A in bone homeostasis as well as in bone destructive diseases, in which modulation of DYRK1A might be used as a strategy to treat unregulated bone resorption.

Here we show that DYRK1A functions as a negative feedback regulator of NFATc1 in the modulation of bone homeostasis in vivo. Our results indicate a novel function of DYRK1A for bone cell regulation that might be applied to the treatment of bone-destructive diseases. Five-week-old ICR mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). DYRK1A TG mice expressing human DYRK1A and WT littermates of C57BL/6 background were described previously (6.Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For the LPS-induced bone loss model, male WT or DYRK1A TG mice (6 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with PBS or LPS (Sigma; O111:B4; 5 mg/kg) dissolved in PBS of 200-μl volume at 7 and 3 days before sacrifice. For the ovariectomy-induced bone loss model, female WT and DYRK1A TG mice (14 weeks old) were either ovariectomized or sham-operated at 4 weeks before sacrifice. Animal experimental protocols were approved by the committees on the care and use of animals in research at Seoul National University and Inje University. Recombinant human soluble RANKL, human M-CSF, and human BMP-2 were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The leukocyte acid phosphatase assay kit was from Sigma. Lipofectamine 2000TM was from Invitrogen. Antibodies (Abs) against DYRK1A (M01) and DYRK1B were from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan) and Abgent (San Diego, CA), respectively. Abs against NFATc1 (7A6), Lamin B (M-20), and c-Fos (H-125) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The 7A6 anti-NFATc1 Ab was raised against a fragment of human NFATc1 that is conserved in all six known mouse isoforms. Anti-β-actin (AC-74) was from Sigma. Phosphospecific Abs for ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), JNK (Thr182/Tyr185), and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphoserine Ab (3C171) was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Ionomycin and cyclosporin A were obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Immunoprecipitates, whole cell lysates, or nuclear extracts from the same number of cells were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunodetection using chemiluminescence (17.Lee Y. Hyung S.W.

The mRNA expression of genes was quantified by the methods described previously (17.Lee Y. Hyung S.W. Jung H.J. Kim H.J. Staerk J. Constantinescu S.N. Chang E.J. Lee Z.H. Lee S.W. Kim H.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Primer sequences for real-time PCR analyses were listed in supplemental Table S1. BMMs (2 × 104 cells/well in 48-well plastic plates) were incubated with 30 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml RANKL for 3–4 days. At the end of incubation, osteoclast differentiation was determined by staining for TRAP activity using a leukocyte acid phosphatase assay kit (Sigma), and cells were photographed as previously described (17.Lee Y. Hyung S.W. Jung H.J. Kim H.J. Staerk J. Constantinescu S.N. Chang E.J. Lee Z.H. Lee S.W. Kim H.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In some experiments, BMMs were cocultured with osteoblasts (104/well) in the presence of 10 nm 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 1 μm prostaglandin E2. Calvarial cells were prepared from 1-day-old mice (18.Ryu J. Kim H.J. Chang E.J. Huang H. Banno Y. Kim H.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5840-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Osteoblast differentiation was induced by treating cells (104/well in 48-well plates) with either 10 mm β-glycerophosphate plus 100 μm ascorbic acid or 300 ng/ml BMP-2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 6 days, cells were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity. The intensity of alkaline phosphatase staining was quantified by scanning of cell culture plates (PowerLook 1100 scanner) followed by measuring the integrated density using the ImageJ program (version 1.40; available on the National Institutes of Health web site). Alternatively, the mineralization was visualized by alizarin red staining after 2–3 weeks of culture. pcDNA3.1-DYRK1A was prepared from mouse brain cDNA (19.Ryoo S.R. Jeong H.K. Radnaabazar C.

For DYRK knockdown experiments, oligonucleotides for small interfering RNA were generated by targeting a 21-base sequence of mouse Dyrk1a and Dyrk1b. The resulting oligonucleotide sequences (supplemental Table S2) were annealed and ligated into pSuper-retro vector (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) using BamHI and HindIII sites. Retroviruses were packaged by transfecting plasmids into Plat-E cells. Retroviral infection of cells was performed as described previously (17.Lee Y. Hyung S.W. Jung H.J. Kim H.J. Staerk J. Constantinescu S.N. Chang E.J. Lee Z.H. Lee S.W. Kim H.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1-DYRK1A and incubated with 100 ng/ml RANKL for 2 days. The cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid containing the 0.8-kb proximal region of NFATc1 promoter (20.Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Tyrsin D. Akimzhanov A. Moroz D. Jha M.K.

Luciferase activity was measured using Bright-GloTM luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) in a FLUOstar Optima luminometer (BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany). WT or DYRK1A TG mice (8 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg calcein (Sigma; dissolved in 200 μl of 2% NaHCO3, 150 mm NaCl) followed by 90 mg/kg xylenol orange (Sigma) at day 1 and day 7, respectively. Mice were sacrificed at day 10, and femurs were fixed and embedded in resin (BMP Lab, Seoul, Korea). Sections were observed under a Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) with a ×40 objective (C-Apochromat/1.2 W Corr). The distance between calcein and xylenol orange deposition was calculated from five different regions of the same image in 4 slides/group using the LSM 5 image browser (version 3.1). Femurs from mice were subjected to microCT analyses using a SkyScan 1172 scanner (SkyScan, Aartselaar, Belgium; 40 kV, 250 μA, 7.9 μm pixel size). Images obtained from a 1-mm-thick distal femoral area, starting from 1 mm below the growth plate, were analyzed by the CT-analyzer program (version 1.7; SkyScan) to calculate bone volume and bone parameters. A three-dimensional reconstitution of images was performed by CT-volume software (version 1.11; SkyScan). Femurs were fixed, decalcified for 1 month in 10% EDTA, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 μm thickness were prepared using Leica microtome RM2145 (Leica Microsystems, Bannockbrun, IL) and were subjected to TRAP and hematoxylin staining. Histomorphometric analysis was performed as described (21.Chang E.J. Ha J. Oerlemans F. Lee Y.J. Lee S.W. Ryu J. Kim H.J. Lee Y. Kim H.M. Choi J.Y. Kim J.Y. Shin C.S. Pak Y.K. Tanaka S. Wieringa B. Lee Z.H. Kim H.H. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using the Bioquant OsteoII program (Bioquant Image Analysis Corp., Nashville, TN). Student's t test was used to determine the significance of difference between two groups. Comparison of results composed of more than two groups was done by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Differences with p < 0.05 were regarded as significant. A detailed description of methods is provided in the supplemental material. DYRK1A expression significantly increased upon stimulation of mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) with RANKL (Fig. 1A). A real-time PCR analysis revealed that RANKL significantly up-regulated Dyrk1a mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). To gain insights into the role of DYRK1A during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, we down-regulated DYRK1A protein expression by introducing small interfering RNA into BMMs via retroviral infection (supplemental Fig. S1A). Osteoclast differentiation was dramatically enhanced in DYRK1A down-regulated BMMs, suggesting a negative regulatory role of DYRK1A during osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, when DYRK1A was overexpressed in RAW264.7 macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1B), a significant decrease in osteoclastogenesis was observed (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, DYRK1B did not dramatically affect osteoclastogenesis, although its expression was significantly increased by RANKL (supplemental Fig. S2). To uncover the RANKL-dependent transcription factor(s) that might induce DYRK1A expression in osteoclasts, BMMs were infected with retroviruses to overexpress transcription factors known to be activated downstream of RANKL. Although c-Fos only slightly stimulated DYRK1A expression, both WT and constitutive active NFATc1 dramatically increased DYRK1A in the absence of RANKL (Fig. 2A), suggesting that NFATc1 might be a regulator of DYRK1A expression. Although the RANKL-dependent DYRK1A expression was suppressed by NFκB inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S3A), it was most likely due to the inhibition of NFATc1 expression because NFκB inhibitors did not reduce DYRK1A expression in the presence of constitutive active NFATc1 (supplemental Fig. S3B). It was suggested that DYRK1A might phosphorylate and thereby exclude NFAT from the nucleus (15.Gwack Y. Sharma S. Nardone J. Tanasa B. Iuga A. Srikanth S. Okamura H. Bolton D. Feske S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 16.Arron J.R. Winslow M.M. Polleri A. Chang C.P. Wu H. Gao X. Neilson J.R. Chen L. Heit J.J. Kim S.K. Yamasaki N. Miyakawa T. Francke U. Graef I.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2006; 441: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Indeed, there was a significant increase in the phosphorylation of NFATc1 in DYRK1A-overexpressing 293FT cells (Fig. 2B). Similar enhanced phosphorylation of NFATc1 was observed in RAW264.7 cells overexpressing DYRK1A (supplemental Fig. S3C). The accumulation of nuclear NFATc1 in response to RANKL treatment was prominently suppressed in DYRK1A-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2C). Similarly, NFATc1 in the nuclear fraction from DYRK1A-overexpressing cells did not increase upon stimulation with ionomycin (Fig. 2D). In addition, it was evident that there was little activation of NFATc1 promoter activity by RANKL in DYRK1A-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells, compared with that in control cells (Fig. 2E). DYRK1A also suppressed NFATc1-dependent IL-4 promoter activity (supplemental Fig. S3D). In accordance with the reduced NFATc1 promoter activation, RANKL-induced increase in total NFATc1 protein was significantly impaired in DYRK1A-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2F). Taken together, we suggest that DYRK1A inhibits NFATc1 activity and expression via a negative feedback regulation. The in vitro inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by DYRK1A led us to analyze the bone phenotype of DYRK1A BAC transgenic (DYRK1A TG) mice that overexpress human DYRK1A by 1.5-fold under the control of endogenous promoter to mimic the increased gene dosage of Down syndrome (6.Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although we detected no emphatic skeletal anomaly in gross examination by soft x-ray (supplemental Fig. S4A), microCT analysis of femurs revealed that trabecular bone volume was markedly decreased in TG mice compared with WT (supplemental Fig. S4B). Analyses of bone parameters from microCT data further confirmed an osteoporotic bone phenotype of both male and female DYRK1A TG mice (Fig. 3A). The bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) in male mice was 12.7 ± 0.6% in WT and 10.1 ± 0.9% in TG femurs. Similarly, BV/TV in female mice was reduced from 12.6 ± 0.5% in WT to 10.9 ± 0.3% in TG mice. The analyses of trabecular thickness (supplemental Fig. S4C), trabecular number (supplemental Fig. S4D), and trabecular separation (supplemental Fig. S4E) indicated reduced bone mass in TG mice. However, it seemed that the extra DYRK1A did not affect cortical bone thickness of femurs (supplemental Fig. S4, F and G). The RANKL-stimulated expression of NFATc1 was significantly reduced in DYRK1A TG BMMs (Fig. 3B). We observed no significant defect in RANKL-dependent mitogen-activated kinase activation (supplemental Fig. S5A), indicating that the signaling pathways known to regulate RANKL-dependent NFATc1 expression in BMMs were not affected. Both proliferation (supplemental Fig. S5B) and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S5C) were significantly impaired in DYRK1A TG BMMs. A real-time PCR analysis revealed significant reduction of osteoclast differentiation markers Acp5, Calcr, and, to a lesser extent, Ctsk in TG BMMs following RANKL stimulation (Fig. 3D). In agreement with the reduced osteoclast differentiation, the resorption activity of TG osteoclasts was significantly lower than that of WT osteoclasts (data not shown). However, when DYRK1A TG BMMs were forced to express WT or constitutive active NFATc1, defective osteoclastogenesis was restored (Fig. 3E). Since the impaired osteoclastogenesis contradicted the reduced bone mass in DYRK1A TG mice, we next investigated the function of osteoblasts in TG mice. Stimulation of osteoblast differentiation in mouse calvarial cells with β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid significantly induced DYRK1A expression (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the induction of DYRK1A paralleled NFATc1 expression. Overexpression of NFATc1 in calvarial cells induced DYRK1A expression (Fig. 4B), suggesting that DYRK1A might be under the regulation of negative feedback loop as in osteoclasts. A markedly reduced NFATc1 induction by BMP-2 was observed in TG osteoblasts (Fig. 4C), whereas extra DYRK1A did not affect BMP-2-dependent Smad phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S6A). Treatment of osteoblasts with BMP-2 increased nuclear NFATc1 in WT cells but not in DYRK1A TG cells (Fig. 4D). In addition, proliferation (supplemental Fig. S6B) and differentiation (Fig. 4E) of calvarial osteoblasts were significantly impaired in DYRK1A TG mice. The inhibition of NFATc1 by a calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A resulted in a significant attenuation of osteoblast differentiation, suggesting a role for NFATc1 in osteoblasts (supplemental Fig. S6C). A real-time PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation markers, including Bglap1, Alpl, and Col1a1, was significantly reduced in DYRK1A TG osteoblasts (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, however, the expression of Tnfsf11 was consistently higher in TG than in WT osteoblasts. DYRK1A TG osteoblasts formed less mineralized nodules (Fig. 4G). In vivo bone formation, measured by the distance between the two fluorescence labels after sequential labeling of femurs with calcein and xylenol orange, was visibly impaired in TG mice (Fig. 4H). Accordingly, mineral apposition rate was significantly lower in TG mice (supplemental Fig. S6D). However, presumably due to the compensatory effect of increased RANKL (encoded by Tnfsf11) expression in TG osteoblasts, impaired TG osteoblast function by extra DYRK1A did not affect osteoclastogenesis in an osteoblast-BMM coculture system (Fig. 4I and supplemental Fig. S6E). Taken together, DYRK1A plays a negative regulatory role during normal osteoblast differentiation. In DYRK1A TG mice, impaired osteoblast function seemingly overrode impeded osteoclast function, resulting in the reduced bone mass. To examine the effect of extra DYRK1A on bone resorption in TG mice, we adopted an LPS challenge and ovariectomy model that emulates inflammation- and hormone deprivation-induced bone loss. A three-dimensional visualization of distal femoral area showed massive loss of trabecular bone following LPS treatment in WT mice (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, no further significant loss of trabecular bone was observed in DYRK1A TG mice challenged with LPS. This was clearly demonstrated when bone volume was analyzed from microCT data (Fig. 5B). The BV/TV was 9.2 ± 0.2% for the PBS-treated group and 7.3 ± 0.2% for the LPS-treated group in WT mice. However, there was no statistical difference in the bone volume of femurs between PBS- and LPS-challenged TG mice (8.1 ± 0.2% for the PBS-treated group and 8.0 ± 0.2% for the LPS-treated group). Analyses of trabecular thickness and trabecular number also revealed that LPS did not induce trabecular bone loss in DYRK1A TG mice (supplemental Fig. S7, A and B). Consistent with the microCT results, histological analyses revealed significant loss of trabecular bone accompanied by increased TRAP activity in femoral sections from LPS-treated WT mice compared with PBS-treated groups (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, no such bone loss and increase of TRAP-positive osteoclasts were observed in DYRK1A TG mice upon LPS treatment. Assessment of the osteoclast and osteoblast numbers also indicated that DYRK1A TG mice were protected from LPS effects (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S7C). A three-dimensional reconstitution of microCT images (supplemental Fig. S8A) and an analysis of microCT data (Fig. 5E) from ovariectomized mice also revealed that ovariectomy reduced bone volume by more than 30% in WT mice. The BV/TV was 15.6 ± 0.5% in sham-operated and 10.4 ± 0.6% in ovariectomized WT mice. However, the femoral bone volume of DYRK1A TG mice was not affected by ovariectomy (13.5 ± 0.1% in sham-operated and 13.4 ± 0.4% in ovariectomized mice) (Fig. 5E). Analyses of trabecular thickness (supplemental Fig. S8B) and trabecular number (supplemental Fig. S8C) also indicated that ovariectomy resulted in a significant trabecular bone loss only in WT mice. Histological analyses were consistent with the microCT results, showing no increase of TRAP-positive osteoclasts and bone loss in DYRK1A TG mice following ovariectomy (supplemental Fig. S8D). The number of osteoblasts in sham-operated and ovariectomized TG mice was significantly smaller than that of corresponding WT mice (supplemental Fig. S8E). Although osteoclast number per bone perimeter dramatically increased following ovariectomy in WT mice, the increase was insignificant in TG mice (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these results suggest that DYRK1A TG mice are apparently resistant to LPS- and ovariectomy-induced bone loss. In the present report, we investigated the role of DYRK1A in bone homeostasis. Intriguingly, in an effort to delineate signaling pathways responsible for the induction of DYRK1A, we discovered that NFATc1 stimulated the expression of DYRK1A in both osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts. Since NFATc1 activity and expression were inhibited by DYRK1A, it is likely that there is a negative feedback mechanism. In this hypothesis, increased NFATc1 upon pro-osteoclastogenic signals in osteoclast precursors induces DYRK1A expression, which in turn attenuates NFATc1 activity and expression, thereby limiting excessive osteoclastogenesis. DYRK1A inhibited NFATc1 nuclear localization and activity via phosphorylation. Importantly, DYRK1A also reduced NFATc1 promoter activity, suggesting a crucial role for DYRK1A in the regulation of NFATc1 autoamplification process (22.Asagiri M. Sato K. Usami T. Ochi S. Nishina H. Yoshida H. Morita I. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Serfling E. Takayanagi H. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The schematic diagram in Fig. 6, A and B, depicted this DYRK1A-dependent negative feedback regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Similarly, bone formation-inducing signals, such as BMP-2, induce NFATc1 expression in osteoblasts. Enhanced DYRK1A by NFATc1 turns down NFATc1 signaling to prevent uncontrolled bone formation. Thus, the DYRK1A-NFATc1 negative feedback loop might serve as a mechanism to maintain bone homeostasis and to prevent pathologic bone destruction or bone formation. The role of DYRK1A in Down syndrome has been of particular interest due to its location on human chromosome 21q22.2 region, denoted as the “Down syndrome critical region,” which is believed to contain crucial genes for Down syndrome pathogenesis (23.Delabar J.M.

The BAC DYRK1A TG mice used in this study have benefits as a clinically relevant model because these mice carry only one copy of human DYRK1A under the control of the endogenous promoter region (see the supplemental material for detailed discussion). As a result, these mice exhibited ∼1.5-fold overexpression of DYRK1A protein, providing an optimal model to study the role of DYRK1A in Down syndrome pathogenesis (6.Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S.

Several groups have reported that the bone mineral density in Down syndrome patients is significantly lower than that in normal population. Importantly, the reduced bone density was observed in both males and females even in young age groups (25.Center J. Beange H. McElduff A. Am. J. Ment. Retard. 1998; 103: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26.Angelopoulou N. Matziari C. Tsimaras V. Sakadamis A. Souftas V. Mandroukas K. Calcif.

Int. 2005; 16: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This was in sharp contrast with the prevalence of osteoporosis in elderly women in normal population. However, the etiology of osteoporosis among Down syndrome patients has remained ambiguous and under debate until the present. The current explanations range from the existence of an additional gene(s) on extra chromosome 21 to malnutrition and sedentary life style among Down syndrome patients. Here we showed for the first time that the 1.5-fold overdose of DYRK1A alone was sufficient to induce significant reduction in bone volume (21% in male mice and 13% in female mice) (Fig. 3A), reminiscent of the Down syndrome-associated osteoporosis. Inhibition of NFATc1 activity by additional DYRK1A resulted in a compromised osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization, supporting a suggested role of NFATc1 in osteoblastogenesis (30.Koga T. Matsui Y. Asagiri M. Kodama T. de Crombrugghe B. Nakashima K. Takayanagi H. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 31.Winslow M.M. Pan M. Starbuck M. Gallo E.M. Deng L. Karsenty G. Crabtree G.R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). At the same time, the proliferation, differentiation, and function of osteoclasts were also diminished in DYRK1A TG mice. From these results, we suggest that extra DYRK1A in DYRK1A TG mice and Down syndrome patients sets a new equilibrium for NFATc1 signaling in bone homeostasis, reducing bone turnover (Fig. 6C). In concert with this hypothesis, we observed consistently lower numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bones from DYRK1A TG mice in accordance with the reported “adynamic” bone phenotype in Down syndrome patients (32.Grimwood J.S. Kumar A. Bickerstaff D.R. Suvarna S.K. Histopathology. 2000; 36: 279-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Notably, the Down syndrome critical region also contains DSCR1, which encodes a calcineurin inhibitor. As a result, the phosphorylated state of NFATc1 might be further sustained by inhibition of calcineurin (16.Arron J.R. Winslow M.M. Polleri A. Chang C.P. Wu H. Gao X. Neilson J.R. Chen L. Heit J.J. Kim S.K. Yamasaki N. Miyakawa T. Francke U. Graef I.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2006; 441: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), possibly magnifying the effect of DYRK1A on NFATc1 activity and bone homeostasis in Down syndrome. Historically, it was of great interest to search for a gene(s) on human chromosome 21 that is responsible for specific Down syndrome pathogenesis. In this context, the possible involvement of DYRK1A in Down syndrome skeletal anomalies in addition to the osteoporotic bone phenotype might be worthy of pursuit. Notably, however, we could not observe significant gross malformations in the skeletal system, such as a craniofacial defect in DYRK1A TG mice, in contrast to Down syndrome patients and trisomy-16 mice (33.Richtsmeier J.T. Baxter L.L. Reeves R.H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 34.Richtsmeier J.T. Zumwalt A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Reeves R.H. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 107: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice trisomic only for the Down syndrome critical region did not show a distinctive facial phenotype (35.Olson L.E. Richtsmeier J.T. Leszl J. Reeves R.H. Science. 2004; 306: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), suggesting that genes in this region may not be involved. Alternatively, mice overexpressing Ets2 that is located outside of the Down syndrome critical region had defects in cranial and cervical skeleton formation (36.Sumarsono S.H. Wilson T.J. Tymms M.J. Venter D.J. Corrick C.M. Kola R. Lahoud M.H. Papas T.S. Seth A. Kola I. Nature. 1996; 379: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However NFATc1, a substrate of DYRK1A, has been linked to craniofacial anomalies in mice. Recent reports observed craniofacial malformations in Nfatc1nuc mice that express the constitutive active form of NFATc1 (31.Winslow M.M. Pan M. Starbuck M. Gallo E.M. Deng L. Karsenty G. Crabtree G.R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), viable Nfatc1−/− mice (31.Winslow M.M. Pan M. Starbuck M. Gallo E.M. Deng L. Karsenty G. Crabtree G.R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and Nfatc2−/−Nfatc4−/− double knock-out mice (16.Arron J.R. Winslow M.M. Polleri A. Chang C.P. Wu H. Gao X. Neilson J.R. Chen L. Heit J.J. Kim S.K. Yamasaki N. Miyakawa T. Francke U. Graef I.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2006; 441: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), suggesting possible gene dosage-dependent mechanisms for NFATc proteins in the regulation of skeletal development. Taken together, although it is believed that the regulation of NFATc1 by DYRK1A alone is sufficient to control bone homeostasis, skeletal development might be governed by additional mechanism(s). Further studies are required to clearly define the mechanism of NFATc protein regulation in skeletal anomalies observed in Down syndrome. Notwithstanding the deleterious effect on bone mass in unchallenged DYRK1A TG mice, extra DYRK1A was beneficial in protecting these mice from experimental bone loss induced by inflammation or hormone deprivation. As summarized in Fig. 6C, bone destruction by LPS or ovariectomy was prevented because the negative-regulation of NFATc1 reduced osteoclastogenesis in DYRK1A TG mice. In efforts to develop a strategy to prevent osteoporosis, NFATc1 has been suggested as a target molecule due to its role in osteoclastogenesis (22.Asagiri M. Sato K. Usami T. Ochi S. Nishina H. Yoshida H. Morita I. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Serfling E. Takayanagi H. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 37.Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M.

We suggest that targeting DYRK1A instead of directly modulating NFATc1 might provide an efficient strategy for treating bone-destructive diseases, because only a 50% increase in the DYRK1A protein level was enough to completely prevent bone loss in animal models. To summarize, we have discovered a negative feedback mechanism for DYRK1A-NFATc1 regulation, which affects bone homeostasis. Our results provide an insight into the novel role for DYRK1A in the regulation of bone mass in normal and pathologic conditions, including Down syndrome-associated osteoporosis, as well as prospects for therapeutic applications for bone-destructive diseases.

Subsequently, phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues within five repeating signature PPPSP motifs on LRP6 is responsible for LRP6 activation. GSK3β, a cytosolic kinase for phosphorylation of a downstream effector β-catenin, was proposed to participate in such LRP6 phosphorylation. Here, we report a new class of membrane-associated kinases for LRP6 phosphorylation. We found that G protein-coupled receptor kinases 5 and 6 (GRK5/6), traditionally known to phosphorylate and desensitize 7TM G protein-coupled receptors, directly phosphorylate the PPPSP motifs on single transmembrane LRP6 and regulate Wnt/LRP6 signaling. GRK5/6-induced LRP6 activation is inhibited by the LRP6 antagonist Dickkopf. Depletion of GRK5 markedly reduces Wnt3A-stimulated LRP6 phosphorylation in cells. In zebrafish, functional knock-down of GRK5 results in reduced Wnt signaling, analogous to LRP6 knock-down, as assessed by decreased abundance of β-catenin and lowered expression of the Wnt target genes cdx4, vent, and axin2. Expression of GRK5 rescues the diminished β-catenin and axin2 response caused by GRK5 depletion. Thus, our findings identify GRK5/6 as novel kinases for the single transmembrane receptor LRP6 during Wnt signaling.

Both receptors act in concert to inhibit the kinase activity of cytosolic glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), which leads to stabilization of β-catenin in the cytosol and enhances the nuclear activity of LEF/TCF transcription factors (5.He X.

Upon Wnt3A stimulation, LRP6 is activated by phosphorylation at its C terminus. The phosphorylation sites include 1) threonine 1479 phosphorylated by the membrane-associated casein kinase 1γ (8.Davidson G. Wu W. Shen J. Bilic J. Fenger U. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2005; 438: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and 2) multiple serine/threonine residues within five repeating signature PPPSP motifs, which are typically monitored by phosphorylation of serine 1490 at the first PPPSP sequence (9.Tamai K.

G protein-coupled receptor kinases 5 and 6 (GRK5 and GRK6) are membrane-associated serine/threonine protein kinases, and they share sequence and functional similarities (12.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 13.Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These two kinases are ubiquitously expressed and phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) upon agonist stimulation (12.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Such receptor phosphorylation initiates β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization, internalization, and signaling events (13.Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). More and more data have been shown that β-arrestins are an important component in Wnt signaling (15.Bryja V. Gradl D.

For example, β-arrestin2 can mediate Wnt5A-stimulated Frizzled 4 endocytosis via Dishevelled2 (17.Chen W. ten Berge D. Brown J. Ahn S. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Nusse R.

Here, we report that GRK5 and GRK6 function as novel kinases responsible for LRP6 phosphorylation in Wnt signaling. pcDNA3 LRP6 (human) was provided by Dr. J. Fred Hess (Merck, West Point, PA). Wnt luciferase reporter plasmid p8xTOPflash was obtained from Dr. Randall Moon (Washington University). LRP6 cytosolic tail (LRP6-CT) and its M5 mutant genes from Dr. David Virshup (Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School) were cloned into pET30a (Stratagene) to express His6-tagged LRP6-CT fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The following antibodies were used: anti-LRP6 phosphoserine 1490 antibody (Cell Signaling) with a 1:1000 dilution, anti-LRP6 antibody (clone C10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with a 1:1000 dilution, anti-β-catenin antibody (clone C2206, Sigma-Aldrich) with a 1:2000 dilution, anti-GAPDH antibody (clone 6C5, Abcam) with a 1:500 dilution, and anti-GRK5 or -GRK6 antibody (generated in our laboratories) with a 1:1000 dilution. Dickkopf-1 was purchased from R and D Systems. GRK5 was purified from Sf9 cells as described (18.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified GRK6 and GSK3β were purchased from Upstate and Calbiochem, respectively. Both Wnt3A and control conditioned medium were produced from mouse L cells stably expressing mouse Wnt3A and wild type L cells (ATCC), respectively, according to the protocols described in ATCC. GRK6 knock-out MEFs were generated in our laboratory from GRK6 knock-out mice (19.Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M. Sotnikova T.D. Cyr M. Laakso A. Macrae A.D. Torres G.E. Kim K.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G.

HEK293 cells and MEF cells were maintained in MEM and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, and both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. DNA transfection was performed using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers' protocols. To conduct Wnt luciferase reporter assays, cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs expressing the genes of interest along with 0.25 μg of p8xTOPflash and 50 ng of an internal control Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) per well in a 12-well plate. The reporter assays were performed in triplicates, and the luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase kit from Promega. His6-tagged LRP6 cytosolic tail and its M5 mutant protein were expressed in BL21DE3 pLysS (Stratagene), and purified using Invitrogen ProBond Resin nickel beads according to the manufacturer's procedure. Purified LRP6-CT protein was subjected to phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by purified GRK5, GRK6, and GSK3β in MOPS reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 μm non-radioactive ATP) at 30 °C for 1 h. The reactions were quenched by SDS loading buffer, resolved in 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation signals were quantified by phosphorimager. For mass spectrometry to identify phosphorylation sites, nonradioactive (without addition of [γ-32P]ATP) phosphorylation assays were performed under identical conditions as described above. A band corresponding to LRP6-CT protein was cut out from an SDS-PAGE gel, and mass spectrometry analysis was performed in the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (the laboratory of Dr. Steven Gygi) at Harvard University. Scramble lentiviral shRNA (Addgene plasmid 1864) and mouse GRK5 lentiviral shRNA (SHGLYC-TRCN0000022829) constructs were purchased from Addgene and Sigma, respectively. Lentivirus production and shRNA knock-down were performed according to protocols from Addgene. For GRK5 knock-down using siRNA, two mouse siRNAs (GRK5-1, 5′-AAGGACCATAGACAGAGATTA-3′; GRK5-2, 5′-AACCTGGCCTATGCCTATGAA-3′) were transfected into GRK6 knock-out MEFs using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Human GRK5 siRNA, AAGGACCATAGACAGAGATTA; human GRK6 siRNA, AACAGTAGGTTTGTAGTGAGC, were used to deplete GRK5 or GRK6 levels in HEK293 cells, using Gene Silencer (Genlantis). Zebrafish LRP6 (zLRP6) was amplified by PCR from cDNA of 12-somite stage (ss) embryos using the following primers: zLRP6-Forward 5′-CACCATGTATTGGACCGACTGGG-3′ and zLRP6-Reverse 5′-TGAGGAGTCTGTGCAGGG-3′. Sequences upstream of the start codon were obtained from the current version of the zebrafish genome and verified by PCR using a high fidelity proofreading polymerase and sequencing. To obtain the complete coding sequence for zebrafish GRK5 (zGRK5), a sequence with significant homology to the mammalian GRK5 was identified by BLAST search of the Sanger zebrafish genome data base. A partial sequence was obtained by PCR from cDNA generated from 24 h postfertilization (hpf) embryos using the following primers: zGRK5-Forward 5′-AGCTCTCGAGATGGCAGCGAACTGTGCA-3′ and zGRK5-Reverse 5′-AGCTCCGCGGGGTTAAAATGTCTCCTTACGCGTCT-3′. 5′- and 3′-RACE PCRs were performed (First choice RLM RACE, Ambion) to obtain the full-length coding sequence and 5′-UTR. Full-length cDNA of zGRK5 was cloned into the pCS2+ vector, while zLRP6 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 using the TOPO directional cloning system (Invitrogen) to in vitro-transcribe capped mRNA for rescue experiments. Mutagenesis of full-length clones at the morpholino (MO) binding site was performed using the QuikChange Lightning Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Sequences for zLRP6 (GQ903573) and zGRK5 (GQ903574) have been deposited in GenBankTM. All antisense morpholinos were designed and synthesized by Gene-Tools, LLC (Oregon) based upon submitted sequences. MOs were dissolved in double distilled water to final concentrations of 200–500 μm. Phenol Red was added to the solutions for better visualization during the injection. Approximately 3 nl of diluted MO were injected at the one-cell stage using an Eppendorf Femtojet Microinjector. The sequences of the MOs are as follows: zLRP6 MO1: 5′-GATTGCTGCCATCCATTCCGGCCCT-3′, zLRP6 MO2: 5′-TCTCTATTCTTGGCTCCTCCCCCCA-3′, zLRP6 5 nucleotide mismatch MO (zLRP6 CTRL MO): 5′-TTGAGATGTATAGACTCACTGTTGG-3′, zGRK5 MO1: 5′-TCGCTGCCATTGTTTCGATCTCCAT-3′, zGRK5 MO2: 5′-GCTAAAAATCAGCCAAGAAATGTGC-3′, zGRK5 5 nucleotide mismatch MO (zGRK5 CTRL MO): 5′-TCGGTGCGATTCTTTCCATCTGCAT-3′. For rescue experiments, 10 pg (zLRP6) and 100 pg (zGRK5) of mRNA were injected per egg into the yolk. After microinjection, embryos were photographed using a Leica MZ16 dissection microscope equipped with a 4 megapixel monocamera and the OpenLab software. Measurements were carried out in OpenLab, and statistical analysis was performed in Prism (GraphPad Software). Lysates of 12 ss embryos were used for Western blots. For in situ hybridization, whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed according to standard techniques after PFA fixation at the indicated stages (20.Thisse C. Thisse B. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar). For the detection of zGRK5 and zLRP6, two sets of non-overlapping DIG-labeled antisense RNA in situ probes were used. For analysis of wnt-responsive genes, in situ probes were generated from the following plasmids: An 811-bp fragment was amplified from 24 hpf cDNA using primers (Forward Axin2: 5′-GCCTAAAAGCAAGGAGCAGAT, and Reverse Axin2: 5′-AAACTCATCACTGGCCCTTTT) based on Danio rerio axin2 (NM_131561), and subcloned into pCRII using TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen). The in situ probe for cdx4 was prepared from a plasmid obtained from Zebrafish International Resource Center, clone cb546. To generate an in situ probe for vent a 407-bp fragment of accession number NM_131700 was amplified using a cDNA library of 6 hpf zebrafish embryo mRNA using the following primers: Forward vent 5′-TACCCAGCAAGTTCTCAGTGG, and Reverse vent 5′-AAAAACAGCGGGATAGAGGAA and cloned by TOPO TA cloning. We used the TOPflash (LEF/TCF) luciferase reporter to assess Wnt pathway activity regulated by GRK5 and GRK6. As a positive control, overexpression of either Wnt1 or LRP6 stimulated TOPflash reporter activity in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Transfection of wild-type GRK5, a kinase-dead mutant of GRK5 (GRK5KD, GRK5 K215R mutant), or GRK6 had no effect on enhancing TOPflash luciferase activity (Fig. 1A). However, co-expression of GRK5 or GRK6 with LRP6 greatly stimulated the TOPflash luciferase activity with an average 4-fold increase over that of LRP6 expressed alone, whereas GRK5KD did not enhance LRP6-mediated TOPflash luciferase activity (Fig. 1A). To confirm that LRP6 is specifically involved in GRK5 and GRK6-mediated Wnt signaling, we used Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), an LRP6 antagonist to inhibit LRP6 activity (21.Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 22.Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, DKK1 inhibited the TOPflash luciferase activity stimulated by co-expression of GRK5 or GRK6 with LRP6, as well as the activity of LRP6 alone (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that GRK5 and GRK6 regulate canonical Wnt signaling in a kinase activity-dependent manner that also requires LRP6. To demonstrate LRP6 phosphorylation by GRK5 and GRK6, we purified the His6-tagged LRP6 cytoplasmic tail (LRP6-CT) from E. coli. The purified LRP6-CT was incubated with purified GRK5, GRK6, or GSK3β as control under phosphorylating conditions. As shown in Fig. 2A, GRK5 (lane 2) was a more effective kinase on LRP6-CT than GSK3β (lane 3), and the stoichiometry of LRP6-CT phosphorylation by GRK5 and GSK3β were ∼1.2 and 0.3 phosphate/molecule under identical conditions (kinase/substrate molarity ratio is 1:5), respectively. Both GRK5 and GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation resulted in an additional slower mobility band of LRP6-CT (lanes 2 and 3, Coomassie Blue staining panel). In contrast, phosphorylation of a LRP6-CT mutant protein (LRP6-CT M5), in which all the serine and threonine residues within the five PPPSP motifs were mutated to alanine, was markedly impaired (about 50% decrease) in the presence of GRK5 (compare lanes 2 and 5) or eliminated in the presence of GSK3β (compare lanes 3 and 6). In addition, phosphorylation of LRP6-CT by GSK3β was inhibited by a GSK3β inhibitor TWS119 (23.Ding S. Wu T.Y. Brinker A. Peters E.C. Hur W. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7632-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), which also partially inhibited GRK5 activity in our experiments (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, GRK5 and GSK3β phosphorylate PPPSP motifs of soluble LRP6-CT in a similar manner, but GRK5 appears to be the more effective kinase. The novel observation that the GSK3β inhibitor TWS119 is also inhibitory to GRK5, coupled with our observation of functional similarity between GSK3β and GRK5 to phosphorylate the same PPPSP motifs on LRP6, further highlights the potential for close collaboration of these two kinases in the Wnt pathway. Similar to GRK5, GRK6 was also able to phosphorylate purified LRP6-CT in vitro, and this phosphorylation was reduced to about 50% when the LRP6-CT M5 mutant protein was used as a substrate (data not shown). We conclude that like GSK3β, both GRK5, and GRK6 can phosphorylate LRP6-CT within the PPPSP motifs, but also at other sites. To determine the phosphorylation sites, we applied mass spectrometry to identify the phosphopeptides within the LRP6-CT phosphorylated by GRK5, GRK6, or GSK3β. In three independent mass spectrometry analyses, GRK5 phosphorylated all five PPPSP motifs in LRP6-CT, including the well-studied representative serine 1490 residue in the first PPPSP motif (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition to phosphorylation within the PPPSP motifs, serine 1450 and serine 1509 residues outside of PPPSP motifs were also phosphorylated by GRK5. These results agree with our observation that the LRP6-CT M5 mutant with unphosphorylable PPPSP motifs still can be phosphorylated by GRK5. Similarly, GRK6 phosphorylated three PPPSP motifs, including the first one containing serine 1490, as well as serine 1448 and serine 1509 outside these motifs (Fig. 2, B and C). GSK3β phosphorylated four PPPSP motifs, one of which contains serine 1490, as well as serine 1509 (Fig. 2, B and C). These data show that GRK5 and GRK6 are able to directly phosphorylate soluble LRP6-CT at the PPPSP motifs in vitro, just as GSK3β does. Besides the PPPSP motifs, these data also indicate that serine 1509 is a new common site that can be phosphorylated by these three kinases. To study whether GRK5 and GRK6 phosphorylate LRP6 in cells, GRK5 or GRK6 was co-expressed with LRP6 in HEK293 cells. LRP6 phosphorylation was assessed using a phosphoserine 1490 (pSer-1490) antibody. Expression of GRK5 or GRK6 led to a 4–5-fold increase of serine 1490 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), whereas expression of GRK5KD or GRK2, another member of the GRK family that is structurally and functionally distinct from GRK5 and GRK6 (12.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 13.Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 14.Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Faseb. J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), had little or no effect (Fig. 3A). Increasing the amount of expressed GRK5 in cells led to proportional increases of LRP6 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). These in vitro and in cellulo phosphorylation data identify GRK5 and GRK6 as membrane-associated kinases that can directly and specifically phosphorylate LRP6 at the PPPSP motifs. Next we examined whether the PPPSP motifs are functionally important for GRK5- and GRK6-mediated LRP6 activation. We generated the full-length LRP6 M5 mutant, in which serine/threonine residues in all PPPSP motifs were mutated to alanine. In contrast to the GRK5 and GRK6-stimulated activity of wild-type LRP6, the LRP6 M5 mutant failed to respond to the expression of GRK5 or GRK6 (Fig. 3C) by increased TOPflash reporter activity, indicating that PPPSP motifs are indispensable for GRK5- and GRK6-mediated LRP6 activation. Wnt3A stimulation can lead to LRP6 phosphorylation in the PPPSP motifs (9.Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Next we investigated whether GRK5/6 was necessary for Wnt3A-stimulated LRP6 phosphorylation. To detect such phosphorylation of endogenous LRP6 (24.Wei Q. Yokota C. Semenov M.V. Doble B. Woodgett J. He X. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15903-15911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a GRK6 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line was generated (supplemental Fig. S2A) and used to study whether GRK5 was required for Wnt3A-stimulated endogenous LRP6 phosphorylation. In GRK6 knock-out MEFs, RNA interference (RNAi), including both GRK5 lentiviral shRNA (small hairpin RNA) (supplemental Fig. S2B) and GRK5 siRNA (small interfering RNA) (supplemental Fig. S3A), was employed to specifically knock-down endogenous GRK5 expression. The efficacy of RNAi knock-down was confirmed by Western blots using anti-GRK5 antibodies (supplemental Figs. S2B and S3A). In GRK6-knock-out MEFs infected with control/scramble lentiviral shRNA or transfected with control siRNA, Wnt3A treatment stimulated serine 1490 phosphorylation on endogenous LRP6 (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Knocking down GRK5 with either GRK5 lentiviral shRNA or GRK5 siRNA markedly reduced Wnt3A-stimulated serine 1490 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S3, B and C), indicating that GRK5 plays an important role in regulating Wnt3A-stimulated LRP6 phosphorylation. We turned to a whole animal model, the zebrafish, to assess the physiological relevance of LRP6 phosphorylation by GRK5/6. We cloned the zebrafish homologs of mammalian GRK5 and LRP6 (zGRK5 and zLRP6) and performed in situ hybridization at several developmental stages, finding an overlapping expression pattern of zGRK5 and zLRP6 (supplemental Fig. S4, A–F). During somitogenesis, zGRK5 and zLRP6 are ubiquitously expressed (supplemental Fig. S4, A and D). At later stages, zLRP6 expression is restricted to the diencephalon, the tegmentum and the hindbrain (supplemental Fig. S4, E and F). Although zGRK5 appears to be ubiquitously expressed in the brain at 24 hpf (supplemental Fig. S4B), it could be detected in a more discrete pattern at 48 hpf, partially overlapping the expression of zLRP6 (supplemental Fig. S4C). To test for an involvement of zGRK5 in canonical Wnt signaling, we designed two different translation blocking antisense morpholinos (MO) for zGRK5 and for zLRP6. Injection of either zGRK5 MO into the yolk of one-cell stage embryos specifically down-regulated zGRK5 protein expression, as assessed in Western blots, whereas a 5-nucleotide mismatch MO (zGRK5 CTRL) did not (Fig. 4A). Similarly, injection of either zLRP6 MO diminished protein levels of zLRP6 in 12 ss embryos (Fig. 4B). To assess the effect of zGRK5 on canonical Wnt signaling, we analyzed β-catenin levels in whole embryo lysates at the 12 ss. We detected lowered levels of β-catenin in zGRK5 morphants, whereas in CTRL morphants β-catenin levels were not altered (Fig. 4C). In Fig. 4D, we repeated the same experiment using zebrafish injected with zLRP6 MO as a control and as a model for diminished Wnt signaling. As expected, β-catenin levels were reduced in lysates of embryos injected with the translation blocking zLRP6 MO, but not when injected with a 5-nucleotide mismatch MO (zLRP6 CTRL) (Fig. 4D). In both zGRK5 or zLRP6 MO-injected embryos, the reduction of β-catenin accumulation could be partially reversed by co-injection of capped mRNA bearing silent mutations in the MO binding site (Fig. 4, C and D). In zebrafish, axin2 transcription has been used as readout for Wnt signaling (25.Gerdes J.M. Liu Y. Zaghloul N.A. Leitch C.C. Lawson S.S. Kato M. Beachy P.A. Beales P.L. DeMartino G.N. Fisher S. Badano J.L. Katsanis N. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1350-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 26.Weidinger G. Thorpe C.J. Wuennenberg-Stapleton K. Ngai J. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When we analyzed zebrafish injected with either zGRK5 or zLRP6 MOs, the axin2-positive area in the brain extended significantly less anteriorly in GRK5 MO-injected fish (Fig. 4, F and F′ and supplemental Fig. S4, H and H′) or LRP6 MO-injected fish (Fig. 4, G and G′ and supplemental Fig. S4, L and L′), when compared with uninjected or CTRL MO-injected fish (Fig. 4, E and E′, and supplemental Fig. S4, G, G′, K, and K′). As summarized in Fig. 4H, zGRK5 knock-down (Fig. 4H, bars 3 and 4, compared with bar 2) mimics the phenotype of zLRP6 knock-down (Fig. 4H, bars 8 and 9, compared with bar 7), which translates to a significant reduction in the anterior extension of axin2 expression in the developing brain. Co-injection of low doses of capped mRNA bearing silent mutations for the respective MO binding sites rescued the antisense MO phenotype (Fig. 4H, bars 5 and 10). In accordance with the results obtained in cells, overexpression of zGRK5 by injection of mRNA enhanced Wnt signaling (Fig. 4H, bar 6), although to a lesser extent than zLRP6 mRNA did (Fig. 4H, bar 11) (see also supplemental Fig. S4, G–N′). We also examined the transcription of cdx4 (27.Shimizu T. Bae Y.K. Muraoka O. Hibi M. Dev. Biol. 2005; 279: 125-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28.Davidson A.J. Ernst P. Wang Y.

Development. 2004; 131: 3991-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30.Ramel M.C. Buckles G.R. Baker K.D. Lekven A.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) genes, which have also been used as readouts for Wnt signaling in zebrafish embryos. Similar to the zebrafish embryos injected with LRP6 MO (Fig. 5, E and J), the zebrafish embryos injected with zGRK5 MO show significantly reduced cdx4 (Fig. 5C) and vent (Fig. 5H) transcription as compared to zebrafish embryos not injected (Fig. 5, A and F) or injected with control MOs (Fig. 5, B, G, D, and I). Taken together, these results demonstrate that GRK5 positively regulates LRP6-dependent Wnt signal transduction in zebrafish, assessed both at the post-translational level (measuring β-catenin accumulation) and at the transcriptional level (assessing axin2, cdx4, and vent as Wnt-responsive genes). In this study, we have provided biochemical and physiological evidence to demonstrate that widely expressed GRK5 and GRK6 have an unexpected and important function during Wnt signaling as membrane-bound kinases phosphorylating LRP6. The classical role of GRK5 and GRK6 is to phosphorylate activated GPCRs, initiating β-arrestin binding for receptor desensitization, internalization, and signaling (12.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 13.Premont R.T. Gainetdinov R.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 14.Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Faseb. J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Our findings that GRK5 and GRK6 phosphorylate the single membrane-spanning receptor LRP6 on defined serine/threonine sites (i.e. serine 1490) within proline-rich PPPSP motifs and thereby activate LRP6 are important and interesting in two respects. First, this result extends the range of receptor families, in addition to GPCRs, that can be phosphorylated and regulated by GRK5 and GRK6. Furthermore, instead of having an inhibitory role as in classical G-protein mediated signaling, GRK5 and GRK6 might have a stimulatory role in Wnt/LRP6 signaling. This suggests that GRK5 and GRK6 may have much broader roles than are currently appreciated. Second, our data provide a novel mechanism for LRP6 phosphorylation and regulation at the plasma membrane. Previously, we have shown that β-arrestin2 is recruited to the plasma membrane to bind to Frizzled through Dishevelled and thereby regulates Frizzled function (17.Chen W. ten Berge D. Brown J. Ahn S. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Nusse R. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2003; 301: 1391-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because GRKs and β-arrestins function in concert in regulating GPCRs, it is quite surprising that GRK5/6 and β-arrestin2 participate in regulating Wnt signaling by separate means, delineating their distinct and independent functions. Additional studies will be needed to clarify how Wnt-induced activation of LRP6 leads to GRK5/6 recognition of the receptor as substrate. In addition, the data presented here also solve a paradox within the current model of LRP6 phosphorylation by GSK3β in the cytoplasm. In a cellular system that included an artificially membrane-associated GSK3β mutant, cytosolic GSK3β was proposed to be recruited to the plasma membrane through the adaptor protein axin to phosphorylate LRP6 at the PPPSP motifs (11.Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. Nature. 2005; 438: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, for axin to bind LRP6, the PPPSP motifs must first be phosphorylated, at a time when GSK3β is still in the cytoplasm (10.Zeng X. Huang H. Tamai K. Zhang X. Harada Y. Yokota C. Almeida K. Wang J. Doble B. Woodgett J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hsieh J.C. He X. Development. 2008; 135: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11.Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. Nature. 2005; 438: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Therefore, at least the initiation of both PPPSP phosphorylation and axin translocation to membrane LRP6 would be expected to be GSK3β independent. Our finding that GRK5 and GRK6 function as LRP6 kinases presents a straightforward mechanism for understanding LRP6 phosphorylation and activation, as these kinases are membrane bound already and are therefore available to initiate LRP6 by phosphorylation to promote subsequent axin/GSK3β binding. In addition, it has been recently shown that parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its receptor (PTHR), a GPCR that can be phosphorylated by GRK5 (31.Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), regulates phosphorylation of LRP6 serine 1490 to activate LRP6 in a Wnt-independent fashion (32.Wan M. Yang C. Li J. Wu X. Yuan H. Ma H. He X. Nie S. Chang C. Cao X. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2968-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the kinase responsible for PTH/PTHR-mediated LRP6 phosphorylation is unknown. Our studies might also suggest a role for GRK5 and GRK6 in PTH/PTHR-mediated LRP6 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the actions of GRK5 and GRK6. By phosphorylating LRP6 on PPPSP motifs they contribute to Wnt signaling, a pathway critical for basic biological processes in cells and during embryonic development.

https://openalex.org/W1982190344,"The extreme polarized morphology of neurons poses a challenging problem for intracellular trafficking pathways. The distant synaptic terminals must communicate via axonal transport with the cell soma for neuronal survival, function, and repair. Multiple classes of organelles transported along axons may establish and maintain the polarized morphology of neurons, as well as control signaling and neuronal responses to extracellular cues such as neurotrophic or stress factors. We reported previously that the motor-binding protein Sunday Driver (syd), also known as JIP3 or JSAP1, links vesicular axonal transport to injury signaling. To better understand syd function in axonal transport and in the response of neurons to injury, we developed a purification strategy based on anti-syd antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads to identify syd-associated axonal vesicles. Electron microscopy analyses revealed two classes of syd-associated vesicles of distinct morphology. To identify the molecular anatomy of syd vesicles, we determined their protein composition by mass spectrometry. Gene Ontology analyses of each vesicle protein content revealed their unique identity and indicated that one class of syd vesicles belongs to the endocytic pathway, whereas another may belong to an anterogradely transported vesicle pool. To validate these findings, we examined the transport and localization of components of syd vesicles within axons of mouse sciatic nerve. Together, our results lead us to propose that endocytic syd vesicles function in part to carry injury signals back to the cell body, whereas anterograde syd vesicles may play a role in axonal outgrowth and guidance."

Heparin and heparan sulfate are linear, negatively charged polymers consisting of repeating units of 1→4-linked uronic acid (l-iduronic acid (IdoA) 4The abbreviations used are: IdoAiduronic acidNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidSeMetselenomethionine. and d-glucuronic acid (GlcA)) and glucosamine (1.Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Heparin consists of a high proportion of IdoA (∼90%) and is highly sulfated. It is widely used as an anticoagulant based on its binding to antithrombin, leading to the accelerated inhibition of the blood coagulation cascade (2.Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int.

Heparin interacts with a variety of proteins, such as growth factors and chemokines, suggesting its relevance in various physiological and pathological processes (2.Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew.

Glycosaminoglycans in general, and heparin in particular, can be degraded by two mechanisms: hydrolysis and lytic elimination (4.Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycan hydrolases, present in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, break the glycosidic bond to the nonreducing end of the glucosamine, whereas glycosaminoglycan lyases, found only in prokaryotes, break the glycosidic linkage to the nonreducing end of uronic acid (5.Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The lyases that cleave chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan have been extensively studied, structurally and biochemically. All of these lyases share a common fold, (α/α)5 barrel, and antiparallel β-sheet, and have similar catalytic mechanisms (6.Linhardt R.J. Avci F.Y. Toida T. Kim Y.S. Cygler M. Adv.

In contrast, dermatan sulfate (chondroitin B) lyase has a completely different fold as a parallel β-helix, similar to pectate lyases, and employs very different catalytic machinery (9.Michel G.

The eliminative depolymerization of heparin/heparan sulfate affording unsaturated oligosaccharide products is carried out by three families of enzymes (10.Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol.

Sasisekharan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, heparinase I is specific for heparin cleaving the glycosidic linkage to the nonreducing end of IdoA, heparin lyase III (heparinase III) cleaves the heparan sulfate next to glucuronic acid, and heparin lyase II (heparinase II) can depolymerize both of these substrates (see Fig. 1A). Structural information on the heparin degrading enzymes is limited to the Pedobacter heparinus (formerly Flavobacterium heparinum) heparinase II, which adopts an overall fold similar to chondroitin and hyaluronan lyases (12.Shaya D.

Heparinases recently have been used to identify a contaminant in commercial heparin that caused multiple deaths (13.Guerrini M. Beccati D. Shriver Z. Naggi A. Viswanathan K. Bisio A. Capila I. Lansing J.C. Guglieri S. Fraser B. Al-Hakim A. Gunay N.S. Zhang Z. Robinson L. Buhse L. Nasr M. Woodcock J. Langer R. Venkataraman G. Linhardt R.J. Casu B. Torri G. Sasisekharan R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 669-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is a structural similarity between heparinase I and other lyases and to augment our understanding of substrate specificity, catalytic mechanism, and processivity, we determined the structure of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron heparinase I in a free state (two crystal forms) in a complex with heparin disaccharide product (HE2), tetrasaccharide substrate (HE4′,cleaved by the enzyme), and a H151A-inactive mutant with a dodecasaccharide (HE12) substrate. A genomic DNA was isolated from the B. thetaiotaomicron strain WAL2926 (Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms), and the gene coding for heparinase I was obtained by PCR from genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-AAGGATCCCTGACTGCTCAGACTAAAAATACGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTGAATTCTATTATCTTTCCGAATATC-3′. The amplified PCR products were inserted into two different vectors: the pelB-removed pET22b plasmid (Novagen) treated with the NdeI/XhoI restriction enzyme that resulted in heparinase I with Leu-Glu-His6 at the C terminus and the pET15b (Novagene) derivative that contained an N-terminal His8 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The final plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Single amino acid mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's protocol. In tip deletion (Δ191–213) and thumb deletion (Δ156–221) mutants, the deleted segment was replaced by Gly-Gly-Ser tripeptide. For the activity assay, all of the mutants and deletion mutants were prepared using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagene) as centrifugation method. The recombinant heparinase I and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, and protein expression was induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.6, and the incubation temperature was decreased from 37 °C (used for bacterial growth prior to induction) to 20 °C. After overnight growth, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,700 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled heparinase I was expressed in methionine auxotroph DL41(DE3) and B834(DE3) cells (Novagen) grown at 20 °C overnight. Two different heparinase I constructs (see above) were purified in different ways. Frozen cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, and 20 mm imidazole) and disrupted by intermittent sonication on ice water. The lysate was separated from debris by centrifugation at 32,500 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was applied onto 3 ml of Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 20 ml of lysis buffer and washed two times with 10 column volumes buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol); heparinase I was eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole, and dialyzed against buffer A. The His tag was cleaved by overnight incubation with tobacco etch virus protease at an ambient temperature (protein:tobacco etch virus molar ratio of 200:1) and removed by passing the protein trough a 1-ml Ni-NTA column. Recovered protein was loaded onto an HR 10/10 Mono S cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed twice (50 mm and 125 mm NaCl, 2 column volumes), and a 125–250 mm linear NaCl gradient was applied. Heparinase I eluted at ∼0.17 m NaCl. Heparinase I-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated, using a Centricon YM-100 (Millipore Corp.), to 17 mg/ml. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) and lysed by sonication. The soluble crude extract was applied to a HisTrap (GE Healthcare) column, which was pre-equilibrated with buffer A and washed with 12 column volumes of buffer A. Heparinase I was eluted with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole). The eluant was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore) and loaded on a Superdex 75 16/60 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 5.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing heparinase I were collected and concentrated to 22 mg/ml in 20 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 5.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol using an Amicon Ultra-4 filter unit (Millipore). SeMet-labeled heparinase I was purified as described above for the wild type heparinase I. Orthorhombic heparinase I crystals were obtained from the Qiagen Classics II suite using a sitting drop setup. Heparinase I, at 17 mg/ml, was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution. Crystals appeared over reservoir containing 0.1 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v). Optimization using the hanging drop method led to the best crystals obtained from reservoir solution containing 22.5% PEG 3350, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.8 mm CaCl2. The crystals were cryoprotected using ethylene glycol at final concentration of 21% (v/v) and flash cooled in nitrogen stream at 100 K. For native heparinase I data extending to 1.3 Å resolution were recorded at a wavelength of 0.9800 Å using a MAR CCD 300-mm area detector at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team beamline, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. SeMet crystals were grown under the same conditions and were isomorphous to the native crystals. The SeMet-labeled crystals diffracted to 1.4 Å at the selenium absorption peak (λ = 0.9793 Å), and the data were recorded in the same manner as the native data. To obtain enzyme-substrate/product complex, the crystals were soaked for 5–10 min in a solution containing 21% ethylene glycol (v/v) and 5 mm heparin tetrasaccharide (2-sulfo-IdoA-β(1→4)-2,6-disulfo-GlcN)2. Diffraction data extending to 1.3 Å resolution were recorded as described above. Different crystallization conditions led to a monoclinic crystal form of heparinase I. Initial crystals were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C, with heparinase I concentrated to 22 mg/ml with 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and 2.0 m ammonium sulfate as mother liquor. These crystals were reproduced by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method and used for data collection. The crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution containing 20% glycerol and were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. SeMet-labeled heparinase I crystals were obtained under the same conditions. To obtain ligand complex structure, 10 mm disaccharide heparin (HE2) and 6 mm dodecasaccharide heparin (HE12) were incubated with the native heparinase I and heparinase I-H151A mutant, respectively. The HE2 complex crystals were obtained in 22% glycerol, 20% PEG 1500, and 10 mm sarcosine. HE12 complex crystals were obtained in 10% glycerol, 8% PEG 1500, and 10 mm sarcosine. X-ray diffraction data of native and ligand complex crystals were collected using the ADSC Quantum210 CCD detector at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory beamline 4A (Pohang, Korea). SeMet-labeled heparinase I multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method diffraction data sets were collected using a Bruker AXS Proteum300 CCD detector at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory beamline 6B (Pohang, Korea). All data sets were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (14.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), with the data collection statistics summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsa Values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell. a Values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell. The structure of heparinase I of orthorhombic was solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion method (15.Rice L.M. Earnest T.N. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) against the single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set, and the final model was refined against the native data set extending to a higher resolution. A strong peak in the electron density was interpreted as a Ca2+ ion based on the ligand geometry and reasonable B-factors. Refinement at 1.3 Å resolution for native heparinase I, and 1.5 Å resolution for heparin-soaked heparinase I converged with an R-factor/R-free of 0.185/0.208 and 0.174/0.206, respectively, with one monomer in the asymmetric unit consisting of residues 3–376 and one bound Ca2+. The native model also contained four molecules of ethylene glycol and 405 water molecules (Table 1). The heparinase I heparin soak model contained five molecules of ethylene glycol and 328 water molecules. Residue 326 is disordered in the native structure, and residues 324–329 are disordered in the above-mentioned data sets, hence they were not modeled. The structure of the monoclinic form of heparinase I was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using the programs Solve (20.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The refinement of two structures of the heparinase I-ligand complex such as HE2 and HE12 were performed using REFMAC5 (19.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

All final models were validated by PROCHECK (23.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thronton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Heparinase activities were determined by measuring the formation of the C4–C5 double bond at the nonreducing end of heparin products indicated by the absorption at 232 nm. The reaction was performed with 2 μg of heparinase I and various lengths of heparins (from tetramer to dodecamer, and low molecular weight heparin with an average molecular weight of 5,700 as 20-mer) as substrate in a concentration range of 50–150 μm in 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. Activity of the wild type and all the described mutants were compared under the same condition. Kinetic constants of wild type heparinase I and tip deletion mutant (Δ191–213) were measured for heparin 20-mer, hexamer, and octamer. The kinetic parameters were derived from initial velocities obtained at six to seven different concentrations (10–45 μm) for wild type and five to seven concentrations (70–350 μm) for tip deletion mutant (Δ191–213) of low molecular weight heparin, hexamer, and octamer. The kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, and kcat) were calculated based on the Lineweaver-Burk equation (10.Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Yang V.C. Linhardt R.J. Bernstein H. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1849-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the binding affinities of heparinase I-H151A (full-length) and deletion mutants, Δ156–221 (thumb deletion) and Δ191–213-H151A (tip deletion), we performed calorimetric titrations using a VP-isothermal titration calorimeter (VP-ITC) (MicroCal) at 15 °C and processed the data with MicroCal Origin 7.0 software. The proteins and heparin oligosaccharides were individually buffer-exchanged into an identical lots of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) using dialysis overnight. Then, proteins and heparin oligosaccharides were degassed for 15 min. For titration, heparin substrates were added to the enzyme and its mutants in 30 consecutive aliquoted injections until the proteins were saturated with ligand. The three-dimensional structures (apo, HE12, HE4′, and HE2 complexes) of heparinase I were determined at 1.4 ∼ 2.0 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (Table 1). Heparinase I is composed of a β-jellyroll domain made of two concave β-sheets (eight antiparallel β-strands each) that have a glucanase fold (SCOP database; Ref. 25.Andreeva A. Howorth D. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D226-D229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the thumb-like insertion domain (thumb domain, residues 156–221) extending from one side of the β-jellyroll (Fig. 1B). A smaller extension forms an Ω loop (residues 92–118) with an embedded α-helix. The thumb domain has an unusual shape with a base formed by five short antiparallel β-strands flanked by an α-helix and extended to the side by a triangular arrangement of two long and one short strands (Fig. 1C). This domain represents a new fold not observed previously. The same shape and orientation of the thumb domain is seen in two crystal forms with very different packing, indicating that despite the appearance of flexibility, this domain is relatively rigid. The inner sheet of the β-jellyroll is strongly curved, forming a long extended canyon that traverses the β-strands. This canyon is highly positively charged and provides a binding site for heparin. Moreover, the thumb domain is also positively charged, predominantly on the side facing the canyon, and appears to facilitate binding of a negatively charged heparin (Fig. 2A). The canyon is partially covered by a “lid” formed by two loops, Gly74-Glu79 and Thr250-Asn257 from the β-jellyroll domain and Lys184-Val187 from the thumb domain (Fig. 2B). The structural integrity of heparinase I is aided by a Ca2+ ion bound in the hinge region between the β-jellyroll domain and the thumb domain and coordinated by side chains from several loops. The equatorial ligands of the pentagonal bipyramid are Oϵ1 (2.8 Å) and Oϵ2 (2.6 Å) of Glu222, Oδ2 (2.3 Å) of Asp346, and the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Trp248 (2.4 Å) and Asn345 (2.5 Å). The axis ligands of the bipyramid are Oδ1 of Asp155 (2.8 Å) and a water molecule (2.6 Å) (Fig. 1D). To visualize the dynamics of heparinase I during catalytic cycle, we have captured the enzyme at various stages of the reaction. The heparinase I(H151A)-HE12 complex shows how an extended heparin substrate binds to the enzyme within the positively charged canyon (Fig. 2A). The second complex shows a tetrasaccharide substrate just after cleavage of the glycosidic linkage. Finally, the third complex shows one of the products bound to the enzyme at the negative “−” subsites (26.Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Eight sugar units of the dodecasaccharide substrate could be fitted well in electron density map, and the electron density was especially well defined for the hexasaccharide occupying subsites −2 to +4 (with cleavage taking place between the −1 and +1 sugar) (Fig. 2B) (26.Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The substrate binding involves many direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the sulfate groups and the basic side chains within the canyon. The free hydroxyl groups of sugars in subsites +2, +1, and −1 are also hydrogen-bonded to the enzyme. The acidic groups at subsites +3, +1, and −2 are involved in hydrogen bonds to the side chains. Of these, the carboxylic group at +1 sugar is the most tightly bound, forming two H-bonds to the side chain of Gln149 and a third to the side chain of Arg83. No stacking between the aromatic residues and the sugar rings is observed, which is rather unusual for the carbohydrate binding sites. Instead, Tyr226 is wedged perpendicularly against the hydrophobic surface of the −1 sugar ring. The β-sheet of the thumb domain participates in substrate binding in the positive “+” subsites through Lys185 and Gln223. To fit into the enzyme's binding site, the long polysaccharide has to adjust its conformation. First, the chain makes a tight 90° bend centered at GlcNAc in the +2 subsite (Fig. 3A). This bending is necessary to accommodate an extended chain and allow the +3 and +4 sugars to emerge on the protein surface. The second feature is the higher energy twist conformation assumed by the sugar ring in the −2 subsite (28.Money V.A. Smith N.L. Scaffidi A. Stick R.V. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2006; 45: 5136-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This conformation allows the −3 sugar to emerge to the protein surface at the other end of the canyon (see below), as is illustrated by the surface representation of heparinase I (Fig. 2A). Several oligosaccharide degrading enzymes acting either by hydrolytic (e.g. lysozyme) or lyase (e.g. chondroitinase AC and chondroitinase B) mechanisms are known to force the substrate to bind with the key sugar ring in an energetically less favorable non-chair conformation. It is thought that imposing strain on the bound substrate lowers the energy barrier of the transition state (29.Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 262: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30.Strynadka N.C. James M.N. EXS. 1996; 75: 185-222PubMed Google Scholar). Heparinase I also utilizes this mechanism but for a different reason. When the enzyme binds a long polysaccharide chain in the middle (endolytic cleavage), it forces a non-chair conformation on a sugar ring in the −2 subsite that allows the remainder of the chain on the nonreducing end to reach the surface (Fig. 3A). Upon binding of the long HE12 polysaccharide, the lid-forming loops move slightly toward the substrate, and the thumb domain rotates forward by 11° around the hinge located near Asp155 (Fig. 4), together creating a tighter fit as compared with other complexes. The movement of the thumb is much smaller for shorter substrates, indicating a role of the thumb domain in binding long polysaccharides. Moreover, the lid loop Glu73-Thr80 covering the − subsites, which is partially disordered in the apo structure of the orthorhombic form, becomes well ordered in the structures of heparinase I-oligosaccharide complexes (also ordered in the apo heparinase I in the monoclinic form), suggesting that its mobility plays an important role in substrate binding and product release. The structure of a cleaved tetrasaccharide bound to heparinase I shows that the breaking of the glycosidic linkage does not require significant movement of the substrate in subsites +2, +1, and −1. The sugar ring in the +1 subsite (unsaturated uronic acid, ΔUA) is now unsaturated, containing a C4–C5 double bond, and, consequently, the ring assumes a half-chair conformation (Fig. 1A). The distance between the C4 of ΔUA in the +1 subsite and the new O1 of GlcNAc in the −1 subsite increases from the bond length of 1.4 Å to a distance of 2.8 Å, resulting in only a small movement of these sugars with the preservation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, unlike in the bound dodecasaccharide, the sugar in the −2 subsite is in the energetically favorable chair conformation, and the sulfate group occupies a different side niche of the binding site as compared with the same sugar in a dodecasaccharide (Fig. 3, A and B). The conformation observed in the tetrasaccharide, while energetically favored, is not compatible with a longer polysaccharide because the next sugar unit attached to the ring in this conformation would collide with the sides of the canyon. This example clearly shows that the conclusions reached from investigating shorter oligosaccharide substrates may not be fully transferable to a longer polysaccharide due to the “end effects.” Moreover, the electron density for the product in + subsites is significantly weaker than for the − subsites, suggesting substantially lower occupancy of this site (see below). This observation would be in agreement with the model where, after breaking the bond, the product on the reducing end of the polysaccharide and occupying the + subsites leaves first. The structure of heparinase I with the product captured in the monoclinic crystal form shows two bound disaccharides (Fig. 3B). The first binds in the −1 and −2 subsites overlapping very well on the corresponding sugars in the other complexes. The second disaccharide is bound in the general area of +2 and +3 subsites, but in the reverse direction to that of the substrate, does not overlap well with the dodecasaccharide and represent fortuitous binding to an open site. This is another indirect indication that the binding to the − subsites is stronger, with the product occupying the + subsites leaving first. To determine whether the enzyme has a preference for the length of the polysaccharide substrate, we performed enzymatic assays and kinetic analysis of heparinase I with various length of heparin polysaccharides. The enzyme requires a minimum of six sugar units for efficient catalysis and has an overall preference for longer polysaccharides (data not shown). The kinetic data show that the kcat/Km for the 20-mer substrate is ∼4.5 times higher than that of the hexasaccharide. The longer polysaccharide shows lower kcat, but this is compensated by a 12-fold lower Km (Table 2). The effect on binding was confirmed by isothermal calorimetry, which showed that the Kd of heparinase I(H151A) for heparin 20-mer is also ∼12-fold lower than for the hexasaccharide (Fig. 5, B and C). Interestingly, for both the wild type and tip deletion mutant (Δ191–213), the kcat for the hexameric substrate is ∼3-fold higher than that of the 20-mer substrate. We rationalize that this is related to a slightly better positioning of the sugars of the hexasaccharide in the active site due to smaller steric effects (see above). The action pattern of heparinase I on a long polymeric substrate investigated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy shows an endolytic pattern with a processive bias (data not shown).TABLE 2Kinetic constants of wild type heparinase I and tip deletion mutant (Δ191–213) measured with heparin 20-mer, hexamer, and octamer.

https://openalex.org/W2157995751,"The giant synapses of Held play an important role in high-fidelity auditory processing and provide a model system for synaptic transmission at central synapses. Whether transmission of action potentials can fail at these synapses has been investigated in recent studies. At the endbulbs of Held in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) a consistent picture emerged, whereas at the calyx of Held in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) results on the reliability of transmission remain inconsistent. In vivo this discrepancy could be due to the difficulty in identifying failures of transmission.We introduce a novel method for detecting unreliable transmission in vivo. Based on the temporal relationship between a cells' waveform and other potentials in the recordings, a statistical test is developed that provides a balanced decision between the presence and the absence of failures. Its performance is quantified using simulated voltage recordings and found to exhibit a high level of accuracy. The method was applied to extracellular recordings from the synapses of Held in vivo. At the calyces of Held failures of transmission were found only rarely. By contrast, at the endbulbs of Held in the AVCN failures were found under spontaneous, excited, and suppressed conditions. In accordance with previous studies, failures occurred most abundantly in the suppressed condition, suggesting a role for inhibition.Under the investigated activity conditions/anesthesia, transmission seems to remain largely unimpeded in the MNTB, whereas in the AVCN the occurrence of failures is related to inhibition and could be the basis/result of computational mechanisms for temporal processing. More generally, our approach provides a formal tool for studying the reliability of transmission with high statistical accuracy under typical in vivo recording conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2073583408,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA metabolism are considered to be important for modulating gene expression in trypanosomes, because these protozoan parasites mainly rely on post-transcriptional mechanisms to regulate protein levels. Previously, we have identified TcUBP1, a single RNA recognition motif (RRM)-type RBP from Trypanosoma cruzi. TcUBP1 is a cytoplasmic protein with roles in stabilization/degradation of mRNAs and in the protection of transcripts through their recruitment into cytoplasmic granules. We now show that TcUBP1, and the closely related protein TcUBP2, can be found in small amounts in the nucleus under normal conditions, and are able to accumulate in the nucleus under arsenite stress. The kinetics of nuclear accumulation, and export to the cytoplasm, are consistent with the shuttling of TcUBP1 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The sequence required for TcUBP1 nuclear accumulation was narrowed to the RRM, and point mutations affecting RNA binding abolished nuclear import. This RRM was also shown to be efficiently exported from the nucleus in unstressed parasites, a property that relied on the binding to RNA. TcUBP1 nuclear accumulation was dependent on active transcription, and colocalized with transcripts in the nucleus, suggesting nuclear binding of the mRNA. We propose that TcUBP1 could be linking the mRNA metabolism at both sides of the nuclear pore complex, using the RRM as a nuclear localization signal, and being exported as a cargo on mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2020926770,"Background Natural product structures have high chemical diversity and are attractive as lead structures for discovery of new drugs. One of the disease areas where natural products are most frequently used as therapeutics is oncology. Method and Findings A library of natural products (NCI Natural Product set) was screened for compounds that induce apoptosis of HCT116 colon carcinoma cells using an assay that measures an endogenous caspase-cleavage product. One of the apoptosis-inducing compounds identified in the screen was thaspine (taspine), an alkaloid from the South American tree Croton lechleri. The cortex of this tree is used for medicinal purposes by tribes in the Amazonas basin. Thaspine was found to induce conformational activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in HCT116 cells. Analysis of the gene expression signature of thaspine-treated cells suggested that thaspine is a topoisomerase inhibitor. Inhibition of both topoisomerase I and II was observed using in vitro assays, and thaspine was found to have a reduced cytotoxic effect on a cell line with a mutated topoisomerase II enzyme. Interestingly, in contrast to the topoisomerase II inhibitors doxorubicin, etoposide and mitoxantrone, thaspine was cytotoxic to cell lines overexpressing the PgP or MRP drug efflux transporters. We finally show that thaspine induces wide-spread apoptosis in colon carcinoma multicellular spheroids and that apoptosis is induced in two xenograft mouse models in vivo. Conclusions The alkaloid thaspine from the cortex of Croton lechleri is a dual topoisomerase inhibitor effective in cells overexpressing drug efflux transporters and induces wide-spread apoptosis in multicellular spheroids."
https://openalex.org/W2003013189,"Mutations in protein kinases can drive cancer through alterations of the kinase activity or by uncoupling kinase activity from regulation. Changes to protein expression in Aurora A, a mitotic Ser/Thr kinase, are associated with the development of several human cancers, but the effects of somatic cancer-associated mutations have not been determined. In this study we show that Aurora A kinase activity is altered in different ways in three somatic cancer-associated mutations located within the catalytic domain; Aurora A(V174M) shows constitutively increased kinase activity, Aurora A(S155R) activity is decreased primarily due to misregulation, and Aurora A(S361*) activity is ablated due to loss of structural integrity. These alterations suggest vastly different mechanisms for the role of these three mutations in human cancer. We have further characterized the Aurora A(S155R) mutant protein, found that its reduced cellular activity and mislocalization are due to loss of interaction with TPX2, and deciphered the structural basis of the disruption at 2.5 Å resolution. Previous studies have shown that disruption of the Aurora A/TPX2 interaction results in defective spindles that generate chromosomal abnormalities. In a panel of 40 samples from microsatellite instability-positive colon cancer patients, we found one example in which the tumor contained only Aurora A(S155R), whereas the normal tissue contained only wild-type Aurora A. We propose that the S155R mutation is an example of a somatic mutation associated with this tumor type, albeit at modest frequency, that could promote aneuploidy through the loss of regulated interactions between Aurora A and its protein partners.

In this study, the crystal structure of C-terminally truncated BMRF1 (BMRF1-ΔC) was solved in an oligomeric state. The molecular structure of BMRF1-ΔC shares structural similarity with other processivity factors, such as herpes simplex virus UL42, cytomegalovirus UL44, and human proliferating cell nuclear antigen. However, the oligomerization architectures of these proteins range from a monomer to a trimer. PAGE and mutational analyses indicated that BMRF1-ΔC, like UL44, forms a C-shaped head-to-head dimer. DNA binding assays suggested that basic amino acid residues on the concave surface of the C-shaped dimer play an important role in interactions with DNA. The C95E mutant, which disrupts dimer formation, lacked DNA binding activity, indicating that dimer formation is required for DNA binding. These characteristics are similar to those of another dimeric viral processivity factor, UL44. Although the R87E and H141F mutants of BMRF1-ΔC exhibited dramatically reduced polymerase processivity, they were still able to bind DNA and to dimerize. These amino acid residues are located near the dimer interface, suggesting that BMRF1-ΔC associates with the catalytic subunit BALF5 around the dimer interface. Consequently, the monomeric form of BMRF1-ΔC probably binds to BALF5, because the steric consequences would prevent the maintenance of the dimeric form.

https://openalex.org/W1996245481,"The lectin chaperone calnexin (Cnx) is important for quality control of glycoproteins, and the chances of correct folding of a protein increase the longer the protein interacts with Cnx. Mutations in glycoproteins increase their association with Cnx, and these mutant proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, until now, the increased interaction with Cnx was not known to increase the folding of mutant glycoproteins. Because many human diseases result from glycoprotein misfolding, a Cnx-assisted folding of mutant glycoproteins could be beneficial. Mutations of rhodopsin, the glycoprotein pigment of rod photoreceptors, cause misfolding resulting in retinitis pigmentosa. Despite the critical role of Cnx in glycoprotein folding, surprisingly little is known about its interaction with rhodopsin or whether this interaction could be modulated to increase the folding of mutant rhodopsin. Here, we demonstrate that Cnx preferentially associates with misfolded mutant opsins associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Furthermore, the overexpression of Cnx leads to an increased accumulation of misfolded P23H opsin but not the correctly folded protein. Finally, we demonstrate that increased levels of Cnx in the presence of the pharmacological chaperone 11-cis-retinal increase the folding efficiency and result in an increase in correct folding of mutant rhodopsin. These results demonstrate that misfolded rather than correctly folded rhodopsin is a substrate for Cnx and that the interaction between Cnx and mutant, misfolded rhodopsin, can be targeted to increase the yield of folded mutant protein."
https://openalex.org/W2126703121,"Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive disease with dismal prognosis; peculiar is the tumor microenvironment characterized by an extensive fibrotic stroma, which favors rapid tumor progression. We previously reported that pancreatic cancer patients have a selective Th2 skew in the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) CD4(+) T cell immunity, which correlates with the presence of a predominant GATA-3(+) tumor lymphoid infiltrate. This has negative effects in both effective anti-tumor immunity and further favoring fibrinogenesis. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Th2 polarization of CEA-specific CD4(+) T cells from pancreatic cancer patients is stable or can be reverted by immunomodulating cytokines.We first evaluated the influence of IL-12 and IL-27, as single agents and in association, on the polarization of CEA-specific Th2 CD4(+) T cell clones from a pancreatic cancer patient. We found that only the combination of IL-12 and IL-27 modified the polarization of Th2 effectors by both reduction of IL-5, GM-CSF and IL-13 and induction of IFN-gamma production, which lasted after cytokine removal. Second, we evaluated the effect of the combined treatment on polyclonal CEA-specific CD4(+) T cells in short-time re-stimulation assays. In agreement with the data obtained with the clones, we found that the combined treatment functionally modulated the Th2 polarization of CEA-specific CD4(+) T cells and enhanced pre-existing Th1 type immunity.Collectively, our results demonstrate that tumor antigen specific Th2 CD4(+) T cells in pancreatic cancer are endowed with functional plasticity. Hence, loco-regional cytokines delivery or targeted therapy based on antibodies or molecules directed to the tumor stroma might improve anti-tumor immunity and ameliorate fibrosis, without systemic toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2127588580,"Current inotropic therapies used to increase cardiac contractility of the failing heart center on increasing the amount of calcium available for contraction, but their long-term use is associated with increased mortality due to fatal arrhythmias. Thus, there is a need to develop and explore novel inotropic therapies that can act via calcium-independent mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to determine whether fast alpha-myosin molecular motor gene transfer can confer calcium-independent positive inotropy in slow beta-myosin-dominant rabbit and human failing ventricular myocytes. To this end, we generated a recombinant adenovirus (AdMYH6) to deliver the full-length human alpha-myosin gene to adult rabbit and human cardiac myocytes in vitro. Fast alpha-myosin motor expression was determined by Western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis and confocal imaging. In experiments using electrically stimulated myocytes from ischemic failing hearts, AdMYH6 increased the contractile amplitude of failing human [23.9+/-7.8 nm (n=10) vs. AdMYH6 amplitude 78.4+/-16.5 nm (n=6)] and rabbit myocytes. The intracellular calcium transient amplitude was not altered. Control experiments included the use of a green fluorescent protein or a beta-myosin heavy chain adenovirus. Our data provide evidence for a novel form of calcium-independent positive inotropy in failing cardiac myocytes by fast alpha-myosin motor protein gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2008760775,"Background Comparative DNA sequence analysis provides insight into evolution and helps construct a natural classification reflecting the Tree of Life. The growing numbers of organisms represented in DNA databases challenge tree-building techniques and the vertical hierarchical classification may obscure relationships among some groups. Approaches that can incorporate sequence data from large numbers of taxa and enable visualization of affinities across groups are desirable. Methodology/Principal Findings Toward this end, we developed a procedure for extracting diagnostic patterns in the form of indicator vectors from DNA sequences of taxonomic groups. In the present instance the indicator vectors were derived from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences of those groups and further analyzed on this basis. In the first example, indicator vectors for birds, fish, and butterflies were constructed from a training set of COI sequences, then correlations with test sequences not used to construct the indicator vector were determined. In all cases, correlation with the indicator vector correctly assigned test sequences to their proper group. In the second example, this approach was explored at the species level within the bird grouping; this also gave correct assignment, suggesting the possibility of automated procedures for classification at various taxonomic levels. A false-color matrix of vector correlations displayed affinities among species consistent with higher-order taxonomy. Conclusions/Significance The indicator vectors preserved DNA character information and provided quantitative measures of correlations among taxonomic groups. This method is scalable to the largest datasets envisioned in this field, provides a visually-intuitive display that captures relational affinities derived from sequence data across a diversity of life forms, and is potentially a useful complement to current tree-building techniques for studying evolutionary processes based on DNA sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W2116647883,"Context In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), some drugs, including CB1 antagonists for obesity treatment, have been shown to cause increased suicidal ideation. A key question is whether drugs that increase or are associated with increased suicidal ideations are also associated with suicidal behavior, or whether drug–induced suicidal ideations are unlinked epiphenomena that do not presage the more troubling and potentially irrevocable outcome of suicidal behavior. This is difficult to determine in RCTs because of the rarity of suicidal attempts and completions. Objective To determine whether drugs associated with more suicidal ideations are also associated with more suicide attempts in large spontaneous adverse event (AE) report databases. Methodology Generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event (AE) Reporting System (AERS) data from 2004 to 2008. A total of 1,404,470 AEs from 832 drugs were analyzed as a function of reports of suicidal ideations; other non-suicidal adverse reactions; drug class; proportion of reports from males; and average age of subject for which AE was filed. Drug was treated as the unit of analysis, thus the statistical models effectively had 832 observations. Main Outcome Measures Reported suicide attempts and completed suicides per drug. Results 832 drugs, ranging from abacavir to zopiclone, were evaluated. The 832 drugs, as primary suspect drugs in a given adverse event, accounted for over 99.9% of recorded AERS. Suicidal ideations had a significant positive association with suicide attempts (p<.0001) and had an approximately 131-fold stronger magnitude of association than non-suicidal AERs, after adjusting for drug class, gender, and age. Conclusions In AE reports, drugs that are associated with increased suicidal ideations are also associated with increased suicidal attempts or completions. This association suggests that drug-induced suicidal ideations observed in RCTs plausibly represent harbingers that presage the more serious suicide attempts and completions and should be a cause for concern."

The ligand-binding site is situated between the two domains. The interactions of these binding surfaces are contributed largely by amino acid side chains located in the loops connecting the alternating β-strands and α-helices of each domain. PBPs undergo a hinge-bending motion upon addition of ligand, allowing the two interfaces, which are solvent-exposed in the absence of ligand, to completely envelop the ligand in the closed form, thus mimicking the desolvated environment of a protein core (8.Björkman A.J.

The x-ray crystal structure of one of these, the β-1,4-mannobiose-binding protein (Protein Data Bank code 1VR5), was recently solved in the open conformation in the absence of its cognate ligand (structure determined and deposited by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (28.Blow N. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) but otherwise undocumented). As expected, based on amino acid similarity, the overall structure of 1VR5 is similar to known OpBPs. In the absence of a ligand, the mode of ligand binding in this protein remains unknown. These observations raise the question of how the OpBP fold has adapted to recognize sugars and what, if any, specificity is encoded. To answer these questions, we undertook structural studies of tm0031, which was shown previously to bind the β-linked disaccharides cellobiose and laminaribiose (25.Nanavati D.M. Thirangoon K. Noll K.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 1336-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In additional ligand-binding studies, we established that this cellobiose-binding protein (tmCBP) binds not only disaccharides but also oligosaccharides up to five sugar monomers in length. X-ray crystallographic structural analysis revealed that only the first two sugar rings are recognized specifically though hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with the protein. Additional rings are placed into a large solvent-filled cavity in the interior of the binding pocket, where there is little specific recognition of the ligand polar and non-polar groups, in a manner similar to the recognition of peptides in the OpBP fold (19.Sleigh S.H. Seavers P.R. Wilkinson A.J. Ladbury J.E. Tame J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 393-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Comparison of superimposed apo-1VR5 with ligand-bound tmCBP suggests that the former possesses similar adaptations to bind its cognate ligand(s). Consequently, we postulate that this binding pocket imposes limited specificity between oligosaccharides other than through specific recognition of the first two sugar rings and the sterics of the cavity that imposes length constraints. This mode of sugar binding has not been observed in other carbohydrate-binding PBPs and represents a novel mechanism of carbohydrate recognition in this protein superfamily. The tmCBP plasmid was a gift from the laboratory of K. Noll. Protein was expressed and purified as described (25.Nanavati D.M. Thirangoon K. Noll K.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 1336-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CD measurements were carried out on a JASCO CD spectrophotometer. Thermal denaturations were determined by measuring the CD signal at 222 nm (1-cm path length) as a function of temperature using 1.0 μm protein (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 150 mm NaCl). In the absence of the chemical denaturant guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), tmCBP is too stable to exhibit temperature-induced denaturation. To determine the apparent thermal transition midpoint (Tm(app)) in the absence of GdmCl, a series of thermal melts in the presence of decreasing amounts of GdmCl was used to extrapolate to 0 m GdmCl (16.Cuneo M.J. Changela A. Beese L.S. Hellinga H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein samples were incubated for 15 min prior to collecting data. Each measurement included a 3-s averaging time for data collection and a 60-s equilibration period at each temperature. Data were fit to a two-state model to determine the Tm(app) values (29.Schellman J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Crystals of tmCBP were grown in the presence of 1 mm ligand. The cellopentaose complex was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion in drops containing 2 μl of the protein solution mixed with 2 μl of 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.3–6.5), 18–24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.2 m magnesium acetate. The cellobiose complex was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion in drops containing 2 μl of the protein solution mixed with 2 μl of 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000. Diffraction-quality crystals typically grew within 1 week at 17 °C. Crystals grown in the presence of cellohexaose resulted in a cellopentaose complex (data not shown) due to the low purity of the oligosaccharides (∼95% pure) and the presence of contaminating cellopentaose. The crystals of the cellobiose and cellopentaose complexes diffract to 1.50 Å resolution and belong to the P41212 space group (a/b = 107.3 and c = 118.2 Å) and the P21 space group (a = 62.1, b = 101.5, and c = 108.3 Å; β = 94.1°), respectively (see Table 1). Crystals were transferred stepwise to the precipitant solution containing 10% ethylene glycol for cryoprotection, mounted in a nylon loop, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at 100 K at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team 22-ID beam line at the Advanced Photon Source. Diffraction data were scaled and integrated using XDS (30.Kabsch W.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the cellobiose complex was determined to a resolution of 1.50 Å by molecular replacement using the N- and C-terminal domains of the β-1,4-mannobiose-binding protein (Protein Data Bank code 1VR5) separately as search models in the program PHASER (31.Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19758) Google Scholar); the individual domains rather than the entire molecule were used to allow for changes in the interdomain hinge-bending angles. One protein molecule bound with cellobiose in the binding pocket was found in the asymmetric unit and was refined to Rcryst and Rfree values of 19.2 and 21.6%, respectively (see Table 1). The final model for the cellobiose complex includes two intact monomers, two cellobiose molecules, and 500 water molecules. The structure of the cellopentaose complex was determined to a resolution of 1.5 Å by molecular replacement using the cellobiose-bound form as a search model in the program PHASER (31.Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19758) Google Scholar). Two molecules bound with cellopentaose in the binding pocket were found in the asymmetric unit and were refined to Rcryst and Rfree values of 20.4 and 22.5%, respectively (see Table 1). The final model for the cellopentaose complex includes two intact monomers, two cellopentaose molecules, and 887 water molecules. The cellobiose and cellopentaose complexes are in nearly identical conformations, with a root mean square deviation of 0.21 Å for alignment of all atoms in both crystal forms (excluding water molecules and ligand). Manual model building was carried out in the programs O and COOT and refined using REFMAC5 (32.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The Protein Data Bank coordinates and structure factors of the cellobiose and cellopentaose complexes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under codes 2O7I and 3I5O, respectively. The stability of tmCBP was determined by thermal denaturation using CD. In the absence of the chemical denaturant GdmCl, no significant change in the CD signal (up to 100 °C) could be observed as a function of temperature (data not shown), and all subsequent measurements were carried out in the presence of GdmCl (Fig. 1). Melting curves were found to fit a two-state model (29.Schellman J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 37.Cohen D.S. Pielak G.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); a Tm(app) of 108 °C in the absence of GdmCl was determined by linear extrapolation of a series of melting point determinations carried out at different concentrations of GdmCl (Fig. 1) (15.Cuneo M.J. Changela A. Warren J.J. Beese L.S. Hellinga H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ligand-mediated shifts in Tm(app) values in the presence of 2 m GdmCl were used to assess the binding of various cellulose hydrolysates ranging from two-sugar rings (cellobiose) to six-sugar rings (cellohexaose). Protein stability increased nonlinearly with oligosaccharide length (Fig. 1), clearly delineating a minimal recognition unit and a maximal length where no more contribution is made to protein stability. The disaccharide cellobiose bound relatively weakly, as evidenced by a small shift in Tm(app) and a change in cooperativity; a significant increase was observed with the trisaccharide cellotriose; beyond five sugar units, there was no significant increase in stability. These results indicate that the first three sugar rings make the greatest contribution to the free energy of ligand binding, although the binding pocket binds five optimally but not necessarily maximally. The protein was co-crystallized with cellobiose and cellopentaose. In these two complexes, the tmCBP structure adopts the closed conformation and has the α/β-fold that is characteristic of OpBPs and shares the highest structural homology with Salmonella typhimurium OpBP (Protein Data Bank code 1JEV; Cα root mean square deviation of 2.8 Å) (38.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar, 39.Tame J.R. Sleigh S.H. Wilkinson A.J. Ladbury J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) even though the amino acid sequence similarity between them is low (18% identity). Alignment of the individual domains of the 1VR5 search model revealed Cα root mean square deviations of 1.3 and 1.1 Å for the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. Like S. typhimurium OpBP, tmCBP is a three-domain protein with the carbohydrate-binding site located in a deep groove at the domain interface (Fig. 2). The topology of β-strands in domains I and III belongs to the group II PBP subfamily. The cellopentaose complex defines a ligand-binding site that spans the entire interface formed by domains I–III (Fig. 2). The minimal cellobiose-binding site is found at one extreme of this groove, at the interface between domains I and III (Fig. 2). As is observed in other highly specific carbohydrate-binding PBPs, the two sugar rings are bound by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds that largely satisfy the dual potential of the hydroxyls (i.e. both the proton donor and the oxygen acceptor). A total of 19 hydrogen bonds are made with the cellobiose. Of these, 15 hydrogen bonds are formed by a network of polar interactions with protein side chain, main chain, and specifically bound water molecules mediating recognition of the hydroxyls in the two sugars (Fig. 3). Two polar amino acids (Asn216 and Asp383) contribute 4 of the 10 hydrogen bonds, three are made by the protein main chain (Ala14 oxygen, Gly13 oxygen, and Phe234 nitrogen), and three are made with aromatic binding pocket residues through either polar or aromatic hydrogen bonds. The remaining hydrogen-bonding potential is satisfied by water molecules (Fig. 3). The oxygen from the hemiacetal of the second sugar ring (ring B) forms a hydrogen bond with two water molecules, one of which also interacts with the protein; the hemiacetal oxygen from the first ring (ring A) forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the C3 hydroxyl of the second ring (ring B) (Fig. 3). Three additional tryptophan residues (Trp381, Trp384, and Trp536) form extensive van der Waals contacts with both rings of the cellobiose. Adjacent to this minimal disaccharide-binding site is a large cavity that is shielded from bulk solvent but completely filled with well defined water molecules (Figs. 3 and 4). This region lacks the aromatic and polar amino acids lining the disaccharide-binding site. In the cellopentaose-bound form, the extra three rings are placed into this cavity (Figs. 3 and 4). However, unlike the cellobiose-bound form, there is little specific recognition of the sugar rings (Fig. 3). These additional rings have the potential to form a total of 26 hydrogen bonds through their hydroxyls and hemiacetal oxygens, but only four hydrogen bonds are made with the protein. One is formed with the C6 hydroxyl of the third ring (ring C) and the carboxylate of Asp262; three other hydrogen bonds are formed by the main chain of three glycine residues (Gly101, Gly103, and Gly104), at the tip of the cavity (the cap), with the hydroxyls of the fifth ring (ring E). Ordered water molecules satisfy the remaining hydrogen-bonding potential of the three sugar rings (Fig. 3). 80 water molecules fill the cavity of the cellobiose complex, of which 66 form a primary solvation shell that directly contacts the protein or carbohydrate polar groups (Fig. 4). An additional 13 form a secondary solvation shell that is bound only by water molecules in the primary solvation shell. The remaining one ordered water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to the secondary shell (tertiary solvation shell). 75 water molecules are retained in the cavity of the cellopentaose complex, of which 67 are in the primary solvation shell and eight in secondary solvation shell (Fig. 4). No ordered tertiary shell water molecules are found in the cellopentaose complex, with the single tertiary shell water molecule being displaced by the extra rings of the carbohydrate. Many of the water molecules in the primary solvation shell form an approximately tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding network, thereby constructing an ice-like structure within the cavity (Fig. 4). The secondary solvation shell forms between one to four hydrogen bonds, with the remaining hydrogen-bonding potential being satisfied by interactions with bulk water. The positions of the ordered water molecules change little upon ligand binding. Binding of the pentasaccharide displaces 1 of the 13 water molecules in the secondary shell and the single tertiary shell water molecule. Only five primary shell water molecules are displaced upon cellopentaose binding. In several cases, the hydroxyls of the incoming sugar fully replace the hydrogen-bonding geometry of the lost water molecule. Superposition of the individual domains of the 1VR5 search model suggests that the β-1,4-mannobiose ligand binds in a similar manner as the tmCBP ligand (Fig. 5) because of similarities in the surfaces that line the ligand-binding pockets. Glucose and mannose, which compose the monomers of the oligosaccharides bound by 1VR5 and tmCBP, differ in their hydroxyl at C2. The 12 amino acids and the backbone conformation in the region of the binding pocket that recognizes the first sugar rings (the “hook”) are highly conserved between the two proteins (Fig. 5). The seven amino acids involved in hydrogen bonding with the ligand are conserved in all but one position, which in tmCBP recognizes the C3 and C4 hydroxyls of the ligand. The remaining five amino acids differ in only two positions: Leu233, which forms van der Waals interactions with the O3 hydroxyl, is replaced with phenylalanine in 1VR5, and Gly232, which forms van der Waals interactions with the O2 hydroxyl, is replaced with asparagine in 1VR5. The latter change is accompanied by a backbone movement in 1VR5, which prevents a steric clash that would occur with the axial C2 hydroxyl of mannose. The remainder of the ligand-binding cavity, which in tmCBP is relatively nonspecific, differs significantly between the aligned structures: the loops and helices contain substitutions and insertions/deletions, and the backbone is found in different conformations (Fig. 5). No definitive conclusions can be drawn about 1VR5 in the absence of a cognate ligand, but it appears that this region also forms a cavity that is larger than the molecular envelope of an individual oligosaccharide chain, suggesting semi-specific recognition. We have demonstrated that the T. maritima tm0031 open reading frame encodes a periplasmic polymeric carbohydrate-binding protein that binds β(1→4)-linked glucose molecules that range in size from two to five sugar rings. The mode of oligosaccharide recognition is unusual in that this binding protein is specific for only part of the ligand, whereas other sugar-binding proteins in the PBP superfamily typically are exquisitely specific. Instead, tmCBP selects a molecular class rather than a single species. Based on comparison with the apo structure of the β-1,4-mannobiose-binding protein, it appears that its ligands may bind in a similar manner, although the boundaries of the cavity, which determine sugar length and branch selectivity, are not well defined in the absence of a cognate ligand. Oligosaccharides are selected by specific recognition of the disaccharide at the nonreducing end (the hook), whereas the rest of the oligosaccharide with mixed linkages is placed into a solvent-filled cavity. The reducing end of cellopentaose forms a few specific hydrogen bonds. This “capping” interaction might impose an upper limit on the length of an oligosaccharide that is recognized by tmCBP and subsequently transported across the membrane. The nonselective cavity is filled with a remarkable arrangement of ordered water molecules, divided into a semipermanent layer that forms a tetrahedral ice-like hydrogen-bonding network and a more loosely bonded layer that is partially displaced by the bound oligosaccharide. It is therefore possible that different branches and linkages can be accommodated within the steric limitation of the cavity, enabling pre-concentration of a wider array of plant-based (40.Buliga G.S. Brant D.A. Fincher G.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 157: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), marine algae-based (41.Alderkamp A.C. van Rijssel M. Bolhuis H. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2007; 59: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and fungus-based (42.Kondoh O. Tachibana Y. Ohya Y. Arisawa M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7734-7741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) β-carbohydrates. For instance, the pentameric β(1→4)-sugar does not occupy the entire volume of the cavity, occupying only a fraction of one region; other linkages of oligosaccharides can be positioned in the remaining cavity space (Fig. 6). T. maritima possesses an extensive saccharolytic metabolic system based on extracellular cellulases that hydrolyze polysaccharides to shorter chains, which are then transported across the membrane for phosphorylation and further cleavage (22.Conners S.B. Mongodin E.F. Johnson M.R. Montero C.I. Nelson K.E. Kelly R.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 872-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this scheme, tmCBP acts as a molecular sieve, with the hook selecting only a subset of β-oligosaccharides and the “cap” imposing a size limit oligosaccharides that can be transported and function as a substrate for the intracellular β-glucose hydrolases. Such semi-specific recognition systems present an efficient solution for the processing of complex mixtures down to common metabolic feedstocks. We thank G.

The objective of this dose/adjuvant-finding study was to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate based on a peptide spanning the C-terminal region of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCS102) in malaria naive adults.Thirty-six healthy malaria-naive adults were randomly distributed into three dose blocks (10, 30 and 100 microg) and vaccinated with PfCS102 in combination with either Montanide ISA 720 or GSK proprietary Adjuvant System AS02A at days 0, 60, and 180. Primary end-point (safety and reactogenicity) was based on the frequency of adverse events (AE) and of abnormal biological safety tests; secondary-end point (immunogenicity) on P. falciparum specific cell-mediated immunity and antibody response before and after immunization. The two adjuvant formulations were well tolerated and their safety profile was good. Most AEs were local and, when systemic, involved mainly fatigue and headache. Half the volunteers in AS02A groups experienced severe AEs (mainly erythema). After the third injection, 34 of 35 volunteers developed anti-PfCS102 and anti-sporozoite antibodies, and 28 of 35 demonstrated T-cell proliferative responses and IFN-gamma production. Five of 22 HLA-A2 and HLA-A3 volunteers displayed PfCS102 specific IFN-gamma secreting CD8(+) T cell responses. Responses were only marginally boosted after the 3(rd) vaccination and remained stable for 6 months. For both adjuvants, the dose of 10 microg was less immunogenic in comparison to 30 and 100 microg that induced similar responses. AS02A formulations with 30 microg or 100 microg PfCS102 induced about 10-folds higher antibody and IFN-gamma responses than Montanide formulations.PfCS102 peptide was safe and highly immunogenic, allowing the design of more advanced trials to test its potential for protection. Two or three immunizations with a dose of 30 microg formulated with AS02A appeared the most appropriate choice for such studies.Swissmedic.ch 2002 DR 1227."
https://openalex.org/W2154430272,"The class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K (III)) regulates intracellular vesicular transport at multiple steps through the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P). While the localization of proteins at distinct membrane domains are likely regulated in different ways, the roles of PI3K (III) and its effectors have not been extensively investigated in a polarized cell during tissue development. In this study, we examined in vivo functions of PI3K (III) and its effector candidate Rabenosyn-5 (Rbsn-5) in Drosophila wing primordial cells, which are polarized along the apical-basal axis. Knockdown of the PI3K (III) subunit Vps15 resulted in an accumulation of the apical junctional proteins DE-cadherin and Flamingo and also the basal membrane protein β-integrin in intracellular vesicles. By contrast, knockdown of PI3K (III) increased lateral membrane-localized Fasciclin III (Fas III). Importantly, loss-of-function mutation of Rbsn-5 recapitulated the aberrant localization phenotypes of β-integrin and Fas III, but not those of DE-cadherin and Flamingo. These results suggest that PI3K (III) differentially regulates localization of proteins at distinct membrane domains and that Rbsn-5 mediates only a part of the PI3K (III)-dependent processes."

We produced the germ line A18b light chain and characterized its hydrolytic, nucleophilic, and tertiary structural activities. This light chain was purified to >99% purity and found to hydrolyze aminomethylcoumarin-peptide and larger protein substrates and bind a fluorophosphonate probe.

The paradigm of FGF involvement in such diverse biological functions results from the tight regulation of the FGF/FGFR signaling system at various levels. The expression of the 22 vertebrate FGF genes and the four tyrosine kinase FGFR genes is spatially and temporally regulated throughout development. Additional tissue specificity is generated by alternative splicing of the FGF receptor genes. For example, splicing of the third immunoglobulin domain (D3) to B and C isoforms is tissue-dependent and determines a degree of the ligand binding specificity. Some of the FGF ligands, such as FGF1, are promiscuous and bind to all FGFRs, whereas other ligands bind only specific FGFR isoforms and/or splice variants (5.Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S.

Some of the activating mutations of human FGF receptors 1–3 abolish asparagine residues in consensus N-glycosylation sites and result in a diverse group of skeletal disorders. These mutations include asparagine 330 to isoleucine (N330I) in FGFR1 (15.White K.E. Cabral J.M. Davis S.I. Fishburn T. Evans W.E. Ichikawa S. Fields J. Yu X. Shaw N.J. McLellan N.J. McKeown C.

Studies using soluble and membrane-bound recombinant receptors produced in mammalian cells corresponding to the extracellular ligand binding domain of FGFR1 IIIc have demonstrated extensive and highly heterogeneous N-glycosylation of FGFR (18.Duchesne L.

Furthermore, N-glycosylation of FGFR1 IIIc regulates the association of FGF2 and heparin to the receptor by decreasing the association rate of the respective binding reactions, suggesting that N-glycosylation of the receptor may negatively regulate signaling through FGFR (18.Duchesne L. Tissot B. Rudd T.R. Dell A. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27178-27189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications, thought to occur in more than 50% of all proteins in eukaryotes (19.Apweiler R. Hermjakob H. Sharon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Although a large number of membrane proteins, including growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (20.Soderquist A.M. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12586-12594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ion channels, are heavily glycosylated, the role of the glycans for the regulation of the protein function is still poorly understood. N-Glycans and sialic acid modulate the gating of Shaker potassium channels (21.Johnson D. Bennett E.S. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation of BMP6 (bone morphogenetic protein 6) ligand, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is suggested to provide receptor specificity and a recognition site for the activin receptor type I (22.Saremba S. Nickel J. Seher A. Kotzsch A. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Changes to N-glycan processing by expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5), which promotes poly N-acetyllactosamine substitution, modifies mouse mammary cell responses to growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, FGF, and transforming growth factor-β and the endocytosis of their receptors (23.Partridge E.A.

A large number of human congenital disorders of glycosylation caused by deficiency in N-glycosylation have been identified (for a review see Ref. 24.Freeze H.H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The congenital disorders of glycosylation result from mutations in enzymes involved in N-glycan synthesis and processing and are likely to be caused by changes in a large repertoire of N-glycan-modified proteins. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome contains a single homologue of vertebrate FGFR, egl-15 (for egg laying-defective), and two homologues of FGF ligands, egl-17 and let-756 (for lethal; see Refs. 25.Burdine R.D.

EGL-15/FGFR has two isoforms, EGL-15 (5A) and EGL-15 (5B), as a result of alternative splicing of the fifth exon (28.Goodman S.J. Branda C.S. Robinson M.K. Burdine R.D. Stern M.J. Development. 2003; 130: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EGL-15 (5B) and LET-756 have essential function in C. elegans, and null mutations in the corresponding genes cause larval lethality. Null mutations in egl-15 (5A) and egl-17, however, lead to very specific cell migration and axon maintenance defects (25.Burdine R.D. Chen E.B. Kwok S.F. Stern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2433-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29.Bülow H.E. Boulin T. Hobert O. Neuron. 2004; 42: 367-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling cascades activated by EGL-15 are relatively well characterized and share a high degree of conservation with mammalian FGFR (reviewed in Refs. 30.Birnbaum D. Popovici C. Roubin R. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31.Borland C.Z. Schutzman J.L. Stern M.J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32.Polanska U.M. Fernig D.G. Kinnunen T. Dev. Dyn. 2009; 238: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hypoactive mutations in egl-15 lead to various degrees of phenotypic effects from scrawny to egg laying-defective, whereas hyperactive mutants of egl-15 accumulate fluid in the body cavity and appear clear (Clr). Mutations in a phosphatase clr-1 also lead to the Clr phenotype and are suppressed by hypoactive mutations in egl-15 (33.Kokel M. Borland C.Z. DeLong L. Horvitz H.R. Stern M.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1425-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Clr phenotype is caused by excess FGFR signaling. The characteristic phenotypes of hypo- and hyperactive egl-15 mutations provide an excellent model in which to assess the role of N-glycosylation for FGFR regulation in vivo. Three of the consensus N-glycosylation sites of immunoglobulin domain 3 (D3) are conserved between human FGFRs and C. elegans EGL-15. Mutations in two of these conserved sites lead to skeletal disorders in humans. We have introduced alanine substitutions to the consensus N-glycosylation sites in the EGL-15 D3 as a single mutation or combinations of mutations. The mutant egl-15 DNA constructs have been introduced into egl-15 (lf) C. elegans and analyzed for the ability of the EGL-15 Asn → Ala mutants to rescue larval lethality. The results show that removal of specific N-glycosylation sites leads to phenotypes associated with FGF receptor overactivation. Furthermore, EGL-15/FGFR is N-glycosylated in vivo. Taken together, these results demonstrate that N-glycosylation regulates the activity of FGFR/EGL-15 in vivo, therefore providing a further regulatory layer to this ligand-receptor system. C. elegans strains were maintained at 20 °C essentially as described (34.Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. Wild type strain used in this study is N2 var. Bristol. The following previously described mutations were used: LGIV, daf-18 (ok480), soc-2 (n1774); LGV, akt-1 (mg144); LGX, egl-15 (n1456). All egl-15 constructs were derived from the plasmid NH112 (a gift from M. Stern), which contains a full-length wild type genomic hybrid (egl-15(5A+B+)) of egl-15 DNA capable of rescuing egl-15 (lf) lethality (26.DeVore D.L. Horvitz H.R. Stern M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Asparagine to alanine mutations were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 1-kb RsrII/BamHI fragment of NH112, which encodes for seven consensus N-glycosylation sites, was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Primer sequences for each construct can be obtained upon request. After mutagenesis, the 1-kb RsrII/BamHI fragment was cloned into the original NH112 vector to replace the wild type RsrII/BamHI fragment. All DNA constructs generated by PCR were confirmed by sequencing. Transgenic arrays were generated using standard germ line transformation techniques (35.Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). All mutant DNA constructs were injected to heterozygous egl-15 (n1456; lf)/+ hermaphrodites at 2.5 ng/μl with either Pmyo-3::gfp, Pttx-3::rfp, or Psur-5::gfp at 50 ng/μl as injection markers and pBluescript. Wild type egl-15 construct (NH112) was injected at concentrations from 0.5 to 25 ng/μl as indicated in the figures and the text. All transgenic constructs were analyzed as extrachromosomal arrays. At least three independent transgenic lines were analyzed for each DNA construct. Egg laying was measured essentially as described (36.Kinnunen T. Huang Z. Townsend J. Gatdula M.M. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Turnbull J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, single hermaphrodites were placed on nematode growth medium agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 as a food source in the presence or absence of 7.5 mm serotonin (5HT; Sigma). The number of eggs laid was counted after 1 h. Significance of results was tested using z test. C. elegans were ground in liquid nitrogen, and the frozen worm powder was solubilized in a buffer containing 1% Igepal (Nonidet P-40; Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl. 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent proteolysis. Protein lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. In some experiments, the supernatants were applied to heparin-agarose beads (Sigma). Heparin-agarose was washed with 20-bead volumes of the binding buffer, followed by low salt washing with the solubilization buffer containing 0.20 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted either in a single step using 1.5 m NaCl or in a gradient of 0.20–1.5 m NaCl in the solubilization buffer. The eluted proteins were treated with N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) or endoglycosidase H (Roche Diagnostics) for 2 h. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, MA). Proteins were detected in Western blot using polyclonal anti-EGL-15 antibody Crackle (a gift from M. Stern) and anti-actin C4 (MP Biomedicals) and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) and ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). Vulval muscles were visualized using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) as described previously (37.Sasson I.E. Stern M.J. Development. 2004; 131: 5381-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For whole mount immunostaining, worms were fixed using a protocol modified from Finney-Ruvkun (38.Finney M. Ruvkun G. Cell. 1990; 63: 895-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-EGL-15 antibody, Pop (a gift from M. Stern), was used at a 1:10 dilution, as described previously (37.Sasson I.E. Stern M.J. Development. 2004; 131: 5381-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), followed by fluorescently conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 1:100. Fluorescent and differential interference contrast images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope equipped with ×10, ×20, ×40, and ×63 optics. Images were captured using Axiovision and further cropped and scaled using Adobe Photoshop CS3. ClustalW alignment of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like D3 of C. elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae, Drosophila melanogaster Breathless (Btl), and human FGFRs shows that three of the four putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)) in the human FGFRs are conserved across the species (Fig. 1A). The only exception is C. briggsae, where one of the conserved asparagines (Asn-464) does not constitute a consensus N-glycosylation site, as it is followed by histidine rather than serine/threonine. C. elegans has a consensus N-glycosylation site (Asn- 449; depicted as N5 in Fig. 1A) in the proximity of the fourth conserved consensus site of human FGFRs (317 in human FGFR1) and a site, designated N4, in proximity to the conserved N3 site. However, because sequence changes more rapidly than structure, it was important to identify if these putative N-glycosylation sites were conserved between worms and mammals at the level of their spatial position in the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. Molecular modeling of the EGL-15 D2 and D3 shows that the three asparagines that are conserved across species, Asn-401, Asn-433, and Asn-474, are at the surface of the protein (supplemental Fig. S1) and occupy a similar spatial position to the orthologous sites in human FGFRs (18.Duchesne L.

Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Asparagine 449 of EGL-15 occupies a similar spatial position to asparagine 317 of human FGFR1, suggesting conserved functions for these residues, although they do not align in the two-dimensional sequence comparison. In the spatial comparison, asparagine 407 of EGL-15, which does not have an obvious orthologue in the human FGFRs, is in close proximity to asparagine 474. Mutations in two of the three sites conserved between human and C. elegans FGFRs have been associated with human skeletal syndromes. These include Asn-262 of human FGFR3 associated with hypochondroplasia (41.Heuertz S. Le Merrer M. Zabel B. Wright M. Legeai-Mallet L. Cormier-Daire V. Gibbs L. Bonaventure J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 14: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is orthologous to Asn-401 in the C. elegans EGL-15 and Asn-330 of human FGFR1 associated with osteoglophonic dysplasia (15.White K.E. Cabral J.M. Davis S.I. Fishburn T. Evans W.E. Ichikawa S. Fields J. Yu X. Shaw N.J. McLellan N.J. McKeown C. Fitzpatrick D. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Econs M.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 361-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), which is orthologous to Asn-474 in C. elegans EGL-15. Mutations in orthologous sites (Asn-331) of human FGFR2 and of FGFR3 (Asn-328; see Ref. 17.Winterpacht A. Hilbert K. Stelzer C. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Segerer H. Spranger J. Zabel B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) lead to Crouzon syndrome and hypochondroplasia, respectively. The C. elegans EGL-15 has three additional consensus N-glycosylation sites in D3, all of which are conserved in the C. briggsae EGL-15 (Fig. 1A). EGL-15 was purified from protein extracts of mixed stage wild type C. elegans. Polyclonal anti-EGL-15 antibody (Crackle) detects EGL-15 from mixed stage C. elegans as four different polypeptides migrating in SDS-PAGE with molecular masses of ∼105, 95, 85, and 75 kDa (Fig. 2A). Two of the separate polypeptides are likely to represent the different isoforms of EGL15, 5A and 5B (42.Lo T.W. Branda C.S. Huang P. Sasson I.E. Goodman S.J. Stern M.J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 318: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is well established that vertebrate FGF receptors form ternary complexes with the FGF ligands and with heparan sulfate, a tissue form of heparin. EGL-15/FGFR could be enriched from C. elegans protein lysates using heparin affinity matrix (Fig. 2B), indicating that EGL-15 binds to heparin/heparan sulfate in vitro. Intriguingly, heparin affinity enriched predominantly the 105-kDa EGL-15 from wild type C. elegans, although a faint band of the 95-kDa polypeptide could also be detected. The enrichment of receptor proteins that bound more strongly to heparin allowed their subsequent digestion with PNGaseF and endoglycosidase H. Following digestion, the 105-kDa EGL-15 from wild type C. elegans migrates faster upon SDS-PAGE, indicating that at least this endogenous EGL-15 isoform is N-glycosylated in vivo (Fig. 2B). Given that in mammals N-glycosylation appears to negatively regulate FGFR function (18.Duchesne L. Tissot B. Rudd T.R. Dell A. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27178-27189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and that the worm possesses a single gene encoding for FGFRs, this allowed a detailed structure-function profile to be established for the six potential glycosylation sites in D3 individually and in combination. Different levels of EGL-15/FGFR signaling lead to a spectrum of visible phenotypes (43.Huang P. Stern M.J. Development. 2004; 131: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The role of N-glycosylation in EGL-15 signaling was assessed by making site-specific asparagine to alanine substitutions to the potential N-glycosylation sites of D3 (Fig. 1B). To examine the combinatorial potential of these sites, a single Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) site, two or more putative N-glycosylation sites, or all seven potential N-glycosylation sites were changed. Where two consensus N-glycosylation sites are in close proximity, genetic removal of one of the asparagines may lead to the other asparagine being substituted with N-glycans, even if it would not normally contain sugar modifications. This could either restore the original function or alter the function of the mutant EGL-15 protein. Hence, where two consensus N-glycosylation sites reside in close proximity, the sites were abolished individually and in combination (Fig. 1B). The wild type and mutant egl-15 (Asn → Ala) DNA constructs were introduced into an egl-15 (n1456) background. The n1456 allele is a loss-of-function (lf) mutation, and the parental strain was maintained as heterozygous. Transgenic expression of wild type egl-15 rescued larval lethality of the egl-15 (lf) almost completely (83% of all laid eggs survived through larval stages; n >1000) but did not fully rescue the egg laying phenotype (Egl). Phenotypes observed for single or multiple EGL-15 Asn → Ala mutants are summarized in Table 1. Substituting asparagine 433 of EGL-15 with alanine (EGL-15 N433A) led to subtle phenotypes, most notably the Egl phenotype (Fig. 3C; Table 1). Asparagine 433 is conserved in human FGFRs, and based on molecular modeling, it occupies a similar spatial position to the human counterpart. Mutations in the orthologous sites of the human FGFRs have not been associated with human disorders to date. EGL-15 N474A mutation led to more severe phenotypes, and most notably these mutants displayed the Clr phenotype (Fig. 3D; Table 1), which is characteristic of EGL-15 overactivation (33.Kokel M. Borland C.Z. DeLong L. Horvitz H.R. Stern M.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1425-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The N474A is the only single mutant that showed the Clr phenotype. EGL-15 N474A mutants were also Egl and had uncoordinated movement. The EGL-15 N407A mutation did not lead to severe phenotypes, although these animals were slightly dumpy (Dpy; Table 1). Asn-407 does not have an orthologous site in the human FGFRs, but it is in close sequence proximity to Asn-401, which is orthologous to Asn-262 in human FGFR3. Asn-407 is also in close spatial proximity to Asn-474 (supplemental Fig. S1). Despite several independent attempts, we failed to obtain a transgenic strain with the egl-15 N401A mutant DNA construct. The fact that several independent attempts failed suggests that the nature of the N401A mutation leads to the inability of the mutant EGL-15 to rescue the larval lethality of the egl-15 (lf) background. Using the same conditions, we have successfully obtained at least three independent transgenic lines for 12 of the other egl-15 Asn → Ala mutant DNA constructs. Single amino acid substitutions of Asn-440, Asn-449, and Asn-497 led to weak phenotypes; most notably the animals were weak Egl (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of phenotypes observed for EGL-15 Asn → Ala mutantsConstructPhenotypeEglClrDpyUncPvlWT [egl-15 (+)]+−−−−N401ANANANANANAN407A+−++−N433A+−−−−N440A+−−−−N449A+−−−−N474A++−++N497A+−−−−N401A,N407A+−−+−N440A,N449A+−−+−N401A,N407A,N433A++−+/−−N401A,N407A,N433A,N440A++−−−N401A,N407A,N433A,N440A,N449A+++−−−N401A,N407A,N433A,N440A,N449A,N474A+++++−−−N401A,N407A,N433A,N440A,N449A,N474A,N497A++++−−− Open table in a new tab The observed phenotypes are likely to be associated with the specific mutation in EGL-15 rather than too much EGL-15 protein, as introducing the wild type copy of egl-15 DNA at the same DNA concentration does not lead to a clear phenotype, but although it rescues larval lethality, it also leads to the animals being Egl. EGL-15 protein levels were also very similar in wild type and transgenic C. elegans expressing either wild type or mutant egl-15 DNA constructs (Fig. 2A). We also tested the wild type egl-15 DNA at higher DNA concentrations, and although high DNA concentrations lead to increased embryonic lethality (not shown) presumably caused by overexpression of EGL-15 protein, we could not detect any Clr phenotype, suggesting multiple levels of regulation of EGL-15 signaling over and above that dictated by expression of the protein. Multiple asparagine to alanine mutations lead to a marked increase of the Clr phenotype characteristic of excessive EGL-15 signaling (Fig. 3; Table 1). EGL-15 N401A,N407A, N433A triple mutant displayed intermediate penetrance of the Clr phenotype, and the severity of this phenotype increased as more mutations were introduced. Almost 90% of EGL-15 N401A,N407A,N433A,N440A,N449A,N474A mutants were Clr (Fig. 4). The clear phenotype was suppressed to 30% by inactivating mutation in soc-2 (soc = suppressor of clear; Fig. 4), a homologue of a mammalian leucine-rich repeat protein and a component of FGFR downstream signaling (44.Selfors L.M. Schutzman J.L. Borland C.Z. Stern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6903-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that asparagine substitutions of consensus N-glycosylation sites lead to overactivation of EGL"
https://openalex.org/W1977433489,"As an oral bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus mutans has been known as the aetiologic agent of human dental caries. Among a total of 1960 identified proteins within the genome of this organism, there are about 500 without any known functions. One of these proteins, SMU.440, has very few homologs in the current protein databases and it does not fall into any protein functional families. Phylogenetic studies showed that SMU.440 is related to a particular ecological niche and conserved specifically in some oral pathogens, due to lateral gene transfer. The co-occurrence of a MarR protein within the same operon among these oral pathogens suggests that SMU.440 may be associated with antibiotic resistance. The structure determination of SMU.440 revealed that it shares the same fold and a similar pocket as polyketide cyclases, which indicated that it is very likely to bind some polyketide-like molecules. From the interlinking structural and bioinformatics studies, we have concluded that SMU.440 could be involved in polyketide-like antibiotic resistance, providing a better understanding of this hypothetical protein. Besides, the combination of multiple methods in this study can be used as a general approach for functional studies of a protein with unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W2033768970,"Recent clinical evidence suggests important role of lipid and amino acid metabolism in early pre-autoimmune stages of type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. We study the molecular paths associated with the incidence of insulitis and type 1 diabetes in the Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mouse model using available gene expression data from the pancreatic tissue from young pre-diabetic mice. We apply a graph-theoretic approach by using a modified color coding algorithm to detect optimal molecular paths associated with specific phenotypes in an integrated biological network encompassing heterogeneous interaction data types. In agreement with our recent clinical findings, we identified a path downregulated in early insulitis involving dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT), a key regulator of ether phospholipid synthesis. The pathway involving serine/threonine-protein phosphatase (PP2A), an upstream regulator of lipid metabolism and insulin secretion, was found upregulated in early insulitis. Our findings provide further evidence for an important role of lipid metabolism in early stages of type 1 diabetes pathogenesis, as well as suggest that such dysregulation of lipids and related increased oxidative stress can be tracked to beta cells."

In murine models ICSBP deficiency results in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) with increased mature neutrophils. Over time this MPD progresses to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that ICSBP deficiency is adequate for MPD, but additional genetic lesions are required for AML. The hypothesis of these studies is that dysregulation of key target genes predisposes to disease progression under conditions of decreased ICSBP expression. To investigate this hypothesis, we used chromatin co-immunoprecipitation to identify genes involved the ICSBP-leukemia suppressor effect. In the current studies, we identify the gene encoding Fanconi F (FANCF) as an ICSBP target gene. FancF participates in a repair of cross-linked DNA. We identify a FANCF promoter cis element, which is activated by ICSBP in differentiating myeloid cells. We also determine that DNA cross-link repair is impaired in ICSBP-deficient myeloid cells in a FancF-dependent manner. This effect is observed in differentiating cells, suggesting that ICSBP protects against the genotoxic stress of myelopoiesis. Decreased ICSBP expression is found in human AML and chronic myeloid leukemia during blast crisis (CML-BC). Our studies suggest that ICSBP deficiency may be functionally important for accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities during disease progression in these myeloid malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W2009593650,"MecA is an adaptor protein that regulates the assembly and activity of the ATP-dependent ClpCP protease in Bacillus subtilis. MecA contains two domains. Although the amino-terminal domain of MecA recruits substrate proteins such as ComK and ComS, the carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 121–218) has dual roles in the regulation and function of ClpCP protease.

Proteolysis regulated by the AAA+ superfamily is important to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is an important regulatory mechanism to biological processes such as stress responses or protein quality control under non-stress conditions (1.Prepiak P. Dubnau D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In prokaryotic cells, ClpP and its associated adaptor ATPases form distinct proteolytic complexes with an architecture that is similar to the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome. The closely related ATPases include ClpA, ClpB, ClpC, ClpE, ClpL, ClpV, ClpX, and HslU (ClpY) (2.Zolkiewski M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The active, hexameric ATPases unfold and translocate the substrate proteins to the proteolytic chamber within the double ring of ClpP heptamers for degradation (3.Sauer R.T. Bolon D.N. Burton B.M.

Among these ATPases, ClpC is particularly intriguing because it requires an adaptor protein to stimulate its ATPase activity and to facilitate its oligomerization and activation. In Bacillus subtilis, MecA or its paralogue YpbH is required for assembly of the active protease complex ClpCP and recruitment of substrate proteins such as ComK and ComS (4.Schlothauer T. Mogk A.

MecA contains two domains, the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain, which are connected by a flexible linker sequence. The N-terminal domain of MecA is essential for substrate recognition, whereas the C-terminal domain was reported to mediate the interaction with ClpC and to stimulate the ATPase activity of ClpC (9.Kirstein J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 34366-34375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we identified MecA-(121–218) to be a structure entity that plays dual roles. On one hand, MecA-(121–218) is the minimal domain that by itself is sufficient to induce ClpC oligomerization, to stimulate the ATPase activity of ClpC, and to facilitate the assembly and activation of the ClpCP complex. On the other hand, we demonstrated that MecA-(121–218) is a non-recycling degradation tag that targets heterologous fusion proteins for degradation by the ClpCP protease. As indicated by the term non-recycling, MecA-(121–218) is also degraded together with the substrate fusion protein. The association and degradation of MecA-(121–218) result in dynamic cycles of assembly and disassembly of the ClpCP complex. We also showed that the C-terminal domain of YpbH (residues 101–194), which share a sequence identity of 31% and sequence similarity of 63% with MecA-(121–218), functions similarly as MecA-(121–218), both for assembly of the ClpCP protease and as a non-recycling degradation tag. The biochemical observations raised the following questions. First, how does the structure of MecA-(121–218) support its function? Second, given the moderate sequence identity and similarity between MecA-(121–218) and YpbH-(101–194), do they have a similar structure? Third and more importantly, does the prokaryotic degradation tag, MecA-(121–218), exhibit any structural similarity to the eukaryotic degradation tag ubiquitin? To address these questions, we crystallized and determined the structures of MecA-(121–218) and YpbH-(101–194) at 2.2 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively. The two structures share essentially the same fold, a previously uncharacterized α/β fold. We also performed structure-guided mutagenesis for MecA and identified surface residues that may mediate ClpC binding and ComK degradation. The structural study, together with the biochemical observations reported in the accompanying article (23.Mei Z. Wang F. Qi Y. Zhou Z. Hu Q. Li H. Wu J. Shi Y. J. Biol.

All clones were generated using a standard PCR-based cloning strategy, and the identities of individual clones were verified through double-strand plasmid sequencing. ClpC, MecA, and YpbH variants were subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag or PKTG vector with a C-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) at 22 °C. The soluble fraction of the E. coli lysate was purified through a glutathione-Sepharose column and cleaved by the PreScissionTM protease (GE Healthcare) wherever necessary. ClpP was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a C-terminal His6-tagged protein using the pET-21b vector (Novagen). The soluble fraction of ClpP-His6 in the E. coli lysate was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). ComK was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) in a PLM303 vector (a derivative of pET-27a). The soluble fraction of maltose-binding protein fusion ComK in the E. coli extracts was purified over amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and then cleaved by the PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). After affinity purification, all proteins were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Source 15Q, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined by UV spectroscopic measurement at 280 nm. In vitro degradation assays were reconstituted as described previously (7.Turgay K. Hamoen L.W. Venema G. Dubnau D.

ClpC and ClpP were added at 4 μm final concentration. All MecA variants and ComK were added at 6 μm final concentration. All protein concentrations reported in this study refer to those of the monomers, regardless of the oligomerization states of the proteins. Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, 10/30, GE Healthcare) was employed to examine potential protein-protein interaction. In all cases, proteins were incubated at 4 °C for at least 45 min to allow equilibration. The assay buffer contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of MecA-(121–218) were grown at 18 °C by mixing an equal volume of the protein (10 mg/ml) with reservoir solution containing 14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 300 mm CaCl2, 4% ethylene glycol, and 0.1 m Bis-Tris, 4The abbreviations used are: Bis-Tris2-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediolSADsingle-wavelength anomalous dispersionr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. pH 6.2.

The YpbH-(101–194) structure was refined with PHENIX (18.Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar). To decipher the mechanism by which MecA-(121–218) functions, we crystallized this domain and determined its three-dimensional structure at 2.2 Å resolution using iodine-based SAD (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The final atomic model of MecA-(121–218) contains amino acids 127–218, with the N-terminal 6 residues disordered. The compact structure comprises a central β-sheet of four antiparallel β-strands, which is surrounded by three α-helices (α1, α2, and α4) on one side and a single α-helix (α3) on the other side (Fig. 1A). There are four molecules of MecA-(121–218) in each asymmetric unit; these four molecules exhibit identical structure and can be very well superimposed with one another (Fig. 1B). Exhaustive search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the program DALI (19.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) did not identify any continuous polypeptide or isolated domain that exhibits a similar fold as MecA-(121–218) (Fig. 1C). However, the search identified a large number of structures that display partial similarity to MecA-(121–218). The entry with the highest Z-score (a measure of structural similarity) of 5.3 is the structure of the protein alkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase (20.Razeto A. Mattiroli F. Carpanelli E. Aliverti A. Pandini V. Coda A. Mattevi A. Structure. 2007; 15: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), of which a discontinuous portion can be aligned with MecA-(121–218) with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.9 Å for 78 aligned Cα atoms (Fig. 2, A and B). The second closest entry, with a Z-score of 5.2, is the structure of a small, hypothetical protein from Thermotoga maritima (PDB code 2NZC) (Fig. 2, A and C). We conclude that MecA-(121–218) represents a previously uncharacterized fold (Fig. 1C). Given the sequence conservation of the C-terminal domain of MecA in other bacterial species (Fig. 3A), we propose that, in analogy to MecA, these proteins use their C-terminal domain as a degradation tag. We further posit that each of these proteins may facilitate assembly of the ClpCP protease in its cognate bacterial species. The advent of structural information on MecA-(121–218) greatly facilitated understanding of its function. Sequence alignment of 11 MecA homologues revealed four patches (I, II, III, and IV) of highly conserved amino acids (Fig. 3). Patch II contains mostly hydrophobic amino acids on strands β2 and β3, which likely contribute to the structural stability of the MecA fold. The other three patches are exposed on the surface and may play an important role in MecA function. To understand the biochemical function of these conserved residues, we generated eight full-length, mutant MecA proteins. For six of the eight mutant proteins, there is only a single point mutation in each protein. The other two each contains more than one point mutation. We purified these eight mutant proteins to homogeneity and evaluated their abilities to interact with ClpC and to mediate ClpCP degradation of themselves and ComK (Fig. 4, A–H). The same assays were performed for the wild-type MecA and are reported in the accompanying article (23.Mei Z. Wang F. Qi Y. Zhou Z. Hu Q. Li H. Wu J. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34366-34375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When compared with the wild-type protein, five mutations, E137R in patch I, E176R in patch III, I203A in patch IV, and T211A and H215A,F216A, had little or no impact on ClpCP degradation of the cognate MecA mutant and ComK (Fig. 4, A, B, F, G, and H). Subsequent characterization demonstrated that these mutant proteins retained the ability to oligomerize ClpC and to interact with the ClpCP protease (Fig. 4I). Two mutations, E184R in patch III and E198A,Y199A,K201D in patch IV, led to complete abrogation of ClpCP degradation of the associated MecA mutant and ComK (Fig. 4, C and E). Although still interacting with ClpC, these two mutations abolished the ability to mediate formation of a stable ClpC hexamer (data not shown), thus disrupting assembly of a functional ClpCP complex. Interestingly, the missense mutation R195D eliminated degradation of MecA itself but only weakened degradation of ComK (Fig. 4D). MecA R195D retained interaction with ClpC and weak interaction with the ClpCP protease. These results identified two regions of the MecA surface that are important for its function: one around Glu-184 in patch III and the other around the sequence EYGK in patch IV. These two regions are located on the opposite sides of the MecA fold (Fig. 3B), yet mutations in either region led to compromised ability of MecA to interact with ClpC, suggesting direct involvement of both regions in binding to ClpC. YpbH is a paralogue of MecA. It targets different substrate proteins such as Spx, but not ComK or ComS, to ClpCP for degradation (6.Nakano S. Zheng G. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3664-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similar to MecA-(121–218), YpbH-(101–194) is able to target the BIR1 domain (residues 31–145) of DIAP1 (21.Yan N. Wu J.W. Chai J. Li W. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) for degradation as a heterologous fusion protein (supplemental Fig. 1). YpbH-(101–194) and MecA-(121–218) share sequence identity of 31% and sequence similarity of 63%. To examine whether YpbH-(101–194) is structurally similar to MecA-(121–218), we crystallized the C-terminal fragment of YpbH (residues 101–194) and determined its structure at 2.4 Å resolution. Due to the relatively moderate sequence similarity between MecA and YpbH, molecular replacement using MecA-(121–218) as the starting model did not result in an apparent solution. We had to solve the phase problem using the iodine-SAD data collected on crystals of YpbH residues 104–194. Upon completion of the structural refinement, it became obvious that YpbH-(101–194) shares the same fold as MecA-(121–218). There are six molecules of YpbH-(101–194) in each asymmetric unit. The structures of the six molecules are almost identical (Fig. 5A). Despite the moderate sequence similarity, YpbH-(101–194) can be closely superimposed with MecA-(121–218), with an r.m.s.d. of 1.16 Å over 75 aligned Cα atoms. The only apparent differences exist in some of the surface loop regions. The positions of the conserved amino acids are very similar in both structures. In particular, all of the crucial residues identified in MecA-(121–218) are located at nearly identical positions in YpbH-(101–194) (Fig. 5B). The structural conservation further suggests the important role of these residues. In this study, we reported the crystal structures of MecA-(121–218) and YpbH-(101–194). Despite the moderate sequence similarity, the two structures share an almost identical, previously uncharacterized α/β fold. The distinct α/β fold of MecA-(121–218) is reminiscent of ubiquitin (22.Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Wilkinson K.D. Cook W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3582-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but close examination revealed little structural similarity between these two degradation tags. BLAST search of the non-redundant protein data base resulted in more than 100 entries, mostly from Gram-positive bacteria, that share significant sequence similarity with MecA-(121–218), suggesting the existence of a large family of unique degradation tags with this novel fold. Preliminary biochemical characterization suggests the involvement of two separate surface regions that are located on opposing sides of the MecA C-terminal domain. It is possible that each MecA molecule may interact with two neighboring ClpC molecules through distinct interfaces, hence strengthening the interactions between neighboring ClpC molecules. Another possibility is that MecA binding to ClpC causes a conformational change in ClpC that allows oligomerization. The structural study reported in this study and biochemical characterizations reported in the accompanying article (23.Mei Z. Wang F. Qi Y. Zhou Z. Hu Q. Li H. Wu J. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34366-34375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) allow us to propose a working model of the MecA-ClpCP system, as discussed in the accompanying article. Despite these tantalizing clues, many important questions remain to be answered. At present, it is mechanistically unknown how MecA facilitates the oligomerization of ClpC and the assembly of ClpCP complex or how MecA binds and delivers the substrate protein to the ClpCP protease. The structure of a MecA-ClpC complex should provide critical insights into these processes. We thank N. Shimizu, T. Kumasaka, and S. Baba at the SPring-8 beamline BL41XU for on-site assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2063197315,"Cyclic AMP analogs containing hydrophobic modification of C(8) at the adenine ring such as 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (8-pCPT-cAMP) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyl-cAMP (8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-cAMP) can penetrate membranes due to their high lipophilicity and directly activate intracellular cAMP effectors. Therefore, these cAMP analogs have been used in numerous studies, assuming that their effects reflect the consequences of direct activation of cAMP effectors. The present study provides evidence that 8-pCPT-modified cAMP analogs and their corresponding putative hydrolysis products (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine (8-pCPT-ado) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyl-adenosine (8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-ado)) inhibit the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1). In PC12 cells, in which nucleoside transport strongly depended on ENT1, 8-pCPT-ado, 8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-ado, and, to a smaller extent, 8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-cAMP caused an increase of protein kinase A substrate motif phosphorylation and anti-apoptotic effect by an A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)R)-dependent mechanism. In contrast, the effects of 8-pCPT-cAMP were mainly A(2A)R-independent. In HEK 293 showing little endogenous ENT1-dependent nucleoside transport, transfection of ENT1 conferred A(2A)R-dependent increase in protein kinase A substrate motif phosphorylation. Together, the data of the present study indicate that inhibition of ENT1 and activation of adenosine receptors have to be considered when interpreting the effects of 8-pCPT-substituted cAMP/adenosine analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1990234936,"As sensors of invading microorganisms, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed not only on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) but also on epithelial cells. In the TLR family, Tlr11 appears to have the unique feature in that it is expressed primarily on epithelial cells, although it is also expressed on DCs and macrophages. Here, we demonstrate that transcription of the Tlr11 gene is regulated through two cis-acting elements, one Ets-binding site and one interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-binding site. The Ets element interacts with the epithelium-specific transcription factors, ESE-1 and ESE-3, and the IRF motif interacts with IRF-8. Thus, Tlr11 expression on epithelial cells is regulated by the transcription factors that are presumably distinct from transcription factors that regulate the expression of TLRs in innate immune cells such as macrophages and DCs. Our results imply that the distinctive transcription regulatory machinery for TLRs on epithelium may represent a promising new avenue for the development of epithelia-specific therapeutic interventions."
