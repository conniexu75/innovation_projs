https://openalex.org/W2063115478,"The glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) binds 1–2 moles of fatty acid per mole of protein. The fatty acids cannot be released by repeated extractions of the protein with organic solvents, nor can they be released by denaturing the protein with ionic or nonionic detergents. Pronase digestion of G yields an organic extractable fragment that contains bound fatty acid. The fatty acid is quantitatively released from this fragment and from intact G by mild alkali treatment in methanol and is identified by gas-liquid and thin-layer chromatography as, predominantly, the methyl ester of palmitic acid. Insignificant amounts of phosphate are found in G, thus ruling out the presence of bound phospholipid. Chicken embryo fibroblast pre-labeled with 3H-palmitate and then infected with VSV for 4 hr show the presence of 3H label in G but not in other viral structural proteins. The 3H label is present only in the fatty acid moiety of the protein. Much smaller amounts of 3H fatty acid are bound to G protein formed by the VSV mutant ts045 grown at the nonpermissive temperature, and no 3H fatty acid is bound to G synthesized at 37°C in cells pretreated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation. However, infection with the VSV-Orsay strain at 30°C in the presence of tunicamycin allows for production of VSV particles with nonglycosylated G ( Gibson et al., 1979 Gibson R. Schlesinger S. Kornfeld S. The nonglycosylated glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus is temperature sensitive and undergoes intracellular aggregation at elevated temperatures. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3600-3607 Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar ), and this G has the same proportion of the fatty acid as does the normal glycosylated G. These data indicate that fatty acids become covalently attached to the G polypeptide chain during maturation of the protein—perhaps as the glycoprotein moves to the cell's plasma membrane."

The protein binds to a particulate fraction derived from the islets and stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in this subcellular fraction, both phenomena being activated by ionized calcium. A calcium-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase by endogenous calmodulin may contribute to the accumulation of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate evoked by insulin releasing agents in the islet cells."

https://openalex.org/W1495890091,"Detailed procedures are presented which allow reproducible preparation of T4 gene 32 protein, a helix-destabilizing protein essential for DNA replication and genetic recombination in T4 bacteriophage-infected Escherichia coli cells. Although 32 protein can be purified to better than 99% homogeneity by any one of several procedures, these methods have been developed to remove trace amounts of contaminating deoxyribonucleases, which are present in high levels in the original infected cells. Two alternative preparations are presented, each involving three chromatographic steps. Both 32 proteins obtained are essentially nuclease-free, when tested at physiological salt concentrations. However, we show here that the phenyl-Sepharose chromatography step, which is necessary to remove an exonuclease activity active only at low salt concentrations, also removes a second protein present in trace amounts. In some cases, retention of this second protein is desirable, since it is essential for obtaining RNA primed, de novo DNA chain starts in an in vitro DNA replication system, when this system is constructed by mixing highly purified preparations of each of the six replication proteins coded for by T4 genes 32, 43, 44, 62, 45, and 41."

https://openalex.org/W2069117268,"NIH/3T3 mouse cells were transformed by integrated and unintegrated DNAs of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-infected chicken cells without production of progeny virus. In addition, DNA of the replication-defective Bryan high titer strain of RSV transformed NIH/3T3 cells, indicating that transformation of NIH/3T3 cells by RSV DNA did not require virus replication. The efficiency of transformation of NIH/3T3 cells by RSV DNA was similar to the efficiency of transformation of these cells by murine sarcoma virus DNA and to the efficiency of transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts by RSV DNA. NIH/3T3 cells transformed by RSV DNA were morphologically similar to cells transformed by virus infection and were capable of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Stable inheritance of intact RSV genomes by RSV DNA-transformed NIH/3T3 cells was demonstrated by rescue of virus from these cells after fusion with chicken embryo fibroblasts and by transfection assays of the DNAs of RSV DNA-transformed NIH/3T3 cells on chicken embryo fibroblasts. Analysis of the DNAs of RSV DNA-transformed NIH/3T3 cells by restriction endonuclease digestion and nucleic acid hybridization indicated that RSV genomes were linked to cellular DNA sequences. It therefore appeared that transformation of NIH/3T3 cells by RSV DNA occurred by direct integration and stable expression of the donor DNA, rather than by production of extracellular progeny virus and secondary virus infection, as was previously shown to be required for transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts by RSV DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1483359701,"Interferon-treated L cells are characterized by an increased protein kinase activity that can selectively phosphorylate the small subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2. This protein kinase, PK-i, has been extensively purified and shown to be a potent inhibitor of mRNA translation. The purified PK-i contains the endogenously phosphorylated 67,000 Mr protein characteristic of interferon-treated cell extracts. PK-i can also phosphorylate arginine-rich histones. Purified PK-i can be activated by preincubation with ATP (but not adenylyl imidodiphosphate) and low concentrations of double-stranded RNA. The activation results in an increase in the first rate of eIF-2 phosphorylation. Activated PK-i becomes resistant to high concentrations of double-stranded RNA and more thermostable. A stimulator of PK-i activity, factor A, was isolated, as well as a specific phosphoprotein phosphatase that dephosphorylates the 67,000 Mr protein and eIF-2. These two factors, which are present in untreated L cells, may regulate the translation inhibitory activity of the interferon-induced and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PK-i."
https://openalex.org/W256265565,"The regulatory subunit of CAMP-dependent protein kinase II from porcine skeletal muscle (subunit M, = 55,000) is labile to specific and limited proteolysis. Both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated form of the subunit are cleaved by trypsin and chymotrypsin to yield a 37,000 molecular weight CAMP-binding frag- ment and a 16,000 to 17,000 molecular weight fragment. Thermolysin yielded the same proteolytic fragments from the dephosphorylated regulatory subunit; how- ever, the phosphorylated regulatory subunit was rela- tively resistant to proteolysis with thermolysin. Ex- tended proteolysis with trypsin indicated that even smaller CAMP-binding fragments could be generated. If the regulatory subunit was autophosphorylated with [Y-~‘P]ATP or covalently labeled with the photoaf- finity reagent 8-azido-[32P]cAMP, the radioactivity in both cases was retained exclusively with the 37,000 molecular weight fragment following proteolysis with chymotrypsin. This fragment, although retaining the CAMP binding site, was monomeric in comparison to the highly asymmetric dimeric structure of the native regulatory subunit. In contrast to the native regulatory subunit which has a blocked NH2-terminal residue, dansylation of the 37,000 molecular weight fragment gave an NH2-termi- nal aspartic acid, indicating that this fragment corre- sponds to the COOH-terminal end of the native poly- peptide chain. Further sequencing of this fragment yielded the following sequence: Asx-Arg-Arg-Val- P I Ser-Val with 3zP from the autophosphorylated subunit released at Step 5. This sequence indicated that at least one site of autophosphorylation is located near the proteolytically labile site and may explain why the phosphorylated regulatory subunit was resistant to thermolytic cleavage. A model for defining the func- tional domains of the regulatory subunit is presented. Two major forms of CAMP-dependent protein kinases have been identified and are distinguished most frequently by their elution from DEAE-cellulose (l-4). In addition to electrostatic differences, the two types of CAMP-dependent protein kinase, by convention referred to as protein kinase I and II, differ immunologically (5) and genetically (6). Differences are also apparent in the dissociation and reassociation of catalytic and regulatory subunits for the two forms of protein kinase (7-9)."
https://openalex.org/W1605803926,"The treatment of Hepa-2 cells, a permanent mouse hepatoma cell line, for 72 h with hydrocortisone (10(-6) M), N6,O2-dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-3) M), or 8-bromocyclic AMP (10(-3) M) results in a 2-,3- or 4-fold increase, respectively, in rates of synthesis and secretion of mouse serum albumin. Simultaneous treatment with hydrocortisone and N6,O2-dibutyryl cyclic AMP results in a 10-fold stimulation in these parameters, an effect that is significantly more than additive for the two compounds tested. The number of albumin mRNA sequences, determined by hybridization of total cell RNA to albumin complementary DNA, was increased in direct proportion to the increases in albumin synthesis in all experiments. The relative rate of albumin synthesis approaches in vivo levels in cells treated simultaneously with hydrocortisone and N6,O2-dibutyryl cyclic AMP. We propose that these factors may be necessary to maintain the maximal level of differentiated function in the continuous culture of Hepa-2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986820082,"The physical nature of small air ions is well established and it is recognized that they can produce a variety of biological effects. However, in only a few instances have any underlying biochemical changes been detected. Theoretically, one can consider the hydrated superoxide radical anion (O2) (H2O)n with n congruent to 4-8 as a likely candidate for a biologically active species of negative air ion. The chemical and biological reactivity of superoxide is high and includes a leading role in bacterial killing caused by radiation, in which superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme that catalyses the reaction: O2 + O2 +2H leads to H2O2 +O2 protected markedly. Other studies have also demonstrated the bactericidal effect of O2 (refs 9-11). Inasmuch as the bactericidal action of small negative air ions has been repeatedly confirmed, we decided to test for the involvement of O2 in this phenomenon by evaluating the protective effect of SOD. Our results show strong O2 involvement in negative air ion bacterial kill."
https://openalex.org/W1590968907,"A calcium-modulated protein has been isolated from secondary cultures of virus transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts and has been characterized in terms of its physical, chemical, and functional properties. These properties demonstrate that this protein is a calmodulin and distinguish it from other calcium-modulated proteins found in various muscle and non-muscle tissues. In addition, this transformed cell calmodulin has been shown to be indistinguishable in both structure and function from normal cell calmodulins isolated from chicken gizzard and brain. A novel change in the electrophoretic behavior of these calmodulin preparations that is dependent on sample history has been observed. These alterations may be the basis for previous reports of tissue specific differences in calmodulin and for some of the differences occasionally observed in peptide maps of calmodulins."

https://openalex.org/W1624478426,"Cytochrome P-450cam in the native, substrate-free state (Fe3+, S = 1/2) substantially reduces the NMR relaxation times, T1 and T2, of water protons. Temperature and frequency dependences of T1 and T2 were measured; they are consistent with a model of one or two protons exchanging between a binding site on a heme ligand and bulk water. The relevant parameters of this model have been deduced from the data. The spin relaxation time of the heme iron, tau S similar to 0.5 ns at 25 degrees C, is unusually long for a low spin ferric heme protein but is compatible with the line widths measured for paramagnetically shifted heme resonances. The proton residence time on the ligand, tau M similar to 1 microsecond at 25 degrees C, follows an Arrhenius law with activation energy EM similar to 15 kcal/mol. A scalar hyperfine interaction A/h = 2.2 MHz (3.1 MHz for one-proton exchange) of the found proton(s) with the heme iron is deduced from the difference between T1 and T2 observed in the fast exchange limit. The iron-proton distance is found to be 2.9 A (2.6 A for one-proton exchange). Variation of pH between pH 6.4 and 8.6 does not affect T1. The bearing of these results on the question of the axial heme ligand is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488834218,"A flavokinase preparation from Bacillus subtilis is described which catalyzes the phosphorylation of reduced, but not oxidized, riboflavin. The enzyme is distinguished from other known flavokinases also in having an unusually low Km for the flavin substrate, 50 to 100 nM. ATP is the obligatory phosphate donor; one ATP is utilized for each FMNH2 formed. Mg2+ or Zn2+ is required for the reaction; Co2+ and Mn2+ will substitute, but less effectively. The same enzyme preparation catalyzes the synthesis of FADH2 from FMNH2 and ATP, but not the synthesis of FAD from FMN and ATP. FADH2 is also formed from reduced riboflavin, presumably by sequential flavokinase and FAD synthetase action. Zn2+ cannot replace Mg2+ in FADH2 formation. The reverse reaction, formation of FMN from FAD, occurs only with reduced FAD, giving rise to FMNH2, and is dependent on the presence of inorganic pyrophosphate. The enzyme thus appears to be an FADH2 pyrophosphorylase. The two enzymatic activities, flavokinase and FADH2 pyrophosphorylase, although not separated during the purification procedure, are distinguished by differences in metal ion specificity, in concentration dependence for ATP (apparent Km for ATP = 300 microM for FADH2 synthesis and 6.5 microM for flavokinase), and in the inhibitory effects of riboflavin analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1552327136,"Phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine interact with 125I-thyrotropin and inhibit its binding to thyroid plasma membranes; phosphatidylcholine is not similarly effective. The interaction has been monitored by column chromatography on Sephadex G-100 which shows, for example, that 125I-labeled thyrotropin forms an adduct with phosphatidylinositol but not with phosphatidylcholine. Formation of the 125I-labeled thyrotropin-phosphatidylinositol adduct is dependent on the phosphatidylinositol concentration but can be reversed by both unlabeled thyrotropin and excess membranes. The efficacy of the phospholipid interaction and the phospholipid inhibition of thyrotropin binding to thyroid membranes is paralleled by changes in fluorescence and fluorescence polarization imposed on the 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (dansyl) derivative of thyrotropin. These changes are reversed by unlabeled thyrotropin but not by prolactin, placental lactogen, or growth hormone; similar changes are not observed when phospholipids are incubated with dansylated growth hormone, prolactin, and placental lactogen. Monovalent potassium, sodium, and lithium salts neither prevent nor reverse the formation of the phospholipid-dansyl-thyrotropin adduct; these results contrast with the effects of the same salts on the formation of ganglioside adducts with dansyl-thyrotropin. Despite their ability to interact witw 125I-thyrotropin in solution, neither phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, nor phosphatidylethanolamine, when incorporated in a liposome, binds the 125I-labeled ligand. These same phospholipids have no effect on ganglioside binding of 125I-labeled thyrotropin when gangliosides are incorporated in a liposome. These phospholipids do, however, modulate the expression of the glycoprotein component of the thyrotropin receptor when it is imbedded in a liposome. The phosphatidylinositol in this case serves as a negative modulator, both by decreasing the incorporation of the glycoprotein component of the receptor into the liposome and by inhibiting the binding activity of the glycoprotein component which is incorporated. Speculation is offered as to a possible role of the phospholipids in the message transmission process which would be consistent with current studies demonstrating a direct interaction of acidic phospholipids with thyrotropin. The effect of phospholipids on liposomes containing the glycoprotein component of the thyrotropin receptor raises the possibility that phospholipids and, in particular, phosphatidylinositol, may also play a role in regulating the insertion and expression of this receptor component in thyroid plasma membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1533227260,"A strongly fluorescent 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (dansyl) derivative of bovine thyrotropin has been prepared. The dye-conjugated hormone is bioactive and shares, essentially unchanged, the membrane binding and adenylate cyclase stimulatory activities of the native hormone. Binding of 125I-labeled dansyl-thyrotropin to thyroid plasma membranes is sensitive to inhibition by gangliosides and, as is the case for the binding of 125I-thyrotropin, galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl[N-acetylneuraminyl-N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylglucosylceramide (GDIb) is the most potent binding inhibitor. Gangliosides interact with dansyl-thyrotropin, causing a large increase of the quantum yield and a 5- to 10-nm blue shift of the emission maximum of the hormone-bound naphthalene chromophore; gangliosides cause no change in the fluorescent properties of the free dye. The fluorescence enhancement caused by gangliosides can be specifically reversed by unlabeled thyrotropin. The effect of gangliosides on dansyl-thyrotropin fluorescence is strongly salt-dependent; salts cannot, however, reverse the formation of the dansyl-thyrotropin.ganglioside complex once it has formed. The salt data suggest that the association of the ganglioside with dansyl-thyrotropin is dominated by electrostatic interactions, but that salt-independent, short range interactions, most likely hydrophobic, dominate the dissociation of the dansyl-thyrotropin-ganglioside adduct. Sucrose gradient centrifugation, ultracentrifugation, and fluorescence polarization data indicate that the gangliosides are micellar in nature under the conditions of these experiments. Acid titration of dansyl-thyrotropin causes a marked quenching of dansyl fluorescence which in part reflects dissociation of the hormone into its constituent alpha and beta subunits. In the presence of GDIb, but not N-acetylneuraminylgalactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylglucosylceramide (GDIa), pH-dependent quenching and subunit dissociation are essentially eliminated. Circular dichroism results and fluorescence polarization studies support the interpretation that the ganglioside interaction causes a conformational change in the thyrotropin molecule. The acid titration data together with differences in the ability of gangliosides to influence the tyrosine fluorescence of the thyrotropin molecule indicate that different gangliosides induce different conformational perturbations in the thyrotropin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1543109110,"Adenylate cyclase activity and endogenous cyclic AMP levels were measured using a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay and protein binding assay during 24 h of development of Dictyostelium discoideum. Adenylate cyclase activity was not detected until the aggregation stage of development (10 h) when a sudden peak of activity was found. The enzyme was active at all subsequent stages, although a slow decline in activity was observed. Similarly, cyclic AMP levels were not detectable through the first 7 h of development and then showed a sudden peak at aggregation. Following aggregation the cyclic AMP levels decreased to approximately 1/2 the peak value and maintained that level throughout the remainder of the developmental cycle. Adenylate cyclase had a narrow range of substrate saturation with a maximum velocity at 1 to 4 mM ATP at both the aggregation stage (10 h) and the sorocarp stage (24 h). At levels of ATP higher than 6 mM the enzyme from both stages was strongly inhibited. No activity was observed in the absence of Mg2+ or dithiothreitol. The activity from 10-, 14-, and 20-h stages was found bound to a 25,000 x g pellet fraction. The sudden appearance of adenylate cyclase and its product cyclic AMP at aggregation provides additional evidence of a role for this nucleotide in chemotaxis, and the retention of enzyme activity and nucleotide level during the subsequent stages may reflect a further function of cyclic AMP during formation of the two cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2074482080,"Abstract The amino acid sequence relationship between the nonglycosylated structural proteins of murine mammary tumor virus and the polyproteins from infected cells immunoprecipitated with an anti-p27 serum were examined using two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping procedures. The proteins were labeled with 14 C-lysine and 14 C-arginine so that all but one of the tryptic peptides released from a protein could be detected. Previous studies have shown that immunoprecipitation of mammary tumor cells with anti-p27 serum results in the isolation of seven proteins in the molecular weight range of 34,000–160,000 daltons; and that cell-free translation using viral genomic RNA yields three p27-related proteins of 160,000, 110,000 and 77,000 daltons, similar to the three high molecular weight proteins detected in vivo. The proteins of lower molecular weight were thought to be cleavage intermediates of Pr77 gag . As judged from the peptide maps, Pr77 gag contained the complete sequences of the four major internal proteins of the virion (p27, pp21, p14 and p10) and possibly a fifth highly basic protein (p8) also found in virions. The putative cleavage intermediates, as expected, lacked some tryptic peptides that could be assigned to one or more of the major virion proteins and thus allow a scheme for the cleavage events to be constructed. p110 gag contained all the tryptic peptides found in Pr77 gag , plus some additional peptides. A minor virion protein p30 was found to include the peptides of p14 as well as some of the additional peptides present in p110 gag , suggesting a precursor-product relationship between the pr110 gag and p30. The data obtained from these studies lead us to propose that there are three protein precursors which include, at least in part, the gag gene region of the virion—p160 (potentially a gag/pol precursor), p110 gag and Pr77 gag —and that the arrangement of the virion proteins within the gag gene (pr77 gag ) is p10-pp21-p27-p14."

AIdUDP was identified by its acid lability, sensitivity to alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis, chromatographic behavior, and ratio of double isotope (125I, 32P) labeling. ATP, but not AMP, is a phosphate donor, and the direct transfer of the beta and gamma phosphate of ATP as pyrophosphate to AIdUrd was ruled out. The presence of a phosphoramidate bond was supported by the acid lability of AIdUDP which has a half life (t1/2) of 320 min at pH 3.0. At neutral pH, the hydrolysis products are AIdUrd and orthophosphate, with AIdUrd monophosphate being the probable hydrolytic intermediate at these pH values. However, at acidic pH, some pyrophosphate was detected in addition to AIdUrd and orthophosphate. AIdUrd competitively inhibited the phosphorylation of thymidine and deoxycytidine. Escherichia coli thymidine kinase, even though 100-fold higher in activity, was unable to phosphorylate AId-Urd under similar incubation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2091838313,"We identified viral transcripts in parvovirus H1-infected rodent cells using the S1 nuclease mapping technique of Berk and Sharp (1977, 1978). The most abundant viral transcript, present in both nucleus and cytoplasm, is approximately 2.8 kb long and represents about 56% of the viral genome. Less abundant viral transcripts of 3.0, 1.45 and 1.30 kb, and possibly other minor viral transcripts, are also detected in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. In contrast, a prominent 4.7 kb viral transcript which corresponds to 95% of the viral DNA is found only in the nucleus; this finding suggests that the parvovirus genome may function as a single transcription unit. Virus-infected cells pretreated with cycloheximide accumulate all these viral transcripts. Analyses of RNA-DNA hybrids (isolated from neutral agarose gels) by electrophoresis on alkaline agarose gels indicate that the 4.7, 3.0 and 2.8 kb viral transcripts are ""spliced"" RNAs. The nuclear-specific 4.7 kb transcript appears to be encoded by two noncontiguous DNA segments of 2.2 and 2.6 kb. The 3.0 and 2.8 kb transcripts are apparently encoded by.a 2.6 kb segment of DNA and one or more much smaller noncontiguous DNA segments, one of which is approximately 170 nucleotides long."

https://openalex.org/W1605738503,"ATP and UTP support microtubule assembly through the action of brain nucleoside-5'-diphosphate kinase on GDP. Penningroth and Kirschner (1977) J. Mol. Biol. 115, 643-673) have proposed that microtubule assembly may occur by either of two mechanisms: indirectly, through nucleoside-5'-diphosphate kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of uncomplexed GDP and directly by nucleoside-5'-diphosphate kinase-mediated transphosphorylation of tubulin-bound GDP at low tubulin concentrations. We find the rates of GDP and GTP release (0.68 and 0.32 min-1, respectively) are sufficiently fast relative to assembly to permit GDP release, phosphorylation, and GTP binding as the sole mechanism of nucleoside-5'-diphosphate kinase action in microtubule assembly. Computer simulation studies accord with the conclusion that GDP release is rapid relative to microtubule assembly. The specific activity of the nucleoside-5'-diphosphate kinase is 1.7 nmol/min/mg of microtubular protein under the conditions studied. Pulse-chase experiments with tubulin . [14C]GDP complex and the rapidity of GDP phosphorylation by the kinase are in agreement with this scheme. Finally, it was observed that the extent and rate of microtubule assembly depends upon the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio."

When cultures are infected with wild virus, VSV replicates selectively in neurons, producing cell death within 24–48 hr. Sensory and immature neurons express viral antigen most rapidly. Viral antigen and viral budding sites are detected along the neuron some and dendrites. When large amounts of DI-T particles are added to the wild virus inoculum, viral growth is completely suppressed in mature neurons, the cell killing effects of VSV are considerably delayed and co-infected cultures survive for 5–16 days. Viral antigen accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions and on the membrane of neuron cell somas and dendrites in the virtual absence of viral assembly. Identical modulation of VSV infection in mature neuron cultures is obtained when DI-T particles are added before or after the wild virus, but ultraviolet inactivation of DIs completely abolishes their protective effect. Immature neurons or Vero cells cannot be protected from acute cytopathic changes by an equivalent amount of DI particles. Thus DIs interfere with replication and assembly of the wild virus and attenuate cell killing effects in mature neurons in vitro."

RNA synthesis does not proceed if ATP is replaced by ADP. Similarly RNA synthesis is impaired if CDP and UDP are present in the same reaction.

https://openalex.org/W52878158,"The human plasma apolipoproteins, apo-A-II and apo-C-III, assocaite with phospholipid with a concurrent increase in alpha helical structure of the apoprotein and an exothermic enthalpy of association. A linear correlation of the increase in alpha helical structure and the exothermic enthalpy of association gave a value of -1.3 kcal/mol of amino acid residues converted from a random coil to an alpha helical structure. This value is very close to that of alpha helix formation by charged polyamino acids (-1.2 kcal/mol) and suggests that amino acid side chains contribute little or no heat to the random coil leads to alpha helix transition in the plasma apolipoproteins. In the absence of a change in alpha helix in the apolipoproteins studied here, the enthalpy of association is practically nil, suggesting that alpha helix formation is a major enthalpic contribution to the total free energy of lipid-apolipoprotein association."

The equilibrium constant for NADH dissociation was 3.8 +/- 0.2 micrometers, over a 23-fold range of enzyme concentration, and the value in the presence of saturating hydroxymalonate was 0.33 +/- 0.02 micrometer over a 10-fold range of enzyme concentration. The rate constant for NADH binding to the enzyme in the presence of hydroxymalonate was 3.6 X 10(7) M-1 s-1, while the value for dissociation from the ternary complex was 30 +/- 1 s-1. No limiting binding rate was obtained at pseudo-first order rate constants as high as 200 s-1, and the rate curve for dissociation was a single exponential for at least 98% of the amplitude. In addition to demonstrating that the binding sites are independent and indistinguishable, the absence of effects of enzyme concentration on the KD value indicates that NADH binds with equal affinity to monomeric and dimeric enzyme forms."

https://openalex.org/W2047062889,"UM-1037 (3-allyl-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-hexahydro-8-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-benzazocine), a benzazocine compound related structurally to the narcotic antagonists cyclazocine and the N-allyl analogue of cyclazocine, SKF-10,047, but lacking the 2,6-methano bridge, has been found to produce similar signs in normal rhesus monkeys to those characteristic of the narcotic abstinence syndrome1. Narcotic antagonists have been reported to produce contraction in the isolated guinea pig ileum2,3. However, only when the ileum has been continuously exposed to morphine or related drugs in vitro or has been isolated from animals made dependent on a narcotic, does it contract when an antagonist such as naloxone is added to the perfusion medium4. Thus, this preparation has been used as an in vitro model of the narcotic abstinence syndrome, and the contraction might be considered an ‘abstinence sign’. In the present study, UM-1037 was found to produce a contraction of the guinea pig ileum isolated from normal animals similar to the contraction produced by naloxone in preparations exposed to morphine or related drugs. UM-1037, like naloxone, seems to act by releasing acetylcholine (ACh), because its actions were antagonised by atropine and tetrodotoxin. However, morphine, which is necessary for the naloxone-induced contraction, reversed the effect of UM-1037 on the ileum. Responses to UM-1037 were not altered in the presence of naloxone. Thus, the release of ACh which is produced by this unusual benzazocine in the ileum does not seem to be mediated by the opiate receptor."
