https://openalex.org/W2951514146,"Cerebral blood flow is reduced early in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because most of the vascular resistance within the brain is in capillaries, this could reflect dysfunction of contractile pericytes on capillary walls. We used live and rapidly fixed biopsied human tissue to establish disease relevance, and rodent experiments to define mechanism. We found that in humans with cognitive decline, amyloid β (Aβ) constricts brain capillaries at pericyte locations. This was caused by Aβ generating reactive oxygen species, which evoked the release of endothelin-1 (ET) that activated pericyte ETA receptors. Capillary, but not arteriole, constriction also occurred in vivo in a mouse model of AD. Thus, inhibiting the capillary constriction caused by Aβ could potentially reduce energy lack and neurodegeneration in AD."

However, their evolutionary relationships have been contentious, as have the origins of their distinctive digestive systems and headgear, including antlers and horns (see the Perspective by Ker and Yang). To understand the relationships among ruminants, L. Chen et al. sequenced 44 species representing 6 families and performed a phylogenetic analysis. From this analysis, they were able to resolve the phylogeny of many genera and document incomplete lineage sorting among major clades. Interestingly, they found evidence for large population reductions among many taxa starting at approximately 100,000 years ago, coinciding with the migration of humans out of Africa. Examining the bony appendages on the head—the so-called headgear—Wang et al. describe specific evolutionary changes in the ruminants and identify selection on cancer-related genes that may function in antler development in deer.

https://openalex.org/W2950629960,"Flexible domains in a well-oiled machine Motors convert one form of energy into another. For biological motors, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) serves as chemical energy and its hydrolysis is coupled to conformational changes that exert mechanical force. ATP synthases reverse this process in a multistep process: first converting an electrochemical gradient to rotational kinetic energy, and then coupling rotation to formation of high-energy phosphodiester bonds. Murphy et al. investigated these energy changes in the dimeric mitochondrial F 1 -F o ATP synthase from Polytomella sp., a unicellular alga. They solved high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of the ATP synthase complex, extracting 13 rotational substates. This collection of structures revealed that the rotation of the F o ring and central stalk is coupled with partial rotations of the F 1 head. This flexibility may enable the head to better couple continuous rotation with discrete ATP synthesis events. Science , this issue p. eaaw9128"

Cohn et al. wanted to examine the trade-off between material self-interest and more altruistic behaviors (see the Perspective by Shalvi). They distributed more than 17,000 wallets containing various sums of money in 355 cities across 40 countries. In contrast to what rationalist theories of economics predict, citizens were more likely to return wallets that contained more money. The findings also reveal a high level of civic honesty across nations. Science , this issue p. 70 ; see also p. 29"

https://openalex.org/W2949088176,"Transport coefficients of correlated electron systems are often useful for mapping hidden phases with distinct symmetries. Here we report a transport signature of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the magnetic Weyl semimetal cerium-aluminum-germanium (CeAlGe) system in the form of singular angular magnetoresistance (SAMR). This angular response exceeding 1000% per radian is confined along the high-symmetry axes with a full width at half maximum reaching less than 1° and is tunable via isoelectronic partial substitution of silicon for germanium. The SAMR phenomena is explained theoretically as a consequence of controllable high-resistance domain walls, arising from the breaking of magnetic point group symmetry strongly coupled to a nearly nodal electronic structure. This study indicates ingredients for engineering magnetic materials with high angular sensitivity by lattice and site symmetries."

We also reveal that D2-MSN LLP requires muscarinic 1 receptor activation, intracellular calcium signaling, and GluR2-lacking AMPAR insertion.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a central locus for reward-related behaviors. The major projection neurons that regulate these behaviors, medium spiny neurons (MSNs), are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons that are distinguished by their dopamine receptor expression (expressing either dopamine 1 [D1] or dopamine 2 [D2] receptors), their projections (Albin et al., 1989Albin R.L.

These MSN subtypes differ in their behavioral roles along a ventromedial to dorsolateral gradient (Voorn et al., 2004Voorn P. Vanderschuren L.J.M.J. Groenewegen H.J. Robbins T.W.

However, recent studies have indicated cell-type-specific activation of D2-MSNs, using a stimulation paradigm with prolonged optogenetic depolarization and/or high-frequency stimulation, enhances motivation to obtain food rewards or promotes self-stimulation (Cole et al., 2018Cole S.L.

Additionally, high-frequency (≥50 Hz), but not low-frequency, stimulation of all NAc neurons or NAc D1-MSNs specifically reverses anhedonic outcomes, increasing preference for rewarding stimuli, such as sucrose or social interaction in the absence of stimulation (Francis et al., 2015Francis T.C.

MSN activity is coordinated on a short timescale by local GABAergic collaterals that allow active MSNs or local GABAergic interneurons that suppress the activity of adjacent MSNs (Dobbs et al., 2016Dobbs L.K.

Locally, MSNs can modulate activity on a longer timescale by releasing peptides that exert their actions through the control of excitatory input. Local release of dynorphin or enkephalin causes excitatory depression on MSNs (Atwood et al., 2014Atwood B.K. Kupferschmidt D.A. Lovinger D.M.

Montoya M.

Neurobiol. 2008; 68: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predict using high-frequency stimulation paradigms releases peptides and causes lasting functional plasticity changes that work in conjunction with or supersede fast-acting, inhibitory collateral effects, thereby controlling behavior. In this study, we aimed to assess the consequences of varied D1-MSN stimulation on excitatory transmission on NAc MSN subtypes. We demonstrate strong, high-frequency, but not low-frequency, stimulation of D1-MSNs can indirectly enhance excitatory input on D2-MSNs through the release of substance P from D1-MSNs. This lasting potentiation of excitatory input is post-synaptically expressed, sub-compartment specific, and driven by cholinergic neurons through muscarinic receptor signaling and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) insertion. AAV-DIO-ChR2 was injected and expressed in the NAcC or NAcS of dynorphin (Dyn)-Cre mice (Figure 1A). Using cell-attached recordings, we found that D1-MSNs displayed high-fidelity action potential firing in response to increasing stimulation frequencies (Figure 1B). To determine the effects of high-frequency stimulation on excitatory transmission, excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked with electrical stimulation in the presence of picrotoxin (100 μM) to block GABAA receptor transmission. D1-MSNs were stimulated with 50-Hz, 473-nm blue light for varying durations. Surprisingly, it was found, 50-Hz trains of NAcC D1-MSN stimulation (10-ms light pulse duration) for either 5 min (5 s light on, 5 s light off) or 15 min promoted a long-lasting excitatory potentiation (LLP) on D2-MSNs (mean ± SE %baseline: 5 min: 141.1% ± 10.55%; 15 min: 158.2% ± 20.19%) but produced excitatory depression on D1-MSNs (5 min: 75.10% ± 12.45%; 15 min: 75.86% ± 10.53%; Figures S1A and S1B). These stimulation parameters have been used previously to promote sucrose preference and reverse stress-induced aversion in mice (Francis et al., 2015Francis T.C. Chandra R. Friend D.M. Finkel E. Dayrit G. Miranda J. Brooks J.M. Iñiguez S.D. O’Donnell P. Kravitz A. Lobo M.K. Nucleus accumbens medium spiny neuron subtypes mediate depression-related outcomes to social defeat stress.Biol. Psychiatry. 2015; 77: 212-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To determine the duration of stimulation necessary for the effect, we decreased the stimulation to a single 5-s train of 50-Hz stimulation, which produced the same LLP as 5-min and 15-min stimulation on NAcC D2-MSNs (139.9% ± 6.03%), but had no observable effect on NAcC D1-MSNs (88.58% ± 11.08%; Figures 1C, 1E, and 1F). A 50-Hz light train of 1 s was not capable of promoting D2-MSN LLP (92.03% ± 13.51%; Figure S1C). Additionally, a 5-s, 50-Hz train with a shortened light pulse duration of 1 ms was not capable of producing D2-MSN LLP (74.81% ± 9.43%; Figure S1D) or high-fidelity D1-MSN firing (Figure S1E). The NAcC D2-MSN LLP was not dependent on potassium channels (Figure S1F) or dependent on GABAA receptor or GABAB receptor transmission (152.8% ± 10.00%; Figure S1G). In contrast to the NAcC, EPSCs in both NAcS MSN subtypes were depressed (Figures 1D and 1E), which was not blocked by norbinaltorphimine (400 nM), a kappa opioid receptor antagonist, in D2-MSNs (61.56% ± 10.78%; Figure S1H). Lower frequency NAcC D1-MSN stimulation at 10 Hz or 20 Hz was not capable of producing LLP on NAcC D2-MSNs (10 Hz: 78.97% ± 13.21%; 20 Hz: 77.81% ± 10.60%; Figure 1G), suggesting that high-frequency stimulation is necessary for the local stimulation-induced D2-MSN LLP. Peptides require high-frequency stimulation for their release (Hökfelt, 1991Hökfelt T. Neuropeptides in perspective: the last ten years.Neuron. 1991; 7: 867-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The principle excitatory peptide in the striatum, substance P, is exclusively expressed in D1-MSNs and excites about half of the dorsal striatal MSNs (Blomeley and Bracci, 2008Blomeley C. Bracci E. Substance P depolarizes striatal projection neurons and facilitates their glutamatergic inputs.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 2143-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Blomeley et al., 2009Blomeley C.P. Kehoe L.A. Bracci E. Substance P mediates excitatory interactions between striatal projection neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predicted substance P is responsible for the effects of D1-MSN high-frequency stimulation in the NAcC. Indeed, similar to 50-Hz stimulation, substance P (1 μM) produced LLP on NAcC D2-MSNs (131.2% ± 9.15%) but had no effect on NAcC D1-MSNs (106.4% ± 7.85%; Figures 2A, 2E, and 2F ). Similar to NAcS D1-MSN high-frequency stimulation, substance P (1 μM) depressed excitatory transmission on the NAcS D2-MSNs (82.43% ± 6.67%) and, in contrast to D1-MSN 50 Hz repeated stimulation, had no significant effects on excitatory transmission to NAcS D1-MSNs (109.0% ± 6.20%; Figures 2E, 2F, and S2A). Substance P primarily binds to and activates the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) (Regoli et al., 1987Regoli D. Drapeau G. Dion S. D’Orléans-Juste P. Pharmacological receptors for substance P and neurokinins.Life Sci. 1987; 40: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predicted the NAcC D2-MSN LLP is dependent on the NK1R. Using the NK1R selective antagonist L-733,060 (10 μM), we were able to block the LLP on NAcC D2-MSN caused by substance P bath application (101.1% ± 7.07%; Figure 2B). Peptides can act on their receptors at low concentrations (Hökfelt et al., 2000Hökfelt T. Broberger C. Xu Z.Q. Sergeyev V. Ubink R. Diez M. Neuropeptides--an overview.Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1337-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Additionally, higher concentrations of substance P may have affinity for other NK1Rs at 1 μM. Therefore, we tested the ability of substance P to activate the NK1R at varying concentrations using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay. The effective concentration, where the receptor displayed 50% activation (EC50), was 27.9 nM (Figure 2C). Based on these results, we utilized a low concentration of substance P (50 nM) and found this concentration replicated D2-MSN NAcC LLP caused by 1 μM substance P (Figures 2D and 2E). To determine whether high-frequency-driven potentiation on NAcC D2-MSNs is NK1R dependent, we utilized two different selective NK1R antagonists: L-733,060 or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antagonist aprepitant. NK1R antagonism with aprepitant (1 μM) blocked NAcC D2-MSN LLP caused by a single 5-s, 50-Hz train of D1-MSN stimulation (98.02% ± 10.73%; Figure 2G). Additionally, 5 min of NAcC D1-MSN 50-Hz-stimulation-induced potentiation on D2-MSNs was blocked by L-733,060 and produced a transient excitatory depression (79.52% ± 8.22%; Figure S2B). It is possible NK1R could cause excitatory depression by dampening a tonic NK1R tone. However, we found neither L-733,060 nor aprepitant altered synaptic properties in the absence of other stimuli (Figures S2C–S2F). Substance P was able to prevent further potentiation caused by 50-Hz D1-MSN stimulation (2: 140.9% ± 15.02%; 3: 152.5% ± 14.73%; Figure 2H), indicating that substance P and D1-MSN 50-Hz stimulation act through the same mechanism to produce potentiation. Therefore, we conclude high-frequency activation of D1-MSNs drives LLP on NAcC D2-MSNs via a substance P mechanism. The locus of potentiation (pre- versus post-synaptic) is important in understanding the underlying mechanism of substance-P-induced changes in excitatory transmission in the NAc. We first analyzed paired pulse ratios (PPRs) to examine for a functional change in the probability of release, comparing values before and after 50-Hz stimulation or substance P bath application. PPRs were not different in NAcC MSNs after 50-Hz D1-MSN stimulation or substance P (50 nM; Figures 3A and 3B ). Interestingly, using a shorter pulse duration (1 ms), which unmasked a D1-MSN stimulation-induced excitatory depression in NAcC D2-MSNs caused an increase in PPRs (Figure S3A), as was the case with all NAcS MSNs (Figure S3B). These findings indicate NAcC D2-MSNs express potentiation at a post-synaptic locus, which is dependent on stimulation duty cycle, and all NAcS MSNs express pre-synaptic depression. To verify this finding, we examined the amplitude and frequency spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) to probe for quantal changes that may underlie this specificity. The amplitude of sEPSCs was significantly enhanced on NAcC D2-MSNs (Figures 3C and 3E), but not NAcC D1-MSNs (Figures 3D and 3F), and the frequency remained unchanged in both cell types across conditions, except for a surprising increase in sEPSC frequency in NAcC D1-MSNs after substance P. In agreement with the PPR data, the frequency, but not the amplitude, of sEPSCs was decreased on NAcC D2-MSNs in the short pulse duration condition (Figure S3C) as well as on all NAcS MSNs in the long pulse duration condition (Figures S3D and S3E). Taken together, these results suggest a post-synaptic mechanism drives substance-P-induced LLP on NAcC D2-MSNs, and substance-P-induced excitatory depression on NAcS neurons is pre-synaptic. NK1Rs are found on medium and large aspiny neurons within the striatum (Pickel et al., 2000Pickel V.M. Douglas J. Chan J. Gamp P.D. Bunnett N.W. Neurokinin 1 receptor distribution in cholinergic neurons and targets of substance P terminals in the rat nucleus accumbens.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 423: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, we found very few NK1R (Tac1r) RNA transcripts coexpressed with D1 receptor (Drd1) and D2 receptor (Drd2) RNA transcripts in the NAcC (Figure 4A). Because the Tac1r expression was sparse (<2% of cells), we predicted interneurons likely accounted for the expression of the receptor. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, Chat)-positive, cholinergic interneurons also express D2 receptors (Le Moine et al., 1990Le Moine C. Tison F. Bloch B. D2 dopamine receptor gene expression by cholinergic neurons in the rat striatum.Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 117: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and may account for a portion of the Drd2/Tac1r RNA coexpression. In accordance with these findings and similar to previous findings (Chen et al., 2001Chen L.-W. Wei L.-C. Liu H.-L. Qiu Y. Chan Y.-S. Cholinergic neurons expressing substance P receptor (NK(1)) in the basal forebrain of the rat: a double immunocytochemical study.Brain Res. 2001; 904: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Pickel et al., 2000Pickel V.M. Douglas J. Chan J. Gamp P.D. Bunnett N.W. Neurokinin 1 receptor distribution in cholinergic neurons and targets of substance P terminals in the rat nucleus accumbens.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 423: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), nearly all Chat-expressing neurons in the NAcC and NAcS displayed Chat and Tac1r coexpression across all striatal compartments and bregma locations (Figures 4B and S4A). Somatostatin (Sst) neuron coexpression with Tac1r comprised the residual Tac1r expression not explained by coexpression with Chat (Figure S4B). Additionally, the number of Chat-expressing cells did not differ across all striatal compartments (Figure S4C). These results indicate it is unlikely D1-MSNs cause NK1R-dependent LLP on D2-MSNs via direct collaterals. Rather, D1-MSNs may drive LLP on D2-MSNs through an interneuron-mediated disynaptic mechanism. ChAT neurons show enhanced firing rates in the dorsal striatum (Aosaki and Kawaguchi, 1996Aosaki T. Kawaguchi Y. Actions of substance P on rat neostriatal neurons in vitro.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5141-5153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Govindaiah et al., 2010Govindaiah G. Wang Y. Cox C.L. Substance P selectively modulates GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in striatal cholinergic interneurons.Neuropharmacology. 2010; 58: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and levels of acetylcholine are increased within the striatum by substance P in a NK1R-dependent manner (Anderson et al., 1993Anderson J.J. Chase T.N. Engber T.M. Substance P increases release of acetylcholine in the dorsal striatum of freely moving rats.Brain Res. 1993; 623: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Guzman et al., 1993Guzman R.G.

Moreover, SST is known to be inhibitory (Grilli et al., 2004Grilli M. Raiteri L. Pittaluga A. Somatostatin inhibits glutamate release from mouse cerebrocortical nerve endings through presynaptic sst2 receptors linked to the adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A pathway.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Hou and Yu, 2013Hou Z.H.

Somatostatin hyperpolarizes hippocampal pyramidal cells in vitro.Brain Res. 1981; 221: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to explore the effects of substance P on NAcC ChAT neuron firing to assess whether ChAT neurons are involved in driving D2-MSN LLP. We performed cell-attached recordings of NAcC ChAT neurons and, similar to the dorsal striatum, found substance P (1 μM) significantly enhanced firing rates of ChAT neurons in cell-attached (Figure 4C) and whole-cell (Figure S4D) configurations. Although all ChAT cells displayed enhanced firing to 1 μM substance P, a subset exhibited a strong enhancement in firing followed by depolarization block (Figure S4E). To determine the concentration most effective at enhancing ChAT firing rates, without producing depolarization block, we bath-applied substance P at varying concentrations and found the EC50 for substance P was about 43 nM (Figure 4D), which is similar to the EC50 determined by BRET (Figure 2C). Indeed, 50 nM of substance P was able to significantly enhance the firing rate of ChAT neurons, without producing depolarization block (Figure S4F). We next tested the efficacy of the NK1R antagonist L-733,060 in suppressing enhanced firing at the lowest concentration of substance P (100 nM) capable of producing a near maximal response. L-733,060 displayed an IC50 at about 1.5 μM and a maximal inhibition at 10 μM (Figure 4E): the concentration used to block the substance-P-induced D2-MSN synaptic effect (Figure 2B). Similarly, maximal inhibition of receptor activity in a BRET assay was also observed to be near 10 μM for the NK1R antagonists L-733,060 and aprepitant (Figure S4G). At a low substance P concentration (100 nM), we found the enhanced ChAT firing rate was suppressed by 10 μM L-733,060 (Figures 4F and 4G) or 1 μM aprepitant (Figure S4H), which did not have effects on spontaneous ChAT firing rate in the absence of substance P (Figure S4I). Additionally, baseline firing was not restored until 12 min following the initial application of low concentrations of substance P (11 min: 173.7% ± 20.27%, p < 0.05; 12 min: 147.0% ± 15.22%, p > 0.05; Figure 4F). These results suggest substance P drives a lasting enhancement in spontaneous ChAT firing through NK1Rs. Due to the lack of total suppression by both NK1R antagonists, it is possible another tachykinin receptor could mediate the residual"

Currently only few individual molecules were investigated for their diagnostic capabilities in saliva. A systematic comparison of IgG antibody profiles in saliva and plasma is still missing in scientific literature. Our hypothesis is that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual. As a consequence, one could implement practically any plasma based IgG assay (classical serology) as saliva based assay. In other words, the IgG antibodies found in blood are also accessible from saliva. We confirm our hypothesis by comparing IgG reactivities towards protein and peptide antigens. We isolated saliva IgG with high purity and demonstrate that plasma IgG reactivities (classical serology) can be inferred from saliva. As a showcase we perform Hepatitis B virus antibody (plasma-)titer determination from saliva. Additionally we show that plasma and saliva IgG profiles of 20 individuals are highly similar for 256 peptide antigens and match (unsupervised) with high probabilities. Finally, we argue for generalisation to the complete IgG antibody profile. The presented findings could contribute greatly to the development of saliva based diagnostic methods of numerous antibody based tests."

In this study, the anti-obesity effects of whole Spirulina platensis (WSP), Spirulina platensis protein (SPP) and Spirulina platensis protein hydrolysate (SPPH) were compared in high-fat diet fed mice, and the potential acting mechanism of SPPH was also investigated. Totally, SPPH exhibited good anti-obesity effects (reducing 39.8%±9.7% of body weight), lowering 23.8%±1.6% of serum glucose, decreasing 20.8%±1.4% of total cholesterol, while positive drug Simvastatin had the corresponding values: 8.3%±4.6%, 24.8%±1.9% and -2.1%±0.2%, respectively. Subsequently, PCR array was used to conduct gene expression analysis in brain and liver tissues of SPPH-treated mice, which displayed distinctly different expression pattern. The most markedly changed genes included: Acadm (-34.7 fold), Gcg (2.5 fold), Adra2b (2 fold) and Ghsr (2 fold) in brain; Retn (39 fold), Fabp4 (15.5 fold), Ppard (6 fold) and Slc27a1 (5.4 fold) in liver. Further network analysis demonstrated that the significantly expressed genes in brain and liver tissues were mapped into an interacting network, suggesting a modulatory effect on brain-liver axis, major pathways were involved in the axis: PPAR, adipocytokine, AMPK, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and MAPK. This study showed that Spirulina platensis protein hydrolysate possessed anti-obesity effect in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2952153189,"Introduction It is crucial to understand the factors that introduce variability before applying metabolomics to clinical and biomarker research. Objectives We quantified technical and biological variability of both fasting and postprandial metabolite concentrations measured using 1H NMR spectroscopy in plasma samples. Methods In the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study (n = 6,671), 148 metabolite concentrations (101 metabolites belonging to lipoprotein subclasses) were measured under fasting and postprandial states (150 minutes after a mixed liquid meal). Technical variability was evaluated among 265 fasting and 851 postprandial samples, with the identical blood plasma sample being measured twice by the same laboratory protocol. Biological reproducibility was assessed by measuring 165 individuals twice across time for evaluation of short- (<6 months) and long-term (>3 years) biological variability. Intra-class coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess variability. The ICCs of the fasting metabolites were compared with the postprandial metabolites using two-sided paired Wilcoxon test separately for short- and long-term measurements. Results Both fasting and postprandial metabolite concentrations showed high technical reproducibility using 1H NMR spectroscopy (median ICC = 0.99). Postprandial metabolite concentrations revealed slightly higher ICC scores than fasting ones in short-term repeat measures (median ICC in postprandial and fasting metabolite concentrations 0.72 versus 0.67, Wilcoxon p-value = 8.0×10−14). Variability did not increase further in a long-term repeat measure, with median ICC in postprandial of 0.64 and in fasting metabolite concentrations 0.66. Conclusion Technical reproducibility is excellent. Biological reproducibility of postprandial metabolite concentrations showed a less or equal variability than fasting metabolite concentrations over time."

The Colombian Andes is a well-known hotspot for biodiversity, however, it also exhibit high levels of urbanization, making it a useful site to document how species assemblages respond to habitat transformation. To do this, we compared the structure and composition of bird assemblages between rural and urban habitats in Armenia, a medium sized city located in the Central Andes of Colombia. In addition, we examined the influence of urban characteristics on bird species diversity within the city of Armenia. From September 2016 to February 2017 we performed avian surveys in 76 cells (250 x 250 m each) embedded within Armenia city limits; and in 23 cells (250 x 250 m each) in rural areas around Armenia. We found that bird diversity was significantly lower in urban habitats than in rural habitats, and differed in species composition by 29%. In urban cells, with higher abiotic noise intensity and higher impervious surface area, we found lower bird diversity than that in urban cells with higher guadual (Guadua angustifolia patches), and forested surface areas. We did not find segregation of urban cells according to the species composition, although additional bird surveys inside urban forests remnant are needed to be more conclusive about this aspect. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of green areas embedded within cities to conserve bird diversity through reducing the ecological impact of urbanization on avian biodiversity."

A controlled experimental infection was performed and expression of immune-relevant genes in skin, gills, and spleen were recorded by qPCR at day 1 and 8 after parasite exposure. Infection induced a marked reaction involving regulation of innate and adaptive immune genes in rainbow trout at day 8 post-infection. The expression level of a total of 22 out of 24 investigated genes was significantly higher in gills compared to skin reflecting the more sensitive and delicate structure of gills. Especially pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 C1, regulatory cytokines IL-4/13A, IL-10, TGFβ, complement factor C5, chemokines CK10, CK12, acute phase proteins (precerebellin, hepcidin) and immunoglobulins (IgM, IgT) displayed differential expression levels. The spleen, a central immune organ with no trace of the parasite, showed elevated expression of IgM, IgT, complement factor C5 and chemokine CK10 (compared to skin and gills directly exposed to the parasite), indicating an interaction between the infected surface sites and central immune organs. This communication could be mediated by chemokines CK10 and CK12 and cytokine IL-4/13A and may at least partly explain the establishment of a systemic response in rainbow trout against the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2949463068,"Acinetobacter baumannii isolate NIPH 329 carries a novel capsular polysaccharide (CPS) gene cluster, designated KL46, that is closely related to the KL5 locus in A. baumannii isolate SDF but includes genes for synthesis of 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-non-2-ulosonic (di-N-acetylpseudaminic) acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) instead of the corresponding D-glycero-D-galacto isomer (di-N-acetyllegionaminic acid) (Leg5Ac7Ac). In agreement with the genetic content of KL46, chemical studies of the K46 CPS produced by NIPH 329 revealed a branched tetrasaccharide repeat (K unit) with an overall structure the same as K5 from SDF but with â-Pse5Ac7Ac replacing α-Leg5Ac7Ac. As for K5, the K46 unit begins with d-GalpNAc and includes α-d-GlcpNAc-(1→3)-d-GalpNAc and α-d-Galp-(1→6)-d-GlcpNAc linkages, formed by Gtr14 and Gtr15 glycosyltransferases, respectively. The Gtr94K46 glycosyltransferase, which is related to Gtr13K5, links Pse5Ac7Ac to d-Galp in the growing K unit via a â-(2→6) linkage. Nearly identical Wzy enzymes connect the K46 and K5 units via a α-D-GalpNAc-(1→3)-α-D-Galp linkage to form closely related CPSs. Both Pse5Ac7Ac in K46 and Leg5Ac7Ac in K5 are acetylated at O4 but no acetyltransferase gene is present in KL46 or KL5. Related acetyltransferases were found encoded in the NIPH 329 and SDF genomes, but not in other strains carrying an unacetylated Pse or Leg derivative in the CPS. The genes encoding the acetyltransferases were in different putative phage genomes. However, related acetyltransferases were rare among the >3000 publically available genome sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2952497563,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) plays an important role in regulating water exchange across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain-cerebrospinal fluid interface. Studies on AQP-4 knockout mice (AQP4-KO) have reported considerable protection from brain edema induced by acute water intoxication and ischemic stroke, identifying AQP4 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions. However, the long-term effects of chronic AQP4 suppression are yet to be elucidated. In the current study, we evaluated the physiological and structural changes in adult AQP4-KO mice using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemical analysis. Water exchange across BBB was assessed by tracking an intravenous bolus injection of oxygen-17 (17O) water (H217O) using 17O-MRI. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was quantified using arterial spin-labeling (ASL) MRI. Capillary density was determined by immunohistochemical staining for glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1). Compared to wildtype control mice, AQP4-KO mice showed a significant reduction in peak and steady-state H217O uptake despite unaltered CBF. Interestingly, a 22% increase in cortical capillary density was observed in AQP4-KO mice. These results suggest that increased cerebral vascularization may be an adaptive response to chronic reduction in water exchange across BBB in AQP4-KO mice."
https://openalex.org/W2952760161,"Background Sarcopenia, the presence of skeletal muscle mass depletion, can be objectively quantified, whereas subjective global assessment (SGA) is a widely utilized subjective instrument to assess nutritional status. Both the presence of sarcopenia and SGA-assessed malnutrition, in isolation, have been shown to be associated with worse overall survival in a wide range of cancers. However, there is no research evaluating the independent prognostic significance of both the presence of sarcopenia and malnutrition as part of the same analysis. We investigated the impact of sarcopenia on overall survival in colorectal cancer specifically controlling for malnutrition. Methods We examined a consecutive case series of 112 patients with colorectal cancer first seen at our institution between August 2012 and October 2017. Using computed tomography (CT) imaging, the cross-sectional area of muscles at the L3 vertebral level was measured and then divided by height squared to calculate skeletal muscle index (SMI). Sarcopenia was defined as SMI ≤38.5 cm2/m2 for women and ≤52.4 cm2/m2 for men. SGA assessments were completed within 2 weeks of CT imaging. The association of sarcopenia and malnutrition with overall survival was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results Median age at presentation was 53.3 years. Sixty-six (58.9%) patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis. Using SMI, 46 (41.1%) patients were sarcopenic, while 66 (58.9%) were non-sarcopenic. Using SGA, 69 (61.6%) patients were assessed as well-nourished, while 43 (38.4%) were malnourished. Of 69 patients classified as well-nourished by SGA, 22 (31.9%) were sarcopenic. Similarly, of 43 patients categorized as malnourished by SGA, 19 (44.2%) were non-sarcopenic. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, tumor stage, BMI, treatment history and SGA, patients with sarcopenia had 3 times greater risk of mortality compared to those without sarcopenia (p = 0.001). The median survival of patients with both sarcopenia and malnutrition (n = 24) was 14.6 months (95% CI: 10.5 to 18.6) compared to the median survival of 25.9 months (95% CI: 7.8 to 44.0) in patients who were either sarcopenic or malnourished but not both (n = 41; p = 0.001). The median survival of patients who were non-sarcopenic and well nourished (n = 48; p = 0.001) was 38.6 months (95% CI: 25.6 to 51.6). Conclusions The exploratory study suggests that presence of sarcopenia supersedes the presence of malnutrition as a predictor of survival in colorectal cancer. Co-existence of sarcopenia and malnutrition is associated with worse survival in colorectal cancer compared to just one of those conditions being present. Prospective studies with large sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2950040388,"Objective The aim of this study was to examine the incidence trends of type 1 diabetes diagnosed with ketoacidosis in Saxony, Germany from 1999 to 2016. Methods The population based Childhood Diabetes Registry of Saxony comprising valid data for all children aged 0–14 years diagnosed with type 1 diabetes from1999 to 2016 were used for the analyses. Direct age-standardized incidence rates were calculated and the effects of age, sex, calendar year, home districts and family history of any types of diabetes on the incidence were modelled using Poisson regression. Trend analyses for standard rate ratios of children with moderate and severe diabetic ketoacidosis versus children with type 1 diabetes with non-diabetic ketoacidosis were performed using join point regression. Results The rate of ketoacidosis at the time of the type 1 diabetes diagnosis was high with 35.2% during the entire observation period in Saxony. The Poisson regression analysis indicated a statistically significant increased occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis for younger age-groups, but no statistically significant differences between boys and girls. The join point trend analyses show that the proportion of severe and moderate ketoacidosis is increasing disproportionally to the increase in incidence of type 1 diabetes over the years. Conclusion Due to the observed increasing incidence of diabetes as well of diabetic ketoacidosis, an educational prevention campaign is needed in Saxony as soon as possible to aid pediatricians, general physicians as well as general public to identify the early signs of type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2951371265,"Volitional control of breathing often leads to excessive ventilation (hyperventilation) among untrained individuals, which disrupts CO2 homeostasis and may elicit a set of undesirable symptoms. The present study investigated whether seven days of training without any anti-hyperventilation instructions improves CO2 homeostasis during paced breathing at a frequency of 0.1 Hz (6 breaths/minute). Furthermore, the present study investigated the effects of training on breathing-related changes in affective state to examine the hypothesis that training improves the influence of slow paced breathing on affect. A total of 16 participants performed ten minutes of paced breathing every day for seven days. Partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2), symptoms of hyperventilation, affective state (before and after breathing), and pleasantness of the task were measured on the first, fourth, and seventh days of training. Results showed that the drop in PetCO2 significantly decreased with training and none of the participants experienced a drop in PetCO2 below 30 mmHg by day seven of training (except one participant who already had PetCO2 below 30 mmHg during baseline), in comparison to 37.5% of participants on the first day. Paced breathing produced hyperventilation symptoms of mild intensity which did not decrease with training. This suggests that some participants still experienced a drop of PetCO2 that was deep enough to produce noticeable symptoms. Affective state was shifted towards calmness and relaxation during the second and third laboratory measurements, but not during the first measurement. Additionally, the breathing task was perceived as more pleasant during subsequent laboratory measurements. The obtained results showed that training paced breathing at 0.1 Hz led to decrease in hyperventilation. Furthermore, the present study suggests that training paced breathing is necessary to make the task more pleasant and relaxing."
https://openalex.org/W2950364264,"Purpose High density lipoprotein (HDL) protects against myocardial infarction via mechanisms that remain unclear. STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) plays a key role in HDL-induced cardioprotection. In the heart, microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in ischemia reperfusion injury. We therefore investigated whether the cardioprotective effect of HDL modulates miRNAs as a downstream target of STAT3 activation. Methods STAT3 cardiomyocyte deficient mice (STAT3-KO) and wildtype littermates (STAT3-WT) were submitted to left coronary ligature and reperfused (IR) with or without injection of HDL. Infarct size (IS) was determined and cardiac miRNA expression was evaluated after reperfusion in sham, IR and IR+HDL hearts by microarray analysis. In vitro, neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were submitted to hypoxia with or without HDL incubation. Cell viability and miRNA expression were analysed. Results In vivo, HDL reduced IS from 40.5±4.3% to 24.4±2.1% (p<0.05) in STAT3-WT mice. HDL failed to protect in STAT3-KO mice. In STAT3-WT mice, both miR-34b and miR-337 were increased in IR compared to sham and IR+HDL groups (p<0.05). These miRNAs were not modulated in STAT3-KO mice. In vitro, incubation with HDL improved cell viability against hypoxia (p<0.05). The expression of miR-34b and miR-337 was increased by hypoxia and reduced by HDL treatment (p<0.05). In cardiomyocytes transfected with miRNA mimics, HDL failed to improve cell viability against hypoxia. Conclusions Our study, performed both in vivo and in vitro, delineates a novel cardioprotective signalling pathway activated by HDL, involving STAT3-mediated decrease of miR-34b and miR-337 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2952448336,"Background The widely established treatment for psychosis is long-term antipsychotic medication. However, many people stop taking this treatment, and request other options. There are also growing concerns about adverse effects, but currently no professional guidelines to support reducing or stopping these drugs. The views and experiences of individual mental health professionals around reducing and stopping antipsychotics are therefore crucial in treatment decisions. Methods We conducted 7 focus groups with prescribing psychiatrists and other members of community-based statutory mental health services in London. Participants discussed their views about, experiences, and processes of antipsychotic reduction and discontinuation. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Participants acknowledged that antipsychotics can have severe adverse effects. They were generally supportive of trying to reduce these drugs to the lowest effective dose, although stopping antipsychotics was less acceptable. Prior experiences of adverse events after reduction or discontinuation meant that both were approached with caution. Reduction was also reported to be hampered by organisational and knowledge barriers. Lack of resources, pressure to discharge, and poor continuity of care were seen as organisational barriers. Knowledge barriers included inadequate evidence about who might be best suited to reduction, and lack of guidance about how this could be done safely. This meant that reduction was often prompted by patients, and sometimes actively discouraged, and stability with maintenance treatment was often favoured. Conclusions Concerns about risk and other barriers means that clinicians are often reluctant to implement reduction or discontinuation of antipsychotic medication. In order to increase the treatment options available to service users, more research and guidance on how to minimise the risks of antipsychotic reduction and discontinuation is required to enable clinicians to engage more constructively with service users requests, offering people more choice and control in managing their mental health condition."
https://openalex.org/W2949816820,"Testicular or ovotesticular disorders of sex development (DSD) in individuals with female karyotype (XX) lacking the SRY gene has been observed in several mammalian species, including dogs. A genetic background for this abnormality has been extensively sought, and the region harboring the SOX9 gene has often been considered key in canine DSD. Three types of polymorphism have been studied in this region to date: a) copy number variation (CNV) in a region about 400 kb upstream of SOX9, named CNVR1; b) duplication of SOX9; and c) insertion of a single G-nucleotide (rs852549625) approximately 2.2 Mb upstream of SOX9. The aim of this study was thus to comprehensively analyze these polymorphisms in a large multibreed case-control cohort containing 45 XX DSD dogs, representing 23 breeds. The control set contained 57 fertile females. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to study CNVR1 and the duplication of SOX9. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to visualize copy numbers on a cellular level. The Sanger sequencing approach was performed to analyze the region harboring the G-insertion. We confirmed that CNVR1 is highly polymorphic and that copy numbers varied between 0 and 7 in the case and control cohorts. Interestingly, the number of copies was significantly higher (P = 0.038) in XX DSD dogs (mean = 2.7) than in the control females (mean = 2.0) but not in all studied breeds. Duplication of the SOX9 gene was noted only in a single XX DSD dog (an American Bully), which had three copies of SOX9. Distribution of the G-nucleotide insertion was similar in the XX DSD (frequency 0.20) and control (frequency 0.14) cohorts. Concluding, our study showed that CNVR1, located upstream of SOX9, is associated with the XX DSD phenotype, though in a breed-specific manner. Duplication of the SOX9 gene is a rare cause of this disorder in dogs. Moreover, we did not observe any association of G-insertion with the DSD phenotype. We assume that the genetic background of XX DSD can be different in certain breeds."
https://openalex.org/W2950862360,"Cholera toxin (CT) travels by vesicle carriers from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the catalytic A1 subunit of CT (CTA1) dissociates from the rest of the toxin, unfolds, and moves through a membrane-spanning translocon pore to reach the cytosol. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) binds to the N-terminal region of CTA1 and facilitates its ER-to-cytosol export by refolding the toxin as it emerges at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane. HSP90 also refolds some endogenous cytosolic proteins as part of a foldosome complex containing heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (HSC70) and the HSC70/HSP90-organizing protein (HOP) linker that anchors HSP90 to HSC70. We accordingly predicted that HSC70 and HOP also function in CTA1 translocation. Inactivation of HSC70 by drug treatment disrupted CTA1 translocation to the cytosol and generated a toxin-resistant phenotype. In contrast, the depletion of HOP did not disrupt CT activity against cultured cells. HSC70 and HSP90 could bind independently to disordered CTA1, even in the absence of HOP. This indicated HSP90 and HSC70 recognize distinct regions of CTA1, which was confirmed by the identification of a YYIYVI-binding motif for HSC70 that spans residues 83–88 of the 192-amino acid CTA1 polypeptide. Refolding of disordered CTA1 occurred in the presence of HSC70 alone, indicating that HSC70 and HSP90 can each independently refold CTA1. Our work suggests a novel translocation mechanism in which sequential interactions with HSP90 and HSC70 drive the N- to C-terminal extraction of CTA1 from the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2951956466,"By utilizing cognitive mapping and leveraging georeferenced text data, this paper aims to suggest a new visualization method that combines the advantages of both conventional and state-of-the-art research techniques to depict the collective identity of place in a single image. The study addressed two research questions: (1) Can crowd-sourced text data be utilized in representing place identity? (2) Can collective place identity be expressed in the form of a cognitive map? By confirming that text data gathered from social media effectively demonstrate people’s behaviors and perceptions related to places, we propose a novel method to create a visual representation of urban identity–a “crowd-sourced cognitive map”. In particular, to improve the conventional cognitive mapping method to depict the collective identity of a city, we draw cognitive maps of Bundang and Ilsan developed in the 1990s, as well as Songdo and Dongtan developed in the 2000s, just outside of the administrative boundaries of Seoul in Korea, through a computational method based on crowd-sourced opinions collected from social media. We open the possibility for the use of social media text data to capture the identity of cities and suggest a graphical image through which people without prior information could also easily apprehend the overall image of a city. The work in this paper is expected to provide a methodological technique for appropriate decision-making and the evaluation of urban identity to shape a more unique and imageable city."
https://openalex.org/W2950399583,"Background TB persists despite being relatively easy to detect and cure because the journey from the onset of symptoms to cure involves a series of steps, with patients being lost to follow-up at each stage and delays occurring among patients not lost to follow-up. One cause of drop-off and delay occurs when patients delay or avoid returning to clinic to get their test results and start treatment. Methods We fielded two SMS interventions in three Cape Town clinics to see their effects on whether people returned to clinic, and how quickly. One was a simple reminder; the other aimed to overcome “optimism bias” by reminding people TB is curable and many millions die unnecessarily from it. Recruits were randomly assigned at the clinic level to a control group or one of the two SMS groups (1:2:2). In addition to estimating effects on the full sample, we also estimated effects on HIV-positive patients. Results SMS recipients were more likely to return to clinic in the requested two days than the control group. The effect was smaller in the intent-to-treat analysis (52/101 or 51.5% vs. 251/405 or 62.0%, p = 0.05) than in the per-protocol analysis (50/97 or 51.5% vs. 204/318 or 64.2%, p = 0.03). The effect was larger among HIV-positives (10/35 or 28.6% vs. 97/149 or 65.1%, p<0.01). The effects of SMS messages diminished as the interval increased: significant effects at the 5% level were found at five and 10 days only among HIV-positives. The second SMS message had larger effects, albeit not significantly larger, likely due in part to lack of statistical power. Conclusions At 2 U.S. cents per message, SMS reminders are an inexpensive option to encourage TB testers to return to clinic, especially when worded to counter optimism bias."

Secondly, to provide information about the influence of swim style, distance, sex, status, country, years of high-level competition (YHLC) and age in swimmer's performance.Data was obtained from International Federation of Swimming (FINA) regarding the participants 2006-2017 of junior and senior World Championships (WCs). The final filtered database included 4076 swimmers after removing those participating only in junior WCs.Cramer V coefficient, double and triple-entry tables were used to measure the relationship between the positions occupied in junior and senior phases. A One-Way ANOVA analysis was used to explain the variables time and rank between swimmers who participated in junior and senior WC or just in senior in all the distances and swim styles (SS). A univariate general linear model (GLM) was used to examine the association between time/rank and category (swimmers that participated previously in junior WC or not); YHLC; country; status (highest finishing position: final/semi-final/heats) and age.Significant differences (p < .001) were found in the GLM, with Rank as dependent variable, for all the variables. Showing that swimmers that participated previously in junior categories obtained greater results in all the interactions, except in 1500m freestyle. Significant differences (p < .001) were found between the variables position and YHLC, showing the variable position improvements as swimmers attended more WCs.Competing in junior WC has a positive influence in achieve posteriori success in FINA WC. YHLC have a positive impact to achieve better positions."
https://openalex.org/W2951005215,"In contrast to mammals, retinal ganglion cells (RGC) axons of the optic nerve even in mature zebrafish exhibit a remarkable capacity for spontaneous regeneration. One constraint of using adult zebrafish is the limited ability to visualize the regeneration process in live animals. To dynamically visualize and trace the degree of target specific optic nerve regeneration, we took advantage of the optical transparency still preserved in post developmental larval zebrafish. We developed a rapid and robust assay to physically transect the larval optic nerve and find that by 96 hours post injury RGC axons have robustly regrown onto the optic tectum. We observe functional regeneration by 8 days post injury, and demonstrate that similar to adult zebrafish, optic nerve transection in larval zebrafish does not prominently induce cell death or proliferation of RGC neurons. Furthermore, we find that partial optic nerve transection results in axonal growth predominantly to the original, contralateral tectum, while complete transection results in innervation of both the correct contralateral and ‘incorrect’ ipsilateral tectum. Axonal tracing reveals that although regenerating axons innervate the ‘incorrect’ ipsilateral tectum, they successfully target their topographically appropriate synaptic areas. Combined, our results validate post developmental larval zebrafish as a powerful model for optic nerve regeneration, and reveal intricate mechanistic differences between axonal growth, midline guidance and synaptic targeting during zebrafish optic nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2951326062,"The concept of 'patient experience' has become central to how to improve healthcare. Remote communication with patients is today a frequent practice in healthcare services, showing similar outcomes to standard outpatient care while enabling cost reduction in both formal and informal care. The purpose of this study was to analyse the experiences of people with telemonitoring pacemakers.Patients were randomly allocated to either the telemonitoring or hospital monitoring follow-ups. Using the 'Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire' (GS-PEQ), as well as an ad-hoc survey from the 'telehealth patient satisfaction survey' and 'costs survey', patients' experiences were measured six months after the pacemaker implant in a cohort of 50 consecutive patients. The mean age was 74.8 (± 11.75) years and 26 (52%) patients were male of which 1 was lost in follow-up. Finally, 24 patients were followed up with standard hospital monitoring, while 25 used the telemonitoring system. Differences in baseline characteristics between groups were not found.Findings showed overall positive and similar experiences in patients living with telemonitoring and hospital monitoring pacemakers. Significant differences were found in GS-PEQ concerning how telemonitoring patients received less information about their diagnosis/afflictions (p = 0.046). We did not find significant differences in other items such as 'confidence in the clinicians' professional skills', 'treatment perception adapted to their situation', 'involvement in decisions regarding the treatment', 'perception of hospital organisation', 'waiting before admission', 'satisfaction of help and treatment received', 'benefit received', and 'incorrect treatment'.The remote communication of pacemakers was met with positive levels of patients' experiences similarly to patients in the hospital monitoring follow-up. However, telemonitoring patients received less information. Thus, improving the quality and timing of information is required in telemonitoring patients in the planning and organisation of future remote communication healthcare services for people living with a pacemaker implant."
https://openalex.org/W2952346505,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) is the most common and effective weight loss procedure for severe obesity. However, a significant increase in addictive behaviors and new-onset substance use disorder (SUD) are sometimes observed post-surgery. The endogenous opioid system is known to play a major role in motivated behavior and reward, as well as the abuse of substances, including alcohol, tobacco, opioids and highly palatable foods. Here, we examined the effects of RYGB on mu-opioid receptor levels in the brain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four groups: standard diet with sham surgery (control), ad libitum high-energy high-fat (HF) diet with sham surgery, calorie restricted HF diet with sham surgery (Sham-FR), or HF diet with RYGB surgery. Control and HF groups were fed their respective diets for 8 weeks, with surgery performed on the eighth week. After 9 weeks on their respective diets post-surgery, animals were sacrificed for mu-opioid receptor autoradiography using the [3H] [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4-Gly5-ol]- enkephalin (DAMGO) ligand. Rats with RYGB showed reduced DAMGO binding in the central amygdala compared to sham-operated HF diet controls, and in the hypothalamus compared to high-fat fed Sham-FR. Diet alone did not change [3H] DAMGO binding in any region. These findings show that RYGB surgery, independent of diet or caloric restriction, decreases mu opioid signaling in specific regions important for stress and energy regulation. Thus, RYGB surgery may lead to greater stress sensitivity via downregulated mu opioid signaling in the central amygdala, which may contribute to the observed increased risk in some subjects for addictive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2952903368,"Failures in control of tan spot of pyrethrum, caused by Didymella tanaceti, has been associated with decreased sensitivity within the pathogen population to the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide boscalid. Sequencing the SdhB, SdhC, and SdhD subunits of isolates with resistant and sensitive phenotypes identified 15 mutations, resulting in three amino acid substitutions in the SdhB (H277Y/R, I279V), six in the SdhC (S73P, G79R, H134R, H134Q, S135R and combined H134Q/S135R), and two in the SdhD (D112E, H122R). In vitro testing of their boscalid response and estimation of resistance factors (RF) identified isolates with wild-type (WT) Sdh genotypes were sensitive to boscalid. Isolates with SdhB-I279V, SdhC-H134Q and SdhD-D112E exhibited moderate resistance phenotypes (10 ≥ RF < 100) and isolates with SdhC-H134R exhibited very high resistance phenotypes (RF ≥ 1000). All other substitutions were associated with high resistance phenotypes (100 ≥ RF < 1000). High-resolution melt assays were designed and used to estimate the frequencies of substitutions in four field populations (n = 774) collected in August (pre-boscalid application) and November (post-boscalid application) 2012. The SdhB-H277Y, SdhC-H134R and SdhB-H277R genotypes were most frequently observed across populations at 56.7, 19.0, and 10.3%, respectively. In August 92.9% of D. tanaceti contained a substitution associated with decreased sensitivity. Following boscalid application, this increased to 98.9%, with no WT isolates detected in three fields. Overlaying previously obtained microsatellite and mating-type data revealed that all ten recurrent substitutions were associated with multiple genotypes. Thus, boscalid insensitivity in D. tanaceti appears widespread and not associated with clonal spread of a limited pool of individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2952945254,"While potassium fertilization increases growth yield in Brazilian eucalyptus plantations, it could also increase water requirements, making trees more vulnerable to drought. Sodium fertilization, which has been shown to promote eucalyptus growth compared to K-deficient trees, could partially mitigate this adverse effect of potassium. However, little is known about the influence of K and Na fertilization on the tree metabolic response to water deficit. The aim of the present study was thus to analyze the transcriptome of leaves sampled from Eucalyptus grandis trees subjected to 37% rainfall reduction, and fertilized with potassium (K), sodium (Na), compared to control trees (C). The multifactorial experiment was set up in a field with a throughfall exclusion system. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on leaves from two-year-old trees, and data analyzed using multifactorial statistical analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Significant sets of genes were seen to respond to rainfall reduction, in interaction with K or Na fertilization, or to fertilization only (regardless of the water supply regime). The genes were involved in stress signaling, primary and secondary metabolism, secondary cell wall formation and photosynthetic activity. Our focus on key genes related to cation transporters and aquaporins highlighted specific regulation of ion homeostasis, and plant adjustment to water deficit. While water availability significantly affects the transcriptomic response of eucalyptus species, this study points out that the transcriptomic response is highly dependent on the fertilization regime. Our study is based on the first large-scale field trial in a tropical region, specifically designed to study the interaction between water availability and nutrition in eucalyptus. To our knowledge, this is the first global transcriptomic analysis to compare the influence of K and Na fertilization on tree adaptive traits in water deficit conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2952973708,"There is limited evidence on the effect of exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) in non-smoking pregnant mothers and infant health. We assessed the effects of maternal antenatal exposure to SHS on infant growth rate, and secondarily, on birth weight, birth length and head circumference at birth.In this prospective cohort, 305 mother-infant pairs were studied. Mothers filled out questionnaires about exposure to SHS in pregnancy at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Infant anthropometry was performed at birth, day 7, and months 1, 2, 4, and 6, postnatally. Linear mixed modeling and linear regression were used to calculate growth rates over the first 6 months. The association between SHS-exposure with growth rate and birth sizes was assessed using multivariate linear regression adjusted for confounders, with SHS as both number of cigarettes and as groups (no exposure, SHS < 23 cigarettes, SHS ≥ 23 cigarettes).Seventy-three mothers were not exposed and 232 were exposed. SHS exposure (per cigarette) was not related to gain in weight, length, head circumference, and weight for length. However, infants born to mothers exposed to ≥ 23 cigarettes/d had lower head circumference gain (-0.32 mm/m, 95% CI -0.60, -0.03) than those born to non-exposed mothers. SHS exposure (per cigarette) was not related to birth weight, length, and head circumference, but exposure to ≥ 23 cigarettes was related to lower head circumference at birth (-11.09 mm, -20.03, -2.16).Heavy antenatal exposure to SHS in non-smoking mothers results in reduced neonatal head circumference at birth and head circumference gain over the first 6 months of life. Our findings show no clear relations between exposure to SHS during pregnancy and other markers of neonatal growth and birth size."

Nervous system development involves two phases: a generative phase, during which neurons differentiate and extend processes, and a regressive phase involving removal of surplus neurons and pruning of inappropriate connections, in some cases through activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic processes (Luo and O’Leary, 2005Luo L.

Caspase activity has also been implicated in neuronal death in some neurodegenerative diseases (Friedlander, 2003Friedlander R.M. Apoptosis and caspases in neurodegenerative diseases.N. Engl. J.

However, global inhibition of apoptosis can also lead to cancer (Ambrosini et al., 1997Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. A novel anti-apoptosis gene, survivin, expressed in cancer and lymphoma.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar), so a neuron-specific approach to blocking apoptosis could be a more attractive strategy to target neurodegeneration. Caspase-dependent degeneration of neuronal extensions has been observed across species, with caspase-3 (CASP3) as the major effector (Unsain and Barker, 2015Unsain N. Barker P.A.

The finding that neuronal CASP3 activation results in degeneration in some settings, but not others, suggests the existence of specialized downstream effectors regulating pathway outcomes. This motivated us to search for such effectors, whether activators or inhibitors. A powerful model of caspase-dependent axon degeneration is the elimination of tropomyosin receptor kinase A positive (TRKA+) sensory axons driven by local competition for a limiting supply of the TRKA ligand nerve growth factor (NGF) (Saxena and Caroni, 2007Saxena S. Caroni P. Mechanisms of axon degeneration: from development to disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2007; 83: 174-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Trophic factor (NGF) deprivation (TD) of TRKA+ neurons initiates a cascade leading to activation of CASP3, which in turn triggers a further cascade leading to activation of terminal proteases of the calpain family and dismantling of cellular architecture (Schoenmann et al., 2010Schoenmann Z.

In other systems, proteins that are themselves cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (e.g., PARP or ROCK) participate in the apoptotic process (Boulares et al., 1999Boulares A.H. Yakovlev A.G. Ivanova V. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M. Role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in apoptosis.

Barkan D.T. Sali A. Burlingame A.L. Wells J.A. Global sequencing of proteolytic cleavage sites in apoptosis by specific labeling of protein N termini.Cell. 2008; 134: 866-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) in TRKA+ axons after TD and to test them for involvement in degeneration. Here, we report a role for the neuronally enriched protein RUFY3. Rufy3 loss of function dramatically delays axonal degeneration without blocking CASP3 activation, positioning RUFY3 as an effector of degeneration downstream of, or in parallel to, caspase activation in neurons. We identified newly cleaved proteins in TRKA+ dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-derived sensory axons after TD by detecting de novo peptides via labeling of N termini, followed by purification of labeled peptides and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis (degradomics; Mahrus et al., 2008Mahrus S. Trinidad J.C. Barkan D.T. Sali A. Burlingame A.L. Wells J.A. Global sequencing of proteolytic cleavage sites in apoptosis by specific labeling of protein N termini.Cell. 2008; 134: 866-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To obtain sufficient material, we developed a large-scale culture technique for isolation of milligram quantities of protein from both TRKA+ axon preparations (histone H3 negative) and cell body (soma) preparations (histone H3 positive; Figures 1A–1C and S1A–S1C). Using custom-made silicone dividers, we plated DRG cells from several mouse embryos (∼2 million cells) in a linear array on 10-cm tissue culture dishes (Figure 1A). After a 14-day culture period with NGF, caspase-mediated degeneration was induced by withdrawal of NGF for 24 or 48 h—time points when active CASP3 (cCASP3) can be detected by immunoblotting (Figures 1C and S1B). Newly cleaved proteins were labeled by subtiligase labeling of N termini with a biotin containing peptide ester (Figure 1B), visualized by immunoblotting for biotin (Figures 1C and S1C), and isolated by streptavidin enrichment. Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease was used to release purified peptides, and eluates were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (detailed protocol in Data S1). Application of this approach to axon and soma lysates yielded over 915 putative cleavage targets enriched after TD (Table S1). To narrow the range of candidates, we focused on those that are putative caspase cleavage targets (i.e., in which cleavage occurs immediately following an aspartate residue; p − 1 = D). Interestingly, in axons, the most abundant de novo peptides were formed from cleavages immediately following an aspartate, but in soma, we observed a more diverse set of cleavage patterns (Figures S1D and S1E). We identified 44 putative caspase targets in axons, including 30 detected consistently, i.e., each time in triplicate samples in two experiments (number in brackets indicates relative peptide counts): TBA1B (11); RUFY3 (6); AP180, AP2A2, BASP1, CLOCK, E9PYB0, MRP, NDRG1, PRUN2, and UBE20 (5); CEND1, EIF5A, HUWE1, OSBL3, SQSTM1, TMTM30A, and USP5 (4); and CAML, EPB41l3, PRS6A, PRS8, RIMS3, SEP11, STXB1, TPRGL, TRPM7, UBP14, UCHL1, and VAPA (3). For a subset, we confirmed that full-length protein levels decreased upon TD (Figures S1F and S1G). To assess the contribution of these 30 proteins to axonal degeneration, we first employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to determine whether deleting their genes resulted in either acceleration or inhibition of degeneration. Each gene was targeted using 5 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (Morgens et al., 2016Morgens D.W. Deans R.M. Li A. Bassik M.C. Systematic comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi screens for essential genes.Nat.

As a control, we used sgRNAs targeting Bax, a known regulator of axon degeneration upstream of caspase signaling (Nikolaev et al., 2009Nikolaev A. McLaughlin T. O’Leary D.D.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. APP binds DR6 to trigger axon pruning and neuron death via distinct caspases.Nature. 2009; 457: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), which protected axons fully, as assessed by axonal ATP levels (Figure 1D). None of the targets tested, when knocked out, resulted in acceleration of degeneration (data not shown). However, knockout of one of them, RUN- and FYVE-domain-containing protein 3 (Rufy3) (Wei et al., 2014Wei Z. Sun M. Liu X. Zhang J. Jin Y. Rufy3, a protein specifically expressed in neurons, interacts with actin-bundling protein Fascin to control the growth of axons.J. Neurochem. 2014; 130: 678-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), had a potent inhibitory effect, preserving axonal ATP levels to a similar extent as deletion of Bax (Figure 1D). RUFY3 contains a RUN and a coiled-coil domain (Figure 1E) and has been implicated in regulating neuronal polarity and axonal growth (Honda et al., 2017aHonda A. Ito Y. Takahashi-Niki K. Matsushita N.

Neurochem. 2014; 130: 678-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When sgRNAs were tested individually, Rufy3 sgRNA #4 (sg4(Rufy3)) was the most strongly protective, as assessed by preservation of ATP levels and TUJ1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the protection was long lasting (Figure 1F; data not shown). Similar protection was observed using Rufy3-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Figures S1H–S1J; Table S2). To control for non-specific effects, we used a knockout-replacement strategy in neurons in which endogenous Rufy3 was eliminated with sg4(Rufy3) while simultaneously expressing a variant of Rufy3 made guide resistant (gr) by modifying the NGG target of sg4 to include a silent mutation. Expression of gr-Rufy3 restored degeneration in presence of sg4(Rufy3) (Figure 1G), consistent with a specific effect of sg4. Definitive confirmation of RUFY3 involvement was obtained using Rufy3 knockout mice (allele Tm1b, in which exon 5 is removed; Figure S1K). Neurons from Rufy3Tm1b/Tm1b embryos, but not heterozygous littermates, were strongly resistant to TD-induced axon degeneration (Figure 1H). Importantly, Rufy3 knockout had no effect on degeneration induced by axotomy (i.e., Wallerian degeneration; Figures S1L and S1M), which is caspase independent (Simon et al., 2012Simon D.J. Weimer R.M. McLaughlin T. Kallop D. Stanger K. Yang J. O’Leary D.D.M. Hannoush R.N. Tessier-Lavigne M. A caspase cascade regulating developmental axon degeneration.J.

The proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are not involved in Wallerian degeneration.Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 260-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results position RUFY3 specifically in the caspase-dependent degeneration pathway. Analysis of extracts from axons and soma at various time points following NGF withdrawal showed that knockout of Rufy3 does not impact the known decrease in AKT phosphorylation after TD (Figures 2A and S2A), a proximal signaling event that occurs just downstream of TRKA (Simon et al., 2016Simon D.J. Pitts J. Hertz N.T. Yang J. Yamagishi Y. Olsen O. Tešić Mark M. Molina H. Tessier-Lavigne M. Axon degeneration gated by retrograde activation of somatic pro-apoptotic signaling.Cell. 2016; 164: 1031-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Downstream of AKT dephosphorylation, transcription of Puma activates a somatically derived pro-degenerative signal (Simon et al., 2016Simon D.J. Pitts J. Hertz N.T. Yang J. Yamagishi Y. Olsen O.

Axon degeneration gated by retrograde activation of somatic pro-apoptotic signaling.Cell. 2016; 164: 1031-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Rufy3 knockout did not prevent robust expression of PUMA (Figures S2C and S2D), suggesting that RUFY3 also functions downstream of somatic PUMA. PUMA induction by TD leads to activation of a classical caspase cascade in the axon, starting with activation of proapoptotic Bax, leading to activation of CASP9, which in turn activates CASP3 (Simon et al., 2012Simon D.J. Weimer R.M. McLaughlin T. Kallop D. Stanger K. Yang J. O’Leary D.D.M. Hannoush R.N. Tessier-Lavigne M. A caspase cascade regulating developmental axon degeneration.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17540-17553Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the crystal structure of the RUN domain of RUFY3 indicates that it has structural (but not sequence) homology with the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of APAF1 (Kukimoto-Niino et al., 2006Kukimoto-Niino M. Takagi T. Akasaka R. Murayama K. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Terada T. Inoue M. Watanabe S. Tanaka A. Hayashizaki Y. et al.Crystal structure of the RUN domain of the RAP2-interacting protein x.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31843-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which functions in the caspase-cascade between Bax and CASP9 (Simon et al., 2016Simon D.J. Pitts J. Hertz N.T. Yang J. Yamagishi Y. Olsen O. Tešić Mark M. Molina H. Tessier-Lavigne M. Axon degeneration gated by retrograde activation of somatic pro-apoptotic signaling.Cell. 2016; 164: 1031-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To examine whether loss of Rufy3 alters activation of CASP9 or CASP3 following TD, we first probed lysates of soma and axons from Rufy3Tm1b/Tm1b neurons. Compared to wild-type, the levels of cleaved, active CASP9 (cCASP9) were not markedly altered, as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Figure 2B). Cleaved, active CASP3 (cCASP3) was also readily detected, albeit at a somewhat reduced level compared to controls (total CASP3 protein levels before TD were unaffected; Figures 2A, 2B, and S2E). Activation of cCASP3 in axons after TD was confirmed by IHC in Rufy3Tm1b/Tm1b neurons (Figure 2C) and in wild-type neurons infected with sg4(Rufy3) (Figure 2D). Bax sgRNA, a positive control, blocked cCASP3 appearance, as expected (Figure 2D). Both Rufy3 and Bax sgRNAs preserved axon morphology (Figure 2D) and ATP levels (Figure 2E). To directly quantify levels of CASP3 activity in axons, we utilized caspase 3 and 7 glo, which measures DEVDase activity (and appears in these neurons to be due largely to cCASP3; data not shown). Consistent with the levels of cCASP3 seen by immunoblot, axonal lysates from sg4(Rufy3)-treated neurons after TD showed substantial DEVDase activity that was about half that seen in controls; Bax sgRNA fully abolished DEVDase induction, as expected (Figure 2F). Consistent with activation of CASP3 in Rufy3-deficient neurons after TD, cleavage of the CASP3 targets alpha II spectrin (SPTAN1) and calpastatin (CSTN) was also observed, albeit at reduced levels—consistent with the reduction in cCASP3 (Figure S2E). Collectively, these results show that loss of Rufy3 does not prevent activation of CASP3, which in turn acts on proteolytic substrates like SPTAN1 and CSTN, yet degeneration is blocked, as evidenced by preservation of ATP levels and of targets of terminal protease (calpain) activity, including neurofilament medium chain (NF-M) and light chain (NF-L) (Figures 2A, 2B, 2E, S2A, and S2B). Loss of Rufy3 does cause a partial reduction (by about half) in the level of cCASP3 (but not cCASP9) after TD, which could reflect a direct or indirect effect (see Discussion), but this level is expected to be sufficient for degeneration (Simon et al., 2012Simon D.J. Weimer R.M. McLaughlin T. Kallop D. Stanger K. Yang J. O’Leary D.D.M. Hannoush R.N. Tessier-Lavigne M. A caspase cascade regulating developmental axon degeneration.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17540-17553Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Unsain et al., 2013Unsain N. Higgins J.M. Parker K.N. Johnstone A.D. Barker P.A. XIAP regulates caspase activity in degenerating axons.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2013Yang J. Weimer R.M. Kallop D.

Regulation of axon degeneration after injury and in development by the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1175-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, RUFY3 is required for degeneration downstream of, or in parallel to, cCASP3. Because we identified RUFY3 in a screen for proteins cleaved after TD, and because the proteolytic site we identified is a putative caspase cleavage site, we examined whether loss of Casp3 affects its cleavage. In control cultures, the levels of intact RUFY3 and NF-L were significantly reduced at 24 h and undetectable at 48 h following TD in lysates from both soma and axons, whereas in cultures from Casp3−/− mice, loss of both was significantly delayed, though not completely blocked (Figures 3A and S3A). Thus, CASP3 is important for timely degradation of RUFY3, but there must be an additional protease(s) for RUFY3. We next turned to cell lysates. Curiously, addition of purified cCASP3 caused complete loss of RUFY3 (and CSTN) in lysates derived from soma, but not axons; in contrast, SPTAN1 was completely cleaved in both lysates, showing that added cCASP3 is active in both (Figure 3B). This suggested that RUFY3 (and CSTN) is differentially modified such that in soma, but not axons, it is cleavable by CASP3; alternatively, soma lysates could contain an activator needed for cleavage or axonal lysates an inhibitor of cleavage. In support of differential modification, RUFY3 immunoprecipitated from soma, but not axon lysates, was degraded by cCASP3 (Figure 3C). Further support was obtained by mixing soma and axon lysates. Addition of cCASP3 to the mix gave an intermediate effect, with partial degradation of RUFY3 (and CSTN) that fits with the possibility that only RUFY3 (and CSTN) derived from soma, not axons, is susceptible to degradation (Figures S3B and S3C). Interestingly, when active CASP3 was added to purified recombinant RUFY3 generated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (which are non-neuronal) or via in vitro translation, it caused only a small shift in molecular weight (Figure S3D), suggesting that, unlike RUFY3 expressed in neurons, those forms of recombinant RUFY3 are not appropriately modified for full degradation by CASP3. To search for possible modifications of RUFY3, we again turned to mass spectrometry. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) coupled with stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang G. Deinhardt K. Neubert T.A. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cultured primary neurons.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1188: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was used to identify differences in RUFY3 phosphorylation state between axons and soma. Interestingly, serine 34 was phosphorylated in axons, but not soma; after TD, the phosphorylation level in axons decreased substantially, whereas RUFY3 in soma remained unphosphorylated (Figures 3D and S3E). To probe the effect of phosphorylation at S34, we expressed gr-Rufy3 phospho mutants in the presence of sg4(Rufy3) and immunoprecipitated these mutants from soma and axon lysates. The phospho-resistant serine-to-alanine mutation at position 34 (S34A) was sensitive to addition of active CASP3, whereas a phospho-mimetic serine-to-aspartate mutant (S34D) was fully resistant (Figure 3E), suggesting that dephosphorylation of S34 is required for RUFY3 degradation triggered by active CASP3. Importantly, in presence of sg4(Rufy3) to remove endogenous Rufy3, both gr-RUFY3WT and gr-RUFY3S34A were able to rescue RUFY3 function as assessed by TUJ1 immunoreactivity, ATP depletion, and DEVDase activity, whereas gr-RUFYS34D was not (Figures 3F–3H), suggesting that dephosphorylation of RUFY3 at S34 is required for its function. We note that rescue by gr-Rufy3WT and gr-Rufy3S34A was very strong, but not complete (Figures 3H and 3I), perhaps because of incomplete rescue of protein levels and/or slight impairment of function by the S34A mutation. The overexpression of gr-Rufy3 also led to a second, longer band (Figure 3J), suggesting two forms of RUFY3: one fully processed as with sg-Control and another partially processed; both were dramatically reduced following TD. Finally, mutations to the other previously reported phosphorylation sites (T5, T12, S27 S49, T51, and S53; Huttlin et al., 2010Huttlin E.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Elias J.E. Goswami T. Rad R.

Proteomics. 2009; 8: 904-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) did not affect the ability of active CASP3 to cause RUFY3 degradation or axon degeneration (data not shown). We supplemented the phosphorylation analysis with deletion analysis. We expressed guide-resistant versions of either the N-terminal 254 amino acids (aas) (gr-Rufy31-254) or the C-terminal 215 aas (gr-Rufy3262-469) in combination with sg4(Rufy3) but found that neither alone was sufficient to drive degeneration (Figure S3F). Analysis of sequencing data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) (Lek et al., 2016Lek M. Karczewski K.J. Minikel E.V. Samocha K.E. Banks E. Fennell T. O’Donnell-Luria A.H. Ware J.S. Hill A.J. Cummings B.B. et al.Exome Aggregation ConsortiumAnalysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans.Nature. 2016; 536: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (6554) Google Scholar) revealed a striking bias of deleterious mutations toward the C-terminal end of the human ortholog, RUFY3 (Figure S3G), raising the possibility that the N-terminal domain plays an important role in RUFY3’s function. To test this, we expressed gr-Rufy3Δ1−61, a fragment lacking the 61 most N-terminal aas, and found that this construct also was not able to rescue degeneration (Figures 3F–3I and S3F). Interestingly, the two constructs that rescue function (gr-RUFY3WT and gr-RUFY3S34A) are degraded in lysates in response to TD, whereas the two that do not rescue (gr-RUFY3S34D and gr-RUFY3SΔ1−61) are not (Figure 3J), consistent with the possibility—but not proving—that degradation is required for RUFY3 function. Finally, mutation of cleavage site D254, used initially to identify RUFY3, did not prevent RUFY3 degradation in axons or block degeneration (data not shown). Thus, this site, though helpful in identifying RUFY3, appears incidental to its function. We next examined RUFY3 expression and function in vivo. We first assessed RUFY3 levels in the nervous system by immunostaining sections from embryonic day 12.5 mouse embryos (E12.5). Consistent with prior reports (Mori et al., 2007Mori T. Wada T.

https://openalex.org/W2951086400,"Canine brucellosis, caused by Brucella canis, is a disease of dogs and represents a public health concern as it can be transmitted to humans. Canine brucellosis is on the rise in the United States and there is currently no vaccine for use in dogs. Mice have been extensively utilized to investigate host-pathogen interactions and vaccine candidates for smooth Brucella species and could serve a similar role for studying B. canis. However, comparatively little is known about B. canis infection in mice. The objective of this study was to characterize the kinetics of colonization and pathogenicity of B. canis in mice in order to evaluate the mouse as a model for studying this pathogen. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 105, 107, or 109 CFU of Brucella canis RM6/66 and euthanized 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 9-, and 12-weeks post-inoculation. B. canis induced splenomegaly in mice infected with 109 CFU at 1- and 2 weeks post-inoculation while no gross lesions were observed in other dose groups. Infection at the two higher doses resulted in dose-dependent granulomatous hepatitis and histiocytic infiltration of the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes by 1–2 weeks. B. canis was cultured from the liver, spleen, uterus, bone marrow, lung, and kidney in all groups with colonization declining at a slow but steady rate throughout the experiment. Clearance was achieved by 9 weeks 105 CFU group and by 12 weeks in the 107 CFU group, while B. canis persisted in the spleen until 12 weeks in the highest dose group. Although B. canis does not demonstrate significant replication in C57BL/6 mice, it has the ability to establish an infection, induce splenomegaly, and persist for several weeks in multiple organs. Moreover, 1 x 107 CFU appears to be a suitable challenge dose for investigating vaccine safety."

https://openalex.org/W2952315874,"Due to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in China, the incidence of measles in China has decreased extensively. The incidence reached its lowest levels in contemporary history in 2012 and 2017, with incidence rates of 4.6 and 4.3 per million population, respectively. However, more than 147,000 measles cases were reported from 2013 to 2016. Furthermore, the proportions of cases in infants < 8 months and adults have been increasing since 2013, representing a considerable challenge for measles elimination in China. A total of 14,868 measles viruses were isolated from confirmed measles cases from 2011 to 2017, of which 14,631 were identified as the predominant endemic genotype, H1; 87 were identified as genotype A viruses that were vaccine associated strains; and 150 were identified as non-H1 genotype viruses. The non-H1 genotype viruses included 62 D8 viruses, 70 D9 viruses, 3 D11 viruses, 14 B3 viruses, and 1 G3 virus, which were identified as imported or import-related viruses that caused sporadic cases or small outbreaks. Most of the transmission chains detected during the period 2011–2012 were interrupted and were followed by many new transmission chains of unknown origin that spread, causing a large measles resurgence in China during 2013–2016. After 4 years of measles resurgence and continuous implementation of the routine immunization program and SIAs, the population immunity reached a sufficiently high level to interrupt most of the transmission chains; only a few strains survived, which continued to be sporadically detected in China in 2017. In the present study, the results from the combined epidemiological and molecular virological data demonstrated the great progress towards measles elimination in China by the further analysis of circulation dynamics for the endemic H1 genotype measles virus from 2011 to 2017. And this study accumulated critical baseline data on circulating wild-type measles viruses in China and provides comprehensive information to the world. These comprehensive baseline data provide evidence to support measles elimination in the future, not only in China but also in other countries worldwide. In addition, the information will be very useful to other countries for tracing their sources of measles cases and for identifying transmission links, which can help prevent potential measles outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2952381123,"The emerging field of nutritional geometry (NG) provides powerful new approaches to test whether and how organisms prioritize specific nutritional blends when consuming chemically complex foods. NG approaches can thus help move beyond food-level estimates of diet breadth to predict invasive success, for instance by revealing narrow nutritional niches if broad diets are actually composed of nutritionally similar foods. We used two NG paradigms to provide different, but complementary insights into nutrient regulation strategies and test a hypothesis of extreme nutritional generalism in colony propagules of the globally distributed invasive ant Monomorium pharaonis. First, in two dimensions (protein:carbohydrates; P:C), M. pharaonis colonies consistently defended a slightly carbohydrate-biased intake target, while using a generalist equal-distance strategy of collectively overharvesting both protein and carbohydrates to reach this target when confined to imbalanced P:C diets. Second, a recently developed right-angled mixture triangle method enabled us to define the fundamental niche breadth in three dimensions (protein:carbohydrates:lipid, P:C:L). We found that colonies navigated the P:C:L landscape, in part, to mediate a tradeoff between worker survival (maximized on high-carbohydrate diets) and brood production (maximized on high-protein diets). Colonies further appeared unable to avoid this tradeoff by consuming extra lipids when the other nutrients were limiting. Colonies also did not rely on nutrient regulation inside their nests, as they did not hoard or scatter fractions of harvested diets to adjust the nutritional blends they consumed. These complementary NG approaches highlight that even the most successful invasive species with broad fundamental macronutrient niches must navigate complex multidimensional nutritional landscapes to acquire limiting macronutrients and overcome developmental constraints as small propagules."

Despite being declared an international emergency by the World Health Organization, very little is known about the mechanisms of ZIKV pathogenesis or the long-term consequences of maternal ZIKV infection in the affected offspring, largely due to the lack of appropriate rodent models. To address this issue, our lab has developed a working model of prenatal ZIKV infection in rats. In this study, we infected immune competent pregnant female rats with 105–107 PFU of ZIKV (PRVABC59, Puerto Rico/Human/Dec 2015) in order to examine its pathogenesis in the dams and pups. We examined the febrile response and sickness behavior in the dams, in addition to neonatal mortality, microglia morphology, cortical organization, apoptosis, and brain region-specific volumes in the offspring. Here, we demonstrate that pregnant and non-pregnant female rats have a distinct febrile response to ZIKV infection. Moreover, prenatal ZIKV infection increased cell death and reduced tissue volume in the hippocampus and cortex in the neonatal offspring. For the first time, we demonstrate the efficacy and validity of an immunocompetent rat model for maternal ZIKV infection that results in significant brain malformations in the neonatal offspring."

In this study, we surveyed the presence of Babesia ovis, Theileria ovis, Theileria lestoquardi, Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Anaplasma marginale in 200 goats from 3 different districts in Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran. Species-specific diagnostic PCRs and sequence analysis revealed that 1.5%, 12.5%, and 80% of samples were positive for T. lestoquardi, T. ovis, and A. ovis, respectively. Co-infections of goats with up to 3 pathogens were seen in 22% of the samples. We detected a significant association between T. ovis infection and age, T. ovis infection and location (Zabol), and A. ovis infection and location (Sarbaz) by multivariate logistic regression analysis. In addition, by analyzing the data with respect to Plasmodium caprae infection in these goats, a negative correlation was found between P. caprae and A. ovis infection.

Compared to conventional transcranial electrical stimulation, we demonstrated that it can stimulate deep neurons at the desired firing rate (beat frequency) with higher spatial resolution via a computational model combining finite element analysis and Hodgkin-Huxley action potential model. Additionally, we measured the distribution of stimulus waveforms in saline solution to validate its effect. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that MMS stimulation with higher spatial resolution is steerable and might be a potential alternative to traditional implanted electrodes."

https://openalex.org/W2950410076,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ligands that lack agonist activity but enhance activation in the presence of an agonist are called positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). nAChR PAMs have therapeutic potential for the treatment of nicotine addiction and several neuropsychiatric disorders. PAMs need to be selectively targeted toward certain nAChR subtypes to tap this potential. We previously discovered a novel PAM, (R)-7-bromo-N-(piperidin-3-yl)benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide (Br-PBTC), which selectively potentiates the opening of α4β2*, α2β2*, α2β4*, and (α4β4)2α4 nAChRs and reactivates some of these subtypes when desensitized (* indicates the presence of other subunits). We located the Br-PBTC-binding site through mutagenesis and docking in α4. The amino acids Glu-282 and Phe-286 near the extracellular domain on the third transmembrane helix were found to be crucial for Br-PBTC's PAM effect. E282Q abolishes Br-PBTC potentiation. Using (α4E282Qβ2)2α5 nAChRs, we discovered that the trifluoromethylated derivatives of Br-PBTC can potentiate channel opening of α5-containing nAChRs. Mutating Tyr-430 in the α5 M4 domain changed α5-selectivity among Br-PBTC derivatives. There are two kinds of α4 subunits in α4β2 nAChRs. Primary α4 forms an agonist-binding site with another β2 subunit. Accessory α4 forms an agonist-binding site with another α4 subunit. The pharmacological effect of Br-PBTC depends both on its own and agonists' occupancy of primary and accessory α4 subunits. Br-PBTC reactivates desensitized (α4β2)2α4 nAChRs. Its full efficacy requires intact Br-PBTC sites in at least one accessory and one primary α4 subunit. PAM potency increases with higher occupancy of the agonist sites. Br-PBTC and its derivatives should prove useful as α subunit-selective nAChR PAMs."
https://openalex.org/W2950770845,"Sugarcane ripening in Louisiana is necessary to ensure adequate sucrose levels in early-season harvested sugarcane. The response of nine sugarcane cultivar’s yield components to glyphosate and trinexapac-ethyl ripeners was determined in field trials. Glyphosate (210 g ae ha-1) and trinexapac-ethyl (200 g ai ha-1) treatments failed to increase sucrose yields more than non-ripened sugarcane. Sugarcane ripened with glyphosate or trinexapac-ethyl increased theoretical recoverable sucrose (TRS) 4 to 12% more than non-ripened sugarcane in seven out of nine cultivars, but greater TRS values were counterpoised by lower sugarcane stalk weight. An unintentional consequence of reduced late-season vegetative growth may benefit growers by allowing them to harvest more sugarcane hectares to meet their daily load quota and exposes fewer hectares to a freeze event. The cultivars HoCP 00–950, Ho 09–804, and HoCP 09–840 were not responsive to glyphosate or trinexapac-ethyl ripeners and should not be treated. A delayed harvest from 28 to 49 days after treatment (DAT) coincided with greater TRS values and 17% more sucrose yield."
https://openalex.org/W2951979145,"The Bitcoin market becomes the focus of the economic market since its birth, and it has attracted wide attention from both academia and industry. Due to the absence of regulations in the Bitcoin market, it may be easier to bring some kinds of illegal behaviors. Thus, it raises an interesting question: Is there abnormity or illegal behavior in Bitcoin platforms? To answer this question, we investigate the abnormity in five leading Bitcoin platforms. By analyzing the financial index, i.e. the normalized logarithmic price return, we find that the properties of price return in bitFlyer are completely different from others. To find the possible reasons, we find that the abnormal ask price and bid price appear simultaneously in bitFlyer, which may be potentially linked to either price manipulation or money laundering. It verifies our conjecture that there may be abnormity or price manipulation in Bitcoin platforms. Furthermore, our findings in price return could also provide an innovative and effective method to detect the abnormity in Bitcoin platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2949318308,"Senescence Marker Protein (SMP30) is a metalloenzyme that shows lactonase activity in the ascorbic acid (AA) biosynthesis pathway in non-primate mammals such as a mouse. However, AA biosynthesis does not occur in the primates including humans. Several studies have shown the role of SMP30 in maintaining calcium homeostasis in mammals. In addition, it is also reported to have promiscuous enzyme activity with an organophosphate (OP) substrate. Hence, this study aims to recombinantly express and purify the SMP30 proteins from both mouse and human, and to study their structural alterations and functional deviations in the presence of different divalent metals. For this, mouse SMP30 (MoSMP30) as well as human SMP30 (HuSMP30) were cloned in the bacterial expression vector. Proteins were overexpressed and purified from soluble fractions as well as from inclusion bodies as these proteins were expressed largely in insoluble fractions. The purified proteins were used to study the folding conformations in the presence of different divalent cations (Ca2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) with the help of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. It was observed that both MoSMP30 and HuSMP30 acquired native folding conformations. To study the metal-binding affinity, dissociation constant (Kd values) were calculated from UV-VIS titration curve, which showed the highest affinity of MoSMP30 with Zn2+. However, HuSMP30 showed the highest affinity with Ca2+, suggesting the importance of HuSMP30 in maintaining calcium homeostasis. Enzyme kinetics were performed with γ-Thiobutyrolactone and Demeton-S in the presence of different divalent cations. Interestingly, both the proteins showed lactonase activity in the presence of Ca2+. In addition, MoSMP30 and HuSMP30 also showed lactonase activity in the presence of Co2+ and Zn2+ respectively. Moreover, both the proteins showed OP hydrolase activities in the presence of Ca2+ as well as Zn2+, suggesting the metal-dependent promiscuous nature of SMP30."
https://openalex.org/W2949772866,"Cell-based therapies with bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMDPC) lead to an improved clinical outcome in animal sepsis models. In the present study we evaluated the ability of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to mobilize BMDPC in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis model and thereby its potential as a novel treatment strategy.Male Wistar rats received LPS (25μg/kg/h for 4 days) intravenously and were subsequently treated with GM-CSF 12.5μg/kg (0h,24h,48h,72h). As control groups, rats were infused with sodium chloride or GM-CSF only. Clinical and laboratory parameters, proinflammatory plasma cytokines as well as BMDPC counts were analyzed. Cytokine release by isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from rat spleen upon incubation with LPS, GM-CSF and a combination of both were investigated in vitro.In vivo, rats receiving both LPS and GM-CSF, showed a reduced weight loss and increased mobilization of BMDPC. At the same time, this regime resulted in an increased release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) and a significantly increased mortality. In vitro, the combination of LPS and GM-CSF showed a significantly increased IL-6 release upon incubation compared to incubation with LPS or GM-CSF alone.GM-CSF did not have a beneficial effect on the clinical course in our LPS-induced sepsis model. It synergistically promoted inflammation with LPS and probably thereby impaired survival."
https://openalex.org/W2951294456,"Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) are a major constraint for small ruminant production. Due to the rise of anthelmintic resistance throughout the world, alternative control strategies are needed. The development of GIN resistance breeding programs is a promising strategy. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying genetic resistance might lead to more effective breeding programmes. In this study, we compare transcriptome profiling of abomasal mucosa and lymph node tissues from non-infected, resistant and susceptible infected Creole goats using RNA-sequencing. A total of 24 kids, 12 susceptible and 12 GIN resistant based on the estimated breeding value, were infected twice with 10,000 L3 Haemonchus contortus. Physiological and parasitological parameters were monitored during infection. Seven weeks after the second infection, extreme kids (n = 6 resistant and 6 susceptible), chosen on the basis of the fecal egg counts (FEC), and 3 uninfected control animals were slaughtered. Susceptible kids had significantly higher FEC compared with resistant kids during the second infection with no differences in worm burden, male and female worm count or establishment rate. A higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified in infected compared with non-infected animals in both abomasal mucosa (792 DEG) and lymph nodes (1726 DEG). There were fewer DEG in resistant versus susceptible groups (342 and 450 DEG, in abomasal mucosa and lymph nodes respectively). ‘Cell cycle’ and ‘cell death and survival’ were the main identified networks in mucosal tissue when comparing infected versus non-infected kids. Antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via major histocompatibility complex class I were in the top biological functions for the DEG identified in lymph nodes. The TGFβ1 gene was one of the top 5 upstream DEG in mucosal tissue. Our results are one of the fist investigating differences in the expression profile induced by GIN infection in goats."
https://openalex.org/W2950369660,"Early detection of asymptomatic carotid stenosis may help identifying individuals at risk of stroke. We explore a new method based on laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) which could allow the non-contact detection of stenosis from neck skin vibrations due to stenosis-induced flow disturbances. Experimental fluid dynamical tests were performed with water on a severely stenosed patient-specific carotid bifurcation model. Measurements were taken under various physiological flow regimes both in a compliant and stiff-walled version of the model, at 1 to 4 diameters downstream from the stenosis. An inter-arterial pressure catheter was positioned as reference. Increasing flow led to corresponding increase in power spectral density (PSD) of pressure and LDV recordings in the 0–500 Hz range. The stiff model lead to higher PSD. PSD of the LDV signal was less dependent on the downstream measurement location than pressure. The strength of the association between PSD and flow level, model material and measuring location was highest in the 0–50 Hz range, however useful information was found up to 200 Hz. This proof-of-concept suggests that LDV has the potential to detect stenosis-induced disturbed flow. Further computational and clinical validation studies are ongoing to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the technique for clinical screening."
https://openalex.org/W2949789507,"Natural independent walking mostly occurs during infant´s everyday explorations of their home environment. Gait characteristics of infant walkers at different developmental stages exist in literature, however, data has been only collected in laboratory environments, which may reduce gait variability, therefore mask differences between developmental stages of natural gait. The aim of the study was to provide the first data set of temporal and functional gait characteristics of novice and improver infant walkers in familiar environment conditions in their home. We hypothesised that familiar environment conditions may effectively demonstrate natural gait characteristics and real differences in gait variables differing between 2 groups of developing infant walkers.In a cross-sectional design; we used open-source videos of infants in their home environments: twenty videos of 10 novice (5 girls, 5 boys, 7-12 months) and 10 improver (4 girls, 6 boys, 8-13 months) walkers were chosen from an open-source website. 2-D video gait analysis was undertaken for these parameters: falls frequency, frequency of stops, gait cadence, and time of stance phase, swing phase, and double support. Between groups comparison for novice versus improver was investigated by Mann-Whitney U tests (p ≤ 0.05) with determination of effect size of Pearson r correlation.Statistically significant differences between groups with large effect sizes were found for these parameters: falls frequency (p = 0.01, r = 0.56); cadence (p = 0.01, r = 0.57); stance phase duration of right leg (p < 0.01, r = 0.63); stance phase duration of left leg (p = 0.01, r = 0.56); and double support phase duration (p < 0.01, r = 0.69). Novices scored higher in comparison with improver walkers in all the parameters except cadence.This study presents the first data set of functional and temporal gait parameters of novice and improver infant walkers in their home environments. As an addition to recent research, novice infants walk with lower cadence and higher falls frequency, stance phase time and double support in their familiar environments. With increasing experiences, infant´s cadence increases while the other parameters decrease."
https://openalex.org/W2953238534,"Community marine reserves are geographical areas closed to fishing activities, implemented and enforced by the same fishermen that fish around them. Their main objective is to recover commercial stocks of fish and invertebrates. While marine reserves have proven successful in many parts of the world, their success near important marine predator colonies, such as the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) and the Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii), is yet to be analyzed. In response to the concerns expressed by local fishermen about the impact of the presence of pinnipeds on their communities’ marine reserves, we conducted underwater surveys around four islands in the Pacific west of the Baja California Peninsula: two without reserves (Todos Santos and San Roque); one with a recently established reserve (San Jeronimo); and, a fourth with reserves established eight years ago (Natividad). All these islands are subject to similar rates of exploitation by fishing cooperatives with exclusive rights. We estimated fish biomass and biodiversity in the seas around the islands, applying filters for potential California sea lion and harbor seal prey using known species from the literature. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that the age of the reserve has a significant positive effect on fish biomass, while the site (inside or outside of the reserve) did not, with a similar result found for the biomass of the prey of the California sea lion. Fish biodiversity was also higher around Natividad Island, while invertebrate biodiversity was higher around San Roque. These findings indicate that marine reserves increase overall fish diversity and biomass, despite the presence of top predators, even increasing the numbers of their potential prey. Community marine reserves may help to improve the resilience of marine mammals to climate-driven phenomena and maintain a healthy marine ecosystem for the benefit of both pinnipeds and fishermen."
https://openalex.org/W2950774300,"Purpose To compare the amount of myopia induced by same-size donor-to-host penetrating keratoplasty with that of the amount of myopia induced by over-sized donor-to-host penetrating keratoplasty. Setting Tertiary referral academic center. Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Charts from patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty by the same technique at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between Nov 1, 2002, and January 1, 2006, were reviewed. The patients underwent optical penetrating keratoplasty using 12 interrupted 10–0 nylon sutures and a 12-bite continuous 10–0 nylon suture by a single surgeon (R.K.F.). The surgical technique used would be considered standard of care at most institutions. The Institutional Review Board, University of Miami Human Subjects Research Office, approved the study protocol. The donor graft was over-sized by 0.25mm in eyes when the intended final refractive target was greater than -1.00 diopters spherical equivalent (SE). The same-size donor graft was used when the intended final refractive target was less than -1.00 diopters SE. The selection of donor graft size was entirely based upon clinical parameters, meaning that the intended final refractive target was determined per each patient’s fellow eye refraction, with the intention of reducing anisometropia. All patients received postoperative refraction and corneal topography. These measurements were performed at 6–8 weeks when the initial removal of sutures commenced, then at 6 months, then after completion of selective suture removal, then again at 12 months. Results At 12 months, the over-sized group resulted in -1.35 diopters (SD = 2.25) SE of refraction, and the same-size group resulted in -0.14 diopters (SD = 2.42) SE. This approached statistical significance (p = 0.052) in comparison to -1.00 diopters spherical equivalent. Conclusions Using a donor graft that is over-sized by 0.25mm results in refraction of -1.00 diopters SE or more of myopia. Using a same-size donor-graft results in refraction of less than -1.00 diopters SE. Therefore, careful graft-size selection can result in a more favorable clinical outcome—namely, reduction in anisometropia—in patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty."
