https://openalex.org/W2085796374,"We used fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) to analyze organelle movement by conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein in a cell. We located a green fluorescence protein (GFP)–tagged peroxisome in cultured Drosophila S2 cells to within 1.5 nanometers in 1.1 milliseconds, a 400-fold improvement in temporal resolution, sufficient to determine the average step size to be ∼8 nanometers for both dynein and kinesin. Furthermore, we found that dynein and kinesin do not work against each other in vivo during peroxisome transport. Rather, multiple kinesins or multiple dyneins work together, producing up to 10 times the in vitro speed."
https://openalex.org/W2083416570,"Aging of a eukaryotic organism is affected by its nutrition state and by its ability to prevent or repair oxidative damage. Consequently, signal transduction systems that control metabolism and oxidative stress responses influence life span. When nutrients are abundant, the insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway promotes growth and energy storage but shortens life span. The transcription factor Foxo, which is inhibited by IIS, extends life span in conditions of low IIS activity. Life span can also be increased by activating the stress-responsive Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Here we show that JNK requires Foxo to extend life span in Drosophila. JNK antagonizes IIS, causing nuclear localization of Foxo and inducing its targets, including growth control and stress defense genes. JNK and Foxo also restrict IIS activity systemically by repressing IIS ligand expression in neuroendocrine cells. The convergence of JNK signaling and IIS on Foxo provides a model to explain the effects of stress and nutrition on longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2086653658,"Optically gated ion channels were expressed in circumscribed groups of neurons in the Drosophila CNS so that broad illumination of flies evoked action potentials only in genetically designated target cells. Flies harboring the ""phototriggers"" in different sets of neurons responded to laser light with behaviors specific to the sites of phototrigger expression. Photostimulation of neurons in the giant fiber system elicited the characteristic escape behaviors of jumping, wing beating, and flight; photostimulation of dopaminergic neurons caused changes in locomotor activity and locomotor patterns. These responses reflected the direct optical activation of central neuronal targets rather than confounding visual input, as they persisted unabated in carriers of a mutation that eliminates phototransduction. Encodable phototriggers provide noninvasive control interfaces for studying the connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits, for assigning behavioral content to neurons and their activity patterns, and, potentially, for restoring information corrupted by injury or disease."
https://openalex.org/W2011326960,"Malaria parasites use antigenic variation to avoid immune clearance and increase the duration of infection in the human host. Variation at the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes is mediated by the differential control of a family of surface antigens encoded by var genes. Switching of var gene expression occurs in situ, mostly from telomere-associated loci, without detectable DNA alterations, suggesting that it is controlled by chromatin structure. We have identified chromatin modifications at telomeres that spread far into telomere-proximal regions, including var gene loci (>50 kb). One type of modification is mediated by a protein homologous to yeast Sir2 called PfSir2, which forms a chromosomal gradient of heterochromatin structure and histone hypoacetylation. Upon activation of a specific telomere-associated var gene, PfSir2 is removed from the promoter region and acetylation of histone occurs. Our data demonstrate that mutually exclusive transcription of var genes is linked to the dynamic remodeling of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1983970357,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum undergoes antigenic variation to evade host immune responses through switching expression of variant surface proteins encoded by the var gene family. We demonstrate that both a subtelomeric transgene and var genes are subject to reversible gene silencing. Var gene silencing involves the SIR complex as gene disruption of PfSIR2 results in activation of this gene family. We also demonstrate that perinuclear gene activation involves chromatin alterations and repositioning into a location that may be permissive for transcription. Together, this implies that locus repositioning and heterochromatic silencing play important roles in the epigenetic regulation of virulence genes in P. falciparum."
https://openalex.org/W2019261756,"Factors controlling the onset and progression of extracellular amyloid diseases remain largely unknown. Central to disease etiology is the efficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) machinery that targets destabilized mutant proteins for degradation and the enhanced tendency of these variants to aggregate if secreted. We demonstrate that mammalian cells secrete numerous transthyretin (TTR) disease-associated variants with wild-type efficiency in spite of compromised folding energetics. Only the most highly destabilized TTR variants are subjected to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and then only in certain tissues, providing insight into tissue selective amyloidosis. Rather than a ""quality control"" standard based on wild-type stability, we find that ER-assisted folding (ERAF), based on global protein energetics, determines the extent of export. We propose that ERAF (influenced by the energetics of the protein fold, chaperone enzyme distributions, and metabolite chaperones) in competition with ERAD defines the unique secretory aptitude of each tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2104783373,"Learning complex motor behaviors like riding a bicycle or swinging a golf club is based on acquiring neural representations of the mechanical requirements of movement (e.g., coordinating muscle forces to control the club). Here we provide evidence that mechanisms matching observation and action facilitate motor learning. Subjects who observed a video depicting another person learning to reach in a novel mechanical environment (imposed by a robot arm) performed better when later tested in the same environment than subjects who observed similar movements but no learning; moreover, subjects who observed learning of a different environment performed worse. We show that this effect is not based on conscious strategies but instead depends on the implicit engagement of neural systems for movement planning and control."
https://openalex.org/W2027831967,We show that the escape of hydrogen from early Earth's atmosphere likely occurred at rates slower by two orders of magnitude than previously thought. The balance between slow hydrogen escape and volcanic outgassing could have maintained a hydrogen mixing ratio of more than 30%. The production of prebiotic organic compounds in such an atmosphere would have been more efficient than either exogenous delivery or synthesis in hydrothermal systems. The organic soup in the oceans and ponds on early Earth would have been a more favorable place for the origin of life than previously thought.
https://openalex.org/W2066612343,"Bone is constantly resorbed and formed throughout life by coordinated actions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Here we show that Smurf1, a HECT domain ubiquitin ligase, has a specific physiological role in suppressing the osteogenic activity of osteoblasts. Smurf1-deficient mice are born normal but exhibit an age-dependent increase of bone mass. The cause of this increase can be traced to enhanced activities of osteoblasts, which become sensitized to bone morphogenesis protein (BMP) in the absence of Smurf1. However, loss of Smurf1 does not affect the canonical Smad-mediated intracellular TGFbeta or BMP signaling; instead, it leads to accumulation of phosphorylated MEKK2 and activation of the downstream JNK signaling cascade. We demonstrate that Smurf1 physically interacts with MEKK2 and promotes the ubiquitination and turnover of MEKK2. These results indicate that Smurf1 negatively regulates osteoblast activity and response to BMP through controlling MEKK2 degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2140108163,"TGF-beta signaling is essential for development and proliferative homeostasis. During embryogenesis, maternal determinants act in concert with TGF-beta signals to form mesoderm and endoderm. In contrast, ectoderm specification requires the TGF-beta response to be attenuated, although the mechanisms by which this is achieved remain unknown. In a functional screen for ectoderm determinants, we have identified Ectodermin (Ecto). In Xenopus embryos, Ecto is essential for the specification of the ectoderm and acts by restricting the mesoderm-inducing activity of TGF-beta signals to the mesoderm and favoring neural induction. Ecto is a RING-type ubiquitin ligase for Smad4, a TGF-beta signal transducer. Depletion of Ecto in human cells enforces TGF-beta-induced cytostasis and, moreover, plays a causal role in limiting the antimitogenic effects of Smad4 in tumor cells. We propose that Ectodermin is a key switch in the control of TGF-beta gene responses during early embryonic development and cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2034569328,"The Wnt-Wingless (Wg) pathway is one of a core set of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that regulates many aspects of metazoan development. Aberrant Wnt signaling has been linked to human disease. In the present study, we used a genomewide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila cells to screen for regulators of the Wnt pathway. We identified 238 potential regulators, which include known pathway components, genes with functions not previously linked to this pathway, and genes with no previously assigned functions. Reciprocal-Best-Blast analyses reveal that 50% of the genes identified in the screen have human orthologs, of which ∼18% are associated with human disease. Functional assays of selected genes from the cell-based screen in Drosophila , mammalian cells, and zebrafish embryos demonstrated that these genes have evolutionarily conserved functions in Wnt signaling. High-throughput RNAi screens in cultured cells, followed by functional analyses in model organisms, prove to be a rapid means of identifying regulators of signaling pathways implicated in development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1975188689,"Previous studies demonstrated that α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrillization is inhibited by dopamine, and studies to understand the molecular basis of this process were conducted (Conway, K. A., Rochet, J. C., Bieganski, R. M., and Lansbury, P. T., Jr. (2001) Science 294, 1346–1349). Dopamine inhibition of α-syn fibrillization generated exclusively spherical oligomers that depended on dopamine autoxidation but not α-syn oxidation, because mutagenesis of Met, His, and Tyr residues in α-syn did not abrogate this inhibition. However, truncation of α-syn at residue 125 restored the ability of α-syn to fibrillize in the presence of dopamine. Mutagenesis and competition studies with specific synthetic peptides identified α-syn residues 125–129 (i.e. YEMPS) as an important region in the dopamine-induced inhibition of α-syn fibrillization. Significantly, the dopamine oxidation product dopaminochrome was identified as a specific inhibitor of α-syn fibrillization. Dopaminochrome promotes the formation of spherical oligomers by inducing conformational changes, as these oligomers regained the ability to fibrillize by simple denaturation/renaturation. Taken together, these data indicate that dopamine inhibits α-syn fibrillization by inducing structural changes in α-syn that can occur through the interaction of dopaminochrome with the 125YEMPS129 motif of α-syn. These results suggest that the dopamine autoxidation can prevent α-syn fibrillization in dopaminergic neurons through a novel mechanism. Thus, decreased dopamine levels in substantia nigra neurons might promote α-syn aggregation in Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; AFM, atomic force microscopy; α-syn, α-synuclein; EM, electron microscopy; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; LB, Lewy body; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type. is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, as it affects over one million people in North America and four million worldwide (1Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). PD is clinically diagnosed by four characteristic features, bradykinesia, postural instability, motor rigidity, and resting tremor. Pathologically, there is a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which results in a significant decrease in dopamine levels in the striatum followed by motor impairments in PD patients (1Lang A.E.

In addition to neuron loss, intracellular proteinaceous lesions are found in different PD brain regions that are termed Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites. LBs are found in the remaining dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (4Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 5Pollanen M.S.

Previous studies suggest that α-syn may play a role in the regulation of synaptic dopamine levels and its secretion. For example, down-regulation of α-syn in neuronal cultures results in an alteration in the number of docked vesicles (30Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Faulty synaptic transmission and altered striatal dopamine levels were observed in α-syn knock-out mice (31Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y.

Although some of the data are conflicting, these studies collectively suggest that dopamine transporter and α-syn form a complex that then modifies dopamine reuptake (33Lee F.J. Liu F. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 34Wersinger C. Sidhu A. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 340: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Dopamine/α-syn interactions also have been detected in cell culture models. For example, Xu et al. showed increased cell death in dopaminergic neurons transfected with wild type (WT) or pathologically mutant forms of α-syn (35Xu J. Kao S.Y. Lee F.J. Song W. Jin L.W. Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and Paxinou et al. reported the formation of α-syn aggregates in α-syn-overexpressing cells following simultaneous exposure to dopamine and nitric oxide (36Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B.I. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8053-8061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Conway et al. showed that dopamine or l-dopa inhibits the fibrillization of recombinant α-syn filaments, presumably through adduct formation and stabilization of α-syn into “protofibrillar” structures that are incompetent to form fibrils (37Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). To better understand interactions between dopamine and α-syn, we conducted in vitro studies to determine the nature of this interaction, and we also characterized the structural and conformational properties of dopamine-modified α-syn. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby dopaminochrome, an oxidized product of dopamine, inhibits α-syn fibrillization by interacting with a specific amino acid motif in the C terminus. Remarkably, the dopamine oxidation-induced formation of oligomeric spheres that are incapable of forming mature α-syn fibrils is due to conformational changes rather than covalent modifications, because these changes are reversible, Thus, our novel observations could be exploited for developing better therapies for PD-related α-synucleinopathies. Expression of WT, Mutant, and Truncated Recombinant Human α-Syn Proteins—Human WT α-syn cDNA was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pRK172 at the NdeI and Hind III restriction sites.

Analysis of Assembled α-Syn Proteins—α-Syn proteins (50 μl samples) were incubated at 37 °C with continuous shaking at 1,000 rpm at a concentration of 5 mg/ml (345 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.75 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) containing 0.04% sodium azide. Dopamine was used at equimolar concentrations to α-syn (345 μm) or one-fifth of the concentration of α-syn (69 μm), and N-acetyl cysteine was used at 3-fold molar excess. Each sample (50 μl) was overlaid with ∼40 μl of mineral oil to prevent evaporation. For sedimentation analysis, pelletable polymers of α-syn were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. SDS sample buffer was added to supernatants and pellets, which were heated to 100 °C for 5 min. α-Syn proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and quantified by densitometry. The formation of amyloid polymers of α-syn was assayed using the K114 amyloid fluorescent dye as described previously (38Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

Purification of Dopamine-treated α-Syn Proteins—WT or mutant α-syn proteins were exposed to equimolar concentrations of dopamine in PBS, and samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. In some experiments, byproducts of dopamine oxidation were removed from modified α-syn by resolving the reactants using Affi-Gel blue bead chromatography. α-Syn was exchanged with Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA) into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and further purified through DEAE-Sepharose beads and eluted by 300 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. α-Syn was exchanged into either 100 mm NaOAc, pH 7.5, or PBS. This purified α-syn was used for fibril assembly studies, negative staining EM, immuno-EM, AFM, circular dichroism, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. Visualization of α-Syn Fibril and Spherical Oligomer Formation by EM and AFM—WT, mutant, and dopamine-modified α-syn samples were collected before and after incubation for EM, immuno-EM, and AFM analyses. Negative staining EM was used to observe fibrils of WT and mutant α-syn proteins after fibrillization. Samples were applied to 300 mesh carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. A JEOL 1010 EM was used to examine these samples at magnifications up to 100,000×, and images were captured with a Hermits camera (Birdgewater, MA) using software from AMT (Danvers, MA). Purified dopamine-modified α-syn samples were analyzed by immuno-EM. Samples were applied onto 300 mesh carbon-coated grids, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and immunostained with various primary antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that detected the N terminus (Syn505 and Syn506) and C terminus (Syn211 and Syn214) of α-syn and a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised to recombinant α-syn. Oligomers were then decorated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to 5-nm gold particles and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Control grids were stained with secondary antibody alone or with an anti-tau antibody (T14). EM grids were analyzed at magnifications up to 250,000×. A multimode atomic force microscope equipped with a J scanner (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) was used to analyze control and dopamine-modified WT and mutant α-syn samples for the presence of fibrils and/or spherical oligomers. Diluted samples were applied to freshly peeled, 1 cm in diameter mica discs, and the specimens were air-dried overnight. Silicon nitride cantilevers with a spring constant of 0.06 newton/m were used for imaging, and the images were collected after the force applied to each specimen was minimized. Circular Dichroism Spectrometry—CD spectra were recorded using a Jasc0 J-810 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were collected at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm-long quartz cuvette containing the protein diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Protein Conformational Studies by FTIR Spectrometry—An FTS 60A FTIR spectrometer (Bio-Rad) was used to analyze α-syn samples after the buffer was exchanged into 2 mm HEPES in D2O, pH 7.4, and nitrogen-dried onto a germanium internal reflection crystal. Before sample spectra were collected, rapid background scans were performed. Techniques such as smoothing, water vapor subtraction, baseline correction, and deconvolution were not performed on the raw spectra. Peptide Competition Experiments—Full-length WT α-syn (345 μm) was assembled in PBS in the presence of a synthetic α-syn peptide (116–140, 120–135, 123–133, or mutant 123–133) at 5-fold molar excess with or without dopamine (345 μm). Pelletable polymers were assessed by centrifugal sedimentation analysis, and amyloid fibrils were determined by K114 fluorescence analysis as described above. Synthesis of Dopaminochrome—Dopaminochrome was synthesized by dissolving dopamine at 5 mm in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. Sodium periodate (NaIO4) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm (from a stock of 100 mm in H2O) and incubated with constant shaking for 5 min. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis was used to confirm that the reaction was complete and resulted in dopaminochrome as the major product. Synthesis of Aged/Polymerized Dopamine—Dopamine (35 mm) was incubated in PBS for 96 h. Oxidized dopamine polymers were recovered by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in PBS. Denaturation and Renaturation of Dopamine-Modified α-Syn—α-Syn was incubated with dopamine at an equimolar concentration overnight at 37 °C without shaking. Dopamine-modified α-syn was denatured by the addition of urea to 7 m. α-Syn was subsequently re-natured by dialysis into decreasing concentrations of urea over a period of 48 h and eventually into PBS. Re-natured α-syn was then incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 96 h, and the protein was analyzed by centrifugal sedimentation and K114 fluorometry. Inhibition of α-Syn Protein Fibrillization by Dopamine—Recombinant WT human α-syn was incubated under conditions that result in fibril formation in the absence or presence of dopamine with or without N-acetyl cysteine (an oxidant scavenger) or tyrosine. Sedimentation analysis (Fig. 1A) and K114 fluorescence analysis (Fig. 1B), which specifically binds amyloid fibrils (41Crystal A.S. Giasson B.I. Crowe A. Kung M.P. Zhuang Z.P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), were employed to assess the degree of α-syn fibrillization in these samples. Both assays revealed that WT α-syn does not fibrillize in the presence of dopamine, and this inhibition is prevented by the addition of the reducing agent N-acetyl cysteine to the incubation reaction (Fig. 1, A and B). Tyrosine also was used as a control because its structure is similar to that of dopamine, but it does not self-oxidize or promote oxidation and did not inhibit the fibrillization of α-syn fibrils (Fig. 1, A and B). Most experiments in these studies were performed with an oil overlay to prevent evaporation (see “Experimental Procedures”); however, similar results were obtained without an oil overlay (see supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article). Furthermore, WT α-syn, which was incubated with dopamine without shaking and then purified to eliminate all dopamine oxidation byproducts, also did not form pelletable polymers or amyloid fibrils upon further incubation for up to 12 days in vitro (data not shown). These results indicate that dopamine oxidation is involved in the inhibition of α-syn filament formation. To identify α-syn structures generated by dopamine inhibition, EM and AFM analyses were conducted. Although untreated WT α-syn produced abundant fibrils after incubation for 48 h as detected by AFM (Fig. 1C) and EM (data not shown) (23 and 40), no fibrils were observed in dopamine-treated α-syn samples. Instead, there was an abundant accumulation of spherical oligomers (Fig. 1D). These spheres accumulated even within 12 h of adding dopamine and no further incubation (data not shown), indicating that dopamine promoted the conversion of α-syn from monomers to spherical oligomers. Calculations based on AFM data suggested that these spheres are ∼25 nm in diameter and contain ∼25 α-syn molecules. When immuno-EM was conducted using monoclonal antibodies specific for the C terminus (Syn 211 and Syn 214) (42Giasson B.I. Jakes R. Goedert M. Duda J.E. Leight S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and N terminus (Syn 505 and Syn 506) (43Duda J.E. Giasson B.I. Mabon M.E. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) of α-syn, immunogold labeling was detected using all of the monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1, E and F), suggesting that both the N terminus and the C terminus of α-syn within these spheres are exposed. As negative controls, anti-tau or secondary antibodies alone were used to immunostain the dopamine-modified α-syn oligomers, and no labeling was detected (data nor shown). Dopamine-modified α-Syn Spherical Oligomers Demonstrates a Predominantly Random Coil Structure with Some β-Pleated Sheets—CD and FTIR spectrometry were used to determine the conformation of α-syn after modification by dopamine. Consistent with previous observations (39Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 44Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), soluble, unassembled α-syn is predominantly in random coil conformation (Fig. 2, A and B) as indicated by a minimum between 197 and 200 nm in the CD spectra. Polymerized, filamentous α-syn is predominantly in β-pleated sheet conformation (Fig. 2, A and C) as indicated by the minimum of ∼220 nm and the positive signal <195 nm in the CD spectra. Dopamine- or dopaminochrome-treated α-syn was demonstrated by CD analysis as being mostly randomly coiled with little α-helix or β-pleated sheet structure (Fig. 2A), but FTIR spectrometry analysis showed that dopamine-treated α-syn has some β-pleated sheet structure. Dopamine Inhibition of α-Syn Fibrillization Does Not Require Modification of Tyr, Met, and His—α-Syn does not contain any Cys or Trp residues, known targets for dopamine modification, but the protein does contain four Met residues, four Tyr residues, and one His residue that could be affected by dopamine or products of dopamine oxidation. Thus, to investigate whether dopamine-mediated inhibition of α-syn fibrillization requires oxidation or other chemical modifications, α-syn proteins with the following mutations were generated: (i) single, double, triple, and quadruple Tyr → Phe mutations; (ii) single, double, and triple Met → Ala mutations; and (iii) His → Arg (H50R) mutation. The quadruple Met → Ala mutation could not be generated, because Met-1 is necessary for bacterial protein expression as the start codon. Significantly, similar to WT α-syn, all α-syn mutants formed pelletable amyloid fibrils, and this process was inhibited by dopamine (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm that dopamine arrested fibrillization of mutant α-syn at the spherical oligomeric stage, dopamine-treated Tyr → Phe α-syn with four types of mutations, Met → Ala α-syn with three types of mutations, and H50R α-syn were examined by AFM. Spherical oligomers with similar morphology and size to dopamine-treated WT α-syn accumulated with all mutant proteins (data not shown). Taken together, our data demonstrate that dopamine inhibition of α-syn fibrillization is independent of single or multiple Tyr, Met, and His residues. Inhibition of α-Syn Fibrillization by Dopamine Involves Residues 125–129 (YEMPS)—The results obtained to date suggest that amino acid residues that are generally targeted for modification by dopamine are not involved in dopamine-mediated inhibitions of α-syn fibrillization. To further investigate this mechanism, α-syn proteins with C-terminal truncations were analyzed. Fibril formation by WT α-syn 1–140 as well as by the α-syn 1–130 truncation mutants was inhibited by dopamine. However, dopamine did not inhibit the formation of fibrils assembled from α-syn 1–102, α-syn 1–110, and α-syn 1–125 truncation mutants (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that dopamine may interact or modify α-syn within residues 125–129, i.e. Tyr-125, Glu-126, Met-127, Pro-128, and Ser-129 (YEMPS). To ensure that these results are not simply due to a faster rate of fibril formation of C-terminal truncation mutant proteins (22Murray I.V.J. Giasson B.I. Quinn S.M. Koppaka V. Axelsen P.H. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8530-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), A53T α-syn was used as a control, because this mutant protein also fibrillizes faster than WT α-syn protein (22Murray I.V.J. Giasson B.I. Quinn S.M. Koppaka V. Axelsen P.H. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8530-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24Serpell L.C. Berriman J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 44Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat.

However, fibril formation of A53T α-syn was also inhibited by dopamine (see Fig. 4B). We confirmed the role of α-syn residues 125–129 in mediating the inhibitory effect of dopamine by conducting follow-up competition experiments using α-syn synthetic peptides with or without the YEMPS region. Synthetic peptides containing the YEMPS region (i.e. α-syn 116–140, α-syn 120–135, and α-syn 123–133) or peptides that contained mutations in this region (Y125F,E126A,M127A,P128F,S129A; mutant α-syn 123–133) were incubated with dopamine together with full-length α-syn at a 5-fold molar excess (Fig. 4A). As expected, full-length α-syn fibrillized into pelletable amyloids in the presence of dopamine and peptides containing the YEMPS motif, thereby indicating that these peptides competed successfully for dopamine (Fig. 4A). A YEMPS α-syn mutant peptide (mutant 123–133), where there residues YEMPS were changed to FAAFA, was unable to eliminate the inhibitory effects of dopamine (Fig. 4A). To demonstrate directly that α-syn YEMPS residues mediate the inhibitory effect of dopamine, an α-syn mutant (designated 125–129) was generated wherein all five 125–129 amino acids residues were substituted to FAAFA, respectively. The effects of dopamine (at both equimolar and a sub-stoichiometric concentrations, i.e. 1:5 ratio of dopamine to protein) on WT α-syn, A53T α-syn, and α-syn 125–129 fibrillization were compared. At both concentrations, dopamine inhibited fibrillization of WT α-syn (Fig. 4, B and C). Equimolar concentrations of dopamine also inhibited fibril formation of A53T α-syn, but at a ratio of 1:5 A53T α-syn was able to partially fibrillize. In contrast, the α-syn 125–129 mutant was more resilient to dopamine-mediated inhibition of fibrillization at either concentration, although some inhibition was still observed. These data were confirmed with EM analysis that showed abundant mutant α-syn 125–129 fibrils in the presence of dopamine (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results establish that residues 125–129 in α-syn are involved in dopamine inhibition of α-syn fibrillization. Dopaminochrome, a Product of Dopamine Oxidation, Is Responsible for the Inhibition of α-Syn Fibril Formation—To determine whether byproducts of dopamine autoxidation may inhibit α-syn filament formation rather than dopamine itself, the effects of dopaminochrome, a relatively stable oxidized product of dopamine, was analyzed for WT and mutant α-syn 125–129. Significantly, freshly synthesized dopaminochrome inhibited α-syn fibrillization almost as effectively as dopamine (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the mutant α-syn 125–129 protein can fibrillize in the presence of dopaminochrome. Furthermore, dopamine that has been allowed to oxidize and polymerize over time had little effect on the fibrillization of α-syn (Fig. 5C), indicating that oxidized intermediates such as dopaminochrome are responsible for the inhibition of α-syn filament formation. Reversibility of Dopamine Inhibition of Filament Formation—The ability of dopaminochrome to inhibit filament formation suggests that this process may not be due to a covalent modification of α-syn. Consistent with this notion, mass spectrometry analyses of isolated dopamine-treated α-syn did not reveal significant dopamine/α-syn adducts, and [3H]dopamine incorporation analyses showed that <0.1% of the α-syn molecules were adducts of dopamine (data not shown). The lack of dopamine/α-syn adducts suggests that oxidized dopamine may induce conformational changes in α-syn, resulting in proteins that are fibrillization-incompetent. Moreover, these findings imply that this inhibition should be reversible. To test this hypothesis, dopamine-treated α-syn spherical oligomers were denatured in 7 m urea and re-natured by dialysis in PBS. Remarkably, this treatment led to the near complete recovery of the ability of dopamine-treated α-syn to assemble into fibrils (Fig. 5, D and E), which were ultrastructurally identical to those formed by untreated α-syn (Fig. 5F). The studies presented here provide novel mechanistic insights into how dopamine inhibits α-syn fibrillization predominantly by inducing alterations in protein conformation that affect α-syn polymerization. Consistent with previous reports (37Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), our data show that dopamine prevents α-syn from forming mature amyloid fibrils and that oxidation is needed for this inhibition. However, our findings indicate that dopamine-induced covalent modification of α-syn is not required to prevent filament formation. Rather, inhibition of filament formation is due to the formation of oxidized dopamine by-products that induce conformational changes in α-syn to form species that are unable to proceed to assemble into mature fibrils. Several key pieces of evidence support these conclusions. First, using mass spectrometry we and others (46Li J. Zhu M. Manning-Bog A.B. Di Monte D.A. Fink A.L. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were unable to detect significant amounts of α-syn dopamine adducts, which is consistent with findings that dopamine can inhibit α-syn filament formation at sub-stoichiometric concentrations (37Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Second, under the conditions used here that inhibit α-syn filament formation, only a minute amount of α-syn was covalently modified by dopamine (<0.1%), as demonstrated by using [3H] dopamine in radiolabeling studies (data not shown). Third, mutagenesis studies of the major amino acid residues that could be substrates for covalent modification by dopamine failed to show any effect. Although treatment with dopamine did lead to methionine oxidation as observed by the presence of species with an increased molecular mass of 64 Da using mass spectrometry (data not shown), this oxidation was not responsible for inhibition of α-syn fibrillization as demonstrated by studies of Met-to-Ala α-syn mutants and by previous studies (38Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Finally, α-syn filament formation could be inhibited by the addition of a by-product of dopamine oxidization, i.e. dopaminochrome, although other intermediates may also be involved. It is noteworthy that fully oxidized/polymerized dopamine is ineffective in inhibiting α-syn fibril formation, and this failure of polymerized, oxidized dopamine to interact with α-syn might be due to chemical inactivation or steric hindrance. The data presented here also support the notion that dopamine by-products, such as dopaminochrome, interacting with the amino acid motif YEMPS in α-syn are involved in the inhibition of filament formation. These dopamine intermediates appear to act as molecular chaperones, inducing conformational changes in α-syn as observed by FTIR spectrometry and the accumulation of structural “spheres” observed by AFM. It has been proposed that α-syn spherical oligomers generated in the absence of dopamine or dopaminochrome may be intermediates in the pathway that lead to mature fibril formation (44Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 49Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). However, dopamine-induced α-syn spheres could be structural variants that are on an “off-filament pathway” and therefore unable to progress to form fibrils. Significantly, this altered form of α-syn can be rendered fibrillization-competent by denaturation/renaturation, consistent with the role of conformational alterations rather than covalent modifications in dopamine inhibition of α-syn fibrillogenesis. These finding may have important implications for the role of dopamine oxidation in the pathogenesis of PD and future PD drug discovery efforts. It is hypothesized that dopaminergic neurons may be selectively vulnerable in PD because of their increased exposure to oxidation stress as a result of dopamine biochemistry. However, our data here suggest that intermediates in dopamine oxidation may prevent the formation of α-syn filaments, although other catecholamines might have similar effects (37Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 46Li J. Zhu M. Manning-Bog A.B. Di Monte D.A. Fink A.L. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remains to be determined if spherical oligomers generated because of dopamine oxidation have any toxic effects. It also is difficult to assess how many oxidized dopamine intermediates exist in cells at steady state, because it is likely that these compounds readily convert to neuromelanin. It is also interesting to speculate that a reduction in dopamine levels may occur early in PD and result in an increased propensity for WT α-syn to form fibrillar inclusions, but this may partially be countered by l-dopa, which has a similar effect on α-syn filament formation as dopamine (37Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 46Li J. Zhu M. Manning-Bog A.B. Di Monte D.A. Fink A.L. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although LB-like inclusions with mature α-syn fibrils developed in multiple brain regions in animal models of synucleinopathies (47Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 48Lee M.K. Stirling W. Xu Y. Xu X. Qui D. Mandir A.S. Dawson T.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Price D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8968-8973Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), dopaminergic neurons such as those in substantia nigra are remarkably spared and devoid of LB-like inclusions, suggesting that normal dopamine levels may prevent α-syn fibrillogenesis in vivo. In summary, this study provides evidence for an alternative polymerization pathway for α-syn that does not culminate in mature α-syn fibrils. Furthermore, we show that α-syn fibrillization can be affected by physiological, molecular chaperones that may have important consequences for disease pathogenesis. These findings provide a framework for further studies to define the physiological role of dopamine on α-syn inclusion formation, and our observations could be exploited to develop novel therapies for PD and related α-synucleinopathies.

https://openalex.org/W2153167479,"The β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is a prototypical family A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and an excellent model system for studying the mechanism of GPCR activation. The β2AR agonist binding site is well characterized, and there is a wealth of structurally related ligands with functionally diverse properties. In the present study, we use catechol (1,2-benzenediol, a structural component of catecholamine agonists) as a molecular probe to identify mechanistic differences between β2AR activation by catecholamine agonists, such as isoproterenol, and by the structurally related non-catechol partial agonist salbutamol. Using biophysical and pharmacologic approaches, we show that the aromatic ring of salbutamol binds to a different site on the β2AR than the aromatic ring of catecholamines. This difference is important in receptor activation as it has been hypothesized that the aromatic ring of catecholamines plays a role in triggering receptor activation through interactions with a conserved cluster of aromatic residues in the sixth transmembrane segment by a rotamer toggle switch mechanism. Our experiments indicate that the aromatic ring of salbutamol does not activate this mechanism either directly or indirectly. Moreover, the non-catechol ring of partial agonists does not interact optimally with serine residues in the fifth transmembrane helix that have been shown to play an important role in activation by catecholamines. These results demonstrate unexpected differences in binding and activation by structurally similar agonists and partial agonists. Moreover, they provide evidence that activation of a GPCR is a multistep process that can be dissected into its component parts using agonist fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2064316344,"Spongiform encephalopathies are believed to be transmitted by self-perpetuating conformational conversion of the prion protein. It was shown recently that fundamental aspects of mammalian prion propagation can be reproduced in vitro in a seeded fibrillization of the recombinant prion protein variant Y145Stop (PrP23-144). Here we demonstrate that PrP23-144 amyloids from different species adopt distinct secondary structures and morphologies, and that these structural differences are controlled by one or two residues in a critical region. These sequence-specific structural characteristics correlate strictly with the seeding specificity of amyloid fibrils. However, cross-seeding of PrP23-144 from one species with preformed fibrils from another species may overcome natural sequence-based structural preferences, resulting in a new amyloid strain that inherits the secondary structure and morphology of the template. These data provide direct biophysical evidence that protein conformations are transmitted in PrP amyloid strains, establishing a foundation for a structural basis of mammalian prion transmission barriers."

Some K2P genes do not produce currents in experimental cells (K2P1, K2P7, K2P12 and K2P15). As synthesis of mRNA in native cells indicates that these are not pseudogenes (Washburn et al., 2002Washburn C.P. Sirois J.E. Talley E.M. Guyenet P.G. Bayliss D.A.

While K2P1 was first reported to be a weak, inwardly rectifying potassium channel, and so named TWIK (Lesage et al., 1996Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

In this report, K2P1 is shown to be inactive despite residence in the plasma membrane so long as the protein is covalently modified by small ubiquitin-related modifier protein, SUMO (also called sentrin). Sumoylation, the covalent modification of substrate proteins with SUMO, is a reversible, posttranslational modification primarily observed with nuclear proteins and implicated in nuclear import/export, target stability, and transcriptional activity (Muller et al., 2001Muller S.

Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). SUMO subtypes, SUMO-conjugating enzyme, and SUMO proteases are conserved from yeast to humans. Here, SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc-9) is discovered to be uniformly distributed at the plasma membrane of Xenopus laevis oocytes until assembly with K2P1 channels induces polarized expression over the animal pole. Endogenous Ubc-9 sumoylates K2P1 on an intracellular lysine at position 274. Desumoylation by a SUMO protease (SENP-1) activates the mute pore, allowing its characterization. K2P1 is now seen to be a potassium-selective leak channel with a 32 pS unitary conductance that passes larger outward than inward currents under physiological conditions (that is, high internal and low external potassium) due to open rectification. Active at all physiological voltages, K2P1 is sensitive to external pH via protonation of a histidine in the first P loop that is conserved in the TASK (acid-sensitive) K2P channels K2P3 and K2P9 (Lopes et al., 2000Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N. Proton block and voltage-gating are potassium-dependent in the cardiac leak channel Kcnk3.J. Biol.

SUMO regulation of K2P1 is also demonstrated in the mammalian renal fibroblast cell line COS-7. K2P1 is thus a canonical leak channel showing tightly regulated activity at the plasma membrane via SUMO modification and removal. Expression of K2P1 alone fails to produce potassium currents in oocytes or mammalian tissue culture cells (Orias et al., 1997Orias M. Velazquez H. Tung F. Lee G. Desir G.V.

Sequence and function of the two P domain potassium channels: implications of an emerging superfamily.J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Lack of ion channel function can be associated in the first instance with failure of the protein to reach the plasma membrane; thus, K2P7 channels are speculated to operate on intracellular membranes (Salinas et al., 1999Salinas M. Reyes R. Lesage F. Fosset M. Heurteaux C. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Cloning of a new mouse two-P domain channel subunit and a human homologue with a unique pore structure.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11751-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Alternatively, K2P3 channels reach the plasma membrane but surface levels are determined by regulated forward transport (O’Kelly et al., 2002O’Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A.

Interaction with 14-3-3 proteins promotes functional expression of the potassium channels TASK-1 and TASK-3.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To investigate trafficking of human K2P1, the protein was produced with an N-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (GFP-K2P1) and studied in oocytes by confocal microscopy, as before (Rajan et al., 2002Rajan S. Preisig-Muller R. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R. Hanley P.J. Renigunta V. Musset B. Schlichthorl G. Derst C. Karschin A. Daut J. Interaction with 14-3-3 proteins promotes functional expression of the potassium channels TASK-1 and TASK-3.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing GFP-K2P1 showed strong fluorescence at the plasma membrane (Figure 1A ); this fluorescence was absent in cells with untagged K2P1 (data not shown) or GFP alone (Figure 1B). Of note, surface expression of GFP-K2P1 was polarized to the animal pole of the cells. Xenopus laevis oocytes are prototypical polarized cells that display structural and functional asymmetry of the animal and vegetal poles (Ubbels, 1997Ubbels G.A. Establishment of polarities in the oocyte of Xenopus laevis: the provisional axial symmetry of the full-grown oocyte of Xenopus laevis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 382-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), with targeting of some membrane proteins to the animal pole a recognized phenomenon. Surface expression in polarized fashion was also seen with K2P1 channels bearing a 16-residue tag at the C terminus (K2P1-1d4) visualized with anti-1d4 monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1C). Surface expression without activity suggested that K2P1 might require a stimulus to operate. However, agents (including long-chain free fatty acids, lysophospholipids, volatile anesthetics, and classical regulators of kinases and phosphatases, data not shown) known to upregulate other K2P channels had no effect. Activity was also not seen when the N and/or C termini of K2P1 were replaced by the regions from three functional K2P channels (K2P2, K2P3, or K2P9, data not shown). Conversely, mutating a single intracellular lysine following the fourth transmembrane span, a region critical to regulation of K2P2 (Bockenhauer et al., 2001Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A.N. KCNK2: reversible conversion of a hippocampal potassium leak into a voltage-dependent channel.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was most informative. As before (Orias et al., 1997Orias M. Velazquez H. Tung F. Lee G. Desir G.V. Cloning and localization of a double-pore K channel, KCNK1: exclusive expression in distal nephron segments.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F663-F666PubMed Google Scholar, Goldstein et al., 1998Goldstein S.A.N. Wang K.W. Ilan N. Pausch M. Sequence and function of the two P domain potassium channels: implications of an emerging superfamily.J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), human K2P1 expression failed to induce currents in oocytes (Figure 1E). Like wild-type, GFP-K2P1 and K2P1-1d4 channels were electrically silent (data not shown) despite staining consistent with successful targeting to the plasma membrane (Figures 1A and 1C). Conversely, changing the lysine at position 274 to glutamate (K274E-K2P1) produced macroscopic currents by two-electrode voltage clamp (Figures 1F–1H). As expected for a K2P channel, the portal was constitutively active (that is, open at rest) and potassium selective, showing a shift in reversal potential with altered bath potassium of 51 ± 3 mV per 10-fold change. It became clear that lysine had a unique silencing effect when currents were also observed on alteration of the position to glutamine, alanine, cysteine, or arginine, a residue like lysine that is positively charged at physiological pH. This led us to speculate that position 274 was in a receptor site for a regulator that required lysine to bind; the underlying hypothesis was that the regulator suppressed K2P1 function and that mutations interfered with regulator association allowing the channels to open. Evaluating the region of K2P1 with lysine 274 for known motifs revealed a variant SUMO modification site, -LK274KF-. SUMO-1, -2, and -3 are ∼100 amino acid, soluble, intracellular proteins, found in all eukaryotic cells, that act via covalent linkage to the ϵ amino group of lysine on an acceptor protein to be regulated. Sumoylation proceeds by a pathway that is distinct from, but analogous to, ubiquitin conjugation. Thus, SUMOs are first activated and linked to Aos1/Uba2 and then transferred to the cysteine side chain of the conjugating enzyme Ubc-9 (Gong et al., 1999Gong L. Li B. Millas S. Yeh E.T.

Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Structural basis for E2-mediated SUMO conjugation revealed by a complex between ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and RanGAP1.Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Ubc-9 then binds to the acceptor protein and transfers its thioester-linked SUMO to the acceptor-protein lysine. The SUMO conjugation machinery is present en toto in extracts from Xenopus laevis oocytes (Saitoh et al., 1998Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Ubc9p and the conjugation of SUMO-1 to RanGAP1 and RanBP2.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As interaction of Ubc-9 and the acceptor is required to accomplish sumoylation, we sought evidence for interaction of Ubc-9 and K2P1. First, human Ubc-9 was cloned and confirmed to interact with the C-terminal portion of K2P1 that carries lysine 274 using a yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 2A ). To next determine if complete K2P1 and Ubc-9 proteins interact in oocytes, a GFP tag was introduced at the N terminus of Ubc-9 (GFP-Ubc-9) for studies by confocal microscopy. Expressed on its own, GFP-Ubc-9 was observed at the oocyte plasma membrane in a uniform, nonpolarized fashion (Figure 2B). In contrast, coexpression of wild-type K2P1 (no tag) and GFP-Ubc-9 led to restricted localization of the conjugating enzyme at the animal pole (Figure 2C), the surface pattern observed for K2P1 channels (Figure 1B), arguing for assembly of the two proteins. Native Ubc-9 endogenous to oocytes was found to interact with K2P1 in the same fashion as overexpressed human Ubc-9. The human protein is identical to the Xenopus product (accession number BC046273 ), allowing use of a commercial antibody to human Ubc-9. Native Ubc-9 shows a uniform signal at the plasma membrane in untreated cells (Figure 2D). When K2P1 is expressed, the native Ubc-9 signal is polarized to the animal pole (Figure 2E). This suggested that surface distribution of native Ubc-9 was also restricted by assembly with K2P1. Direct evidence for sumoylation of K2P1 was thus sought. Human K2P1 was shown to be coupled to native SUMO by enzymes endogenous to the oocyte as follows. Wild-type K2P1 and mutant subunits with lysine 274 changed to glutamate (K274E-K2P1) were produced with C-terminal 1d4 tags to allow immunopurification. Channels were expressed in oocytes, solubilized in detergent, affinity isolated via the 1d4 tag, subjected to separation by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-1d4 (Figure 3A ) or anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (Figure 3B). Consistent with SUMO modification of wild-type K2P1-1d4 on lysine 274 and failure to sumoylate K274E-K2P1-1d4 channels, the latter subunits migrate at a lower apparent kDa (Figure 3A). While many native proteins in oocytes are modified by SUMO (Figure 3B, lane 1), immunoprecipitation isolated a single sumoylated band that migrated at the same position as K2P1-1d4 (Figure 3B, lane 2). Furthermore, no sumoylated band was isolated from cells expressing K274E-K2P1-1d4 (Figure 3B, lane 4), despite successful isolation of the subunit (Figure 3A, lane 4). Evidence that lysine 274 was the single essential residue in K2P1 required for SUMO linkage and activity was also obtained by cloning and study of human SUMO-1. First, SUMO was produced with a nine-residue tag from hemagglutinin at the N terminus (HA-SUMO). HA-SUMO was overexpressed with K2P1-1d4 or K274E-K2P1-1d4, and after purification, anti-1d4 and anti-HA antibodies were used to visualize channel subunits or human SUMO-1, respectively. Whereas both K2P1-1d4 and K274E-K2P1-1d4 subunits were purified (Figure 3C), HA-SUMO was observed only with wild-type subunits bearing lysine 274 (Figure 3D, lane 2). In addition, mutation or deletion of the other potential SUMO modification sites in K2P1 produced no current (data not shown; examined constructs included K275Q and R, K283Q, K286Q and E, and K312Q and E). If sumoylation silences K2P1, desumoylation is expected to activate the channels. This was found to be the case. Recently, proteases were identified that specifically cleave SUMO from target proteins (Gong et al., 2000Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. Differential regulation of sentrinized proteins by a novel sentrin-specific protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). One such enzyme, SENP-1, was cloned from a human brain library and expressed with wild-type human K2P1 in oocytes. Coexpression resulted in macroscopic, potassium-selective currents with attributes like those of K274E-K2P1 channels (Figures 4A and 4B ). Wild-type K2P1 channels activated by SENP-1 were open at rest and potassium selective, showing 51 ± 3 mV change in reversal per 10-fold change in bath potassium (data not shown). Specificity of the SENP-1 effect was confirmed by study of a point mutant where the active-site cysteine at position 603 was altered to serine to produce C603S-SENP-1, a change that ablates enzymatic activity (Bailey and O’Hare, 2004Bailey D. O’Hare P. Characterization of the localization and proteolytic activity of the SUMO-specific protease, SENP1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); expression of C603S-SENP-1 with K2P1 failed to induce currents (Figure 4C). Neither expression of SENP-1 nor C603S-SENP-1 alone yielded significant currents (Figures 4D and 4E). To demonstrate that the effect of wild-type SENP-1 on K2P1 was to remove SUMO from the channel subunit, fusion proteins of glutathione S-transferase and SENP-1 (GST-SENP-1) and C603S-SENP-1 (GST-C603S-SENP-1) were synthesized in bacteria, purified, and applied to K2P1-1d4 channels immunopurified from oocytes also expressing HA-SUMO. Figures 4F and 4G show that the isolated K2P1-1d4 subunits traveled as expected for sumoylated K2P1 (Figure 3) and were modified by HA-SUMO, and that GST-SENP-1 treatment removed the HA-SUMO adduct from the channel (lane 3), whereas inactive GST-C603S-SENP-1 did not (lane 4). Of note, the increase in apparent mass on modification of K2P1 with SUMO or HA-SUMO is less than expected (∼12 kDa). This is best explained by anomalous gel migration, because terminal epitopes are not lost from purified SUMO-modified channels. Indeed, isolation of K2P1-1d4 channels after coexpression with GFP-SUMO (∼35 kDa) shows incorporation of the larger adduct on gels visualized with antibodies to either SUMO or GFP (Figure 4H). To support the conclusion that currents induced by SENP-1 were due to activation of K2P1 channels (rather than effects on other oocyte proteins), a predicted behavior of the channel based on its sequence was studied. A point mutation was introduced into K2P1 to change a natural histidine at position 122 in the first P loop to asparagine (H122N-K2P1). This residue is homologous to a histidine in K2P3 (Lopes et al., 2000Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A.N.

Paradoxically, many cell types coexpress both ligands and receptors, raising the question of how specific signaling readouts are achieved under these conditions. Here, we studied the signaling activities exerted by coexpressed EphA receptors and GPI-linked ephrin-A ligands in spinal motor neuron growth cones. We demonstrate that coexpressed Eph and ephrin proteins segregate laterally into distinct membrane domains from which they signal opposing effects on the growth cone: EphAs direct growth cone collapse/repulsion and ephrin-As signal motor axon growth/attraction. This subcellular arrangement of Eph-ephrin proteins enables axons to discriminate between cis- versus trans-configurations of ligand/receptor proteins, thereby allowing the utilization of both Ephs and ephrins as functional guidance receptors within the same neuronal growth cone."

The neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) control many aspects of mammalian nervous system development. Neurotrophin receptors are members of the Trk receptor tyrosine kinase family; TrkA is a receptor for NGF, TrkB for BDNF and NT-4/5, and TrkC for NT-3 (Huang and Reichardt, 2003Huang E.J.

NT-3 also signals through TrkA and TrkB under certain circumstances (Davies et al., 1995Davies A. Minichiello L. Klein R.

In addition, each of the neurotrophins binds to the structurally unrelated neurotrophin receptor p75. Many developmental roles of neurotrophins and their receptors have been established. For example, NGF-TrkA signaling is crucial for the survival and growth of sympathetic neurons as well as small-diameter nociceptive sensory neurons (Levi-Montalcini and Booker, 1960Levi-Montalcini R.

TrkB and TrkC are also critical for the development of specific populations of peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons (Klein et al., 1994Klein R. Silos-Santiago I. Smeyne R.J. Lira S.A. Brambilla R.

Although less well characterized, neurotrophins also appear to control many aspects of central nervous system (CNS) development and modulate synaptic plasticity, metabolism, and neurotransmission in the adult nervous system (for examples, see Guillin et al., 2001Guillin O.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). While standard gene inactivation approaches have been useful for revealing the in vivo roles of neurotrophins and their receptors in the mouse embryo, these strategies are not well suited for the systematic analysis of the functions of neurotrophins in the postnatal or adult nervous system. Indeed, nearly all neurotrophin and Trk null mice die perinatally. Conditional knockouts, employing the Cre-LoxP strategy, have proven useful for the analysis of at least some postnatal neurotrophin functions, but limitations of this approach include the dependence on a small number of available Cre recombinase strains, the low efficiency of Cre recombinase, the lack of reversibility, and the poor temporal control of target gene excision. Neutralizing antibodies have also been widely used to study neurotrophin functions (Goedert et al., 1978Goedert M. Otten U. Thoenen H. Biochemical effects of antibodies against nerve growth factor on developing and differentiated sympathetic ganglia.Brain Res. 1978; 148: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Levi-Montalcini and Booker, 1960Levi-Montalcini R. Booker B. Destruction of the sympathetic ganglia in mammals by an antiserum to a nerve-growth protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1960; 46: 384-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this approach is greatly hampered by issues of antibody specificity, complications associated with nonselective immune responses, the need for repeated injections, and difficulties of antibody delivery to the CNS. Furthermore, large quantities of specific antibodies that selectively neutralize BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 are either limited or not available. Pharmacological inhibitors of Trk kinase, notably the alkaloid K252a, have also been widely used to study Trk function (Koizumi et al., 1988Koizumi S. Contreras M.L. Matsuda Y. Hama T. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. K-252a: a specific inhibitor of the action of nerve growth factor on PC 12 cells.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 715-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Ohmichi et al., 1992Ohmichi M. Decker S.J.

Lamballe F. Barbacid M. K252a is a selective inhibitor of the tyrosine protein kinase activity of the trk family of oncogenes and neurotrophin receptors.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar), but interpretations of experiments using inhibitors such as K252a are difficult due to limited drug specificity. Thus, there is a clear need for strategies allowing potent, specific, rapidly acting, and reversible inhibition of Trk signaling in order to study the roles of neurotrophins during embryonic and postnatal development and during the maintenance and plasticity of the adult nervous system. An ideal approach would combine the specificity of gene targeting and the temporal control, reversibility, and rapid-acting properties offered by a pharmacological approach. Here we report mouse models that combine the benefits of mouse genetics and pharmacology to probe the functions of neurotrophins. We describe the generation and characterization of mice harboring knockin mutations in the murine Trk exons that encode regions of the Trk kinase ATP binding pockets. A phenylalanine-to-alanine substitution within kinase subdomain V of each of the Trk receptors renders them sensitive to specific inhibition by membrane-permeable, small-molecule PP1 derivatives, including 1NMPP1 (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. et al.A chemical switch for inhibitor-sensitive alleles of any protein kinase.Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Such inhibition is specific, stable, and reversible in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo administration of 1NMPP1 leads to elimination of specific populations of neurons in Trk knockin mice but not in their wild-type littermates. These Trk mutant mice allow specific, potent, and reversible inhibition of Trk signaling and should be useful for both in vivo and in vitro studies addressing neurotrophin functions in the developing and adult nervous system. We sought to develop a chemical-genetic strategy that enables specific, rapid, and reversible inhibition of endogenous Trk kinases. Mutations within the ATP binding pocket of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase v-Src (I338) renders it susceptible to inhibition by small-molecule derivatives of the general kinase inhibitor PP1 (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. et al.A chemical switch for inhibitor-sensitive alleles of any protein kinase.Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). At the location corresponding to v-Src I338, TrkA592, TrkB616, and TrkC617, all Trk proteins have a phenylalanine (F) (Figure 1A ). Preliminary findings showed that substitution of TrkA F592 with either a glycine (G) or an alanine (A) does not affect NGF-dependent TrkA signaling in PC12 cells, but does render the mutant TrkA receptor susceptible to inhibition by 1NMPP1 and 1NaPP1, derivatives of PP1 (data not shown). Importantly, neither 1NMPP1 nor 1NaPP1 affects the activity of wild-type TrkA. The success of these PC12 cell experiments prompted us to employ a gene-targeting approach to generate knockin mice in which the activities of the endogenous Trk proteins are susceptible to specific inhibition by PP1 derivatives. The gene-targeting strategies used to generate TrkAF592A, TrkBF616A, and TrkCF617A knockin mice are outlined in Figures 1B–1D. Chimeric mice were obtained following blastocyst injection of targeted ES cells, and the neomycin resistant cassettes used for ES cell selection were excised upon crossing the chimeric Trk mice with mice expressing FlpE recombinase in germ cells. As a result, the TrkAF592A, TrkBF616A, and TrkCF617A knockin mice each harbor a single point mutation, changing F to A within the ATP binding pocket of kinase subdomain V, and contain approximately 100 base pairs of FRT and LoxP sequences located in adjacent introns. Heterozygous mice harboring the Trk F-A knockin mutations were backcrossed to a C57BL/6 background, and homozygous mice were obtained from heterozygous intercrosses. Unlike each of the Trk null mice, which dies perinatally (Klein et al., 1994Klein R. Silos-Santiago I. Smeyne R.J. Lira S.A. Brambilla R. Bryant S. Zhang L. Snider W.D. Barbacid M.

Severe sensory and sympathetic neuropathies in mice carrying a disrupted Trk/NGF receptor gene.Nature. 1994; 368: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), homozygous TrkAF592A, TrkBF616A, and TrkCF617A knockin mice are viable and fertile, with no obvious behavioral abnormality. These findings support the notion that the Trk F-A knockin mutations do not abolish Trk gene function. To further address this issue, BDNF-TrkB signaling was assessed using cultured cortical neurons obtained from postnatal day 0.5 (P0.5) TrkBF616A pups or wild-type littermates. The BDNF dose-responsiveness for activation of TrkB phosphorylation and downstream effectors, Akt and MAPK, is comparable for wild-type and TrkBF616A neurons (Figure 2A ). A detailed description of the TrkBF616A kinase kinetics in transfected cells is described elsewhere (N.D. Okerlund, C. Zhang, K.M. Shokat, and P.M. England, submitted). These findings indicate that the F616A mutation has little or no effect on BDNF-mediated TrkB signaling. To ask if one or more of the PP1 derivatives inhibits the mutant Trk F-A kinases, we tested several PP1 derivatives (100 nM; Figure 2B) for their ability to block BDNF signaling in cortical neurons cultured from TrkBF616A mice. Both 1NaPP1 and 1NMPP1 achieved complete inhibition of TrkBF616A autophosphorylation and signaling, whereas the same concentration of 2NMPP1 led to partial inhibition, and CPPU had no inhibitory effect (Figure 2C). Interestingly, K252a (100 nM), the commonly used inhibitor of Trk kinases, did not inhibit TrkBF616A signaling, although it did block the activity of wild-type TrkB (Figure 2D). This result indicates that K252a and PP1 derivatives may interact with common residues within the TrkB ATP binding pocket and that the F616A mutation may diminish K252a binding to TrkB. Side-by-side drug efficacy comparisons were thus carried out with the most potent PP1 derivatives, 1NMPP1 and 1NaPP1. Both drugs were found to potently and specifically inhibit TrkBF616A kinase activity in cortical neurons cultured from either wild-type or TrkBF616A mutant embryos (Figure 3A ; data not shown). The IC50 values for 1NaPP1 and 1NMPP1 inhibition of TrkBF616A were both estimated to be approximately 3 nM. In marked contrast, no inhibition of TrkB activity was observed in wild-type cortical neurons treated with either 1NaPP1 or 1NMPP1, even at concentrations as high as 10 μM (Figure 3A; data not shown). Similar findings were made in experiments designed to test the efficacy and specificity of 1NMPP1 inhibition of TrkAF592A signaling. Since NGF and TrkA are required for survival of sympathetic neurons (Klein et al., 1994Klein R. Silos-Santiago I. Smeyne R.J. Lira S.A. Brambilla R. Bryant S. Zhang L. Snider W.D. Barbacid M.

Booker B. Destruction of the sympathetic ganglia in mammals by an antiserum to a nerve-growth protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1960; 46: 384-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we cultured superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons from P0.5 TrkAF592A mice and their wild-type littermates and assessed their survival after treatment with 1NMPP1. NGF-TrkAF592A signaling was effectively blocked by 100 nM 1NMPP1, as shown by complete inhibition of NGF-dependent survival of sympathetic neurons obtained from TrkAF592A mice (Figures 3B and 3C). No inhibitory effect was observed for wild-type sympathetic neurons. These findings indicate that 1NMPP1 selectively and potently inhibits the activities of TrkAF592A and TrkBF616A, whereas a high concentration of this compound does not affect wild-type Trk receptor signaling. One of the appealing advantages of using competitive inhibitors to study enzyme function is the reversible nature of their action, which in the case of 1NMPP1 may allow precise temporal control over Trk F-A signaling. To assess the extent of reversibility of 1NMPP1-mediated inhibition of TrkBF616A signaling in cortical neurons, we first exposed TrkBF616A neurons for 2 hr to either 1NMPP1 (100 nM) or DMSO vehicle control, washed away the drug or vehicle, and then reexposed neurons to either DMSO or 1NMPP1. BDNF-TrkBF616A signaling was completely inhibited in 1NMPP1-treated cortical neurons, but is then reestablished after 1NMPP1 washout, indicating that 1NMPP1 inhibition of TrkBF616A is reversible (Figure 4A ). Additionally, in contrast to the commonly used nonselective Trk inhibitor K252a, which requires replenishment every 12 to 24 hr, in vitro stability experiments indicate that a single application of 1NMPP1 (100 nM) to cultured neurons led to sustained inhibition of TrkBF616A signaling for at least 3 days, the duration of the experiment (Figure 4B). These results, taken together, indicate that 1NMPP1 is a potent, specific, stable, and reversible inhibitor of TrkAF592A and TrkBF616A signaling in neurons. We next sought to determine the efficacy and specificity of 1NMPP1 inhibition of Trk F-A signaling in vivo. We reasoned that 1NMPP1 application to TrkAF592A, TrkBF616A, and TrkCF617A embryos, but not to their wild-type littermates, should result in phenotypes similar to those observed in Trk null mice. The dependence of sympathetic neurons on TrkA, nodose ganglion neurons on TrkB, and parvalbumin (PV)-positive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on TrkC is evident from the dramatic cell loss in mice harboring null mutations in the respective Trk and neurotrophin genes (Klein et al., 1994Klein R. Silos-Santiago I. Smeyne R.J. Lira S.A. Brambilla R. Bryant S. Zhang L. Snider W.D. Barbacid M.

Control of landmark events in meiosis by the CDK Cdc28 and the meiosis-specific kinase Ime2.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar ). We therefore assessed the integrity of SCG, nodose ganglia, and PV-positive DRG neurons in the Trk F-A knockin mice. Cell counts revealed no significant differences in SCG, nodose ganglion, and PV-positive DRG neuron numbers between Trk F-A knockin pups and their wild-type littermates at P0.5 (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Therefore, consistent with the aforementioned results of in vitro experiments, the F-A knockin mutations do not adversely affect neurotrophin signaling in vivo. To assess the extent of 1NMPP1 inhibition of NGF-TrkAF592A signaling in vivo, we administered 1NMPP1 in drinking water (25 μM) to TrkAF592A heterozygous mice throughout their pregnancies after they were mated to mice of the same genotype. In parallel experiments, 1NMPP1 was administered in the drinking water together with two intraperitoneal boosting injections (16.6 ng/g body weight) at E15 and E17. In both sets of experiments, neuronal counts of SCG and nodose ganglion were done in the P0.5 progeny of 1NMPP1 or vehicle-treated TrkAF592A mice. SCG counts revealed approximately 50% neuronal loss in TrkAF592A homozygous offspring whose mothers received 1NMPP1, whereas no effect was observed in wild-type littermates (Figure 5). This degree of cell loss is comparable to that observed in P0 TrkA null mice (Fagan et al., 1996Fagan A.M. Zhang H. Landis S. Smeyne R.J. Silos-Santiago I. Barbacid M. TrkA, but not TrkC, receptors are essential for survival of sympathetic neurons in vivo.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6208-6218PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, nodose ganglion neurons, which depend on TrkB signaling for survival, were not affected in these experiments, indicating that TrkB signaling is not affected by 1NMPP1 treatment of TrkAF592A mice (data not shown). Comparable experiments were carried out to assess the efficacy and specificity of 1NMPP1 inhibition of TrkBF616A and TrkCF617A signaling in vivo. Nodose ganglion neuron counts revealed 60% neuronal loss in TrkBF616A homozygous offspring whose mothers were treated with 1NMPP1, while no cell loss was observed in wild-type littermates. Drinking water administration of 1NMPP1 was sufficient to block TrkBF616A signaling in nodose ganglion neurons; a comparable amount of nodose ganglion cell loss was observed in experiments with and without the boosting injections (Figure 6). As expected, SCG neuron viability was not affected in either group (data not shown). Moreover, we observed a dramatic decrease of PV-positive fibers in the lumbar spinal cord and PV-positive DRG neurons in 1NMPP1-treated TrkCF617A mice, but not in their wild-type littermates (Figure 7). This degree of proprioceptive neuron loss is comparable to that observed in Nt3 null mice (Ernfors et al., 1994Ernfors P. Lee K.F. Kucera J. Jaenisch R.

Taken together, these results indicate that 1NMPP1, administered orally, effectively and specifically inhibits TrkAF592A, TrkBF616A, and TrkCF617A signaling in vivo.Figure 71NMPP1 Specifically Inhibits TrkCF617A Signaling In VivoShow full caption(A) Parvalbumin staining of lumber spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia.(B) Cell counts of parvalbumin-positive neurons in L5 dorsal root ganglia at P0.5.

Here we describe mouse models that allow for potent, specific, and reversible inhibition of Trk kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. Our chemical-genetic approach for studying neurotrophin-Trk receptor signaling combines the specificity of gene targeting and the convenience, rapid temporal control, and reversibility of competitive pharmacology. A similar strategy should prove useful for studying the neural functions of other growth factor receptors, including c-Ret, FGF receptors, EGF receptors, and Eph receptors. Major advantages of the chemical-genetic approach to studying neurotrophin signaling include the specificity of inhibition and the availability of a compelling control, the wild-type littermate. These benefits circumvent the concerns of typical pharmacological experiments. There are more than 500 kinases in the protein kinase superfamily, and they exhibit a remarkable degree of conservation within their ATP binding domains. The most commonly used protein kinase inhibitors compete with ATP binding, but the interpretations of such experiments are hampered by the uncertainty of inhibitor specificity. Indeed, the most commonly used Trk inhibitor, K252a, also blocks the activities of other tyrosine kinases as well as a number of serine/threonine kinases, including MLCK and PKC (Kase et al., 1987Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M.

Paradoxically, high concentrations of K252a can actually support survival of neurotrophin-dependent neurons, consistent with the existence of multiple unidentified targets of this drug (Borasio, 1990Borasio G.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49473-49480Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is difficult to design control experiments that provide a measure of specificity of K252a or the other ATP competitive inhibitors. For experiments employing the Trk F-A mice described here, an excellent control of 1NMPP1 specificity is provided by wild-type littermates. The sole difference between experimental and control neurons is the F-A substitution, which is by itself functionally silent. The Trk F-A mutants reported here are potently and specifically inhibited by the PP1 derivatives. Indeed, the IC50 of 1NMPP1 and 1NaPP1 inhibition of Trk F-A neurons is ∼3 nM, whereas no inhibition of wild-type TrkA and TrkB is observed with drug concentrations as high as 10 μM. This high degree of inhibitor potency compares quite favorably to the most potent kinase inhibitors, including the heat-stable inhibitor of PKA, PKI (Mitchell et al., 1995Mitchell R.D. Glass D.B. Wong C.W. Angelos K.L. Walsh D.A. Heat-stable inhibitor protein derived peptide substrate analogs: phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinases.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PP1 derivatives are extremely stable in vitro, as compared to other inhibitors. While K252a experiments require drug replenishment every 12 to 24 hr, a single dose of 1NMPP1 leads to potent inhibition of Trk F-A signaling for at least 3 days. Finally, 1NMPP1 inhibition of Trk F-A mutants is both fast acting and reversible. Along with inhibitor specificity, these convenient features of 1NMPP1 pharmacology should enable a wide range of future experiments addressing Trk receptor function. Another advantage of the Trk F-A knockin mice is the convenient mode of drug administration. PP1 inhibitors have proven effective when administered through IP injection or drinking water. Drinking water administration of 1NMPP1 effectively blocks Trk F-A signaling in vivo, as shown by our findings that oral administration of 1NMPP1 to pregnant TrkAF592A, TrkBF616A, and TrkCF617A heterozygous mice leads to loss of selective populations of neurons in homozygous Trk F-A embryos. 1NMPP1 inhibition of Trk F-A signaling in vivo is robust. The SCG of 1NMPP1-treated TrkAF592A mice exhibit ∼50% of the normal complement of sympathetic neurons. This result compares favorably to the extent of cell loss observed in TrkA null mice at P0.5 (Fagan et al., 1996Fagan A.M. Zhang H. Landis S. Smeyne R.J. Silos-Santiago I. Barbacid M. TrkA, but not TrkC, receptors are essential for survival of sympathetic neurons in vivo.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6208-6218PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, comparable to that observed in Nt3 null mice (Ernfors et al., 1994Ernfors P. Lee K.F. Kucera J. Jaenisch R. Lack of neurotrophin-3 leads to deficiencies in the peripheral nervous system and loss of limb proprioceptive afferents.Cell. 1994; 77: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), PV-positive DRG neurons are almost completely lost in 1NMPP1-treated TrkCF617A mice. The destruction of specific populations of neurons in Trk F-A mice but not control littermates whose mothers were treated with 1NMPP1 indicates that this inhibitor can pass the placental barrier to selectively inhibit Trk F-A signaling in embryos in utero. Thus, the oral route of 1NMPP1 delivery will likely prove useful for experiments designed to establish the precise developmental times at which Trk signaling events are required for aspects of neuronal development. Importantly, 1NMPP1 can also pass the blood-brain barrier. Indeed, Wang et al. showed that 1NMPP1 effectively inhibits the activity of a mutant CaMKII produced by transgenic overexpression in the adult brain (Wang et al., 2003Wang H. Shimizu E. Tang Y.P. Cho M. Kyin M. Zuo W. Robinson D.A. Alaimo P.J. Zhang C. Morimoto H. et al.Inducible protein knockout reveals temporal requirement of CaMKII reactivation for memory consolidation in the brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 4287-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, low molecular weight, membrane-permeable PP1 derivatives are well suited for in vivo functional experiments requiring precise temporal control over Trk F-A receptor activity. Much remains to be learned about the postnatal functions of neurotrophin signaling, since the lethality of neurotrophin and Trk null mice has severely limited their usefulness in addressing neurotrophin function during much of CNS development. The Trk F-A knockin mice, unlike Trk null mice, are healthy and have no observable behavioral or physiological phenotype. We therefore anticipate that the Trk F-A mice will be valuable for assessing the requirement of Trks in the postnatal development of the nervous system. Pharmacological inhibition of TrkAF592A in postnatal mice should allow for a determination of the role of NGF-TrkA signaling during development of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which express high levels of TrkA. Similarly, inhibition of TrkBF616A and TrkCF617A in double knockin mice should provide insights into the potentially redundant developmental roles of TrkB and TrkC, which are coexpressed in many populations of postnatal CNS neurons. The Trk F-A mice should also prove useful for addressing adult functions of neurotrophins, including their potential roles in neuronal survival, axon and dendrite maintenance, neural regeneration, adult stem cell differentiation and growth, neurotransmission, neural plasticity, and behavior. Finally, the rapid and reversible nature of 1NMPP1 inhibition of Trk F-A signaling should enable studies that define the precise temporal contributions of neurotrophin-Trk signaling events during development, plasticity, and behavior. In summary, we have developed mouse models that allow for specific, temporal, and reversible inhibition of neurotrophin-Trk signaling in vitro and in vivo. The TrkAF592A, TrkBF616A, and TrkCF617A knockin mice should prove useful for elucidation of the functions of neurotrophins during embryonic and postnatal development as well as during maintenance and plasticity of the adult nervous system. Murine TrkA F592, TrkB F616, and TrkC F617 are the residues corresponding to Src I338 used previously to establish specific chemical inhibition of Src kinase activity (Bishop et al., 2000Bishop A.C.

The trk exons encoding these amino acids were altered by homologous recombination. To construct the targeting vector for TrkAF592A, a 12.3 kb Aat II-Spe I fragment containing exon 12 of TrkA was isolated from a 129J mouse genomic BAC library (RPCI-22). The targeting vector was comprised of a 1.0 kb short arm, a 7.6 kb long arm, a 3.7 kb targeted sequence carrying the F592A mutation, and the FRT-Neo-FRT cassette flanked by two loxP sites. To construct the targeting vector for TrkBF616A, a 11.2 kb Bsr BI fragment containing exon 14 of TrkB was isolated from a 129J mouse genomic BAC library (RPCI-22). The targeting vector was comprised of a 0.7 kb short arm, a 7.3 kb long arm, 3.2 kb targeted sequence carrying the F616A mutation, and the FRT-Neo-FRT cassette flanked by two loxP sites. To construct the targeting vector for TrkCF617A, a 11.7 kb Hind III fragment containing the target exon of TrkC was isolated from a 129J mouse genomic BAC library (RPCI-22). The targeting vector was comprised of a 3.8 kb short arm, a 7.0 kb long arm, a 0.9 kb targeted sequence carrying the F617A mutation, and the FRT-Neo-FRT cassette flanked by two loxP sites. Mutagenesis was done using a site-directed PCR mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene). Linearized targeting vectors were electroporated into 129.1 mouse strain embryonic stem (ES) cells, and ES cell clones were selected with G418 (300 μg/ml). ES cell clones were screened by PCR, and results were confirmed by Southern blotting. Four positive ES clones for each construct were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, which were then introduced into pseudopregnant females. Chimeric animals were mated with C57BL/6 to produce heterozygous animals, and these mice were subsequently crossed with mice expressing FlpE recombinase (Rodriguez et al., 2000Rodriguez C.I.

All analyses were performed on mice with a 129J and C57BL/6 hybrid genetic background.

Cortical neurons were used 5 days after plating for treatments and immunoblot experiments as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were lysed with boiling Laemmli buffer, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against P-TrkA(Y490), P-Akt (Ser473), or P-Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling). Normalization for protein amounts was done by reprobing the immunoblots with an antibody against α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All blocking and washing solutions for immunoblotting were using TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5] and 150 mM NaCl) containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween-20. Embryonic tissues were fixed in PBS containing paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4%), cryoprotected overnight in PBS containing 30% sucrose, and 10 μm sections were prepared using a cryostat. For parvalbumin immunostaining, sections were blocked in PBS containing BSA (1%) and Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 1.5 hr. Primary antibody (PV28, SWANT) was diluted 1:1500 in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4°C. Fluorescent secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:750 in blocking solution. Tissues were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), cryoprotected overnight in PBS containing 30% sucrose, and frozen. Cyrostat sections (10 μm) of superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and nodose ganglion were prepared and stained with a solution containing 0.5% cresyl violet, and cells with visible nucleoli were counted as neurons (Lonze et al., 2002Lonze B.E.

https://openalex.org/W2046843922,"Efficiency of interspecies prion transmission decreases as the primary structures of the infectious proteins diverge. Yet, a single prion protein can misfold into multiple infectious conformations, and such differences in ""strain conformation"" also alter infection specificity. Here, we explored the relationship between prion strains and species barriers by creating distinct synthetic prion forms of the yeast prion protein Sup35. We identified a strain conformation of Sup35 that allows transmission from the S. cerevisiae (Sc) Sup35 to the highly divergent C. albicans (Ca) Sup35 both in vivo and in vitro. Remarkably, cross-species transmission leads to a novel Ca strain that in turn can infect the Sc protein. Structural studies reveal strain-specific conformational differences in regions of the prion domain that are involved in intermolecular contacts. Our findings support a model whereby strain conformation is the critical determinant of cross-species prion transmission while primary structure affects transmission specificity by altering the spectrum of preferred amyloid conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2032627096,"The striatum receives rich dopaminergic and more moderate serotonergic innervation. After vesicular release, dopamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling is controlled by transporter-mediated reuptake. Dopamine is taken up by dopamine transporters (DATs), which are expressed at the highest density in the striatum. Although DATs also display a low affinity for 5-HT, that neurotransmitter is normally efficiently taken up by the 5-HT transporters. We found that when extracellular 5-HT is elevated by exogenous application or by using antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine) to inhibit the 5-HT transporters, the extremely dense striatal DATs uptake 5-HT into dopamine terminals. Immunohistochemical results and measurements using fast cyclic voltammetry showed that elevated 5-HT is taken up by DATs into striatal dopamine terminals that subsequently release 5-HT and dopamine together. These results suggest that antidepressants that block serotonin transporters or other factors that elevate extracellular 5-HT alter the temporal and spatial relationship between dopamine and 5-HT signaling in the striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2050556924,"Progenitors in the developing central nervous system acquire neural potential and proliferate to expand the pool of precursors competent to undergo neuronal differentiation. The formation and maintenance of neural-competent precursors are regulated by SoxB1 transcription factors, and evidence that their expression is regionally regulated suggests that specific signals regulate neural potential in subdomains of the developing nervous system. We show that the frizzled (Fz) transmembrane receptor Xfz5 selectively governs neural potential in the developing Xenopus retina by regulating the expression of Sox2. Blocking either Xfz5 or canonical Wnt signaling within the developing retina inhibits Sox2 expression, reduces cell proliferation, inhibits the onset of proneural gene expression, and biases individual progenitors toward a nonneural fate, without altering the expression of multiple progenitor markers. Blocking Sox2 function mimics these effects. Rescue experiments indicate that Sox2 is downstream of Xfz5. Thus, Fz signaling can regulate the neural potential of progenitors in the developing nervous system."

It is therefore a particularly appropriate region for studying the role of experience in sculpting neuronal networks. We found that nostril closure decreased the number of newborn granule cells in the MOB, the complexity of their dendritic arborization, and their spine density, without affecting the preexisting population of granule cells. Accordingly, the frequency of miniature synaptic inhibitory events received by mitral cells was reduced. However, due to a compensatory increase in newborn granule cell excitability, action potential-dependent GABA release was dramatically enhanced, thus counteracting the reduction in spine density and leading to an unaltered synchronization of mitral cell firing activity. Together, this study reveals a unique form of adaptive response brought about exclusively by the cohort of newborn cells and used to maintain normal functioning of the MOB.

The functional properties of networks in the brain can be adjusted to constantly changing developmental and environmental conditions. The continuous postnatal supply of newborn inhibitory interneurons to the main olfactory bulb (MOB) offers an ideal system to study neuronal adjustment regulated by sensory experiences. Progenitor cells originating from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle first migrate tangentially to the MOB, by way of the rostral migratory stream (RMS), and then migrate radially within MOB before they differentiate into local interneurons (Luskin, 1993Luskin M.B.

In contrast, odor enrichment increases the number of newborn granule cells and improves olfactory memory (Rochefort et al., 2002Rochefort C. Gheusi G. Vincent J.-D. Lledo P.-M. Enriched odor exposure increases the number of newborn neurons in the adult olfactory bulb and improves odor memory.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2679-2689PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that granule cells provide inhibition onto output bulbar neurons (i.e., mitral/tufted cells) that is responsible for their oscillatory synchronization (Friedman and Strowbridge, 2003Friedman D.

Olfactory processing in a changing brain.Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Yet, it is unknown whether the newborn interneurons actively participate in the oscillatory synchronization of principal cells, or what their functional implications are for overall bulbar activity. In principle, any variation in the number and/or the morphology of newborn neurons might disrupt the activity of bulbar output neurons and thus information processing. A small number of studies have attempted to address these issues with unexpected results. For instance, measurements of the paired-pulse inhibition of evoked potentials following stimulation of lateral olfactory tract in control and odor-deprived bulbs demonstrated that a reduced number of newborn interneurons surprisingly increased the level of inhibition received by mitral cells (Wilson et al., 1990Wilson D.A. Guthrie K.M. Leon M. Modification of olfactory bulb synaptic inhibition by early unilateral olfactory deprivation.Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 116: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, Wilson and Wood, 1992Wilson D.A. Wood J.G.

NMDA receptors mediate expression of one form of functional plasticity induced by olfactory deprivation.Brain Res. 1995; 677: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here, using unilateral odor deprivation in combination with quantitative immunohistological, biphoton, and electrophysiological analyses, we explore the functional consequences of reduced neurogenesis on the activity of the bulbar network. We show that sensory deprivation specifically reduces the dendritic length, spine density, and total number of newborn but not of preexisting granule cells. As a consequence, action potential- and glutamate-independent GABA release is impaired. Interestingly, however, sensory deprivation also strengthens action potential-dependent GABA release, since newborn granule cells were more excitable. Such a compensatory effect preserves the overall inhibition and thus the spatiotemporal synchronization of output neurons. Together, this study demonstrates that the cohort of newborn granule cells brings to the MOB unique adaptive properties and thus upholds the function of the neuronal network in response to the ever-changing olfactory world. To investigate whether sensory activity regulates the number of newborn interneurons, we quantified their abundance in the MOB following unilateral odor deprivation using 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as a cell division marker. In agreement with previous results (Brunjes, 1994Brunjes P.C. Unilateral naris closure and olfactory system development.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1994; 19: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), 30–40 days of odor deprivation starting at postnatal days 4–5 (P4–P5) reduces MOB size (Figure 1A ). It also decreases the number of newborn cells labeled at P16 and counted 21 days later in the granule cell layer (GCL) (1370 ± 216 and 1053 ± 157 for control and odor-deprived bulbs, respectively; n = 6; p < 0.01, paired Student’s t test; Figures 1B and 1C). The reduced number of newborn cells was not due to a decrease in proliferation rate, since quantification of BrdU+ profiles in the SVZ-RMS area, 4 hr after BrdU injections, did not reveal any significant difference between control and occluded bulbs (respectively, 450 ± 25 and 433 ± 18 cells; n = 4; p > 0.05, paired Student’s t test). The reduction in newborn cell number was specific to the GCL, as no change was found in the glomerular layer in terms of number (controls, 68.1 ± 15; occluded, 59.1 ± 13; n = 4; p > 0.05, paired Student’s t test) and density (controls, 95.5 ± 26.7 cells/mm2 and occluded, 98 ± 20.8 cells/mm2; n = 4; p > 0.05, paired Student’s t test) of newborn periglomerular neurons. The area of GCL was also reduced by odor deprivation (1.17 ± 0.11 mm2 in occluded and 1.48 ± 0.15 mm2 in control bulbs; n = 6; p < 0.01, paired Student’s t test; Figure 1D). This meant that, despite the decrease in cell number, occlusion produced no change in the density of newborn granule cells (controls, 984 ± 155 cells/mm2; deprived bulbs, 952 ± 156 cells/mm2; n = 6; p > 0.05, paired Student’s t test; Figure 1E). To determine whether sensory deprivation also alters cell fate, we estimated the proportion of cells double labeled for BrdU and the neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 1F). Orthogonal projections through 3D reconstructed BrdU+ cells revealed that in both conditions about 85% of newborn cells were neurons (n = 400 and 380 BrdU+ cells for control and odor-deprived bulbs, respectively, from four animals; p > 0.05, paired Student’s t test; Figure 1G). It has been demonstrated that a reduced number of newborn cells following sensory deprivation is mainly due to their decreased survival rate after they have reached and positioned themselves in the GCL (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002Petreanu L. Alvarez-Buylla A. Maturation and death of adult-born olfactory bulb granule neurons: role of olfaction.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6106-6113PubMed Google Scholar), processes that take about 2 weeks in both newborn and adult rats (Luskin, 1993Luskin M.B. Restricted proliferation and migration of postnatally generated neurons derived from the forebrain subventricular zone.Neuron. 1993; 11: 173-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar, Winner et al., 2002Winner B. Cooper-Kuhn C.M. Aigner R. Winkler J. Kuhn H.G. Long-term survival and cell death of newly generated neurons in the adult rat olfactory bulb.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the reduction in number of newborn granule cells observed in our experiments takes place during the last 7–10 days of the BrdU postinjection period. Bearing in mind this critical time period required for the survival of newborn granule cells, and also observations demonstrating high local production of granule cells in the MOB during the first postnatal week (Hinds, 1968Hinds J.W. Autoradiographic study of histogenesis in the mouse olfactory bulb. I. Time of origin of neurons and neuroglia.J. Comp. Neurol. 1968; 134: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), we investigated whether sensory deprivation also affects the preexisting population of granule cells. When the resident population of granule cells produced locally in the MOB was labeled by a single BrdU injection in P2 pups, sensory deprivation performed at P4 failed to reduce their number 7 days later (390.9 ± 43.4 and 397.3 ± 46.6 for control and odor-deprived bulbs, respectively; n = 3; p > 0.05, paired Student’s t test). Together, these results demonstrate that odor deprivation specifically reduced the number of newborn neurons located in the GCL, but not those positioned in the glomerular layer, without changing the proliferation rate or the GCL cell density. Although the density of newborn granule cells remains unchanged in deprived bulbs, it is plausible that sensory deprivation alters their morphology and/or their spine density. To explore this, neuronal precursors were labeled in the SVZ using a GFP-expressing lentiviral vector, and newborn neurons were morphologically analyzed in the GCL, 25 days after the vector injection and following 45 days of odor deprivation. Interestingly, newborn granule cells displayed a less complex morphology in occluded bulbs as compared to controls (Figure 2A ). Odor deprivation drastically reduced the length of the apical dendrite from the soma to the first point of ramification (e.g., the primary dendrite) (controls, 168.1 ± 10.1 μm; occluded bulbs, 101.2 ± 7.9 μm; n = 40 cells per condition from three animals; p < 0.01, unpaired Student’s t test; Figure 2B). The total length of the dendritic tree was also significantly reduced (controls, 332.6 ± 24.9 μm; occluded bulbs, 245.4 ± 24.5 μm; n = 40 cells per condition from three animals; p < 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test; Figure 2B). Since odor deprivation decreases the overall size of the MOB, the reduced length of the dendritic arborization might simply arise from general shrinkage of the GCL and the external plexiform layer (EPL). To explore this possibility, we normalized the length of the primary dendrite as well as the entire dendritic tree of newborn granule cells with respect to the 25% reduction in the size of the GCL and the EPL measured in the same slices. Interestingly, whereas the length of the primary dendrite was still significantly smaller in deprived bulbs (controls, 168.1 ± 10.1 μm; occluded bulbs, 126.5 ± 9.9 μm; n = 40 cells per condition from three animals; p < 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test), no difference in the length of the dendritic tree was observed (controls, 332.6 ± 24.9 μm; occluded bulbs, 306.7 ± 30.6 μm; n = 40 cells per condition from three animals; p > 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test). This finding indicates that the reduction in the length of dendritic arborizations of newborn granule cells cannot be solely explained by overall shrinkage of MOB. When we performed a similar analysis on mitral cells labeled with protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) antibody (Nakajima et al., 1998Nakajima T. Murabayashi C. Ogawa K. Taniguchi K. Immunoreactivity of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) in the developing hamster olfactory bulb.Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a 30% reduction in the length of mitral cells’ primary dendrite in the deprived bulb (controls, 323.8 ± 15.8 μm; occluded bulbs, 261.5 ± 21.1 μm; n = 15 cells per condition from two animals; p < 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test) was accompanied by a 30% reduction in the size of EPL (controls, 2.75 ± 0.01 μm; occluded bulbs, 2.11 ± 0.01 μm; n = 15 cells per condition from two animals; p < 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test). Interestingly, newborn granule cells in the odor-deprived bulb also demonstrate a 2-fold reduction in spine density (from 0.20 ± 0.01 spine/μm in controls to 0.11 ± 0.007 spines/μm in occluded bulbs, respectively; n = 40 cells from three animals; p < 0.01, unpaired Student’s t test; Figures 2C and 2D). These results demonstrate that sensory activity is essential for the normal growth of newborn granule cell dendrites, and for normal newborn cell spine density. To explore whether sensory deprivation also affects the dendritic architecture and spine density of the preexisting population of granule cells, we injected DiI directly to the P3 MOB and analyzed cell morphology 10 days later. This time was chosen because the effect of sensory deprivation on newborn granule cell architecture and spine density is likely taking place during the last 7–10 days of GFP vector postinjection, when labeled precursors finish their migration and positioning in the GCL. Additionally, it is conceivable that granule cell progenitors born in the SVZ and RMS after sensory deprivation performed at P4 are not yet incorporated into the MOB network, thus providing a more or less homogenous population of resident granule cells at this time point. The length of the primary dendrite as well as the entire dendritic tree was very similar for this preexisting granule cell population in control and occluded bulbs (controls, 128.5 ± 19 μm and 129.4 ± 24.3 μm; occluded bulbs, 126.5 ± 7.4 μm and 114.6 ± 9.7 μm; n = 12 cells per condition from two animals; p > 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test; Figures 2E and 2F). Similarly, no difference in the spine/filopodia density of DiI-labeled granule cells was observed following sensory deprivation (0.14 ± 0.01 spine/μm and 0.13 ± 0.01 spines/μm in the control and occluded bulbs, respectively; n = 30–40 cells from two animals; p > 0.05, unpaired Student’s t test; Figures 2G and 2H). These results strongly suggest that sensory deprivation specifically affects the morphology and spine density of the newborn, but not the preexisting, granule cell population. To investigate the functional consequences of a reduced spinogenesis in newborn granule cells, we employed electrophysiological recordings on their target output neurons: the mitral cells. Neither their general cell morphology (assessed by DiI labeling) nor their intrinsic membrane properties assessed by intracellular recordings (data not shown) were altered by nostril occlusion. We then recorded spontaneous synaptic activity impinging on mitral cells. These neurons receive inhibitory inputs from granule cells via dendrodendritic reciprocal synapses, consisting of an excitatory mitral-to-granule cell synapse directly adjacent to an inhibitory granule-to-mitral cell synapse (Price and Powell, 1970Price J.L. Powell T.P.S. The morphology of granule cells within the olfactory bulb.J. Cell Sci. 1970; 7: 91-123PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that GABA release is triggered by activation of glutamatergic receptors located on granule cell spines (Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998Isaacson J.S. Strowbridge B.W.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 337-342PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, spontaneous granule-to-mitral cell GABAergic inhibition also occurs in the absence of glutamatergic receptor activation through both action potential-dependent and -independent GABA release (Castillo et al., 1999Castillo P.E. Carleton A. Vincent J.D. Lledo P.M. Multiple and opposing roles of cholinergic transmission in the main olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9180-9191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the contribution of each of the three components to the GABAergic inhibition between control and odor-deprived bulbs. Application of the broad-spectrum ionotropic glutamatergic antagonist kynurenate (Kyn; 5 mM) to control bulb slices strongly decreased the frequency (62.2% ± 4.5% reduction; n = 8; p < 0.001), but not the amplitude (2.4% ± 10.5% reduction; n = 8; p > 0.05), of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) (Figure 3A ). Subsequent bath application of the Na+ channel blocker TTX (1 μM) further reduced the frequency of glutamate-independent spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) (33.2 ± 7.3% reduction, n = 8; p < 0.001; Figure 3A). As previously found for mice (Castillo et al., 1999Castillo P.E. Carleton A. Vincent J.D. Lledo P.M. Multiple and opposing roles of cholinergic transmission in the main olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9180-9191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events was more strongly attenuated by Kyn than by TTX (Figure 3A), demonstrating the importance of glutamate-induced GABA release by the tonic form of inhibition. These recordings further demonstrate that mitral cells receive sPSCs driven by glutamate receptor activation and occurring at high frequency, sIPSCs triggered by action potentials and occurring with lower frequency and, finally, inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) independent of both glutamate receptor activation and action potentials, here called miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Having isolated the three types of GABAergic events in mitral cells, we then investigated their potential changes following odor deprivation. Similar to the control situation, applications of Kyn and TTX strongly affected the frequency, but not the amplitude, of sPSCs in mitral cells from odor-deprived bulbs (Figure 3A). Interestingly, while frequencies of sPSCs and sIPSCs were only slightly decreased following odor deprivation (Figures 3C and 3E), the reduction of mIPSC frequency was much more severe (Figure 3G). Such a reduction is consistent with our finding of reduced spine density in newborn granule cells and implies that newborn granule cells play an important role in providing a strong inhibition on output neurons. Additionally, a highly significant reduction in the frequency of mIPSCs coupled with only subtle modifications in the frequency of sIPSCs further demonstrates that the contribution of action potential-dependent GABA release might be altered following odor deprivation. Quantifying the percentage reduction in the sIPSC frequency following application of TTX further supported this notion: highly significant changes between control and occluded bulbs were observed following addition of 1 μM TTX (Figure 3G, inset). The mean reduction in sIPSC frequency was 33.2% ± 7.3% for control and 71.6% ± 9.9% for occluded bulbs (n = 8; p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). By contrast, application of Kyn (5 mM) induced a similar reduction of sPSC frequency (62.2% ± 4.5% and 63.5% ± 7.9% reduction in the control and occluded bulbs, respectively; n = 8; Figure 3E, inset). In addition, the amplitude of the three types of GABAergic synaptic events was similar between controls and odor-deprived bulbs (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3F), suggesting that restriction of sensory inputs does not alter postsynaptic GABAA receptors. Together, these results show that newborn granule cells contribute to the massive inhibitory input to mitral cells and that alterations in the efficiency of this input activate some action potential-dependent compensatory mechanisms. To assess whether restriction in the degree of sensory inputs might decrease evoked granule-to-mitral cell responses, mitral cells were transiently depolarized using voltage steps. Release of glutamate induced by depolarizing mitral cells has been shown to excite granule cell spines that, in turn, mediate GABAergic dendrodendritic inhibition (DDI) of the mitral cells (Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998Isaacson J.S.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 337-342PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that a short depolarization (2–3 ms) recruits voltage-activated Ca2+ channels that are required to trigger GABA release. In contrast, longer depolarizations (25–50 ms) induce GABA release that depends on NMDA receptor activation (Halabisky et al., 2000Halabisky B. Friedman D. Radojicic M. Strowbridge B.W. Calcium influx through NMDA receptors directly evokes GABA release in olfactory bulb granule cells.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5124-5134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we recorded DDI responses at different steps of depolarization and isolated them by subtracting the traces recorded with a specific GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI; 40 μM), from those recorded under standard conditions. To investigate whether the reduced spine density of newborn granule cells would affect evoked DDI responses, mitral cells were depolarized with increasing voltage step duration in the presence of TTX (1 μM) (Figures 4A and 4B ). In addition, since our recordings of spontaneous synaptic activity suggested increased action potential-dependent GABA release from granule cells of occluded bulb, we also recorded DDI responses in the absence of TTX (Figures 4C and 4D). Interestingly, whereas the integral (Figure 4B) and amplitude (data not shown) of DDI responses recorded with TTX (1 μm) tended to be smaller in the occluded bulb, the opposite effect was observed when TTX was omitted. Both integral (Figure 4D) and amplitude (data not shown) were significantly higher in deprived bulbs. These results suggest that the reduced spine density of newborn granule cells also slightly contributes to evoked local inhibitory dendrodendritic responses in the MOB. However, due to the compensatory increase in action potential-dependent GABA release, DDI responses were not reduced, but rather increased, in deprived bulbs, demonstrating an increase in the global inhibition of mitral cells. Application of BMI left a small component that was further blocked by Kyn (5 mM). This dendrodendritic excitatory (DDE) component represents either autoexcitation of mitral cell dendrites (Isaacson, 1999Isaacson J.S.

To investigate whether acetylcholine-driven activity is required for assembly of the central pattern-generating (CPG) circuit, we studied mice lacking the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzyme. Our studies show that a rhythmically active spinal circuit forms in ChAT mutants, but the duration of each cycle period is elongated, and right-left and flexor-extensor coordination are abnormal.

Spinal neuron development occurs in a precisely regulated and highly stereotypical fashion under the control of well-defined genetic pathways (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). A high-ventral to low-dorsal gradient of sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the neural tube leads to the generation of distinct progenitor cell domains that serve as precursors for different subclasses of neurons (Briscoe et al., 2000Briscoe J.

A core feature of the neuronal differentiation process is the activation of transcription factor pathways involved in regulating cell fate specification (Goulding et al., 2002Goulding M. Lanuza G.

As development progresses, the emergent neurons involved in locomotor control display high levels of spontaneous activity driven by complex synaptic connections between interneurons and motor neurons (Hanson and Landmesser, 2003Hanson M.G.

The role of this activity in the development of spinal circuitry has been debated for a century; nevertheless, its function, if any, in establishing neuronal networks for controlling locomotor behavior remains unknown (Harrison, 1904Harrison R.G.

During development, spinal locomotor neurons become organized into a neuronal network termed the central pattern generator (CPG). This network represents an autonomously functioning circuit that controls rhythmic movements in walking, breathing, and swimming (Grillner, 1998Grillner, S., Ekeberg, El Manira, A., Lansner, A., Parker, D., Tegner, J., and Wallen, P. (1998). Intrinsic function of a neuronal network—a vertebrate central pattern generator. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 26, 184–197.Google Scholar). In walking and swimming, the CPG controls right-left alternation of muscle groups on each side of the body, as well as coordination of extensor-flexor muscle contractions (Nishimaru and Kudo, 2000Nishimaru H. Kudo N. Formation of the central pattern generator for locomotion in the rat and mouse.Brain Res. Bull. 2000; 53: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Lesion and isolation experiments have mapped CPG neurons involved in the control of hindlimb stepping to the ventral lumbar spinal cord (Cazalets et al., 1995Cazalets J.R. Borde M. Clarac F.

Furthermore, each side of the lumbar cord contains a functional CPG network, and each becomes coupled to the other via mutually inhibitory connections formed by commissural interneurons. Thus, longitudinal split cord preparations that sever this commissural pathway uncouple the left and right sides of the spinal cord and disrupt the normal alternating step pattern evoked by the bilateral CPGs (Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 1997Kjaerulff O.

Identification of an interneuronal population that mediates recurrent inhibition of motoneurons in the developing chick spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7557-7567PubMed Google Scholar). V0 cells represent a large population of commissural interneurons in the ventral spinal cord that require the Dbx1 transcription factor for their proper specification (Pierani et al., 2001Pierani A.

Recent studies of Dbx1 mutant mice lacking V0 interneurons demonstrate that this cell population is required for normal right-left coordination (Lanuza et al., 2004Lanuza G.M. Gosgnach S. Pierani A.

Similarly, EphA4 mutant mice exhibit a kangaroo-like hopping behavior as a result of excitatory interneurons inappropriately crossing the midline (Kullander et al., 2003Kullander K. Butt S.J.

Sci. 1998; 860: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The early phase of spontaneous bursting is driven by cholinergic synapses with the help of GABAergic and glycinergic interneurons working in an excitatory manner (Hanson and Landmesser, 2003Hanson M.G. Landmesser L.T. Characterization of the circuits that generate spontaneous episodes of activity in the early embryonic mouse spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 587-600PubMed Google Scholar). Although somewhat counterintuitive, it appears that the output cells for locomotion, motor neurons, are the likely source of the acetylcholine that drives spontaneous activity in the embryonic spinal cord. This recurrent pathway appears to be mediated by axon collaterals from motor neurons that form local connections to spinal interneurons and adjacent motor neurons (Eccles et al., 1954Eccles J.C.

However, during development the neurotransmitter systems used to drive spontaneous activity switch, and glutamate gradually replaces the cholinergic pathway while GABA and glycine begin to have inhibitory effects at around the same time (Chub and O’Donovan, 1998Chub N. O’Donovan M.J. Blockade and recovery of spontaneous rhythmic activity after application of neurotransmitter antagonists to spinal networks of the chick embryo.J.

When the normal patterns of these rhythmic episodes are forced to occur less frequently, dorsal-ventral guidance errors occur in the peripheral hindlimb, suggesting that these depolarizations influence the expression and/or function of axon guidance molecules (Hanson and Landmesser, 2004Hanson M.G.

Similarly, in Xenopus embryos, the pattern of neuronal activity in the developing spinal cord has a dramatic influence on gene regulation and the particular neurotransmitter phenotype acquired by the developing cells (Borodinsky et al., 2004Borodinsky L.N.

Anat. 1904; 3: 197-220Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Haverkamp, 1986Haverkamp L.J.

Behavioral development in the absence of neural activity: effects of chronic immobilization on amphibian embryos.J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1332-1337PubMed Google Scholar). Since acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter driving early motor activity, we reasoned that mouse mutants lacking the rate-limiting enzyme for acetylcholine biosynthesis, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), would lack spontaneous activity during early embryonic stages of spinal cord development. As expected, we found that E12.5 ChAT mutant embryos (Brandon et al., 2003Brandon E.P. Lin W. D’Amour K.A. Pizzo D.P. Dominguez B. Sugiura Y. Thode S. Ko C.P. Thal L.J. Gage F.H. Lee K.F.

Roles of neurotransmitter in synapse formation: development of neuromuscular junctions lacking choline acetyltransferase.Neuron. 2002; 36: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) exhibit markedly reduced levels of activity compared to controls. A day later, however, a low frequency of spontaneous activity was detected in ChAT mutant embryos, but it was atypically driven by glutamatergic inputs in the absence of the normal cholinergic signaling pathway. Likewise, the effects of glycine on motor activity were found to be altered in ChAT mutants. At early stages, glycine has an excitatory effect on activity in control embryos, whereas in ChAT mutants it has an inhibitory effect. Despite these physiological changes, E18.5 ChAT-deficient embryos assemble spinal circuits capable of generating rhythmically alternating motor output. Nevertheless, the coordination between right-left alternation and extensor-flexor regulation is abnormal in these mutants. These locomotor defects cannot be mimicked by the acute application of acetylcholine receptor antagonists on wild-type embryos, demonstrating that the cholinergic signaling pathway is required for proper development of locomotor circuits during a transient period of embryonic development. The role of acetylcholine in the development of spinal motor neurons and their synapses has been previously examined using ChAT mutant mice (Brandon et al., 2003Brandon E.P. Lin W. D’Amour K.A. Pizzo D.P. Dominguez B. Sugiura Y. Thode S. Ko C.P. Thal L.J. Gage F.H. Lee K.F. Aberrant patterning of neuromuscular synapses in choline acetyltransferase-deficient mice.J.

Roles of neurotransmitter in synapse formation: development of neuromuscular junctions lacking choline acetyltransferase.Neuron. 2002; 36: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These mutants exhibit increased muscle nerve branching, hyperinnervation, and perinatal death due to paralysis. Because acetylcholine is known to drive regular episodes of neuronal activity in early embryonic chick and mouse motor neurons (Hanson and Landmesser, 2003Hanson M.G. Landmesser L.T. Characterization of the circuits that generate spontaneous episodes of activity in the early embryonic mouse spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 587-600PubMed Google Scholar, Milner and Landmesser, 1999Milner L.D. Landmesser L.T. Cholinergic and GABAergic inputs drive patterned spontaneous motoneuron activity before target contact.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3007-3022PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether spontaneous activity was altered in ChAT mutant mice. Recordings from lumbar sciatic nerves of wild-type and heterozygous E12.5 mice detected recurring episodes of spontaneous activity at a frequency of 0.4 ± 0.1 bursts/min (Figures 1A and 1F). In contrast, E12.5 ChAT mutants lacked spontaneous bursts altogether (Figures 1B and 1F). The frequency of spontaneous bursting episodes is similar from E12.5 to E13.5 in wild-type and heterozygous mice (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1F). In ChAT mutants, however, a change occurred at E13.5, and spontaneous activity became detectable (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1F). Nevertheless, the frequency of activity in ChAT mutants was reduced compared to that in controls. From E12.5 to E15.5, we found that the frequency of spontaneous activity in wild-type embryos gradually declined. Starting at E16.5, a marked increase in activity occurred in controls, which persisted beyond E18.5 (Figure 1F; data not shown). ChAT mutants exhibited a different pattern of spontaneous activity during development: motor activity was reduced compared to that in controls, and bursting in the mutants failed to shift to a higher frequency at E16.5 (Figure 1F). Next, we defined the temporal period in which acetylcholine is required for spontaneous activity in wild-type embryos. We monitored the frequency of bursting episodes at developmental stages from E12.5 to E18.5 using the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist DHβE to disrupt cholinergic signaling (Figure 1G). Two phases of spinal cord development were identified: Phase I, from E12.5–E14.5, was dependent upon cholinergic signaling, and, therefore, DHβE blocked activity; Phase II, from E15.5 onward, was defined by activity that persisted in the presence of DHβE (Figure 1G). We then examined the frequency of spontaneous activity in ChAT mutant embryos, expecting to observe a full recovery during Phase II of development, starting at approximately E15.5. Nevertheless, we found that spontaneous activity in ChAT mutants did not recover to wild-type levels after E15.5 (Figures 1F and 1G). We also noted that, during Phase I, spontaneous activity was entirely dependent upon nicotinic cholinergic signaling in wild-type embryos, whereas ChAT mutants exhibited low levels of spontaneous activity at E13.5–E14.5 despite the lack of acetylcholine (Figure 1G). The residual activity in ChAT mutants was not mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors’ binding to choline, for example, because DHβE failed to block the spontaneous bursts (Figure 1E). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that spontaneous activity is diminished throughout development in ChAT mutants and that secondary changes occur that result in an unusual noncholinergic form of spontaneous activity during Phase I that can not reach normal levels during Phase II. Previous studies have shown that direct activation of motor neurons in E12.5 embryos elicits episodes of activity that propagate through the lumbar spinal cord (Hanson and Landmesser, 2003Hanson M.G. Landmesser L.T. Characterization of the circuits that generate spontaneous episodes of activity in the early embryonic mouse spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 587-600PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the networking of spinal neurons in the absence of cholinergic signaling, we antidromically stimulated motor axons in the right sciatic nerve of controls and ChAT mutants. The synchronous activation of motor neurons in the sciatic nerve induced a compound action potential in both wild-type and mutant embryos, but this only induced a prolonged episode of bursting within the sciatic nerve of control embryos (Figures 2A and 2B ). In addition, the antidromic stimulation of the sciatic nerve propagated rostrally to the crural nerve in wild-type embryos, but not in ChAT mutants (Figures 2A and 2B). Next, we used direct stimulation of the spinal cord over the crural nerve to induce bursting. Although both the crural and sciatic nerves were activated by direct stimulation in wild-type embryos, bursting was only detected in the crural nerve of ChAT mutants, revealing a defect in the propagation of motor activity caudally to the sciatic nerve (Figures 2C and 2D). These findings argue for a role of cholinergic transmission in the activation of both local and propagating mouse motor circuits (Hanson and Landmesser, 2003Hanson M.G. Landmesser L.T. Characterization of the circuits that generate spontaneous episodes of activity in the early embryonic mouse spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 587-600PubMed Google Scholar). We next performed studies to understand the basis for the nonnicotinic form of spontaneous activity that emerged at approximately E13.5 in ChAT mutants. In both the late embryonic and adult spinal motor circuits, the main excitatory drive is provided by glutamatergic spinal interneurons (Chub and O’Donovan, 1998Chub N. O’Donovan M.J. Blockade and recovery of spontaneous rhythmic activity after application of neurotransmitter antagonists to spinal networks of the chick embryo.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 294-306PubMed Google Scholar, Rekling et al., 2000Rekling J.C. Funk G.D. Bayliss D.A. Dong X.W. Feldman J.L. Synaptic control of motoneuronal excitability.Physiol.

Activity patterns and synaptic organization of ventrally located interneurons in the embryonic chick spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3457-3471PubMed Google Scholar). During early stages of development, however, glutamatergic input appears to be dispensable for spontaneous activity. Consequently, the addition of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX, together with the NMDA receptor antagonist APV, to E13.5 wild-type embryos does not significantly alter rhythmic spontaneous bursting (Figures 3A–3C ). To define the embryonic period in which glutamatergic neurotransmission becomes necessary for spontaneous motor activity, we measured the frequency of bursts in the presence of CNQX and APV at a series of developmental ages from E12.5 to E18.5 (Figure 3C). Two phases of development were again observed: Phase I, spanning E13.5 to E15.5, was defined by spontaneous activity that persisted in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists, whereas Phase II, from E15.5 onward, exhibited an absolute requirement for glutamatergic signaling (Figure 3C). Interestingly, these two phases of glutamatergic function complemented the pattern seen with nicotinic receptor antagonists (see Figure 1G), suggesting that the switch from cholinergic to glutamatergic drive may be coordinated. The residual spontaneous activity detected in ChAT mutants at E13.5–E14.5 was unexpected, since this falls within the cholinergic period (Phase I) of activity in wild-type"

Among the members of this family, PYPAF1, PYPAF5, PYPAF7, and NALP1 have been shown to induce caspase-1-dependent interleukin-1β secretion and NF-κB activation in the presence of the adaptor molecule ASC. On the other hand, we recently discovered that PYNOD, another member of this family, is a suppressor of these responses. Here, we show that PYPAF3 is the second member that inhibits caspase-1-dependent interleukin-1β secretion. In contrast, PYPAF2/NALP2 does not inhibit this response but rather inhibits the NF-κB activation that is induced by the combined expression of PYPAF1 and ASC. Both PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 mRNAs are broadly expressed in a variety of tissues; however, neither is expressed in skeletal muscle, and only PYPAF2 mRNA is expressed in heart and brain. They are also expressed in many cell lines of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic lineages. Stimulation of monocytic THP-1 cells with lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-1β induced PYPAF3 mRNA expression. Furthermore, the stable expression of PYPAF3 in THP-1 cells abrogated the ability of the cells to produce interleukin-1β in response to lipopolysaccharide. These results suggest that PYPAF3 is a feedback regulator of interleukin-1β secretion. Thus, PYPAF2 and PYPAF3, together with PYNOD, constitute an anti-inflammatory subgroup of PYPAFs.

IL-1β plays a fundamental role in protecting animals against infectious agents by activating immune cells, inducing a variety of cytokines and acute phase proteins and acting as a pyrogen (1Dinarello C.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 2Dinarello C.A. Int. J. Tissue React. 1992; 14: 65-75PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, excessive production of IL-1β induces septic shock and is fatal for animals. Therefore, the regulation of IL-1β production is an important issue in infectious diseases from both the pathophysiological and pharmacological points of view. However, the regulatory mechanisms of IL-1β production are poorly understood. IL-1β is produced as an inactive proprotein and is converted to the active mature protein through proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1. Recently, IL-1β-converting enzyme-protease-activating factor (Ipaf, also called caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 12), which has homology with apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf)-1 and promotes caspase-1-dependent IL-1β maturation, was discovered (3Poyet J.L.

More recently, several members of another subfamily of Apaf-1-like proteins having an N-terminal PYRIN domain (called PYRIN-containing Apaf-1-like proteins (PYPAFs) or NALPs), namely PYPAF1/cryopyrin, PYPAF5, PYPAF7, and NALP1, have been found to promote caspase-1-dependent IL-1β maturation in the presence of an adaptor molecule, ASC (4Wang L.

On the other hand, two other Apaf-1-like proteins, Nod1 and Nod2, were discovered to be cytoplasmic sensors for cell-invading microbes (7Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). These findings shed light on how microbial infection induces the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of mature IL-1β (7Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev.

On the other hand, little is known about the functions of other Apaf-1-like proteins in caspase-1 activation and/or IL-1β maturation. PYPAF2 has been contradictorily reported both to and not to promote caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion (5Grenier J.M. Wang L. Manji G.A. Huang W.J. Al-Garawi A. Kelly R. Carlson A. Merriam S.

Immunity. 2004; 20: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Recently, we discovered that PYNOD, a novel member of the PYPAFs, has the potential to inhibit caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion as well as ASC-mediated NF-κB activation (10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This was the first example of a PYPAF member playing a negative regulatory role in IL-1β secretion. This finding prompted us to investigate whether other ill-characterized members of this family have activities similar to PYNOD. Here we investigated the effects of PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 expression on NF-κB activation and IL-1β secretion. These two proteins are highly homologous and likely to be products of a very recent gene duplication event. We found that PYPAF3 inhibits caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion but not ASC-mediated NF-κB, while PYPAF2 inhibits the latter but not the former. Further study suggested that PYPAF3 is a feedback regulator of caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion.

Cell Lines and Transfection—The HEK293, 293T, HepG2, ECV304, PK-1, SW480, K562, Jurkat, U937, and THP-1 cell lines were described previously (10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The HeLa (epitheloid carcinoma) cell line was obtained from Dr. Nobuhiro Nakamura (Kanazawa University, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science). The HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) cell line was obtained from Dr. Shinji Nakao (Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science). For luciferase reporter assays and IL-1β secretion assays, HEK293 cells were plated onto 48-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well, and transfection was carried out 18 h later using linear polyethyleneimine (Mr about 25,000, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) as described previously (12Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation assays, 293T cells were plated onto 6-well plates at density of 5 × 105 cells/well, and transfection was carried out 18 h later using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). To generate stable transfectants, THP-1 cells were transfected with pHA-EAK-PYPAF3 by electroporation. After selection with puromycin for 4 weeks, stable transfectants expressing HA-tagged PYPAF3 were selected by Western blot analysis. Luciferase Reporter Assays for NF-κB Activity—HEK293 cells in 48-well plates were transfected with plasmids including 15 ng/well of pNF-κB-Luc (carrying a firefly luciferase cDNA driven by 5× NF-κB-binding sites; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and 3 ng/well of pRL-TK (carrying Renilla luciferase cDNA driven by the HSV-TK promoter; Promega, Madison, WI). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant (300 ng/well) by the addition of empty vector (pEF-BOS). After 24 h, cell lysates were prepared and the firefly, and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The relative luciferase activity was calculated as follows: relative luciferase activity = firefly luciferase activity/renilla luciferase activity. IL-1β Secretion Assays—HEK293 cells in 48-well plates were transfected with plasmids including those expressing pro-IL-1β (80 ng/well) and procaspase-1 (2 ng/well, unless otherwise specified). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant (300 ng/well) by the addition of empty vector (pEF-BOS). After 26 h, the culture supernatants were collected and subjected to ELISA for IL-1β using the Human IL-1β OptEIA ELISA Set (Pharmingen). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were carried out as previously described (10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), except that transfection and cell culture were performed in 6-well plates and that rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blots, respectively. PYPAF-3-specific antisera were prepared from mice immunized with purified glutathione S-transferase-fused PYPAF-3 PYRIN domain (amino acids 1–93). Assays for mRNA Expression—Panels of first-strand cDNA from multiple human tissues (Human I and Human II) were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA from cultured cell lines was prepared using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (13Fukui M. Imamura R. Umemura M. Kawabe T. Suda T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The primers used to detect human PYPAF2 mRNA were as follows: sense, 5′-gcaaaggatgaagtcagaga-3′; antisense, 5′-ccctccacccttatgtagat-3′, while those for PYPAF3 mRNA were as follows: sense, 5′-gcagtgggctgaattcttct-3′; antisense, 5′-gcctgacagagaatccacaa-3′. The amount of template cDNA was adjusted so that a similar amount of a PCR fragment of β-actin was generated within the linear range of the PCR. PYPAF2 Inhibits the NF-κB Activation Induced by the Combined Expression of PYPAF1 and ASC—We first investigated the effect of PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 expression on ASC-mediated NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells using luciferase reporter assays. Consistent with a previous report (14Manji G.A. Wang L. Geddes B.J. Brown M. Merriam S. Al-Garawi A. Mak S. Lora J.M. Briskin M. Jurman M. Cao J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11570-11575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), PYPAF1 promoted this response, and truncation of the LRRs (PYPAF1dLRR) enhanced this activity (Fig. 1A). In contrast, PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 and even their LRR-truncated mutants failed to show such an activity (Fig. 1A). Instead, PYPAF2 dose-dependently inhibited the NF-κB activation induced by PYPAF1dLRR plus ASC (Fig. 1B). PYPAF3 showed little or no such activity. It was previously shown that PYPAF4 inhibits NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α or IL-1β (15Fiorentino L. Stehlik C. Oliveira V. Ariza M.E. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35333-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, PYPAF2 did not inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, while a dominant negative mutant of TRADD inhibited this response, serving as a positive control (Fig. 1C). In this context, PYPAF2 is more similar to PYNOD (10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) than PYPAF4. PYPAF3 Inhibits Caspase-1-dependent IL-1β Secretion— Next, we investigated whether PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 promotes caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion in the presence of ASC in HEK293 cells. Previous reports lack agreement on whether or not PYPAF2 promotes this response (5Grenier J.M. Wang L. Manji G.A. Huang W.J. Al-Garawi A. Kelly R. Carlson A. Merriam S. Lora J.M. Briskin M. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Agostini L. Martinon F. Burns K. McDermott M.F. Hawkins P.N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). In our hands, IL-1β secretion was not induced by PYPAF2, PYPAF3, or their LRR-deletion mutants, irrespective of the presence or absence of ASC (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), while it was efficiently induced by PYPAF1 and PYPAF1dLRR in the presence of ASC as reported previously (4Wang L. Manji G.A. Grenier J.M. Al-Garawi A. Merriam S. Lora J.M. Geddes B.J. Briskin M. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29874-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We then investigated the effect of PYPAF2 or PYPAF3 expression on the caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion induced by PYPAF1dLRR plus ASC. In contrast to its lack of inhibitory activity against ASC-mediated NF-κB activation described above, PYPAF3 strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the IL-1β secretion, while PYPAF2, which successfully inhibited the ASC-mediated NF-κB activation, did not (Fig. 2B). To further examine the mechanism by which PYPAF3 inhibits caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion, we investigated the effect of PYPAF3 on the IL-1β secretion induced by caspase-1 overexpression. In the absence of ASC and PYPAF1, caspase-1 induced IL-1β secretion dose-dependently (Fig. 2C). The expression of PYPAF3 but not PYPAF2 inhibited this response dose-dependently, indicating that PYPAF3 affects caspase-1 activation or downstream events. PYPAF3 Inhibits Processing of Pro-IL-1β and Procaspase-1—To explore how PYPAF3 inhibited the caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion in more detail, we investigated the processing of pro-IL-1β and procaspase-1 by Western blot analysis. First, C-terminal HA-tagged pro-IL-1β was coexpressed with procaspase-1 in 293T cells. Under these conditions, an anti-HA antibody detected the mature form of IL-1β (p17) (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The expression of PYPAF3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–8) but not PYPAF2 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–5) dose-dependently inhibited the generation of p17. Next, N-terminal FLAG-tagged procaspase-1 was overexpressed in 293T cells to induce its auto- or cognate cleavage. Under these conditions, p33, which corresponds to the N-terminal fragment after the p10 subunit cleavage, was detected by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–4). PYPAF3 strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the generation of p33 (Fig. 3B, lanes 8–10), indicating that PYPAF3 inhibits procaspase-1 processing. PYPAF2 partially inhibited this processing at a high dose but much less efficiently than did PYPAF3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–7). PYPAF3 Interacts with Both Procaspase-1 and Pro-IL-1β—We next investigated whether there are physical interactions between PYPAF3 and caspase-1 or IL-1β. These proteins were transiently expressed in 293T cells, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. Immunoprecipitation of caspase-1 or IL-1β but not RIP-DD resulted in the coprecipitation of PYPAF3 (Fig. 4, A and B, left panels). In addition, the immunoprecipitation of PYPAF3 but not Bcl-XL resulted in the coprecipitation of caspase-1 and IL-1β (Fig. 4, A and B, right panels). These results indicate that PYPAF3 physically interacts with both caspase-1 and IL-1β. If caspase-1 or IL-1β was endogenously expressed in 293T cells, it was possible that caspase-1 or IL-1β indirectly interacted with PYPAF3 through the other one. Therefore, We examined the expression of caspase-1 and IL-1β mRNA in 293T cells. No RT-PCR product corresponding to caspase-1 cDNA was detected (see supplemental Fig. S2A), indicating that caspase-1 is not expressed in this cell line. On the other hand, we detected a faint band corresponding to IL-1β cDNA (see supplemental Fig. S2A). Then we investigated whether a significant amount of IL-1β is present in 293T cells. We could not detect any IL-1β protein in the culture supernatants or cell lysates from 293T cells using ELISA irrespective of the presence or absence of exogenous caspase-1, unless IL-1β was exogenously expressed by transfection (see supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, the expression level of endogenous IL-1β protein in 293T cells was very low, if any. These results suggest that caspase-1 and IL-1β interacted with PYPAF3 independent of each other. Expression of PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 mRNA—The expression of PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 mRNA in human tissues and cell lines was investigated by RT-PCR. Both PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 mRNA were detected in various tissues (Fig. 5A). However, skeletal muscle expressed neither PYPAF2 nor PYPAF3 mRNA, and heart and brain expressed low levels of PYPAF2 and no PYPAF3 mRNA. PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 mRNA were detected in many but not all tested cell lines, including hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines (Fig. 5B). However, the expression levels of these mRNAs in the cell lines were not well correlated with each other. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-1β Induce PYPAF3 Expression in Monocytic THP-1 Cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells—We next investigated whether inflammatory stimuli induce PYPAF3 expression in hematopoietic cell lines, using HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia, Jurkat acute T cell leukemia, U937 histiocytic lymphoma, and THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia cells. Interestingly, LPS potently enhanced the expression level of PYPAF3 but not PYPAF2 mRNA in THP-1 cells (Fig. 6A). Such induction was not observed in HL-60, Jurkat, or U937 cells. IL-1β also induced PYPAF3 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells in a stimulation time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, LPS and IL-1β enhanced PYPAF3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as revealed by RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that elevation of the IL-1β concentration results in the induction of PYPAF3, which has the potential to inhibit IL-1β production, in monocytes. PYPAF-3 Inhibits LPS-induced IL-1β Secretion from THP-1 Cells—Finally, to obtain more insight into the biological significance of the ability of PYPAF3 to inhibit IL-1β secretion, we investigated whether PYPAF3 inhibits the LPS-induced endogenous IL-1β production in THP-1 cells. To this end, we established stable transfectants expressing N-terminal HA-tagged PYPAF3. Western blot analysis using anti-HA or anti-PYPAF3 antibodies failed to detect a protein corresponding to full-length PYPAF3; however, we reproducibly detected a 35-kDa band with either anti-HA or anti-PYPAF3 antibodies specifically in PYPAF3-expressing but not in control transfectants (Fig. 7A and data not shown). We established five independent clones of PYPAF3 transfectants, and all of them produced little or no IL-1β upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 7B, showing two representative clones), while control transfectants receiving empty vector produced a large amount of IL-1β under these conditions. These results indicate that PYPAF3 inhibits the endogenous IL-1β production in THP-1 cells. In this study, we demonstrated that PYPAF3 inhibits caspase-1-dependent IL-1β processing, while PYPAF2 inhibits ASC-mediated NF-κB activation. We recently found that a novel PYPAF member, which we named PYNOD, inhibits both of these activities (10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, PYPAF4 was previously reported to inhibit the NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α or IL-1β (15Fiorentino L. Stehlik C. Oliveira V. Ariza M.E. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35333-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, these members seem to constitute an anti-inflammatory subgroup of PYPAFs, in contrast to the proinflammatory members, which include PYPAF1, PYPAF5, PYPAF7, and NALP1. PYPAF3 interacted with both caspase-1 and IL-1β and inhibited the processing of both. At present, it is not clear whether PYPAF3 can inhibit the processing of IL-1β by already-activated caspase-1. On the other hand, PYPAF2, like PYNOD, inhibited the ASC-mediated but not TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. These results suggest that the molecular mechanisms by which PYPAF2 and PYNOD inhibit NF-κB activation are different from that of PYPAF4, which directly binds to IKKα and inhibits NF-κB activation induced by cytokines (15Fiorentino L. Stehlik C. Oliveira V. Ariza M.E. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35333-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 are products of highly homologous genes that reside next to each other on chromosome 19q13.42 with a head-to-head orientation (7Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 8Tschopp J. Martinon F. Burns K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In mouse, only one homolog corresponding to these two human genes has been found (16Reed J.C. Doctor K. Rojas A. Zapata J.M. Stehlik C. Fiorentino L. Damiano J. Roth W. Matsuzawa S. Newman R. Takayama S. Marusawa H. Xu F. Salvesen G. Godzik A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1376-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that these two genes were generated as the result of a very recent gene duplication event. Because PYNOD inhibits both caspase-1-dependent IL-1β processing and ASC-mediated NF-κB activation, and separable regions are responsible for each of these functions, 2Y. Wang and T. Suda, unpublished observation. it is possible that the common ancestor gene for PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 encoded a protein that possessed both of these activities, which might have been separately inherited by PYPAF2 and PYPAF3. In this context, it would be interesting to test whether the mouse protein representing these two human proteins has both functions. This structural similarity and functional difference between PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 may be useful for investigating the structure-function relationship of these proteins. PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 mRNAs were broadly expressed in most tissues, with a few exceptions. Skeletal muscle expressed neither PYPAF2 nor PYPAF3, while heart and brain expressed PYPAF2 but not PYPAF3. Interestingly, PYNOD is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain (10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that PYNOD and PYPAF2/PYPAF3 play similar functions in different tissues and/or different contexts. Despite the broad expression of PYPAF2 and PYPAF3 mRNA, their expression levels in a given tissue or cell line were not well correlated with each other. Furthermore, LPS stimulation induced the expression of PYPAF3 but not PYPAF2 mRNA in THP-1 cells. These results suggest that the expression of these mRNAs is differently regulated despite their genes being adjacent on the chromosome. When we examined the N-terminal HA-tagged PYPAF3 protein expressed in stable transfectants of THP-1, we could detect only a 35-kDa fragment, which corresponds to the N-terminal fragment of PYPAF3 consisting of the PYRIN domain and the NAIP/CIITA/HET-E/TP1 (NACHT) domain, suggesting that PYPAF3 is quickly degraded in these cells. In addition, when we transfected HEK293 cells with a plasmid expressing the N-terminal portion of PYPAF3 corresponding to the p35 fragment together with expression plasmids for caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β, it inhibited the IL-1β secretion significantly but less efficiently than a plasmid expressing full-length PYPAF3 (data not shown). We are now trying to determine the essential region of PYPAF3 for its caspase-1-inhibitory activity. Stimulation by LPS or IL-1β induced the expression of PYPAF3 mRNA in monocytic THP-1 cells. Furthermore, stable transfectants of this cell line expressing PYPAF3 were severely defective in the LPS-induced IL-1β production. Therefore, it is likely that the PYPAF3 is a feedback regulator for IL-1β secretion. Considering that an exaggerated production of IL-1β is highly toxic to animals, such a feedback regulation mechanism should be very important under pathophysiological conditions. ICEBERG, COP, and CARD8 are CARD-containing proteins that have been reported to interact with caspase-1 and inhibit caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion (17Humke E.W. Shriver S.K.

Doctor K. Rojas A. Zapata J.M. Stehlik C. Fiorentino L. Damiano J. Roth W. Matsuzawa S. Newman R. Takayama S. Marusawa H. Xu F. Salvesen G. Godzik A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1376-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, PYPAF3 and PYNOD have counterparts in mice (10Wang Y. Hasegawa M. Imamura R. Kinoshita T. Kondo C. Konaka K. Suda T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Reed J.C. Doctor K. Rojas A. Zapata J.M. Stehlik C. Fiorentino L. Damiano J. Roth W. Matsuzawa S. Newman R.

https://openalex.org/W2116594088,"The excitatory and inhibitory inputs to directionally selective (DS) ganglion cells are themselves directionally selective. Directionality is achieved because excitation is reduced during null-direction movement along a GABAergic pathway. Inhibition is reduced during preferred-direction movement along a pathway that includes cholinergic synapses. Both excitation and inhibition are made directional by laterally offset inhibitory signals similar to the spatial offset of the direct inhibitory input to the DS cell dendrites. Thus, spatially offset lateral inhibition generates directionality at three different levels in the DS circuitry. We also found that for stimuli falling within the dendritic field, cholinergic input is delivered to the OFF but not the ON dendrites. Cholinergic pathways from outside the dendritic field reach both ON and OFF dendrites, but both of these pathways are normally inactivated by GABAergic synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2171629370,"Song learning in birds requires a basal ganglia-thalamo-pallial loop that contains a calyceal GABAergic synapse in the thalamus. Information processing within this circuit is critical for proper song development; however, it is unclear whether activation of the inhibitory output of the basal ganglia structure Area X can drive sustained activity in its thalamic target, the medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). We show that high-frequency, random activation of this GABAergic synapse can drive precisely timed firing in DLM neurons in brain slices in the absence of excitatory input. Complex IPSP trains, including spike trains recorded in vivo, drive spiking in slices with high reproducibility, even between animals. Using a simple model, we can predict much of DLM's response to natural stimulus trains. These data elucidate basic rules by which thalamic relay neurons translate IPSPs into suprathreshold output and demonstrate extrathalamic GABAergic activation of thalamus."

We generated CAPS1-deficient (KO) mice and studied exocytosis in a model system for Ca2+-dependent LDCV secretion, the adrenal chromaffin cell. Adult heterozygous CAPS1 KO cells display a gene dosage-dependent decrease of CAPS1 expression and a concomitant reduction in the number of docked vesicles and secretion. Embryonic homozygous CAPS1 KO cells show a strong reduction in the frequency of amperometrically detectable release events of transmitter-filled vesicles, while the total number of fusing vesicles, as judged by capacitance recordings or total internal reflection microscopy, remains unchanged. We conclude that CAPS1 is required for an essential step in the uptake or storage of catecholamines in LDCVs."
https://openalex.org/W2102154813,"We have previously identified C1 domain-containing phosphatase and TENsin homologue (C1-TEN) as being an intracellular binding partner for Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). C1-TEN is a tensin-related protein that houses an N-terminal region with predicted structural similarity to PTEN. Here, we report our observations on the effects of ectopic expression of C1-TEN in HEK293 cells, which resulted in profound molecular and phenotypic changes. Stable expression of C1-TEN altered cellular morphology, with less cell spreading and weaker filamentous actin staining. Cells overexpressing C1-TEN were inhibited greatly in their proliferation and migration rates as compared with mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, serum starvation-induced apoptosis caused a twofold increase in caspase 3 activity in C1-TEN-overexpressing cells vs. mock cells. In addition, C1-TEN-overexpressing cells showed a markedly reduced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB kinase and its substrate GSK3, as well as reduced Akt enzymatic activity. No such effects on JNK were observed. Also, serum-stimulated activation of Akt was delayed in C1-TEN-overexpressing cells, while no difference in profile of ERK activation was observed. Furthermore, cells expressing a C1-TEN mutant where the putative phosphatase active site cysteine at position 231 was substituted for a serine displayed full restoration of both cell proliferation and Akt activation. In conclusion, C1-TEN appears to be a novel intracellular phosphatase that negatively regulates the Akt/PKB signaling cascade, and is similar to its relative PTEN in this respect. However, the particular domain organization of C1-TEN may enable it to regulate RTK and other signaling complexes that are linked to Akt/PKB signaling in a unique manner."
https://openalex.org/W2106360060,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptionally regulates the expression of the plasma membrane high affinity iron transport system in response to iron need. This transport system is comprised of the products of the FET3 and FTR1 genes. We show that Fet3p and Ftr1p are post-translationally regulated by iron. Incubation of cells in high iron leads to the internalization and degradation of both Fet3p and Ftr1p. Yeast strains defective in endocytosis (Δend4) show a reduced iron-induced loss of Fet3p-Ftr1p. In cells with a deletion in the vacuolar protease PEP4, high iron medium leads to the accumulation of Fet3p and Ftr1p in the vacuole. Iron-induced degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p is significantly reduced in strains containing a deletion of a gene, VTA1, which is involved in multivesicular body (MVB) sorting in yeast. Sorting through the MVB can involve ubiquitination. We demonstrate that Ftr1p is ubiquitinated, whereas Fet3p is not ubiquitinated. Iron-induced internalization and degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p occurs in a mutant strain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RSP5 (rsp5-1), suggesting that Rsp5p is not required. Internalization of Fet3p-Ftr1p is specific for iron and requires both an active Fet3p and Ftr1p, indicating that it is the transport of iron through the iron permease Ftr1p that is responsible for the internalization and degradation of the Fet3p-Ftr1p complex. Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptionally regulates the expression of the plasma membrane high affinity iron transport system in response to iron need. This transport system is comprised of the products of the FET3 and FTR1 genes. We show that Fet3p and Ftr1p are post-translationally regulated by iron. Incubation of cells in high iron leads to the internalization and degradation of both Fet3p and Ftr1p. Yeast strains defective in endocytosis (Δend4) show a reduced iron-induced loss of Fet3p-Ftr1p. In cells with a deletion in the vacuolar protease PEP4, high iron medium leads to the accumulation of Fet3p and Ftr1p in the vacuole. Iron-induced degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p is significantly reduced in strains containing a deletion of a gene, VTA1, which is involved in multivesicular body (MVB) sorting in yeast. Sorting through the MVB can involve ubiquitination. We demonstrate that Ftr1p is ubiquitinated, whereas Fet3p is not ubiquitinated. Iron-induced internalization and degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p occurs in a mutant strain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RSP5 (rsp5-1), suggesting that Rsp5p is not required. Internalization of Fet3p-Ftr1p is specific for iron and requires both an active Fet3p and Ftr1p, indicating that it is the transport of iron through the iron permease Ftr1p that is responsible for the internalization and degradation of the Fet3p-Ftr1p complex. Transition metals are essential for life, yet transition metals in high concentrations can be toxic. Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes tightly regulate the concentration of free intracellular metals by either regulating metal uptake or sequestration. High affinity iron transport in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the expression of two cell surface proteins, the multicopper oxidase Fet3p and the transmembrane permease Ftr1p (1Askwith C.C. de Silva D.

Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Transcription of these genes, as well as genes that encode proteins required for the processing of Fet3p, is regulated by the iron sensing transcription factor Aft1p (3Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae transporters for the transition metals copper and zinc are regulated post-translationally. High levels of zinc induce the internalization and vacuolar degradation of Zrt1p, the high affinity zinc transporter (4Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). High levels of copper induce the degradation of Ctr1p, the high affinity copper transporter, whereas Ctr3p, another high affinity copper transporter, is not affected (5Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A previous study from our laboratory suggested that regulation of the high affinity iron transport system was predominantly transcriptional (6Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although there is evidence that the activity of the iron transport system may be regulated by cAMP (7Lesuisse E. Horion B. Labbe P. Hilger F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, however, suggested that the multicopper oxidase-based high affinity iron transport system might be regulated post-translationally. Incubation of S. pombe, expressing the high affinity transport system, with high concentrations of iron led to a rapid inhibition of iron transport (8Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). High levels of iron transport activity are seen when FET3/FTR1 are expressed using the iron-independent GAL10 promoter. There is a 50% reduction in transport activity when such cells are incubated in high iron as opposed to low iron medium (8Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we re-examined whether the Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system is post-translationally regulated. We demonstrate that high levels of iron induce the internalization and degradation of the Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system. Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The cells were grown in either medium containing yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) 1The abbreviations used are: YPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose; BPS, bathophenanthroline disulfonate; CM, complete media; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein. or yeast nitrogen base synthetic complete medium (CM) with supplements as needed (9Askwith C.

Low iron growth medium was made by adding 40 or 80 μm bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS), an iron chelator, to CM or YPD and then adding back varying amounts of FeSO4 (9Askwith C. Eide D.

Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All samples were isolated from mid-log phase cultures grown in either CM or CM BPS (5Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled FET3 and CMD1 probes were generated. Preparation of Antisera against Fet3p—A secreted Fet3p (Fet3p lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) was generated as described by Hasset et al. (11Hassett R.F. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Procedures for the isolation and deglycosylation of secreted-Fet3p have been described previously (12Harris Z.L. Davis-Kaplan S.R. Gitlin J.D. Kaplan J. Blood. 2004; 103: 4672-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The N-glycanase-treated Fet3p was injected into rabbits, and antisera were prepared. The soluble Fet3p was attached to an Amino-link gel using the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Inc.). The antiserum was applied to the column, and the column was extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) and immediately neutralized with 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The purified antibody was useful for both immunofluorescence and Western analysis. Immunofluorescence—Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (13Davis-Kaplan S.R. Ward D.M. Shiflett S.L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4322-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For visualization of Fet3p, the rabbit anti-Fet3p antibody was used (1:500) followed by either an Alexa 594- or Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500). All of the fluorescent secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes. Western Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed on Fet3p-containing membrane fractions as described previously (14Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using our purified rabbit anti-Fet3p (1:1000). The only variation in protocol was that membranes (15 μg) were treated with endoglycosidase Hf per the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs) before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels followed by Western analysis. For Western analysis of Gap1p-GFP or Ftr1p-CFP, membranes were isolated using a procedure described previously (15Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with milk and incubated with either a rabbit anti-Fet3p (1:1,000), rabbit anti-GFP (1:10,000) (Abcam #6556), or rabbit anti-Gas1p (1:30,000, the kind gift of Dr. Howard Riezman University of Basel), followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:12,500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Proteins were visualized by using a Western Lightning chemiluminescent detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of Fet3p-GFP, Gap1p-GFP, or Ftr1p-CFP, proteins were extracted as described for Western analysis. Following extractions, samples were incubated with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:10,000, Abcam #6556) and 40 μl of Sepharose-conjugated Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads were pelleted and washed ten times in extraction/lysis buffer, and samples were eluted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated samples were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis using either rabbit anti-Fet3p, mouse anti-GFP (1:10,000, Covance), or mouse anti-ubiquitin (1:1,000, Covance) as the primary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Atomic Absorption Assay—Cells were grown to log phase in low iron medium and then transferred to medium containing a range of FeSO4 for 2 h. Log phase cells were collected and washed by centrifugation with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA. Cell pellets were digested in 200 μl of 5:2 nitric acid:perchloric acid at 80 °C for 1 h. After digestion, the samples were diluted to 1.0 ml with deionized water and then flamed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometer. All samples were measured in duplicate, and the experiment was performed at least twice. To determine if the Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system is post-transcriptionally regulated by iron, we exposed wild type cells expressing the transport system to high iron medium and then examined Fet3p levels by Western analysis. When cells were exposed to high iron medium there was a concentration-dependent decrease in Fet3p. Relative to Gas1p, employed as a loading control, exposure of cells to 1 mm FeSO4 resulted in the disappearance of 50% of Fet3p within 1 h (data not shown) and 80% within 2 h (Fig. 1A). It may be possible that the disappearance of surface Fet3p is the result of the steady-state turnover of Fet3p, as FET3 transcription is iron-sensitive (9Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). We observed that FET3 mRNA levels were dramatically decreased when cells were incubated with as little as 10 μm iron (Fig. 1B). There was little further change in transcript level with increased medium iron. Examination of Fet3p levels revealed little decrement in Fet3p when cells were incubated with 10 μm iron for 2 h. Decreased protein levels were only seen at higher concentrations of iron (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that Fet3p levels may be regulated independently of FET3 mRNA. We confirmed this result using two different approaches. First, we measured Fet3 protein in cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Cells were grown in low iron medium, and cycloheximide was added at the same time as high iron. In the presence of cycloheximide, there was an iron-dependent decrease in Fet3p (Fig. 1C). Second, we examined changes in Fet3p levels in Δfet3 cells transformed with a plasmid containing GAL10FET3 (8Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). High affinity iron transport occurs under low iron conditions in the presence of galactose but not in the presence of glucose. Cells were exposed to galactose in low iron medium to induce the high affinity iron transport system. The cells were then incubated in glucose media to prevent transcription of FET3 mRNA. Addition of glucose leads to inhibition of transcription of galactose-regulated genes within 4 min (16Mason P.B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Addition of iron to glucose media resulted in a concentration-dependent loss of Fet3p (Fig. 1D). These experiments demonstrate that iron has an effect on Fet3p independent of FET3 transcription. The post-translational regulation of the high affinity iron transport system was confirmed using immunofluorescence. Cells incubated in iron-depleted medium showed fluorescent staining of the cell surface, whereas Δfet3 cells stained with the same anti-Fet3p antibody showed no fluorescence (Fig. 2A). Addition of iron for 2 h resulted in the disappearance of Fet3p fluorescence. Expression of FET3 regulated by the GAL10 promoter leads to abundant Fet3p on the cell surface, and there was little change in the surface expression of Fet3p when galactose-grown cells were incubated in glucose-containing medium. Upon addition of iron, there was a dramatic decrease in fluorescence (data not shown). We generated strains containing an integrated FET3-GFP. As shown previously, addition of an epitope to either Fet3p or Ftr1p does not alter their ability to transport iron (17Severance S. Chakraborty S. Kosman D.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of iron also resulted in the loss of surface fluorescence in cells that had a chromosomal copy of FET3 with a carboxyl-terminal GFP (Fig. 2B). The loss of Fet3p was confirmed by Western analysis. Both components of the high affinity iron transport system, Fet3p and Ftr1p, have to be synthesized simultaneously for appropriate cell surface targeting (2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In the absence of Fet3p, Ftr1p does not localize to the surface and is degraded, as is Fet3p in the absence of Ftr1p. These results suggest that Fet3p and Ftr1p form a complex. Based on the observation that iron induced the loss of Fet3p, we asked whether iron also induced the loss of Ftr1p. We generated strains containing an integrated FTR1-CFP, because published studies show the utility of this fusion protein (17Severance S. Chakraborty S. Kosman D.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Frt1p-CFP permitted those cells to grow on low iron media, indicating that the protein was functional. When Ftr1p-CFP-expressing cells were incubated with high iron there was a loss of cell surface Ftr1p-CFP fluorescence (Fig. 2C). The predicted molecular mass of Ftr1p is 45.7 kDa, and addition of CFP would add 27 kDa. Our data show Ftr1p-CFP migrating on SDS-PAGE with a predicted molecular mass of 70 kDa, which is close to the predicted size of the fusion protein. We took advantage of mutant cell lines to show that the loss of surface Fet3p was due to internalization and vacuolar degradation. A deletion of END4 attenuates but does not completely inhibit endocytosis, as shown by decreased uptake of the fluorescent dye FM4–64 (18Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In Δend4 cells, the iron-induced loss of surface Fet3p was reduced (Fig. 3A). In cells that lack the vacuolar protease Pep4p, the iron-induced loss of cell surface fluorescence correlated with the appearance of fluorescence in the vacuole (Fig. 3B). The targeting of many cell surface proteins to the vacuoles requires their sorting in the multivesicular body (19Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Vta1p is a class E protein involved in multivesicular body sorting (20Yeo S.C. Xu L. Ren J. Boulton V.J. Wagle M.D. Liu C. Ren G. Wong P. Zahn R. Sasajala P. Yang H. Piper R.C. Munn A.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3957-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Shiflett S.L. Ward D.M. Huynh D. Vaughn M.B. Simmons J.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10982-10990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In iron-exposed Δvta1 cells, Fet3p was not degraded and was found at the plasma membrane as well as in a class E prevacuolar compartment (Fig. 3C). The Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system is highly specific for iron and will not transport other transition metals. Cells with a deletion of PEP4 (Δpep4) were incubated overnight in low iron medium and then exposed to different transition metals. At a concentration of 50 μm, only iron led to the vacuolar accumulation of Fet3p. Incubation of cells in metals such as Cu+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ in concentrations as high as 50 μm did not lead to internalization of Fet3p (Fig. 4). These results show that internalization of surface Fet3p is specific for iron. Entry of most plasma membrane proteins into the vacuole through the multivesicular body is a consequence of their being ubiquitinated. We therefore examined whether either Fet3p or Ftr1p was ubiquitinated. Cells expressing either Fet3p-GFP or Ftr1p-CFP were incubated in the presence of iron for 2 h and harvested, and detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. No ubiquitin was seen in the immunoprecipitate from Fet3p-GFP-expressing cells, but ubiquitin was found in extracts from Ftr1p-CFP-expressing cells (Fig. 5A). Ubiquitin could be seen on Ftr1p-CFP from cells grown in low iron medium; however, the addition of iron resulted in a significant increase in ubiquitin levels. Immunoprecipitated Ftr1p (detected by Western analysis) had an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa, much lower than that of Ftr1p-CFP seen in extracts of cells probed by Western analysis. We think that it is likely that the lower molecular mass results from proteolytic cleavage occurring during immunoprecipitation, because we did not observe this change in molecular mass prior to immunoprecipitation (compare Figs. 2B and 5A). We confirmed the presence of ubiquitin on Ftr1p by taking advantage of cells transformed with a plasmid containing a copper regulated (CUP1) ubiquitin with a carboxyl-terminal c-myc epitope. Cells were grown in high copper-containing medium to induce the expression of ubiquitin-c-myc, and detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated using antibodies to GFP. Again, no ubiquitin was seen in immunoprecipitates from Fet3p-GFP cells, but ubiquitin was seen in immunoprecipitates from Ftr1p-CFP cells (Fig. 5B). We observed that Ftr1p was ubiquitinated in both low and high iron medium with multiple ubiquitin-containing bands. Other plasma membrane proteins have been found to be hyper-ubiquitinated in cells overexpressing ubiquitin (15Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). If ubiquitination of Ftr1p was responsible for the internalization of the Fet3p-Ftr1p complex, then we might expect increased internalization of hyper-ubiquitinated Ftr1p-CFP in low iron medium. In Fet3p-GFP- or Ftr1p-CFP-expressing cells incubated in low iron medium, fluorescence was found predominately on the cell surface. Under the same conditions, in cells expressing ubiquitin, fluorescence was now found in the vacuole. Addition of iron to cells overexpressing ubiquitin resulted in an increase in the rate of vacuolar accumulation of Fet3p-Ftr1p. These results suggest that ubiquitination of Ftr1p leads to internalization of the Fet3p-Ftr1p complex. Most plasma membrane transporters are ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p (for reviews see Refs. 19Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar and 22Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). To determine if Rsp5p is required for the iron-induced internalization of Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system, we utilized a yeast strain with a mutation in RSP5. We first confirmed that rsp5 cells showed a defect in ubiquitination by following the degradation of the high affinity amino acid transporter Gap1p. Wild type and rsp5 cells were transformed with a GAP1-GFP plasmid. In cells grown in ammonia-free (nitrogen-poor) media Gap1p is localized to the plasma membrane (15Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Soetens O. De Craene J.O. Andre B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43949-43957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Addition of ammonia results in the internalization of Gap1p-GFP and its localization in the vacuole, as seen by fluorescence or by the presence of cleaved GFP on Western blots. In the rsp5 cells, Gap1p-GFP is found at the plasma membrane and in a prevacuolar compartment (Fig. 6A). Western analysis of rsp5 extracts showed full-length Gap1p-GFP, whereas in wild type cells only GFP is seen, indicating that Gap1-GFP is degraded. Gitan and Eide (4Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) reported a decrease in the Zn2+-mediated internalization and degradation of the high affinity zinc transporter Zrt1p in rsp5 cells. We confirmed that result, as shown in Fig. 6B. To determine if Rsp5 was necessary for the iron-induced degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p, we generated an rsp5 strain with an integrated FET3-GFP or FTR1-CFP. We were surprised to find no reduction in iron-induced internalization or degradation of Fet3p or Ftr1p in rsp5 cells (Fig. 6C). It is possible that the rsp5 mutant retains sufficient activity to ubiquitinate Ftr1p. We therefore took advantage of a temperature-sensitive allele of RSP5 (rsp5-1), which shows a severe defect in ubiquitination (24Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We confirmed that rsp5-1 has a temperature-sensitive defect in ubiquitination by showing a severe alteration in α-factor-mediated internalization of Ste2p-GFP (Fig. 6D). Fet3p-GFP showed no of iron-dependent loss in rsp5-1 cells at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 6E). These results suggest that Rsp5p is not required for the iron-induced loss of the high affinity iron transport system. We considered three mechanisms to explain how iron signals the internalization and degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p: a signal generated by iron at the cell surface, a signal generated by iron inside the cell, or a signal generated as a consequence of movement of iron through the transport system. To test these possibilities, we transformed a Δfet3Δpep4 strain with a GAL10-regulated allele of FET3 that was unable to transport iron due to a mutation in one of the amino acids that ligate the Type 1 copper (25Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22415-22419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in galactose to induce the expression of the mutant Fet3p. Although the inactive Fet3p is still translocated to the cell surface, incubation of cells with high levels of iron did not result in the degradation of the mutant Fet3p, as assessed by either Western blot analysis (data not shown) or by immunofluorescence (Fig. 7A). We then examined the effect of mutations in Ftr1p by expressing a form of Ftr1p that had defective iron transport. A mutation in the putative iron binding REXLE domain of Ftr1p does not prevent Ftr1p and Fet3p from being localized to the cell surface but reduces iron transport by ∼80% (17Severance S. Chakraborty S. Kosman D.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When exposed to high iron, the degradation of the transport system was reduced compared with wild type cells (Fig. 7B). The concentration of media iron in these experiments was high, because it was sufficient to support the growth of Δfet3 cells but was also sufficient to inhibit transcription of a FET3lacZ reporter construct in Δfet3 cells (data not shown). To further show that a Fet3-Ftr1p transport system is required for iron-induced internalization, we took advantage of cells with a deletion in the GEF1 gene. Gef1p is a voltage-regulated chloride channel present in the post-Golgi compartment in which apo-Fet3p is copper-loaded (14Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Gaxiola R.A. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the absence of Gef1p, apo-Fet3p is not copper-loaded but is still targeted to the cell surface. Cell surface apo-Fet3p, lacks multicopper oxidase activity and is unable to transport iron. Incubation of Δgef1 cells with iron did not lead to the degradation of apo-Fet3p (Fig. 8). Apo-Fet3p on the cell surface can be copper-loaded by incubation of cells at 0 °C in the presence of Cl–,Cu+, and reduced pH (14Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Copper loading of apo-Fet3p resulted in increased iron transport activity and increased multicopper oxidase activity. Once copper-loaded, addition of iron leads to the internalization and degradation of Fet3p. These results demonstrate that an active iron transport system is required for iron to induce the internalization of Fet3p-Ftr1p. Extracellular iron is not the signal for the internalization and degradation of the high affinity iron transport system. S. cerevisiae can acquire iron through the low affinity iron transport system, Fet4p, as well as through siderophore-iron transporters. There are two separate routes by which S. cerevisiae can acquire iron provided by iron-siderophore complexes (27Lesuisse E. Simon-Casteras M. Labbe P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Kaplan J. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The first route involves reduction of siderophore-iron complexes at the cell surface followed by the uptake of iron by the Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system. The impermeable Fe(II) chelator BPS can inhibit uptake of iron by this route. The second route of uptake of siderophore iron involves transport of the siderophore iron complex through a siderophore transporter. This route of iron acquisition cannot be inhibited by BPS. In the presence of high concentrations of BPS, yeast can grow on siderophore-iron complexes (28Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Kaplan J. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 29Kosman D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Addition of high concentrations of ferrioxamine-iron to cells grown in BPS did not lead to the internalization of Fet3p-Ftr1p (Fig. 9A). The same concentration of ferrioxamine-iron, however, can provide enough iron to support the growth of cells and to prevent the expression of a FET3lacZ reporter construct (Fig. 9B). It may be possible that the amount of siderophore-iron accumulated within cells may be enough to suppress the transcription of the iron-regulon but is insufficient to induce the internalization of Fet3p-Ftr1p. To examine the effect of intracellular iron on the degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p, we took advantage of the observation that, in the absence of high affinity, iron transport system cells increase the expression of the low affinity transition metal transporter Fet4p (30Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As shown above, Δgef1 cells do not internalize Fet3p-Ftr1p. At low concentrations of media iron wild type cells accumulated more iron than Δgef1 cells (Fig. 9C). This is expected, because Δgef1 cells do not have a functional high affinity iron transport system. As media iron increases, Δgef1 cells showed a greater accumulation of iron than wild type cells. Increased iron accumulation reflects the increased expression of the Fet4p low affinity iron transporter on Δgef1 cells and low levels of Fet4p on wild type cells. Even in the face of greater than wild type levels of cellular iron, no degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p was observed (see Fig. 8). These results suggest that intracellular iron does not provide the signal for the internalization of Fet3p-Ftr1p. Transcriptional regulation of the high affinity iron transport system, comprising the products of the FET3 and FTR1 genes, by the transcription factor Aft1p has been well described (3Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 31Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that Fet3p and Ftr1p are regulated post-translationally, as iron induces the internalization and degradation of both Fet3p and Ftr1p. The simultaneous synthesis of Fet3p and Ftr1p is required for their appropriate targeting to the cell surface suggesting that these molecules are in a complex (2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 8Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The observation that iron induces the simultaneous internalization of both Fet3p and Ftr1p provides further support for the view that these two proteins exist in an obligate complex. Iron-induced internalization of the iron transport system is consistent with studies showing post-translational regulation of copper (5Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), zinc (4Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4863-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) transport systems. For both iron and zinc transport systems, transcriptional regulation is more sensitive than post-translational regulation. Iron, at concentrations as low as 10 μm, can reduce transcription of FET3 by >90%, whereas the same concentration only had minimal effects on protein levels. Ubiquitination is the signal that targets most membrane proteins for degradation (19Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 22Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Ftr1p can be ubiquitinated and that ubiquitination is required for degradation, because deletions of genes required for sorting into the multivesicular body pathway prevent the vacuolar localization of Fet3p-Ftr1p. Most plasma membrane proteins are ubiquitinated by Rsp5p (22Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Rsp5p, in combination with Bsd2p, is responsible for ubiquitination of the Mn2+ transporter Smf1p in the biosynthetic pathway (36Hettema E.H. Valdez-Taubas J. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The rate of degradation of the amino acid transporter Gap1p and the zinc transporter Zrt1p was severely reduced in rsp5 cells. It was surprising to find that the iron-induced degradation of Fet3p-Ftr1p was not affected in rsp5 cells. Furthermore, no iron-induced change in surface Fet3p was seen at the restrictive temperature in cells that had temperature-sensitive allele of RSP5, although effects were seen on the internalization of Ste2p. These results suggest that a ubiquitin ligase other than Rsp5p is required for the ubiquitination of Ftr1p. Given that metals can induce the internalization of surface transporters via ubiquitination leading to transporter degradation, what is the signal that leads to ubiquitination? The metal-induced event that leads to Rsp5p-mediated ubiquitin addition in Smf1p may be a conformational change in the transporter resulting from transport of the metal (36Hettema E.H. Valdez-Taubas J. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutations that abolish transport activity for Smf1p abolish metal-induced internalization. These studies suggest that Rsp5p (in combination with Bsd2p) recognizes alterations in the hydrophobic domain of membrane proteins. Transport of substrate might be expected to lead to perturbation in the lipid bilayer resulting from movements in the transporter as substrate is passed through the bilayer. This is an attractive model for post-translational regulation of the iron transport system, because it would correlate transport activity with both cellular metal requirement and transcriptional regulation of the high affinity iron transporter. In conditions of iron sufficiency, iron transport will lead to degradation of the transporter. In the face of iron insufficiency, even though transport of iron increases the rate of degradation of the transporter, the increased degradation rate will be offset by increased transcription of the transporter. Linking transport activity to degradation rate provides a simple feedback mechanism that ensures tight control of cytosolic metal levels, as well as assuring the specificity of membrane targeting to the specific transporter. The demonstration that the Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system must be active to effect iron-induced internalization indicates that cell surface iron is not the signal for internalization/ubiquitination. There are two issues that must be resolved before accepting a model for iron-induced internalization in which the movement of iron through the channel is responsible for ubiquitination. First, why are high concentrations of iron required for post-translational regulation? The Km for the Fet3p-Ftr1p transport system is in the sub-micromolar (0.15–0.2 μm) range (9Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), yet much higher concentrations of iron (>50 μm) are required for substantial rates of transporter degradation. Second, what is the ubiquitin ligase responsible for “marking” Ftr1p? We have ruled out Rsp5p, although it is formally possible that, even in the rsp5 mutant strain or the temperature-sensitive rsp5-1 strain, residual enzyme activity is sufficient to ubiquitinate Ftr1p. The best way to show that Rsp5p is not required is to identify the ubiquitin ligase that is required. Those studies are in progress. We thank Drs. David Eide (University of Wisconsin), Chris Kaiser (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Linda Hicke (Northwestern), and Howard Riezman (University of Basel) for their generous gifts of plasmids, cells, and antibodies."

Pma1p constitutes a major cargo of the secretory pathway and thus serves as an excellent model to study plasma membrane biogenesis. We have previously shown that newly synthesized Pma1p is mistargeted to the vacuole in an elo3Δ mutant that affects the synthesis of the ceramide-bound C26 very long chain fatty acid (Eisenkolb, M., Zenzmaier, C., Leitner, E., and Schneiter, R.

Remarkably, a block at various steps of sterol biosynthesis, a complete block in sterol synthesis, or the substitution of internally synthesized ergosterol by externally supplied ergosterol or even by cholesterol does not affect Pma1p biogenesis or its association with detergent-resistant membrane domains (lipid “rafts”). However, a block in sphingolipid synthesis or any perturbation in the synthesis of the ceramide-bound C26 very long chain fatty acid results in mistargeting of newly synthesized Pma1p to the vacuole. Mistargeting correlates with a lack of newly synthesized Pma1p to acquire detergent resistance, suggesting that sphingolipids with very long acyl chains affect sorting of Pma1p to the cell surface.

Integral membrane proteins destined to the cell surface enter the membrane in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALA, δ-aminolevulinic acid; IPC, inositolphosphorylceramide; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALA, δ-aminolevulinic acid; IPC, inositolphosphorylceramide; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and are then transported along the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. Along this route, the quality of the transported cargo is monitored at several steps to ensure that only functional proteins are delivered to the cell surface. Surface delivery of membrane proteins is likely coupled to expansion of the plasma membrane itself, implying that transport and sorting of proteins may be linked to that of lipids. Whereas the mechanisms that survey protein sorting and quality control are being studied intensively, the fate of lipids along this route and their possible roles in protein sorting and maturation are less well understood (1Opekarova M. Robl I. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J.

The proton pumping H+-ATPase, Pma1p, is an abundant and long-lived polytopic membrane protein of the yeast plasma membrane. Due to its abundance at the cell surface, Pma1p constitutes a major cargo of the secretory pathway and thus may serve as a model to study plasma membrane biogenesis (3Morsomme P. Slayman C.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29613-29616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pma1p is biosynthetically inserted into the ER membrane, where it homo-oligomerizes to form a 1.8-MDa complex that resists extraction by detergents (5Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This protein-lipid complex is then packaged into a larger subclass of COPII transport vesicles that contain Lst1p instead of Sec24p (6Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). From the Golgi complex, Pma1p is transported to the cell surface by a branch of the secretory pathway that does not intersect with endosomes (7Harsay E. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Gurunathan S. David D. Gerst J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, Pma1p becomes stabilized and occupies domains that are distinct from those occupied by the arginine/H+ symporter Can1p (9Malinska K. Malinsky J. Opekarova M. Tanner W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4427-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Similar to the synthesis of integral membrane proteins, the synthesis of sphingolipids commences in the ER, where serine palmitoyl transferase catalyzes the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form a long chain base. The long chain base then condenses with a C26 very long chain fatty acid to form ceramide in a reaction that requires LAG1, LAC1, and LIP1 (10Schorling S. Vallee B. Barz W.P. Riezman H. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A.

From the ER, ceramide is transported both by vesicular and non-vesicular routes to the Golgi, where it is converted to sphingolipids (13Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mature sphingolipids are then transported to the plasma membrane, where they are highly enriched (15Funato K. Vallee B. Riezman H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15105-15114Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

The ceramide-bound C26 very long acyl chain is synthesized by elongation of saturated long chain fatty acids by an ER-associated acyl chain elongation complex containing Elo2p/Fen1p, Elo3p/Sur4p, Tsc13p, Ybr159p, and soluble factors such as palmitoyl-CoA (Acb1p) and malonyl-CoA (synthesized by Acc1p), which provide the substrates for elongation (18Oh C.S.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the very long chain fatty acid substitution on the fungal ceramide is unknown, but it has been speculated that the length of the transmembrane domain of proteins along the secretory pathway may increase to match bilayers of increasing “thickness” (14Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In such a model, the abundance of C26-containing lipids may determine the thickness of membranes along the secretory pathway. A relationship between Pma1p biogenesis and lipid synthesis is indicated by a number of observations. Long chain base or ceramide synthesis is required for oligomerization and raft association of Pma1p in the ER (5Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of Pma1p, however, is not required for ER export or surface delivery but might be important for stabilization of the protein once it has reached the cell surface (5Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, raft association of Pma1p is important for its proper surface targeting and for the subsequent stabilization of the protein at the cell surface (23Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 25Gong X. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9104-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that newly synthesized Pma1p is mistargeted to the vacuole in a mutant that affects acyl chain elongation and hence C26 synthesis (elo3/sur4) (26Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to characterize the role of lipids and particularly that of the C26 very long chain fatty acid in surface transport of Pma1p in more detail. Pulse-chase analyses to follow Pma1p biogenesis in various lipid biosynthetic mutants indicate that any reduction in the efficiency of the fatty acid elongation pathway results in destabilization of newly synthesized Pma1p. These results suggest that ceramide levels and/or their substitution with saturated very long chain fatty acids is important for proper routing of Pma1p to the cell surface.

To generate double mutants with pep4Δ, a pep4::LEU2 disruption cassette (pTS17; Tom Stevens, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR) was cut with BamHI and used for transformation of elongase mutants. PEP4 disruption was confirmed by PCR and a plate assay for carboxypeptidase Y activity. To generate the hem1Δ mutant, the plasmid pHEM1-LEU2 containing the hem1::LEU2 disruption cassette (kindly provided by I. Hapala, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic) was cut with BamHI/HindIII to release the disruption cassette, and transformants were selected on minimal media without leucine but supplemented with ALA. Correct insertion of the disruption cassette at the HEM1 locus was confirmed by phenotypic analysis, i.e. growth on ALA-supplemented media, but no growth on non-supplemented media. The plasmid containing a GFP-tagged version of Pma1p was kindly provided by A. Breton (Institut de Biochimie et Genetique Cellulaires, Bordeaux, France) (28Balguerie A. Bagnat M. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Breton A.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Generation of Anti-Pma1p Antisera—To generate antibodies against Pma1p, plasma membranes were isolated from wild-type cells by fractionation over a sucrose density gradient (29Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and the region corresponding to Pma1p was excised and used to immunize rabbits provided and maintained by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Pulse-chase Analysis—For pulse-chase analysis, cells were grown to A600 = ∼1 in minimal media lacking cysteine and methionine; unless otherwise noted the culture was then split and pre-incubated at either 24 °C or 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were pulsed with 100 μCi/ml EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (∼1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min. Chase was initiated by addition of chase solution (100×; 0.3% cysteine, 0.3% methionine, 300 mm ammonium sulfate). At each time point, 5 A600 units of cells were removed, placed on ice, and arrested with 20 mm NaN3/NaF. Cells were centrifuged; resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin A, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin; and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. SDS was added to 1%, and the lysate was incubated at 45 °C for 10 min. The lysate was diluted by addition of 800 μl of TNET (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-Pma1p antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, visualized with a phosphorimager, and quantified using the Quantify One software (Bio-Rad). Detergent resistance of newly synthesized Pma1p was examined as previously described (25Gong X. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9104-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Lysates of labeled cells (3–4 A600 equivalents) were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS. Detergent concentrations in aliquots of total, supernatant, and pellet samples were adjusted for immunoprecipitation. All pulse-chase analyses were performed at least two times with essentially the same results. Deviations between independent experiments were generally <10%. Fluorescence Microscopy—In vivo localization of GFP-tagged Pma1p was performed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with an Axio-Cam charge-coupled device camera and AxioVision 3.1 software. Lipid Analysis—Sterol synthesis was monitored by labeling cells with 10 μCi/ml l-[methyl-3H]methionine (85 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in methanol, and non-saponifiable lipids were extracted with heptane and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) using cyclohexane:diethylether:glacial acetic acid (40: 159:1, v/v/v) as solvent system. Incorporation of radiolabel into newly synthesized sterols was quantified by one-dimensional radioscanning with a Berthold Tracemaster 40 Automatic TLC-Linear Analyzer, and plates were visualized using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Synthesis of Inositolphosphorylceramide Is Required for Surface Delivery of Pma1p—The fact that long chain base synthesis is required for Pma1p biogenesis, together with our previous observation that Pma1p is conditionally destabilized in an elo3Δ/sur4Δ mutant, indicates that Pma1p biogenesis is lipid-dependent (5Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22395-22401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine this lipid requirement in more detail, we first examined Pma1p stability in wild-type cells treated with inhibitors of essential steps along the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1). Myriocin (20 μg/ml) was used to block long chain base synthesis, fumonisin B1 (72 μg/ml) was used to block ceramide production, and aureobasidin A (2 μg/ml) was used to inhibit the conversion of ceramide to inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC) (30Horvath A.

Cells were pre-incubated with each of these drugs for 15 min at 24 °C, split, incubated at either 24 °C or 37 °C for 15 min, and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 5 min in the presence of the drugs. The stability of newly synthesized Pma1p was then monitored 0, 30, and 60 min after the addition of unlabeled chase solution. This analysis revealed that Pma1p is degraded in cells treated with each one of these inhibitors, indicating that sphingolipid synthesis up to IPC is required for stable production of Pma1p. The shift to 37 °C for 15 min was included to replicate the conditions under which Pma1p is degraded in elo3Δ mutants, and under the experimental regime used here, the temperature shift was required to destabilize Pma1p (Fig. 2A) (26Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of drug action was not limited by the time of drug pre-incubation because even 1 h of drug pre-treatment did not result in any significant destabilization of newly synthesized Pma1p when cells remained at 24 °C (data not shown).Fig. 2Inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis induces conditional turnover of newly synthesized Pma1p.A, wild-type cells (BY4742) were cultivated in media lacking methionine and cysteine at 24 °C. Cells were incubated with myriocin (20 μg/ml), fumonisin B (72 μg/ml), or aureobasidin A (2 μg/ml) for 15 min at 24 °C, split, and incubated in the presence of drugs at either 24 °C or 37 °C prior to pulse-chase analysis and immunoprecipitation. Quantification of Pma1p levels is shown in the graphs. B, PEP4 mutant cells (YRS1546) were incubated with the indicated drugs at 24 °C for 15 min, shifted to 37 °C for 15 min, and pulse-labeled. Samples were removed at the indicated time points after chase addition and split into a total fraction (T) and a fraction that was extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. The detergent fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield a detergent-resistant pellet (P) and a soluble (S) fraction. Pma1p was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Quantification of Pma1p levels in the detergent-resistant pellet as a function of temperature and time is shown in the graphs. The data shown in A and B represent one of two independent experiments with essentially the same results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) lcb1-100 and elo3Δ affect detergent solubility of newly synthesized Pma1p (5Lee M.C.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). lcb1-100 encodes a temperature-sensitive subunit of the serine palmitoyl transferase and can be employed to conditionally block long chain base synthesis (33Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schröder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a block in sphingolipid biosynthesis also affects detergent solubility of newly synthesized Pma1p, the fate of Pma1p was examined in pep4Δ mutant cells, which lack a major vacuolar hydrolase and thus fail to degrade Pma1p that has been mistargeted to the vacuole. Cells were treated with inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis and pulse-labeled at either 24 °C or 37 °C, and the membrane pellets were extracted with cold Triton X-100 to generate detergent-soluble and detergent-resistant pellet fractions. Pma1p was then immunoprecipitated from these fractions, and the proportion of Pma1p was compared with a non-detergent-treated control (total). This analysis revealed that in wild-type cells, a large proportion (>50%) of newly synthesized Pma1p already becomes detergent-resistant at 5 min after pulse-labeling, and this pool of Pma1p further increases over time (Fig. 2B). In cells treated with the inhibitors and pulse-labeled at 37 °C, however, the majority of newly synthesized Pma1p was present in the detergent-soluble fraction at the 5 min time point, and only a small increase in the proportion of Pma1p that resisted detergent extraction was observed over time. This loss of detergent resistance was temperature-dependent because it was not observed when cells were labeled and chased at 24 °C. Taken together, the results of this analysis indicate that drug-induced mistargeting of newly synthesized Pma1p is temperature-dependent and correlates with the failure of Pma1p to acquire detergent resistance. The pharmacological block in sphingolipid synthesis thus results in the same conditional phenotype as previously observed in an elo3Δ mutant (26Eisenkolb M. Zenzmaier C. Leitner E. Schneiter R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4414-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Defects or a Block in Sterol Synthesis Does Not Affect Pma1p Biogenesis—Sphingolipids associate with sterols to form membrane domains that resist detergent extraction (34Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar). To test whether synthesis of the fungal sterol, ergosterol, is important for Pma1p biogenesis and acquisition of detergent resistance, the stability of newly synthesized Pma1p was examined in viable mutants in the post-squalene part of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (35Lees N.D. Bard M. Kirsch D.R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 33-47PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis revealed that Pma1p was stable in all erg mutants tested (erg24Δ, erg3Δ, erg4Δ, erg5Δ) (Fig. 3A). To determine whether a block in ergosterol biosynthesis as imposed by terbinafine, an inhibitor of the fungal squalene epoxidase (36Jandrositz A. Turnowsky F. Hogenauer G. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), affects Pma1p biogenesis, cells that lack endogenous steryl esters due to mutations in the two steryl ester synthetases, ARE1 and ARE2 (37Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), were treated with terbinafine (30 μg/ml) for different periods of time, and turnover of Pma1p was examined by pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation. are1Δ are2Δ double mutant cells were employed to prevent the rapid replenishment of a depleted ergosterol pool by steryl ester hydrolysis (38Koffel R. Tiwari R. Falquet L. Schneiter R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1655-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Pma1p stability was unaffected in cells treated with terbinafine for up to 4 h prior to pulse-chase labeling (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, endogenous synthesis of ergosterol is completely blocked, as determined by labeling cells with [3H]methionine and the analysis of radiolabeled ergosterol (Fig. 3C). Pulse-chase analysis followed by detergent extraction revealed that Pma1p acquired detergent resistance even in cells that were blocked in ergosterol synthesis (Fig. 3C). To examine whether Pma1p synthesized under these conditions is indeed transported to the cell surface rather than accumulated in an intracellular location, we examined the subcellular distribution of a GFP-tagged version of Pma1p. erg mutants expressing Pma1p-GFP were cultivated for 2 h at 37 °C and then analyzed by fluo"
https://openalex.org/W2046615147,"Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation has been proposed to play an important role in regulating synaptic transmission. Here we show that LIN-23, the substrate binding subunit of a Skp1/Cullin/F Box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase, regulates the abundance of the glutamate receptor GLR-1 in the ventral nerve cord of C. elegans. Mutants lacking lin-23 had an increased abundance of GLR-1 in the ventral cord. The increase of GLR-1 was not caused by changes in the ubiquitination of GLR-1. Instead, SCF(LIN-23) regulates GLR-1 through the beta-catenin homolog BAR-1 and the TCF/Lef transcription factor homolog POP-1. We hypothesize that LIN-23-mediated degradation of BAR-1 beta-catenin regulates the transcription of Wnt target genes, which in turn alter postsynaptic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2101187809,"Second messengers generated from membrane lipids play a critical role in signaling and control diverse cellular processes. Despite being one of the most evolutionarily conserved of all the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isoforms, a family of enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, the mechanism of PLC-δ1 activation is still poorly understood. Here we report a novel regulatory mechanism for PLC-δ1 activation that involves direct interaction of the small GTPase Ral and the universal calcium-signaling molecule calmodulin (CaM) with PLC-δ1. In addition, we have identified a novel IQ type CaM binding motif within the catalytic region of PLC-δ1 that is not found in other PLC isoforms. Binding of CaM at the IQ motif inhibits PLC-δ1 activity, while addition of Ral reverses the inhibition. The overexpression of various Ral mutants in cells potentiates PLC-δ1 activity. Thus, the Ral-CaM complex defines a multifaceted regulatory mechanism for PLC-δ1 activation.

The binding of hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and other agonists to cell surface receptors transmits the extracellular signal across the cell membrane resulting in the production of intracellular secondary messengers. Once evoked, second messengers initiate a cascade of intracellular reactions that ultimately lead to the production of a wide variety of cellular responses. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; PLC-δ1CT, PLC-δ1 containing amino acids 647–756; PLC-IQ, PLC-δ1 amino acids 473–492; CaM, calmodulin; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3 or InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PLD, phospholipase D; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate; GDPβS, guanosine 5-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). family of enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) that results in the generation of second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3 or IP3) and diacylglycerol (1Williams R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). InsP3 is a universal calcium (Ca2+) mobilizing second messenger and diacylglycerol functions as an activator of protein kinase C. Presently, there are at least 13 known mammalian PLC isozymes that are divided into six classes (PLC-β1to β4, PLC-γ1 and γ2, PLC-δ1, PLC-δ3, PLC-δ4, PLC-ϵ, PLC-ζ, and PLC-η1 and -η2) (2Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 3Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

All the mammalian PLC enzymes are multisubunit proteins and share a common backbone. In all but PLC-ζ there is an N-terminal high affinity PIP2-binding region called the pleckstrin homology domain that is required for membrane targeting (6Katan M. Allen V.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is followed by four adjacent EF-hand domains, which are critical for catalytic activity (7Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Located between the EF-hand and the C-terminal C2 domain is the catalytic core, composed of the X and Y domains. X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that the X/Y domains converge in the three-dimensional structure to form two halves of a structural unit resembling a triosephosphate isomerase-like barrel structure (7Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). A disordered linker region containing several charged residues separates the X and Y domains. Cooperation of various regions in PLC-δ1 is highlighted in mutational studies showing that ablation of distal domains renders the enzyme inactive (8Ellis M.V. Carne A. Katan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Regulation of PLC-β, -γ, and -ϵ isoforms can be partly explained by the specific regions incorporated on top of the PLC-δ backbone structure. For example, PLC-β isoforms contain a long C-terminal extension that is required for interaction with α subunits of the Gq/11 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins or the Gβγ dimers (9Park D. Jhon D.Y. Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor) to their respective receptors results in the stimulation of the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. The protein-tyrosine kinase activity phosphorylates and activates PLC-γ by binding to the Src homology 2 or SH3 domains (2Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases can also phosphorylate and activate PLC-γ (2Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). PLC-ϵ contains a RasGEF domain at the N terminus and two Ras-associating domains at the C terminus necessary for activation by Ras-p21 (3Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The small GTPase Rho was also shown to activate PLC-ϵ but in a mechanism independent of the Ras-associating domains (11Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sperm-specific PLC-ζ isoform was found to trigger fertilizationlike Ca2+ oscillations in eggs (4Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro measurements demonstrated that, although enzymatic activity is lower, PLC-ζ has a 100-fold greater sensitivity to Ca2+ indicating that this isoform is active at Ca2+ concentrations equivalent to those in cells at the resting state (12Kouchi Z.

Suh P.G. Biochem. J. 2005; (epub BJ20041677.Feb.10)PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the role of PLC-δ1 is to amplify Ca2+-mediated signal transduction pathways initiated by the PLC-β,-γ, and -ϵ isoforms (14Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PLC-δ isoforms are coupled to membrane receptors is poorly understood. However, previous work suggests regulation of PLC-δ1 by two distinct mechanisms. The first mechanism requires the high molecular weight GTP-binding protein Gh (also known as transglutaminase II), which was shown to stimulate PLC-δ1 activity (15Feng J.F. Rhee S.G. Im M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The second route involves a protein similar to Rho-GAP that was also shown to stimulate PLC-δ1 activity (16Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism of PLC-δ1 activation is poorly understood but is believed to involve increases in intracellular calcium concentrations. Ral (RalA and RalB) is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases (17Chardin P. Tavitian A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The two Ral proteins share about 85% sequence identity with each other and about 50% identity with Ras-p21 (18Chardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RalA and -B differ primarily in the C-terminal region and, like other GTPases, function as molecular switches, which cycle between a GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive state (19Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). Ral proteins possess pivotal roles in diverse cell functions such as the control of cell proliferation (20Chien Y. White M.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), migration (21Gildea J.J. Harding M.A. Seraj M.J. Gulding K.M. Theodorescu D.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These proteins are also important partners in calcium and Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-mediated signal transduction pathways (29Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Clough R.R. Sidhu R.S. Bhullar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28972-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have shown that RalA and -B bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent and -independent manner (30Clough R.R. Sidhu R.S. Bhullar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28972-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent CaM-binding domains in target proteins share little sequence identity but many have some common characteristics. Typically CaM-binding sequences vary in length between 16 and 30 amino acids and have a propensity to form amphipathic α-helices with a hydrophobic and basic face (31Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 27: 33-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, CaM forms a tertiary structure that is distinct from the calcium-saturated state. The greatest structural change in the calcium-free CaM (apo-CaM) form occurs in the central linker region, which separates EF-hands I and II from EF-hands III and IV. Apo-CaM-binding proteins typically share a common motif known as the IQ motif (32Bahler M. Rhoads A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). IQ motifs also have amphipathic character with a hydrophobic and basic face and thus can interact with both apo-CaM and Ca2+/CaM. To characterize new signaling pathways for Ral, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify novel binding partners for this GTPase. We show here that Ral binds and promotes PLC-δ1 activity in vitro and in vivo. We also show that CaM binds and inhibits PLC-δ1 activity and Ral can reverse this inhibition. CaM inhibition of PLC-δ1 activity occurs through binding to a newly identified putative IQ motif located in the X/Y linker region of PLC-δ1. Direct inhibition of PLC-δ1 activity by the peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding IQ motif implicates the peptide also binds to an internal site in PLC-δ1. These studies point to a direct role for Ral-CaM in the regulation of PLC-δ1 enzyme activity. Plasmids and Chemicals—Rat PLC-δ1 in the pGEX-2T vector was generously provided by Dr. M. Katan (The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK), while the pRK5-[RalB] mutant vectors (RalB(V23), RalB(N28), RalB(V23,D49), RalB(V23,ΔN11), RalB(V23,ΔCAAX)) were provided by Dr. M. White (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Bovine brain Calmodulin and W-7·HCl were purchased from Calbiochem. Sepharose 4B-coupled calmodulin and pGEX-4T3 vector were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Lipofectamine 2000 and cell culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. The Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system 3 and all accompanying reagents including the human testes cDNA library were obtained from Clontech. Antibodies for hemagglutinin, RalA, RalB, Ras and PLC-β1 were obtained from BD Biosciences, while anti-calmodulin was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and phospholipase C-δ1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (goat polyclonal Clone C-20, catalog number sc-7521), BD Biosciences (mouse monoclonal catalog number 610357), and Upstate Biotechnology (mouse monoclonal clone S-11-2, catalog number 05-343). The predicted PLC-δ1 CaM-binding IQ motif peptide (NH2-VRSQVQHKPKEDKLKLVPELS-COOH) was custom synthesized by the University of Calgary Peptide Synthesis Service. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Yeast Two-hybrid and Library Screening—Clontech's yeast Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Human testes cDNA library in pACT2 vector was screened for potential protein-protein interactions with pGBKT7-[RalB] as bait (30Clough R.R. Sidhu R.S. Bhullar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28972-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Positive clones were restreaked on selective media (lacking histidine, adenine, leucine, and tryptophan) and their DNA isolated and sequenced. Plasmid Constructs—The isolated clone in the pACT2 vector was restricted with EcoRI and XhoI, and the resulting 700-bp fragment was purified following agarose gel electrophoresis. The insert was ligated into pGEX-4T3 using T4 Quick DNA ligation kit (New England Biolabs) at the same restriction sites for the expression of GST-tagged protein in Escherichia coli. This construct encodes amino acids 647–756 of PLC-δ1 (called PLC-δ1CT). Isolation of GST Fusion Proteins—Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5-α strain of E. coli cells using 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (33Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purity of the final protein preparation was assessed using SDS-PAGE. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin solution at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air (v/v) on 24-well, 35-mm, or 100-mm plates. Transfections—Mammalian expression vectors were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection, either 1 or 4 μg of DNA plus Lipofectamine was added to HeLa cells (∼70% confluent) in 24-well or 35-mm plates, respectively. Proteins were expressed overnight and treated or lysed in the appropriate buffers. Preparation of Membrane and Cytosolic Fractions—To prepare the cytosol and particulate fractions, pelleted cells were resuspended in fractionation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellet representing particulate proteins was solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in above buffer with the addition of 20% glycerol and 0.55% Triton X-100. The solubilized proteins were collected by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble cytosol fraction, which contains CaM but not Ral (33Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was used in some binding experiments. In Vitro Binding Assays—Guanine nucleotide loading was performed according to the method of Cantor et al. (34Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mm GTPγS or GDPβS was incubated with GST-Ral for 20 min at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 40 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mm MgCl2 (final concentration). Beads were washed with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. When necessary, GST was removed from the GST-Ral fusion protein by thrombin cleavage (2 units/ml) overnight at room temperature. The recombinant protein was recovered in the supernatant following centrifugation (33Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein was used immediately or aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. For binding experiments equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (∼50 μg) were used. To test binding of Ral or CaM to PLC-δ1, recombinant Ral (10 μm) or purified CaM (10 μm) or HeLa cell lysate (500 μg) was incubated with GST or GST-PLC-δ1CT for 2 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, plus protease inhibitor mixture). To investigate the binding of PLC-δ1CT to CaM directly, cytosol fractions (500 μg) were incubated with GST-PLC-δ1CT in fractionation buffer overnight at 4 °C. To establish binding of endogenous PLC-δ1 to Ral, GST-RalA or -RalB was incubated with HeLa cell lysates (500 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C in binding buffer. CaM binding assays were performed using 50 μl of calmodulin-Sepharose 4B beads or Sepharose 4B beads blocked with Tris buffer as described previously (30Clough R.R. Sidhu R.S. Bhullar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28972-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To confirm the dependence on Ca2+ for CaM binding to PLC-δ1, reactions were performed by incubating purified CaM with GST-PLC-δ1 overnight at 4 °C diluted in commercially available Ca2+ calibration buffers (Molecular Probes) exactly as described previously (35McCullar J.S. Larsen S.A. Millimaki R.A. Filtz R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33708-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For competition assays, the PLC-IQ peptide was resuspended in water and preincubated with GST-PLC-δ1 for 1 h at 4 °C. For binding assays with the PLC-IQ peptide as bait, the peptide (2.5 mg/ml) was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used in binding studies. At the end of the binding reactions, unbound proteins were washed with incubation buffer (including the appropriate Ca2+ and/or EGTA concentrations). Laemmli's sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) was added to the recovered beads. Samples were heated to 100 °C for 3 min, centrifuged briefly, and separated on 11% or 13% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membrane and detected by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. Calcium Concentration Determinations—Calcium concentrations were determined by measuring total calcium ions using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Free calcium concentrations were calculated, using the MAXCHELATOR software (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html) and adjusted with calcium concentrations obtained from atomic absorption data. PLC-δ1 Enzyme Assay—Phospholipase C-δ1 enzyme assay was performed by a modification of the method described previously (37Wahl M.I. Jones G.A. Nishibe S. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10447-10456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ziegelhoffer A. Tappia P.S. Mesaeli N. Sahi N. Dhalla N.S. Panagia V. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, (inositol-2-3H) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was mixed with unlabeled PIP2, dried by passing N2 gas (henceforth called [3H]PIP2), and then resuspended in 132 mm sodium cholate overnight. Just before the start of enzyme assays the substrate was diluted to bring the sodium cholate concentration to 116 mm. GST-PLC-δ1 was expressed in E. coli for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST-PLC-δ1 was purified and resuspended in reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 70 mm KCl plus 2 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm Ca2+ giving a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm). GST-PLC-δ1 protein was divided equally (40 μl, ∼100 μm) into test tubes. Prior to the start of the enzyme assay, Ral, PLC-IQ peptide, CaM, or W-7 was preincubated with GST-PLC-δ1 for 1 h at room temperature. Concentrations of Ral, PLC-IQ, CaM, and W-7 used were derived from preliminary experiments (Ral, PLC-IQ, and CaM) or from KD values suggested by manufacturers for established drug targets (W-7). Reactions were carried out by the addition of 20 μm [3H]PIP2 (20–30 dpm/pmol) at 37 °C for 2.5 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. Soluble [3H]IP3 was obtained in the supernatant following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Radioactivity was measured from an aliquot of the supernatant by liquid scintillation counting in 10 ml of Scintisafe (Fisher). To measure PLC-δ1 activity in vivo, cells overexpressing various Ral mutants were lysed in buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% sodium cholate) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation using 5 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-PLC-δ1 (Upstate Biotechnology, clone S-11-2) was performed overnight at 4 °C, and enzyme reactions were carried out on the immunoprecipitates as explained earlier. Statistical comparisons were made to control PLC-δ1 activity in the absence of any other treatments, which were performed at the same time as other experimental conditions. To characterize new signaling pathways for Ral, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify novel binding partners for this GTPase. Using the small GTPase RalB in a screen of the human testis cDNA library we detected several novel interacting clones. These were isolated and identified by DNA sequencing. One clone revealed a match to the C-terminal region (amino acids 647–756) of phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1CT). The yeast two-hybrid experiments were repeated with both RalA and RalB to confirm interaction with PLC-δ1. The positive colonies were re-streaked three times in high stringency media to ensure the propagation of the correct phenotype (Fig. 1A). Protein expression from the isolated clone was confirmed in the yeast using antibodies for hemagglutinin and PLC-δ1 (data not shown). The insert containing the PLC-δ1CT was isolated from the yeast plasmid and inserted in-frame into the GST expression vector pGEX-4T3. Expression of GST-PLC-δ1CT in E. coli was confirmed using two different antibodies for PLC-δ1 (Fig. 1B). To further confirm the interaction, GST-PLC-δ1CT was incubated with lysates from HeLa cells. Both RalB (data not shown) and RalA, but not Ras-p21 (Fig. 2A), was found to interact as determined using Western blotting. The addition of EGTA to the buffer showed slightly higher interaction. We also employed the reverse approach in which GST-RalA or -RalB was incubated with HeLa cell lysates. Western blotting using antibody to PLC-δ1 revealed binding does indeed occur to RalA and RalB but not GST (Fig. 2B). Results using purified recombinant RalA protein incubated with full-length GST-PLC-δ1 and GST-PLC-δ1CT provided similar results (Fig. 2C). The binding with full-length GST-PLC-δ1 was greater than with GST-PLC-δ1CT and higher in the presence of EGTA. In all cases no binding was seen to GST protein alone. There was no cross-reactivity of RalA antibody with GST- or GST-PLC-δ1 proteins (Fig. 2C). We and others (29Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Clough R.R. Sidhu R.S. Bhullar R.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that Ral is an important partner in calcium and Ca2+/calmodulin mediated signal transduction pathways. Also, PLC-δ1 is highly sensitive to calcium concentrations and can be activated at concentrations as low as 10 μm (40Kim Y.H. Park T.J. Lee Y.H. Baek K.J. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 41Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine the dependence of Ral binding to PLC-δ1 on calcium. GST-PLC-δ1CT was incubated with HeLa cell lysates containing various exogenous calcium concentrations. Binding of Ral to GST-PLC-δ1CT occurred at low levels of calcium (0.22 nm) and increased proportionally with higher free calcium concentrations (up to 17.0 μm), as determined quantitatively (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in the presence of EGTA, Ral binding to PLC-δ1 was not abolished and may be analogous with that seen with Apo-CaM (Ca2+-free CaM) binding to target proteins. Ral is known to interact with CaM (29Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Clough R.R. Sidhu R.S. Bhullar R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28972-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to determine whether CaM can bind PLC-δ1 as a complex with Ral. Reprobing the same blot with CaM antibody showed a nearly equal binding of CaM and Ral to GST-PLC-δ1CT at 17.0 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 3). The binding of PLC-δ1 to CaM could occur either directly or through Ral. This possibility was tested using GST-PLC-δ1CT incubated with HeLa cell cytosolic fractions (contains CaM but no Ral protein) (Fig. 3). However, no binding of GST-PLC-δ1CT to CaM was seen (data not shown) suggesting that the CaM detected in the complex was due to its association with Ral. We next wished to determine whether Ral or CaM affect PLC-δ1 activity. At a constant calcium concentration (10 μm), preincubation with 260 μm Ral increased PLC-δ1 activity by >20% (Fig. 4A). In contrast, preincubation with 20 μm CaM resulted in a 25% reduction in PLC-δ1 activity suggesting that CaM may also bind to PLC-δ1 directly in a region other than through the binding of CaM to Ral. When both Ral and CaM were preincubated with PLC-δ1 full activity was restored. Addition of the calmodulin antagonist W-7 to the reaction mixture fully reversed the inhibition of PLC-δ1 by CaM. However, W-7 alone also inhibited PLC-δ1 activity suggesting W-7 has affinity for PLC-δ1 (Fig. 4B). Since CaM alone inhibited PLC-δ1 activity we next screened the phospholipase C-δ1 sequence for potential CaM-binding domains using the CaM target data base (calcium.oci.utoron-to.ca/). The data base revealed a region with CaM binding potential (amino acids 473–492) located in the loop region separating the catalytic X (296–"

The signaling fraction of β-catenin is tightly controlled by the adenomatous polyposis coli-axin-glycogen synthase kinase 3β complex, which targets it for proteasomal degradation. It has been recently shown that Ca2+ release from internal stores results in nuclear export and calpain-mediated degradation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Here we have highlighted the critical relevance of constitutive calpain pathway in the control of β-catenin levels and functions, showing that small interference RNA knock down of endogenous calpain per se (i.e. in the absence of external stimuli) induces an increase in the free transcriptional competent pool of endogenous β-catenin. We further characterized the role of the known calpain inhibitors, Gas2 and Calpastatin, demonstrating that they can also control levels, function, and localization of β-catenin through endogenous calpain regulation. Finally we present Gas2 dominant negative (Gas2DN) as a new tool for regulating calpain activity, providing evidence that it counteracts the described effects of both Gas2 and Calpastatin on β-catenin and that it works via calpain independently of the classical glycogen synthase kinase 3β and proteasome pathway. Moreover, we provide in vitro biochemical evidence showing that Gas2DN can increase the activity of calpain and that in vivo it can induce degradation of stabilized/mutated β-catenin. In fact, in a context where the classical proteasome pathway is impaired, as in colon cancer cells, Gas2DN biological effects accounted for a significant reduction in proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer. β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein serving both as a structural element in cell adhesion and as a signaling component in the Wnt pathway, regulating embryogenesis and tumorigenesis.

Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). The three regulatory genes in this pathway most frequently mutated in human cancers are APC, β-catenin, and axin. Their mutations result in the accumulation of nonphosphorylated β-catenin, thereby constitutively activating gene transcription and promoting carcinogenesis (7Oving I.M. Clevers H.C. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 32: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling operates via cell surface receptors to stimulate also the activation of Gq pathway and the subsequent increase in intracellular calcium (8Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Li and Iyengar (9Li G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 20: 13254-13259Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) highlighted the consequences of activation of Gq signaling pathway showing that calcium release from internal stores results in μ-calpain-dependent degradation of β-catenin. Calpains are a large family of calcium-dependent intracellular proteases whose precise and limited cleavage of specific proteins, in concert with their endogenous inhibitor Calpastatin, is thought to play an integral regulatory aspect in various signaling pathways from cytoskeletal remodeling to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 10Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). In addition to Calpastatin, we have recently characterized Gas2 as an important calpain inhibitor (11Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Gas2 is a component of the microfilament system and colocalizes with actin fibers (12Brancolini C. Bottega S. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); it binds the calmodulin-like region of m-calpain (domain III and IV of large subunit) with its amino-terminal domain and with its carboxyl-terminal region exerts an inhibitory function (11Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The isolated amino-terminal region has been demonstrated to act as a dominant negative form of Gas2 (Gas2DN), being able to bind, but not to inhibit, calpain activity and to rescue in vivo the effects of Gas2 on calpain function. Here we underline the contribution of the calpain system to β-catenin degradation, showing that m-calpain, as regulated by the endogenous inhibitors Calpastatin and Gas2, can modulate β-catenin levels and activity in the absence of external stimuli. More importantly, we focused our attention on the properties of Gas2DN, which can abrogate both Gas2 and Calpastatin effects, providing biochemical evidence that it can stimulate calpain activity. The Gas2DN-mediated calpain activation was utilized in colon cancer cells, where β-catenin degradation via proteasome is impaired. We show that in this cellular context, the calpain system controls deregulated β-catenin and that the biological effects of Gas2DN account for a significant reduction in the proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells, therefore representing a potentially critical way to control deregulated β-catenin.

His6-tagged Gas2wt, His6-tagged Gas2DN, and His6-tagged Calpastatin were generated as described below under “Calpain Activity Assay.” Western Blot and Antibodies—Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures using the following primary antibodies: anti-β-catenin (C19220; Transduction Laboratories), anti-Gas2 antibody (12Brancolini C. Bottega S. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), anti-Calpastatin (monoclonal antibody-C-270), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), and anti-m-calpain polyclonal antibody (C0728) and anti-actin polyclonal antibody (A2066) from Sigma. Anti-GFP (Invitrogen):polyclonal GFP antiserum (Invitrogen). Stable Cell Lines—To obtain GFP-Gas2DN/HCT116 and GFP/HCT-116 cells, selection was performed for 2 weeks in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant colonies were clonally expanded, and expression of Gas2DN and GFP was analyzed by Western blot. Calpain Cleavage Assay in Vitro and in Vivo—In vitro cleavage assay was performed as previously described (11Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The in vivo protein assays were performed on HCT-116. Cell lysates were prepared freshly at 4 °C in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (15 min, 13,000 RPM, 4 °C), and the supernatant was used in β-catenin cleavage assay. 2 mm CaCl2 was added for endogenous m-calpain activation, and different aliquots of the samples were collected at the indicated time points. 8 mm EGTA was added to one of the samples to completely inhibit calcium-dependent calpain reaction. Inhibition of m-calpain Expression by RNAi—Small interfering RNA duplexes, si-m-calpain, were purchased from Dharmacon: siCONT 5′-AACCUUUUUUUUUGGGGAAAA-3′, si-m-calpain 5′-GUACCUCAACCAGGACUAC-3′, and siGENOME SMARTpool Upgrade MU-009979–00-0020 human CAPNS1 for calpain small subunit. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Immunofluorescence and BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—After transfection with the various plasmids, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (3% in phosphate-buffered saline) and then processed for immunofluorescence with 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science). For BrdUrd incorporation assay, 24 h after transfection cells were pulsed with 50 μm BrdUrd for 4 h and fixed with paraformaldehyde. To reveal incorporated BrdUrd, coverslips were treated with 50 mm NaOH for 30 s and immediately washed with phosphate-buffered saline. BrdUrd was revealed by anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (GH Healthcare) followed by incubation with rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a antibody (Southern Biotechnology). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Soft Agar Assay—For each cell pool, 30,000 cells were suspended in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and warmed to 37 °C. 200 μl of prewarmed (52 °C) 5% agarose/phosphate-buffered saline solution was mixed with the cell suspension and then layered into 60-mm dishes that were previously coated with 2 ml of 1% agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The agar was allowed to solidify at room temperature for 20 min before the addition of 2 ml of growth medium to each well. After 14 days, the colonies were counted. Subfractionation Experiments—Subfractionation experiments were performed as indicated by the manufacturer (ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit 539790; Calbiochem). Calpain Activity Assay—Recombinant His6-tagged Gas2 (pQE11Gas2wt), His6-tagged Gas2DN (pETM11Gas2DN), and His6-tagged Calpastatin (pETM11Calpastatin) were used to evaluate calpain activity in biochemical studies. To generate His6-tagged Gas2wt protein, full-length Gas2wt was subcloned from pGDSV7SGas2wt (12Brancolini C. Bottega S. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) into pQE11 vector using BamHI and HindIII sites. For the construction of His6-tagged Gas2DN and Calpastatin fusion proteins, specific oligonucleotides upstream and downstream containing, respectively, NcoI and BamHI or NcoI and XhoI sites were used to generate polymerase chain reaction fragments of Gas2DN or Calpastatin that were cloned in pETM11 vector. One unit of calpain activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme causing the production of 1 μmol acid-soluble NH2 revealed with fluorescamine and using acid-denatured globin as substrate (15Melloni E. Averna M. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 82-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rat skeletal muscle m-calpain activity was monitored after incubating for 3 min with His6-tagged recombinant proteins Gas2, Gas2DN, and Calpastatin in a calpain assay buffer containing 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, 50 μm CaCl2, and rat skeletal muscle m-calpain. Activity was measured 10 min after the addition of 1 mm calcium and 2 mg/ml denatured globin as previously described (15Melloni E. Averna M. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 82-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gas2 and Calpastatin, known calpain inhibitors, were used as control of calpain activity in the same assay. Constitutive Activity of Calpain in Vivo Regulates β-Catenin—To address the role of constitutive activity of calpain toward β-catenin, we designed small interference RNA (siRNA) to selectively knock down calpain levels. Because the two ubiquitous calpain isoforms, m- and μ-calpain, are functional only when associated with the common regulatory small subunit, we decided to design siRNA to selectively knock down the small regulatory subunit to block both calpain isoforms and a siRNA to specifically knock down m-calpain to address the relevance of this isoform in this context. The ability of the specific siRNAs (siSmall or si m-calpain) to down-regulate calpain protein levels was tested in U2OS cells, where expression of endogenous small subunit of calpain or of endogenous m-calpain was, respectively, almost completely abolished already at 24 h after specific silencing transfection (Fig. 1A). A scrambled siRNA (siControl) was used as control. To evaluate the effects of calpain siRNAs toward the activity of β-catenin, U2OS cells were transfected as indicated in Fig. 1B. The TOPflash construct is a β-catenin-sensitive promoter widely used as an indicator for binding of β-catenin to hTCF-4. The resulting complex is responsible for activating transcription of the TOPflash reporter (16Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). Data were normalized by cotransfection with a pCMV-Renilla luciferase vector, which controls for the variability in transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection, and Western blot analyses were carried out using the same lysates to monitor steady-state levels of endogenous or overexpressed β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 1B, down-regulation of calpain levels as induced either by siSmall or si m-calpain resulted in the stabilization and activation of both endogenous and overexpressed β-catenin. These results strengthen the argument for a role of the m-calpain isoform for the observed effects. As a negative control for the transcriptional competence of β-catenin, we used FOPflash reporter, which contains mutant Tcf-4 binding site, and this was not affected by β-catenin and siControl or siSmall/si m-calpain (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1Constitutive activity of calpain toward β-catenin. A, U2OS cells were transfected with siControl and siSmall (left panel) or siControl and si m-calpain (right panel). 24 and 48 h later, lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-small subunit of calpain (upper panel) and anti-actin (lower panel) antibodies in the first case and anti-m-calpain (upper panel) and anti-actin (lower panel) in the second case. B, U2OS cells were transfected as indicated. 24 h later, Western blot analysis was performed using anti-HA antibody (left panels) and an anti-β-catenin (right panels). Loading control was tested using anti-actin antibody (lower panels). Luc activity was determined in the same lysates by calculations of Top-Luc and Fop-Luc (as negative control). The data represent means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. C, U2OS cells were transfected with siControl and si-m-calpain. 36 h later cell fractionation was performed and cytoplasmic (C), membrane (M), and nuclear (N) fractions were analyzed. Western blot was performed using anti-β-catenin antibody or anti-c-Fos and anti-actin to check for fractionation efficiency. D, the same experiments as in panel C were performed in H1299 cells. E, confocal microscope image of U2OS cells transfected with HA-tagged β-catenin together with siControl (a) or si-m-calpain (b) and indicating change of β-catenin localization. Panels show two different corresponding fields of cells stained for β-catenin (red).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These observations suggest that, by regulating calpain and particularly the m-calpain isoform, the free cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin could be altered, inducing its translocation into the nucleus where it can function as a transcription factor. To confirm our hypothesis, we transfected U2OS cells with siControl and si m-calpain. 36 h after siRNA transfection, cell fractionation was performed and cytoplasmic (C), membrane (M), and nuclear (N) fractions were separately analyzed. Western blot analysis indicated that the increased levels of β-catenin after m-calpain down-regulation are significantly accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). The same results were obtained in the H1299 cell line (Fig. 1D) and by using siSmall (data not shown). Cellular localization of overexpressed β-catenin after si m-Calpain treatment was also tested by immunocytochemistry, and a supportive change in the nuclear localization was observed by knocking down calpain expression (Fig. 1E). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the calpain proteolytic system can alter the transcriptionally active fraction of β-catenin, thus representing a potential mechanism to regulate β-catenin in parallel to the proteasome. Gas2 and Calpastatin, the Two Endogenous Inhibitors of Calpain, Regulate the Levels and Function of β-Catenin—To better characterize the constitutive m-calpain function toward β-catenin, we decided to analyze the effects of both its endogenous inhibitors, Gas2 (11Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Calpastatin (10Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). As a first approach, we tested whether overexpression of Gas2 and Calpastatin might enhance the steady-state levels of β-catenin in vivo. Cotransfection of HA-tagged β-catenin with Gas2 (Fig. 2A, left panel) and Calpastatin (right panel) caused a substantial accumulation of β-catenin, indicating that calpain regulation by its inhibitors could function as a constitutive system to regulate β-catenin. As a next step we evaluated the transcriptional competence of stabilized β-catenin by determining the effect of Gas2 and Calpastatin overexpression on the ability of β-catenin to stimulate transcription from TCF-responsive elements. The relative luciferase activity (normalized by cotransfection with pCMV-Renilla luciferase) was significantly stimulated by overexpression of Gas2. A similar response was obtained with transfection of Calpastatin (Fig. 2B), suggesting that both Gas2 and Calpastatin overexpression can render β-catenin transcriptionally competent. As a control, we looked for the ability of Gas2 and Calpastatin to cause β-catenin translocation into the nucleus (Fig. 2C) where it can function as a transcription factor. We therefore transfected β-catenin into U2OS together with GFP-tagged Gas2, GFP-tagged Calpastatin, and GFP protein alone as negative control. 24 h after transfection, immunofluorescence analyses were performed to visualize β-catenin localization. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, the presence of both GFP-tagged Gas2 and GFP-tagged Calpastatin was able to relocalize the cytoplasmic β-catenin into the nucleus. Finally, to confirm that endogenous calpain is critical for the effect of Gas2 and Calpastatin on β-catenin stability, HA-tagged β-catenin levels were monitored after transfection in U2OS cells together with Gas2 or Calpastatin and SiControl or siSmall. Calpain silencing abrogated both Gas2 and Calpastatin effects on β-catenin stabilization, thus indicating the critical role for calpain in the Gas2 and Calpastatin regulation of β-catenin levels (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these data suggest that Gas2 and Calpastatin, as endogenous calpain inhibitors, play important roles in controlling β-catenin levels, localization, and transcriptional activity. Gas2DN Blocks Both Calpastatin and Gas2 Regulatory Arms on Calpain Activity—We have previously characterized Gas2DN as a dominant negative form of Gas2, demonstrating that it can still bind m-calpain without showing any inhibitory function (11Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to analyze the effects of Gas2DN on the levels and activity of transfected β-catenin. Gas2DN was transfected into U2OS cells together with β-catenin alone or β-catenin and Gas2. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, its overexpression reduced the levels of β-catenin and of the Gas2-dependent β-catenin stabilization. As a next step we evaluated the transcriptional competence of endogenous β-catenin by determining the effects of Gas2DN overexpression on the ability of β-catenin to stimulate transcription from TCF-responsive elements. We observed that Gas2DN significantly decreased β-catenin transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Altogether, the data indicating the relevance of m-calpain pathway in β-catenin regulation, together with the evidence that Gas2DN is able to down-regulate β-catenin levels and function (Fig. 3, A and B), prompted us to investigate whether Gas2DN interference with m-calpain activity could counteract not only Gas2 but also Calpastatin function, thus serving as a general reagent to control calpain pathway. As shown in Fig. 3C, in U2OS cells HA-β-catenin transcriptional activity as stimulated by Gas2 or Calpastatin coexpression was repressed in both cases by Gas2DN, and as expected HA-β-catenin levels, due to the presence of Gas2 or Calpastatin, were clearly reduced when Gas2DN was cotransfected. We therefore conclude that Gas2DN can also rescue Calpastatin effects on β-catenin stabilization. We decided to perform an in vitro assay to analyze whether the ability of Calpastatin to protect calpain-dependent β-catenin degradation could be abrogated by Gas2DN. As shown in Fig. 3D, whereas Calpastatin can efficiently block β-catenin degradation (compare lanes 4-6 with lanes 1-3), Gas2DN can effectively recover the inhibitory effect of Calpastatin on m-calpain (lanes 7-9). The same amount of in vitro translated (IVT) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase failed to show a similar result (data not shown). To provide final evidence of the calpain activator properties of Gas2DN, its effect on calpain activity was tested in a biochemical in vitro assay measuring calpain activity. Rat skeletal muscle m-calpain activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods” and was monitored in the presence of both the recombinant inhibitors Gas2wt and Calpastatin and in the presence of Gas2DN. Whereas the function of calpain, as can be observed in Fig. 3E, was efficiently blocked by its inhibitors Gas2 and Calpastatin, the presence of recombinant Gas2DN induced an increase in calpain activity, suggesting a potential activator role for this protein. With the same biochemical approach we confirmed in vitro the ability of Gas2DN to counteract the inhibitory effects of both Gas2 and Calpastatin (Fig. 3F). We therefore conclude that Gas2DN can disengage endogenous m-calpain from both its inhibitors, Gas2 and Calpastatin, possibly because both inhibitors share the same binding region on the calmodulin-like domain of m-calpain, as already described (11Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Takano E. Ma H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Calpain Regulates β-Catenin Functions Independently of GSK3β Activity and of the Proteasome—After showing Gas2/Calpastatin/Gas2DN as tools to regulate β-catenin levels and function via calpain, we investigated whether β-catenin could be regulated in the absence of GSK3β, a critical component of the multimolecular complex responsible for targeting β-catenin to the proteasome (18Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). As a first approach, the Gas2DN effect as a general calpain activator was analyzed on stabilized β-catenin in U2OS cells treated with LiCl, a known inhibitor of GSK3β activity (19Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Gas2DN overexpression was still able to reduce β-catenin levels (Fig. 4A) as well as to decrease its transcriptional competence (Fig. 4B), indicating that its effect on β-catenin is a GSK3β-independent process. However, because β-catenin can also be degraded in a proteasome-dependent, but GSK3β-independent, mechanism (20Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 21Liu J. Stevens J. Rote C.A. Yost H.J. Hu Y. Neufeld K.L. White R.L. Matsunami N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), we investigated whether calpain is truly acting in a proteasome-independent manner by using lactacystin as a proteasome-specific inhibitor. To set the conditions we followed the well characterized p53 protein stability as an independent marker of proteasome inhibition. In U2OS cells we found that p53 reaches its highest levels 8 h after lactacystin treatment and maintains such levels for 24 h (data not shown), suggesting that during this time the proteasome system can be considered significa"

Although the activation of caspase-2 has been shown to occur in a large protein complex, the mechanisms of caspase-2 activation remain unclear. Here we report a regulatory role of Bcl-2 on caspase-2 upstream of mitochondria. Stress stimuli, including ceramide and etoposide, caused caspase-2 activation, mitochondrial damage followed by downstream caspase-9 and -3 activation, and cell apoptosis in human lung epithelial cell line A549. When A549 cells were pretreated with the caspase-2 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp(-OMe)-Val-Ala-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone or transfected with caspase-2 short interfering RNA, both ceramide- and etoposide-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis were blocked. Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevented ceramide- and etoposide-induced caspase-2 activation and mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase-2 was activated when A549 cells were introduced with Bcl-2 short interfering RNA or were treated with Bcl-2 inhibitor, which provided direct evidence of a negative regulatory effect of Bcl-2 on caspase-2. Cell survival was observed when caspase-2 was inhibited in Bcl-2-silencing cells. Blockage of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and caspase-9 demonstrated that Bcl-2-modulated caspase-2 activity occurred upstream of mitochondria. Further studies showed that Bcl-2 was dephosphorylated at serine 70 after ceramide and etoposide treatment. A protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, rescued Bcl-2 dephosphorylation and blocked caspase-2 activation, mitochondrial damage, and cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2156015098,"Human mast cells express the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel iKCa1, which opens following IgE-dependent activation. This results in cell membrane hyperpolarization and potentiation of both Ca2+ influx and degranulation. Mast cell activation is attenuated following exposure to beta2-adrenoceptor agonists such as salbutamol, an effect postulated to operate via intracellular cyclic AMP. In this study, we show that salbutamol closes iKCa1 in mast cells derived from human lung and peripheral blood. Salbutamol (1-10 microM) inhibited iKCa1 currents following activation with both anti-IgE and the iKCa1 opener 1-EBIO, and was reversed by removing salbutamol or by the addition of the selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist and inverse agonist ICI 118551. Interestingly, ICI 118551 consistently opened iKCa1 in quiescent cells, suggesting that constitutive beta2-receptor signaling suppresses channel activity. Manipulation of intracellular cAMP, Galphai, and Galphas demonstrates that the beta2-adrenergic effects are consistent with a membrane-delimited mechanism involving Galphas. This is the first demonstration that gating of the iKCa1 channel is regulated by a G protein-coupled receptor and provides a clearly defined mechanism for the mast cell ""stabilizing"" effect of beta2-agonists. Furthermore, the degree of constitutive beta2-receptor ""tone"" may control the threshold for human mast cell activation through the regulation of iKCa1."

CRT polyclonal or monoclonal antibody binding to RK13 srCRT dose-dependently inhibited l,d-MDP-induced apoptosis. In RK13 cells, l,d-MDP up-regulated the TNFR1·TRADD complex of the plasma membrane and subsequently induced cytosolic TRADD-Fas-associated death domain protein complex. Biotinylated srCRT was capable of calcium-dependent binding of Sepharose-immobilized l,d-MDP or peptidoglycan. However, Toll-like receptors TLR-2 and TLR-4, Nod2, and CD14 of RK13 cells did not specifically bind Sepharose-immobilized l,d-MDP. High concentrations (5-40 mm) of EGTA dose-dependently inhibited free l,d-MDP binding to purified RK13 cell CRT and promoted free l,d-MDP dissociation from RK13 cell CRT·MDP complex. Different concentrations of EGTA (0-40 mm) added to Dulbecco's modified essential medium with 1.8 mm calcium or phosphate-buffered saline with 0.18 mm calcium have different effects on medium free calcium concentrations but have identical inhibiting effects on l,d-MDP-induced apoptosis. More inhibition of the l,d-MDP-induced apoptotic DNA ladders and caspase-3 activity in RK13 cells was obtained with EGTA pretreatment (83%) than just EGTA + l,d-MDP (47%). The knocking down of srCRT by antisense oligonucleotide CRTAS121 (250 nmol/ml) and stealth small interfering RNA CRT_siR479 (150 pm/ml) for 2 days (44 and 66%, respectively), resulted in the inhibition of l,d-MDP-induced caspase-3 activity (47 and 65%, respectively). The results suggest that (a) the binding of l,d-MDP to srCRT is calcium-dependent, i.e. on srCRT-bound calcium, and (b) it is srCRT, not TLR-2, TLR-4, Nod2 or CD14, that mediates l,d-MDP-induced RK13 cell apoptosis through activating the TNFR1· TRADD-Fas-associated death domain protein apoptotic pathway.

Some biological effects of l,d-MDP (and PG) are dependent on the interaction of its muramyl moiety with a cellular protein or hormone. For example, the binding of the muramyl moiety of l,d-MDP to the tryptophan region of the 5-hydroxytryptamine binding site on myelin basic protein, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone-adrenocorticotropic hormone plays a key role in inducing antibodies to self-proteins that are produced during autoimmune disease (15Root-Bernstein R.S.

For example, the apoptogenic activity of l,d-MDP in rabbit kidney RK13 cells is dependent on the interaction of the dipeptide moiety of l,d-MDP with CRT (5Chen D. Duggan C. Reden T.B.

Previously, we reported that CRT in RK13 cells is a binding protein for apoptogenic synthetic l,d-MDP and bacterial PG and that the binding of l,d-MDP, l,l-MDP, d,d-MDP, or PG to CRT correlates with their capacities for inducing apoptosis (5Chen D. Duggan C. Reden T.B. Kooragayala L.M. Texada D.E. Langford M.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11796-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this investigation, the apoptogenic effect of l,d-MDP or PG on RK13 cells was shown to be through the interaction of l,d-MDP or PG with CRT, specifically surface CRT (srCRT) but not the reported Toll-like receptors TLR-2 and TLR-4, CD14, or Nod2. On RK13 cell membrane, there exist srCRT, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD), and the complex(es) of srCRT with TNFR1 and/or TRADD. l,d-MDP binding to srCRT activated the TNFR1·TRADD·FADD apoptotic pathway. CRT antibody prebound to srCRT inhibited l,d-MDP-induced apoptosis. The results presented here suggest that EGTA (a specific calcium chelator) removed medium free calcium and cell surface-bound calcium (especially surface RK13 CRT-bound calcium), but it is the removal of cell surface-bound calcium that resulted in the inhibition of l,d-MDP-induced apoptosis of RK13 cells. High concentrations of EGTA dose-dependently inhibited free l,d-MDP binding to purified RK13 cell CRT (rCRT) and promoted free l,d-MDP dissociation from rCRT·MDP complex. In addition, the knocking down of rCRT and srCRT by antisense phosphothioated oligonucleotides or stealth siRNA(s) inhibited the l,d-MDP-induced caspase-3 activity and the development of apoptotic DNA ladders. The results strongly suggest that srCRT is a receptor protein for the apoptotic l,d-MDP or PG and that the apoptotic signal of the binding of srCRT with l,d-MDP is transduced through TNFR1 and TRADD.

Isolation of RK13 Cell Proteins That Bind Sepharose-bound MDP, PG, and LPS—The immobilization of MDP, PG, and LPS to Sepharose 6MB was performed with CNBr-activated-Sepharose 6MB as described by Dziarski et al. (1Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). RK13 cell proteins bound to Sepharose 6MB-immobilized MDP, PG, or LPS were isolated as previously described (5Chen D. Duggan C. Reden T.B. Kooragayala L.M. Texada D.E. Langford M.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11796-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Trypsinized RK13 cells from 175-cm2 culture flasks were washed with TSE buffer (10 mm Tris-·Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and lysed with 50 ml of 1× cell lysis/binding buffer (50 mm Tris-·Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Triton X-114, 0.1% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end rotation. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to recover the supernatant (protein sample). The protein sample was then applied to Sepharose-bound MDP, PG, and LPS columns, which had been equilibrated by 1× cell lysis/binding buffer. After binding at 4 °C overnight, the columns were washed sequentially with 10 volumes of 1× cell lysis/binding buffer, 5 volumes of washing buffer I (1× cell lysis/binding buffer with NaCl adjusted to 0.5 m), and 5 volumes of wash buffer II (1× cell lysis/binding buffer with NaCl adjusted to 0.8 m). Affinity-bound proteins were then eluted with elution buffer I (10 μm MDP, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) or elution buffer II (10 μg/ml LPS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4). Purification of rCRT—Mannan-agarose affinity chromatography was adopted to purify rCRT from RK13 cells by the method described previously (20White T.K. Zhu Q. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15926-15929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Detection of RK13 Cell Surface CRT—RK13 cells (on a glass slide or in a suspension after being trypsinized) were first washed with FACS buffer (1× PBS, 5% fetus bovine serum, and 0.1% sodium azide) and then reacted with rabbit antibody to bovine CRT (1:50) in FACS buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were further washed three times with FACS buffer and reacted with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:100) in FACS buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with FACS buffer, cells were fixed with 2% cold paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. Surface CRT was then observed using a 40×/0.60 numerical aperture plan fluor objective on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope with an epifluorescence attachment using a Chroma 83000 filter set with single band exciters for APC in the filter wheel and a stationary multi-band beam splitter and emission filter. Images were captured with a Photometrics Cool SNAPfx monochrome CCD camera controlled with Scanalytics IPLab software. Purification of Rabbit and Mouse IgG—The IgG of rabbit serum (preserum or anti-bCRT serum) or mouse serum was first reacted with protein A-Sepharose 4B in PBST buffer (1:50) at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end rotation for 2 h. The resins were then washed with 10 volumes of PBST for three times and subsequently eluted with IgG elution buffer (50 mm glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.5). The eluates were immediately neutralized by 1/20 volume of 1.0 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.7. The IgG concentrations in the eluates were measured using the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of RK13 Cell Membrane CRT, TNFR1, and TRADD—Trypsinized RK13 cells were washed three times with PBS and two times with 1× cell membrane preparation buffer (1×CMPB) (20 mm Tris-Cl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.5) in succession. Cells were then suspended in 1× CMPB and lysed by successively passing through a 23-gauge needle (10 times) and a 30-gauge needle (10 times). Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to recover the post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to recover the membrane pellet. The pellet was then lysed in 1× cell membrane lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end rotation for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to recover the supernatant (cell membrane extract, CME). The protein concentration in CME was measured using the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar) and adjusted to 1 μg/μl with 1× cell membrane lysis buffer. Membrane CRT, TNFR1, or TRADD in each 500 μl of CME sample was immunoprecipitated, respectively, by 4 μl of monoclonal antibody to CRT, 5 μl of rabbit antibody to TNFR1, or 5 μl of rabbit antibody to TRADD with 20 μl of recombinant protein G-agarose (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Edition Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After washing three times with 1× cell membrane lysis buffer, 20 μl of 1× SDS gel-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm DTT, 2.3% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) was added to the agarose and boiled for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitated sCRT, TNFR1, or TRADD were detected by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of the TNFR1·TRADD Complex and Cytosolic TRADD·FADD Complex of RK13 Cell Membrane—Rabbit anti-hTRADD antibody was first reacted with protein A-Sepharose 4B in PBST (2.5 μg/ml) at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end rotation overnight. The resin was then washed with PBST for three times and, subsequently, with 1× cross-linking buffer (0.15 m Na2HPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5) for three times. The anti-hTRADD antibody was further immobilized to Sepharose 4B by cross-linking to resin-bound protein A with 2 mg/ml dimethylpimelimidate-2 HCl according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). The resulting anti-hTRADD-Sepharose 4B resin (anti-hTRADD-Seph4B) was washed with PBST for five times. Trypsinized RK13 cells were washed three times with PBS and 1 time with 1× cytosol extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.5) in succession. Cells were then suspended in 1× cytosol extract buffer and lysed by successively passing through a 23-gauge needle (10 times) and a 30-gauge needle (10 times). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to recover the post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to recover the cytosolic supernatant. RK13 cytosolic extract (CE) was obtained by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.15 m. The protein concentration in RK13CE was measured using the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar) and adjusted to 1 μg/μl with corresponding buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. Membrane TNFR1·TRADD complex in every 500 μl of CME (obtained as described above) or cytosolic TRADD·FADD complex in each 500 μl of CE was immunoprecipitated, respectively, by 20 μl of anti-hTRADD-Seph4B at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with PBST, 20 μl of 1× SDS gel-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm DTT, 2.3% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) was added to the resin and boiled for 5 min. The TRADD-co-immunoprecipitated membrane TNFR1 or cytosolic FADD was detected by Western blotting. Measurement of Free Calcium in DMEM or PBS—Calcium concentration in DMEM (1.8 mm Ca2+) + MDP (2.5 μg/ml) or PBS (0.18 mm Ca2+) + MDP (2.5 μg/ml) with the addition of EGTA (0-40 mm) was measured by Sigma CALCIUM kit per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA Ladder Analysis for Apoptosis—Apoptotic DNA ladders were identified and imaged as previously described (5Chen D. Duggan C. Reden T.B. Kooragayala L.M. Texada D.E. Langford M.P.

Caspase-3 Activity Analysis for Apoptosis—Caspase-3 activity was measured with caspase-3 assay kit according to the manufacturer's (Sigma) instructions (the unit of caspase-3 was defined as 1 nmol of p-nitroanilide released/h/ml cell extract at 37 °C). Bioassay of Free l,d-MDP Binding to or Dissociated from CRT—For the experiment of free MDP binding to CRT, 5 μg of purified rCRT were pretreated with EGTA (0-40 mm)in50 μl of CRT binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1 h and then reacted with 50 ng of free MDP at 37 °C for one more hour. For the experiment of free MDP dissociated from CRT, 5 μg of purified rCRT were first reacted with 50 ng of free MDP in 50 μl of CRT binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1 h and then EGTA (final concentrations of 0-40 mm) was added and incubated at 37 °C for one more hour. Each reaction mixture in the above two experiments was then transferred into the medium (1 ml) of a 6-well culture of RK13 cells. After overnight incubation (16-20 h), the cells were harvested for DNA ladder analysis (5Chen D. Duggan C. Reden T.B. Kooragayala L.M. Texada D.E. Langford M.P.

Antisense Oligonucleotides Treatment—Phosphothioated 18-mer oligonucleotides CRTAS121 and CRTPS121 were synthesized for treating RK13 cells. The antisense CRTAS121, 5′-CTGCTCCTTGAAGTAGAC-3′, is corresponding to amino acids 21-26 or nucleotides 121-138 of the reported rabbit CRT mRNA sequence (NCBI accession number J05138). CRTPS121 is the antiparallel sense sequence corresponding to CRTAS121. To obtain duplex CRTDS121, an equal molar mixture of CRTAS121 and CRTPS121 in 100 μl of TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) was heated and annealed by gradually lowering the temperature to room temperature. RK13 cells were transfected by 250 nmol of oligonucleotides CRTAS121, CRTPS121, CRTDS121, or no oligonucleotide control with Oligofectamine (OFM) in 1 ml of serum-free and antibiotic-free DMEM, as per the instruction of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Following oligonucleotide treatment (∼48 h), (a) RK13 cells were harvested and assessed for total CRT content by Western blotting with rabbit anti-bovine CRT antiserum (23Liu N. Fine R.E. Simons E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28635-28639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (b) the ability of MDP-induced RK13 cell apoptosis was studied by DNA ladder analysis or caspase-3 activity analysis, and (c) RK13 cells were biotinylated and assessed for surface CRT content as described below. Stealth siRNA Treatment—Stealth siRNA CRT_siR165, CRT_siR200, or CRT_siR479 is a 25-bp duplex oligoribonucleotide with a sense strand corresponding to nucleotides 165-189, 200-224, or 479-503 of the reported rabbit CRT mRNA sequence. The sense sequence of CRT_siR479 is 5′-GCACCAAGAAGGUUCACGUCAUCUU-3′. CTL_siR479 with a sense strand 5′-GCAAGAAUGGACACUACUGUCCCUU-3′ is the control stealth siRNA for CRT_siR479. RK13 cells were transfected by 150 pmol of CRT_siR165, CRT_siR200, CRT_siR479, CTL_siR479, or no siRNA control with OFM in 1 ml of serum-free and antibiotic-free DMEM per the instruction of the manufacturer.

https://openalex.org/W2007514131,"In contrast to most multimeric transmembrane complexes that oligomerize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) oligomerizes in an aspect of the Golgi apparatus. The mechanisms that prevent oligomerization of Cx43 and related connexins in the ER are not well understood. Also, some studies suggest that connexins can oligomerize in the ER. We used connexin constructs containing a C-terminal dilysine-based ER retention/retrieval signal (HKKSL) transfected into HeLa cells to study early events in connexin oligomerization. Using this approach, Cx43-HKKSL was retained in the ER and prevented from oligomerization. However, another ER-retained HKKSL-tagged connexin, Cx32-HKKSL, had the capacity to oligomerize. Because this suggested that Cx43 contains a motif that prevented oligomerization in the ER, a series of HKKSL-tagged and untagged Cx32/Cx43 chimeras was screened to define this motif. The minimal motif, which prevented ER oligomerization, consisted of the complete third transmembrane domain and the second extracellular loop from Cx43 on a Cx32 backbone. We propose that charged residues present in Cx43 and related connexins help prevent ER oligomerization by stabilizing the third transmembrane domain in the membrane bilayer.

A complete gap junction channel is formed when a connexin hexamer in the plasma membrane of one cell binds to a hexamer in an adjacent cell. Formation of connexin hexamers (oligomerization) occurs in intracellular compartments prior to transport to the plasma membrane. Connexin mutations associated with human disease frequently interfere with proper connexin trafficking and assembly, causing mutant connexins to improperly accumulate in intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Cx, connexin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GS, goat serum; TM, transmembrane domain; EL, extracellular loop. or aspects of the Golgi apparatus (8VanSlyke J.K.

Musil and Goodenough (11Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that connexin43 (Cx43) oligomerizes into hexamers after exit from the ER. Cx43 differs from most other multimeric transmembrane complexes, which typically oligomerize in the ER as a prerequisite to further transport along the secretory pathway (12Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Post-ER oligomerization of Cx43 and other connexins has been confirmed in other studies (13Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14George C.H. Kendall J.M. Evans W.H. J. Biol.

However, there is also evidence suggesting that connexins partially or completely oligomerize in the ER (14George C.H. Kendall J.M. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8678-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Kumar N.M. Friend D.S. Gilula N.B. J.

Most of these studies examined the effect of membrane trafficking inhibitors, such as brefeldin A, on connexin oligomerization. In addition, sites of oligomerization have been inferred from rescue studies in which co-expressed wild-type connexins assemble with misfolded connexins and promote their transport to the plasma membrane. The implication of these studies is that oligomerization between the misfolded and properly folded connexins occurred in the compartment where the misfolded connexin was trapped. As an alternate approach, we have used connexins containing a dilysine ER retention/retrieval motif, HKKSL, to study early events in oligomerization of Cx32 and Cx43 (19Das Sarma J. Wang F. Koval M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20911-20918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HKKSL-tagged connexins are retained in the ER in the absence of pharmacologic agents that have the potential to alter ER composition and function (20Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). We found that ER-retained Cx32-HKKSL had the capacity to oligomerize, whereas Cx43-HKKSL did not (19Das Sarma J. Wang F. Koval M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20911-20918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This suggests that Cx43-HKKSL contains a motif required to inhibit oligomerization in the ER. Given this possibility, we made a series of HKKSL-tagged Cx43/Cx32 chimeras to define Cx43 motifs that inhibit ER oligomerization. Antisera and Reagents—Rabbit anti-Cx43 (21Civitelli R. Beyer E.C. Warlow P.M. Robertson A.J. Geist S.T. Steinberg T.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was generated using His6-tagged C-terminal tail constructs as described previously. Rabbit anti-Cx32 and mouse anti-Cx32 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and mouse anti-calnexin and rabbit anti-β-COP were from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Monoclonal anti-Cx43 was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Fluorescent and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Biomag particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG were from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Triton X-100 was from Roche Applied Science. Tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were from Sigma. Constructs, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—Tagged constructs were produced by PCR amplification in a Stratagene Robocycler (La Jolla, CA) using high fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), starting with rat Cx43 or Cx32 cDNA as a template. Cx43/32 chimeras (Fig. 1) were produced by two-step PCR amplification using established protocols (22Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). In brief, the two halves of a given construct were first produced with the template and primer pairs listed in Table I. The halves were annealed and amplified using Cx43/Cx32-HKKSL, Cx32/Cx32-HKKSL, or Cx43/Cx43-HKKSL sense/antisense primer pairs as appropriate. The resulting PCR products were cut with KpnI or EcoRI and XhoI, ligated into a pcDNA3 expression vector, and transformed into bacterial stocks. DNA for transfection was purified from bacteria using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to transfection, cDNA was purified by EtOH precipitation. Cx32/Cx32 sense/antisense primer pairs were used to produce untagged versions of chimeras using the HKKSL-tagged cDNA as a template. For single-site mutagenesis of tryptophan to arginine, we used 5′-AGGGACACTGTGGAGGACCTATGTCATCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGATGACATAGGTCCTCCACAGTGTCCCT-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively, with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For single-site mutagenesis of arginine to tryptophan, we used 5′-GGGCGGCTTGCTGTGGACCTACATCATCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGATGATGTAGGTCCACAGCAAGCCGCCC-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type or modified connexin cDNA constructs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and analyzed 48 h after transfection.

The cells were incubated with primary antisera diluted into PBS/GS for 1 h, washed, and then labeled with secondary antisera diluted into PBS/GS. The cells were then washed with PBS, mounted into Mowiol, visualized by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus X-70 microscope system, and imaged with a Hammatzu Orca-1 charge-coupled device camera and Image Pro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Protein Analysis—The techniques outlined below have also been described elsewhere (13Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS, harvested into PBS containing protease inhibitors (10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaVO4 and 10 mm NaF), and then passed through a ball bearing homogenizer 100 times (13Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Das Sarma J. Meyer R.A. Wang F. Abraham V. Lo C.W. Koval M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4013-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min using an IEC CL3R centrifuge, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min using a Sorvall Ultra Pro 80 Ultracentrifuge to obtain a membrane-enriched pellet. To analyze total cell connexin expression, this pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and then blocked overnight with 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% Carnation powdered milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 (Blotto). The blots were incubated with Blotto containing specific antisera, washed, and then further incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, Malvern, PA). Specific signals corresponding to a given protein were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with a Kodak EDAS system (Rochester, NY). For detergent solubilization studies, the membrane-enriched pellet was resuspended in PBS plus inhibitors containing 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and separated into Triton X-100-soluble supernatant and -insoluble pellet fractions. The soluble and insoluble fractions were then resuspended into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and assayed by immunoblot. Sucrose gradient fractionation was done using postnuclear supernatants solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting Triton X-100-soluble fraction was overlaid onto a 5–18% sucrose gradient on a 25% sucrose cushion. The gradient was centrifuged at 148,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in a Sorvall Ultra Pro 80 centrifuge using an AH-650 swinging bucket rotor. Following centrifugation, 0.2-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube at 4 °C and then analyzed by immunoblot. We previously used a dilysine-based ER retention/retrieval signal as a method to retain connexins in the ER without using pharmacologic agents (19Das Sarma J. Wang F. Koval M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20911-20918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The application of this approach is shown in Fig. 2. Wild-type versions of Cx43 or Cx32 transfected into HeLa cells are transported to the plasma membrane where they form gap junctions. The addition of an HKKSL motif onto the C terminus of either Cx43 or Cx32 produced proteins that were now retained in the ER, as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Nearly all Cx43-HKKSL and Cx32-HKKSL were solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C, in contrast to wild-type Cx43 and Cx32, which had significant Triton X-100-insoluble pools because of incorporation of these proteins into gap junction plaques (13Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50087-50097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Also, Cx43-HKKSL did not show the slower migrating phosphorylated forms, which are generated after Cx43 incorporation into gap junctions (26Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We then examined the oligomerization state of connexins present in the Triton X-100-soluble portion using sucrose gradient fractionation (Fig. 2, i–l). Consistent with previous results (13Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Gemel J. Valiunas V. Brink P.R. Beyer E.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2469-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), wild-type Cx43 migrated as two peaks, a low molecular mass peak centered at 9–10% sucrose (light fractions) and a higher molecular mass peak centered at ∼15% sucrose (heavy fractions). In contrast, Cx43-HKKSL was present in only the light sucrose fractions, consistent with a lack of oligomerization by the ER-retained construct. Wild-type Cx32 was predominantly in the heavy sucrose fractions, although there were hints of Cx32 in the light sucrose fractions. Cx32-HKKSL was also present predominantly in the heavy sucrose fractions, suggesting that it oligomerized in the ER. Because these two ER localized-constructs, Cx43-HKKSL and Cx32-HKKSL, showed differences in oligomerization, we produced a series of HKKSL-tagged Cx43/Cx32 chimeras to identify the minimal Cx43 element required to inhibit oligomerization in the ER. Whenever possible, regions of Cx43 and Cx32 that were well conserved at the amino acid level were used as splice sites to minimize the potential of producing a connexin that might misfold (Fig. 1). Proper construction of chimera cDNAs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. As controls for the function of the HKKSL tag and proper levels of expression for expression studies in HeLa cells, we insured that each HKKSL-tagged chimera 1) was localized to the ER (by immunofluorescence microscopy) and 2) did not form a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (e.g. Figs. 2 and 5). Of the initial series of HKKSL-tagged chimeras, only Cx43/32a-HKKSL expressed by HeLa cells was present in only the light sucrose fractions (Fig. 3). Removal of the HKKSL tag shifted the sucrose gradient migration pattern from the light fractions to the heavy fractions, suggesting that ER retention was required to prevent oligomerization. In contrast, chimeras containing smaller Cx43 elements migrated to heavier sucrose fractions, suggesting that they had oligomerized in the ER. For these chimeras, there might also be some aggregation, because there were peaks that appeared at ∼20% sucrose. Nonetheless, the general lack of peaks greater than 15% for Cx43/32a-HKKSL is consistent with this chimera being retained in the ER as an apparent monomer. To further define the Cx43 motif required to inhibit oligomerization, a second series of chimeras was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, Cx32/43/32a-HKKSL, which lacks the first transmembrane domain (TM1) and first extracellular loop (EL1) of Cx43 did not oligomerize in the ER. Consistent with this, a complementary chimera, Cx32/43/32-HKKSL (Fig. 4f), was present predominantly in heavy sucrose fractions, suggesting that that TM1 and EL1, along with the TM4 and the cytoplasmic tail, did not confer the ability to inhibit oligomerization in the ER. Also, ER localization was required to prevent oligomerization, because removal of the HKKSL tag from Cx32/43/32a-HKKSL shifted the sucrose gradient migration pattern from the light fractions to the heavy fractions. One feature shared by Cx43/32a-HKKSL and Cx32/43/32a-HKKSL is that they both contain the cytoplasmic loop, TM3, and EL2 domains of Cx43. To determine whether the cytoplasmic loop domain of Cx43 was necessary for preventing Cx43 oligomerization in the ER, we generated a chimera containing the TM3 and EL2 domains of Cx43 on a backbone of Cx32-HKKSL, (Cx32/43/32b-HKKSL). As shown in Fig. 4b, Cx32/43/32b-HKKSL expressed by HeLa cells resolved in the light sucrose fractions, suggesting that the cytoplasmic loop domain of Cx43 was not involved in preventing ER oligomerization of Cx43. Most of the Cx32/43/32b-HKKSL migrated in a peak corresponding to monomers; however, there was a shoulder centered at ∼12% sucrose, suggesting that some Cx32/43/32b-HKKSL might be partially oligomerized, aggregated, or associated with a putative chaperone. As described above, ER localization was required to prevent oligomerization of this chimera because removal of the HKKSL tag shifted the sucrose gradient migration pattern of Cx32/43/32b to the heavy fractions. Untagged Cx32/43/32b also showed a shoulder at 12% sucrose, which likely corresponds to partially oligomerized and/or misfolded Cx32/43/32b, comparable with Cx32/43/32b-HKKSL. To determine whether the EL2 domain of Cx43 was necessary for preventing Cx43 oligomerization in the ER, we generated a chimera lacking this domain (Cx32/43/32c-HKKSL). Cx32/43/32c-HKKSL had a sucrose gradient pattern consistent with oligomerization (Fig. 4d), suggesting that the Cx43 EL2 domain was necessary to prevent oligomerization in the ER. Three of the chimeras tested, Cx43/32a-HKKSL, Cx32/43/32a-HKKSL, and Cx32/43/32b-HKKSL, did not oligomerize in the ER; however, the untagged versions of these chimeras did oligomerize. By immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5), all three of the HKKSL-tagged chimeras showed an ER localization pattern in transfected HeLa cells, as was the case for all of the HKKSL-tagged constructs used in this study. 2J. Maza, J. Das Sarma, and M. Koval, unpublished results. However, Cx43/32a, Cx32/43/32a, and Cx32/43/32b showed different patterns of intracellular localization. Untagged Cx43/32a and Cx32/43/32a were mistargeted to intracellular compartments, suggesting that they might be misfolded or improperly oligomerized. However, untagged Cx32/43/32b was transported to the plasma membrane as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy, more consistent with proper formation of gap junction channels. Also, the untagged constructs showed a Triton X-100-insoluble pool, which is a hallmark of both gap junction plaque formation (24Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and aggregation (27Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). In contrast, the HKKSL-tagged constructs were predominantly soluble in Triton X-100. Thus, regardless of whether the chimeras were capable of forming gap junctions, HKKSL-tagged constructs were prevented from oligomerizing by virtue of being retained in the ER. Having determined that the EL2 domain of Cx43 was necessary to prevent connexin oligomerization in the ER, we then examined whether TM3 plays a role in regulating Cx43 oligomerization. The TM3 domain of Cx43 (and Cx32/43/32b) has a charged arginine residue (Arg-153 in Cx43) that is not present in Cx32, which instead has a hydrophobic tryptophan (Trp) residue. Cx32/43/32bR133W-HKKSL, a chimera that lacks this Arg residue, was not prevented from oligomerizing in the ER, in contrast to Cx32/43/32b-HKKSL (Fig. 6). Thus, the EL2 domain of Cx43 was not sufficient to inhibit connexin oligomerization in the ER. Note that the Cx32/43/32bR133W-HKKSL chimera showed a sucrose gradient pattern with shoulders, suggesting partial oligomerization or perhaps aggregation. Also, the addition of an arginine to a Cx32 backbone had little effect on Cx32 oligomerization because Cx32R133W-HKKSL and wild-type Cx32-HKKSL had similar sucrose gradient profiles. This suggested that there may be a role for charged amino acids near the TM3 membrane interfaces in regulating oligomerization of Cx43. As shown in Fig. 6, both the Arg-153 and Gln-173 residues of TM3 were critical to prevent oligomerization of Cx43-HKKSL in the ER. Cx43R153W-HKKSL and Cx43Q173F-HKKSL both had a complex pattern by sucrose gradient fractionation, in which the majority of the protein appeared in a size range larger than monomers yet smaller than hexamers, suggesting partial oligomerization of these point mutants or association with a putative chaperone. The sucrose gradient migration pattern of these complexes is consistent with a role for both Arg-153 and Gln-173 in maintaining Cx43 in the ER as an apparent monomer. Taken together, these data suggest that TM3 and EL2 of Cx43 represent the minimal motif necessary and sufficient to inhibit oligomerization in the ER. We found that the TM3 and EL2 domains of Cx43 were critical to inhibit connexin oligomerization in the ER. Based on homology, these motifs are likely to help prevent ER oligomerization of other connexins, such as Cx46 (13Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A role for TM3 in regulating connexin oligomerization is also suggested by the findings of Ahmad et al. (28Ahmad S. Martin P.E. Evans W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who showed that substituting a transmembrane domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator for TM3 of Cx32 produced a chimera that did not oligomerize. Consistent with this, most studies suggest that TM3 is the major helix that lines the gap junction channel aqueous pore (29Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 30Skerrett I.M. Aronowitz J. Shin J.H. Cymes G. Kasperek E. Cao F.L. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and thus does not correspond to a “classical” transmembrane domain stably integrated into a hydrophobic membrane bilayer. In the case of hemichannels or complete gap junction channels, interactions with other connexins in the complex help stabilize TM3 in the bilayer facing the aqueous environment of the gap junction channel (31Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, monomeric connexins cannot take advantage of these interactions to be stabilized within the ER membrane, so TM3 may require a different conformation. Charged amino acids present in Cx43 at the two putative membrane/water interfaces of TM3 would be expected to better stabilize TM3 in a bilayer as compared with the corresponding hydrophobic residues of Cx32 (Fig. 6). For instance, interface amino acids might help regulate the position or tilt of TM3 relative to the membrane bilayer as a prerequisite to preventing or promoting connexin oligomerization. By sequence comparison, Cx32 and other β-connexins have a WW sequence near the cytoplasmic end of TM3, in contrast to the LR sequence present in the equivalent position of Cx43 (32Lagree V. Brunschwig K. Lopez P. Gilula N.B. Richard G. Falk M.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3189-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of Cx32 suggests that the WW sequence is firmly within a transmembrane element of TM3 (31Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By analogy, the charged arginine residue would be within the transmembrane portion of TM3 of an oligomerized connexin, although an equivalent structural model of Cx43 has not yet been produced. However, in a monomeric connexin, the arginine residue could potentially direct TM3 to an alternative conformation where arginine could be localized to the membrane/water interface region, thus stabilizing TM3 in the membrane bilayer. A similar argument can be made for the Cx43 glutamine residue of TM3 (Gln-173). This glutamine is highly conserved by α-connexins, although Cx40.1 and Cx50 substitute histidine for glutamine. By analogy to the structural analysis of Cx32 by Fleishman et al. (31Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the polar glutamine residue of Cx43 is likely localized to the luminal membrane/water interface of TM3. Again, Cx32 has an aromatic phenylalanine residue in a comparable position, suggesting that monomeric Cx43 can better anchor TM3 in the bilayer than monomeric Cx32. The EL2 domain was also required to prevent Cx43 oligomerization in the ER. The Cx43 EL2 domain near the luminal/extracellular membrane domain of Cx43 has a “WYIYGF” sequence that is well conserved for all human connexins related to Cx43 (α-connexins) (Fig. 5). The tyrosine-glycine-phenylalanine tripeptide (YGF) is particularly well conserved. The comparable region of Cx32 has a “YLLYPG” sequence, which is partially conserved for β-family connexins related to Cx32. The second tyrosine is well conserved among β-connexins, whereas the remaining amino acids tend to be hydrophobic but not conserved. Conceivably, binding of a putative peripheral chaperone to the EL2 of monomeric Cx43 could help stabilize the position of TM3 relative to the membrane bilayer. Whether this is the case remains to be determined. Interestingly, the spacing between the conserved tyrosine (Tyr-158 for Cx32, Tyr-178 for Cx43) and first universally conserved cysteine in EL2 differs for “YGF” connexins (nine amino acids between tyrosine and cysteine) versus β-connexins (10 amino acids between tyrosine and cysteine). This difference in spacing will alter the relative structure of EL2 and thus could promote a specific conformational change for Cx43 versus Cx32. Further, because the conserved glycine (Gly-179) residue has a high degree of flexibility, it might enable the Cx43 EL2 to attain multiple conformations. Although the EL2 domain is highly conserved for all human α-connexins, four α-connexins (Cx37, Cx40, Cx40.1, and Cx59) lack the critical arginine residue required to prevent Cx43 oligomerization in the ER. Whether α-connexins that lack the critical arginine oligomerize in the ER is not known at present. Interestingly, at least two of these α-connexins, Cx37 and Cx40, form mixed hemichannels with Cx43 as well as with each other (33Cottrell G.T. Wu Y. Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1469-C1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Valiunas V. Gemel J. Brink P.R. Beyer E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1675-H1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35He D.S.

Adhes. 2001; 8: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If Cx37 and/or Cx40 preferentially oligomerize in the ER, then inhibition of Cx43 oligomerization in the ER could be a mechanism to help regulate hemichannel stoichiometry in cells expressing Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43, such as smooth muscle and endothelial cells (38Brink P.R. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Figueroa X.F. Isakson B.E. Duling B.R.

Whether this is the case remains to be determined. Cx32W133R-HKKSL corresponds to an HKKSL-tagged version of the Cx32 (W133R) variant associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (42Wang H.L. Chang W.T. Yeh T.H. Wu T. Chen M.S. Wu C.Y. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 15: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that this Cx32 construct was capable of oligomerization in the ER. This is in contrast to mutations localized to other regions of Cx32, such as R142W (within TM3), E186K (at the extracellular interface of the fourth transmembrane domain), and E208K (at the cytoplasmic interface of the fourth transmembrane domain), which produce forms of Cx32 that are incapable of oligomerizing when expressed by PC12 cells (8VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Mutant connexins associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease appear to fall into discrete classes with trapping in either the ER or Golgi apparatus or with partial trafficking to the plasma membrane (8VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Yum S.W. Kleopa K.A. Shumas S. Scherer S.S. Neurobiol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although this suggests that the inability to properly oligomerize could cause Cx32 misfolding and mistargeting, our results and the results of Martin et al. (44Martin P.E. Mambetisaeva E.T. Archer D.A. George C.H. Evans W.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 45Martin P.E. Steggles J. Wilson C. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the ability to oligomerize does not necessarily guarantee that Cx32 is functional. In fact, mutant connexins frequently have dominant negative effects by forming inactive gap junction channels with wild-type connexins (46Thomas T. Telford D. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19157-19168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 47Rouan F. White T.W. Brown N. Taylor A.M. Lucke T.W. Paul D.L. Munro C.S. Uitto J. Hodgins M.B. Richard G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2105-2113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, many X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mutants are successfully transported to the plasma membrane, although most of these show mutant amino acids in the C-terminal domain rather than the transmembrane or loop domains (9Yum S.W. Kleopa K.A. Shumas S. Scherer S.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We found that Cx32/43/32b was transported to the cell surface; however, two other constructs, Cx43/32d and Cx32/43/32a, were not. Whether this reflects a difference in proper folding versus misfolding remains to be determined. As mentioned above, aberrant retention in the ER or perinuclear intracellular compartments would be consistent with the potential for connexin misfolding to cause mistargeting of these chimeras (8VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Yum S.W. Kleopa K.A. Shumas S. Scherer S.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 43Berthoud V.M. Minogue P.J. Guo J. Williamson E.K. Xu X. Ebihara L. Beyer E.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The prospect that some chimeras may be misfolded also suggests that some higher molecular mass peaks in the sucrose gradients (e.g. peaks at 12% sucrose) may be because of interactions between the connexin chimeras and chaperones rather than oligomerization per se. Another key difference between Cx43/32d and Cx32/43/32a as compared with Cx32/43/32b is that Cx32/43/32b contains a compatible Cx32 cytoplasmic loop and C terminus. In contrast, the other two constructs have a Cx43 cytoplasmic loop that may not be compatible with interacting properly with a Cx32 C terminus. Bruzzone et al. (48Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 955-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that chimeras with mismatched loops and tails showed either partially or completely diminished transport to the plasma membrane. The role for cytoplasmic loop/C terminus binding interactions in channel gating indicates that these two motifs actively interact (49Delmar M. Coombs W. Sorgen P. Duffy H.S. Taffet S.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although connexins with C-terminal truncations are transported to the plasma membrane and form functional channels (50Stergiopoulos K. Alvarado J.L. Mastroianni M. Ek-Vitorin J.F. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), elements of the Cx32 C terminus help promote full oligomerization (45Martin P.E. Steggles J. Wilson C. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that, in addition to TM3 and EL2, interactions between the C terminus and cytoplasmic loop might also play a role in regulating connexin folding, oligomerization, and/or trafficking. What drives Cx43 oligomerization once it is delivered to the Golgi apparatus? The observation that some cells retain monomeric Cx46 in the trans Golgi network underscores the notion that connexin oligomerization is a regulated process (13Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). One possibility is that an element of the Golgi microenvironment that differs from the ER, such as a difference in pH, calcium concentration, or lipid composition, might favor a conformational change in Cx43 to promote oligomerization. Alternatively, if one or more putative Cx43 chaperones are required to inhibit oligomerization, then chaperone dissociation might promote oligomerization upon delivery to the Golgi apparatus. Whether this is the case will require identifying proteins that regulate connexin oligomerization. We thank Drs. Brandy Daugherty and Steven Scherer for critical reading of the manuscript."

The present study was aimed at detailed analysis of cardiac function and exercise endurance in myo-/- mice and at providing evidence for Mb's functional relevance. Myo-/- isolated working hearts display decreased contractility (dP/dtmax 3883+/-351 vs. 4618+/-268 mmHg/sec, myo-/- vs. WT, P<0.005). Due to a shift in sympathetic/parasympathetic tone, heart rate is reduced in conscious myo mice-/- (615+/-33 vs. 645+/-27 bpm, myo-/- vs. WT, P<0.001). Oxygen consumption (VO2) under resting conditions (3082+/-413 vs. 4452+/-552 ml x kg(-1) x h(-1), myo-/- vs. WT, P<0.001) and exercise endurance, as determined by spiroergometry, are decreased (466+/-113 vs. 585+/-153 m, myo-/- vs. WT, P<0.01). Conscious myo-/- mice evaluated by echocardiography display lowered cardiac output (0.64+/-0.06 vs. 0.75+/-0.09 ml x min(-1) x g(-1), myo-/- vs. WT, P<0.001), impaired systolic shortening (60+/-3.5 vs. 65+/-4%, myo-/- vs. WT, P<0.001) and fail to respond to beta1-stimulation. Strikingly, the latter cardiac effects of Mb deficiency can be partially attenuated by NOS inhibition. Loss of Mb results in a distinct phenotype, even under resting conditions, and the importance of oxygen supply and nitric oxide scavenging by Mb is clearly demonstrated at the conscious animal level."
https://openalex.org/W1987916005,"Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1), which is a tolloid member of the astacin-like family of zinc metalloproteinases, is a highly effective procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) and chordinase. On the other hand, mammalian tolloid like-2 (mTLL-2) does not cleave chordin or procollagen; procollagen is cleaved by mTLL-2 in the presence of high levels of procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1 (PCPE-1), for reasons that are unknown.

Using a domain swap approach, we showed that: 1) the metalloproteinase and CUB2 domains of BMP-1 are absolutely required for PCP activity; swaps with either of the corresponding domains in BMP-1 and mTLL-2 did not result in procollagen cleavage and 2) the proteinase domain of mTLL-2 can cleave chordin if coupled to the CUB1 domain of BMP-1. Therefore, the minimal structure for chordinase activity comprises a metalloproteinase domain (either from BMP-1 or from mTLL-2) and the CUB1 domain of BMP-1 (the CUB1 domain of mTLL-2 cannot substitute for the CUB1 domain of BMP-1).

Tolloids are a small group of highly conserved astacin-like zinc metalloproteinases that occur in all metazoa, from flies to humans. They are essential for normal development because they cleave precursors of extracellular matrix macromolecules (at least in vertebrates) and antagonists of bone morphogenetic proteins (in flies, worms, and vertebrates). By cleaving precursors of extracellular matrix macromolecules (see below for details), tolloids initiate the assembly of tissues. How tolloids distinguish between different substrates is not well understood.BMP-1, 1The abbreviations used are: BMP-1, bone morphogenetic protein-1; mTld, mammalian tolloid; mTLL, mammalian tolloid like; PCP, procollagen C-proteinase; PCPE, procollagen C-proteinase enhancer; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CUB domain, a protein domain first found in the complement components C1r/C1s, the sea urchin protein Uegf, and BMP-1; EBNA, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen. 1The abbreviations used are: BMP-1, bone morphogenetic protein-1; mTld, mammalian tolloid; mTLL, mammalian tolloid like; PCP, procollagen C-proteinase; PCPE, procollagen C-proteinase enhancer; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CUB domain, a protein domain first found in the complement components C1r/C1s, the sea urchin protein Uegf, and BMP-1; EBNA, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen. which is one of the best studied tolloids, was originally isolated from osteogenic extracts of bone (1Urist M.R.

This redundancy is demonstrated in BMP-1/mTld null mice that have abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis in skin, are perinatal lethal because of delayed ventral wall closure, but lack gross abnormalities of most connective tissues and exhibit normal anatomy (28Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A notable exception is BMP-1 and mTLL-2; BMP-1 is an effective PCP, whereas mTLL-2 will not cleave fibrillar procollagens (at least in the absence of PCPE) (12Pappano W.N. Steiglitz B.M. Scott I.C.

We generated a series of chimeric molecules containing different combinations of proteinase and CUB domains originating from either BMP-1 or mTLL-2, and we expressed and assayed the mutant proteins in vitro. We found that the metalloproteinase and CUB2 domains from BMP-1 were required for PCP activity; the equivalent domains from mTLL-2 were inactive. We also showed that the mTLL-2 proteinase domain possesses chordinase activity if CUB1 from BMP-1 was part of the same molecule. We showed that a minimal structure for chordinase activity comprises a tolloid metalloproteinase domain and the CUB1 of BMP-1 and thus is shorter that the minimal sequence for PCP activity (37Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The procollagen C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 is enhanced by procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1 (PCPE-1), which is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. PCPE-1 enhances the PCP activity of tolloid metalloproteinases up to 20-fold (38Moschcovich L. Bernocco S. Font B. Rivkin H. Eichenberger D. Chejanovsky N. Hulmes D.J. Kessler E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but lacks intrinsic PCP activity. PCPE-1 consists of two N-terminal CUB domains and a C-terminal NTR (netrin-like) domain (39Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although BMP-1 has numerous substrates, it is unknown whether PCPE-1 is able to enhance cleavage of substrates other than procollagen. A recent study suggests that PCPE-1 is specific to procollagen I, II, and III (40Hulmes D. Moali C. Rattenholl A. Eichenberger D. Ruggiero F. Bidaud C. Rousselle P. Abstract of the American Society of Matrix Biology. 2004; Google Scholar).The mechanism of PCP enhancement by PCPE-1 is unknown. Studies have suggested that PCPE-1 acts by causing a conformational change in the substrate (41Adar R. Kessler E. Goldberg B. Collagen Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33864-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the stoichiometry of the interaction requires a 1:1 ratio of PCPE-1:procollagen, indicating that the stimulation occurs via its interaction with the substrate and not the enzyme. To test this model, we assayed BMP-1 in the presence of PCPE-1 and chordin, which is a substrate unrelated to procollagen. As a further test of the model, we examined the ability of PCPE-1 to enhance the PCP activity of the minimal procollagen C-proteinase that lacks the EGF and CUB3 domains of the molecule. However, the PCP activity of BMP-1 was enhanced more by PCPE-1 than was the minimal PCP. Also, we show that PCPE-1 does not enhance the ability of BMP-1 to cleave chordin. The data show that PCPE-1 appears to function via the procollagen substrate but that the CUB3 domain of BMP-1 might augment the interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSource of Materials—Full-length BMP-1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_001199) was cloned from a human placental cDNA library. A FLAG tag amino acid sequence (DYKDDDDK) was introduced into the BMP-1 sequence (BMP-1-FLAG) immediately 5′ of the stop codon. The cDNA encoding FLAG-tagged BMP-1 was subcloned into the episomal expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) (37Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human mTLL-2 (GenBank™ accession number AF_059516) was obtained by synthesis of the sequence from position 1497 to the stop codon (Gen-Script, Piscataway, NJ). A V5-FLAG tag amino acid sequence (GK-PIPNPLLGLDST-DYKDDDDKG) was introduced into the mTLL-2 sequence immediately 5′ of the stop codon. The FLAG epitope is recognized by a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). An XhoI restriction site was introduced after the stop codon for cloning purposes. The synthesized cDNA in pUC18 (Invitrogen) was digested by PmlI (position 1503) and XhoI (after the stop codon) and ligated into the mTLL-2 IMAGE clone cDNA (IMAGE cDNA clone number 3836889) in pCEP4, thus forming the mTLL-2-FLAG cDNA clone. A KpnI restriction enzyme site was introduced 5′ to the start codon of the mTLL-2 cDNA sequence by PCR for cloning purposes and to remove a false start codon occurring in the 5′-untranslated region of IMAGE clone cDNA sequence. The full-length human chordin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_003741) (43Millet C. Lemaire P. Orsetti B. Guglielmi P. Francois V. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was cloned, tagged, and tested for activity as described previously (9Garrigue-Antar L. Francois V. Kadler K.E. J. Biol.

Moali C. Rattenholl A. Eichenberger D. Ruggiero F. Bidaud C. Rousselle P. Abstract of the American Society of Matrix Biology. 2004; Google Scholar).

Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with a NotI site after the metalloproteinase domain were used to generate the chimeric proteins, by excising and recloning the respective fragment from the mTLL-2 clone. (See “Results” for an explanation of the notation in the chimeric tolloid molecule.) The wild-type and deletion mutant BMP-1 cDNA clones had a KpnI site at the 5′end and an XhoI site at the 3′ end for cloning purposes. For the generation of the chimeras, two fragments were amplified by PCR, using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) as described (37Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The first fragment consisted of the mTLL-2 cDNA sequence up to the end of the metalloproteinase domain. For cloning purposes, a KpnI restriction enzyme site was introduced at the 5′ end of the fragment, and a NotI site was introduced at the 3′ end. The second fragment consisted of the mTLL-2 cDNA sequence constituting CUB1 and CUB2. A NotI site was introduced 5′ of CUB1 and a FLAG epitope sequence, a stop codon, and an XhoI restriction enzyme site 3′ of CUB2. The mTLL-2 IMAGE clone in pOTB7 (Invitrogen) was used as a template. For the first fragment, the primers used were a forward primer with the sequence 5′-CGCGGTACCATGCCCCGGGCG-3′ and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′-CCCACATGCGGCCGCCGCTGGGCATTT-3′. For the second fragment, the primers used were a forward primer with the sequence 5′-GTGCCCAGCCGCGGCCGCATGTGGGGAGA-3′ and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′-CCCCCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTTGAAAAAATTGGCTGCAAAGCCCGCTTTATTGATAGAG-3′. The PCR products were purified, digested either by KpnI and NotI or by NotI and XhoI, and inserted into the BMP-1 clones in pCEP4 to replace the BMP-1 domains with the respective domains from mTLL-2. Specifically, the BMP-1-mTLL-2 chimeras were generated by replacing the sequences corresponding to the signal sequence, the prodomain, and the metalloproteinase domain (fragment KpnI to NotI) from BMP-1 with the respective fragment from the mTLL-2 cDNA. Likewise, the BMP-1-mTLL-2 chimeras were generated by replacing the BMP-1 sequence from NotI to XhoI with the fragment containing domains of mTLL-2. DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems) was used to verify the replacement and to ensure that the cDNA clones were error-free.Protein Expression—293-EBNA (ECACC 85120602) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Wild-type or mutant plasmid/T25 were incubated with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and added to 293-EBNA cells in serum-free OptiMEM (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium was removed and replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum for a further 24 h. The cells were trypsinized (Invitrogen) and diluted 1:5 for selection. After 48 h, selection was initiated by the addition of 0.25 mg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen). A full-length BMP-1-FLAG cDNA clone, a BMP-1-ΔC3-FLAG clone, and a BMP-1-Δ-EC3-FLAG clone were expressed in 293-EBNA cells (37Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A FLAG tag was engineered to the C terminus of recombinant PCPE-1 by PCR. Full-length PCPE/pcDNA3 was used as a template, and the PCR reaction involved a forward primer with the sequence 5′-CGCGGTACCATGCTGCCTGCA-3′ and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′-CCCCCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTCCTGGGACGCAGC-3′. The forward primer incorporates a KpnI restriction enzyme site before the ATG start codon of PCPE-1. The reverse primer includes the final 15 bases before the TGA stop codon, the FLAG tag sequence followed by the stop codon, and then an XhoI restriction enzyme site. The KpnI and XhoI sites were introduced for cloning purposes. DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems) was used to ensure that the cDNA clones were error-free.Preparation of Medium and Cell Lysates—Confluent cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking fetal calf serum for 24 h. Medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,600 × g to remove cell debris, and the pH was stabilized by the addition of 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). For preparation of cell lysates, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min with occasional shaking. The cells were scraped on ice and sonicated. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.Protein Purification—Type I procollagen was purified from the culture medium of primary human fibroblasts, after incubation of the cells with uniformly labeled 14C-labeled l-amino acids, as described (45Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged proteins were purified from the medium of cultured cells as described (4Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Supernatants and cell lysates (see above) were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) SDS-Prosieve gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications) under reducing conditions and subjected to Western immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used where appropriate: the mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by the secondary antibody (anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated IgG (Sigma)); the mouse monoclonal 9E10 directed against the c-Myc tag followed by the secondary antibody (anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated IgG (Sigma)). The signal was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Super-Signal West Dura extended duration, Pierce).Assay of Procollagen C-proteinase and Chordinase Activities—The wild-type and chimeric proteins were assayed for procollagen C-proteinase activity using human U-l-14C-labeled procollagen I substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.12 m NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) Brij-35 in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C for 16 h. Analysis of the cleavage products on SDS gels (7% separating; 4% stacking) was performed as described (46Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the cleaved products were visualized by exposing dried gels to a phosphorimaging plate (Fuji, type BAS III) in a phosphorimaging device (Fujix BAS 2000). One unit of C-proteinase activity was defined as the amount of BMP-1 needed to cleave 1 μg of type I procollagen in 1 h at 34 °C, as described (45Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins corresponding to the proα1(I) and pNα2(I) chains of type I procollagen and type I pNcollagen, respectively, were quantified using AIDA 2.0 software. The percentage of cleavage was calculated by multiplying the intensity of the pNα2(I), corrected for molecular mass, by the initial concentration of procollagen. Chordinase activity was determined in vitro by cleavage of c-Myc-tagged chordin in the same buffer as above for 16 h at 37 °C followed by analysis of the cleavage products on a 10% SDS-Prosieve gel, and Western blot using 9E10 antibody as described above. Where indicated, EDTA was added at a final concentration of 10 mm.RESULTSNomenclature Used to Describe the Chimeric Proteins—We use the labels M, C1, C2, E, and C3 to represent the metalloproteinase, CUB1, CUB2, the most N-terminal EGF-like domain, and CUB3 domains of the tolloid family of proteinases. We use “B” and “T” in superscript to denote from which tolloid a particular domain has been taken. For example, MT-C1B is used as a shorthand notation to represent a mature (i.e. lacking the prodomain) chimeric tolloid molecule containing the metalloproteinase domain from mTLL-2 immediately followed (in the N- to C-direction) by the CUB1 domain from BMP-1. Hyphens are used to avoid confusion. We use parentheses to group together domains from a single tolloid, e.g. (M-C1-C2)T is a truncated molecule containing the metalloproteinase, CUB1, and CUB2 domains of mTLL-2. All molecules were synthesized containing a signal peptide and the prodomain. The signal peptide and prodomains in chimeric proteins were from the same molecule as the metalloproteinase domain, e.g. the molecule (M-C1-C2)T was synthesized with the signal peptide and the prodomain from mTLL-2. All molecules have the FLAG tag at the C terminus, but for brevity, this is not indicated in the shorthand labels.The Chimeric Proteins Are Readily Secreted from 293-EBNA Cells—To evaluate the contribution of the metalloproteinase and non-catalytic domai"
https://openalex.org/W2103944130,"Elevated soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) levels have been found in many pathological conditions, including obesity. To determine the effects of elevated sICAM-1 on immune responses and metabolism, we generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the extracellular domain of mouse ICAM-1 in the liver. The mice, showing 10-fold higher sICAM-1 levels than wild-type mice, presented elevated neutrophil count. Despite this, after intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate, neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal cavity was reduced, and the delayed macrophage recruitment was also affected in the transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Inhibition of contact hypersensitivity response in the sICAM-1 transgenic mice was comparable to ICAM-1-deficient mice and characterized by significantly less ear swelling and inflammatory cell infiltration than in wild-type mice. sICAM-1transgenic mice were more susceptible to weight gain on a Western-type diet than wild-type mice, and older animals showed excessive fat accumulation, again reminiscent of ICAM-1-deficient mice. Together, these data indicate that sICAM-1 interferes with ICAM-1-mediated cell-cell interactions, which could produce immune-suppressant effects and alteration of metabolism in persons with high levels of this soluble adhesion receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1987822949,"We have previously observed that collagen IV regulates Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell spreading and migration via Src kinase and stimulates Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. We observed that collagen IV also stimulated Src-dependent phosphorylation of both paxillin Tyr31 and paxillin Tyr118. Caco-2 transfection with paxillin or p130cas siRNAs inhibited expression of these proteins by more than 90% for at least 5 days after transfection. Although p130cas siRNA inhibited cell spreading on collagen IV by 33%, three different paxillin siRNAs did not inhibit cell spreading. p130cas siRNA did not affect Src Tyr416 or Src Tyr527 phosphorylation, FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation, or Src-dependent phosphorylation of FAK Tyr925, suggesting that p130cas did not inhibit cell spreading by altering FAK or Src activity. Rat p130cas expression after siRNA knock-out of endogenous human p130cas in Caco-2 cells reduced cell spreading inhibition by 71%. In contrast, expression of rat p130cas from which the Src-phosphorylated substrate domain was deleted did not rescue siRNA inhibition of cell spreading. Combined treatment with siRNAs to Crk and CrkL, which bind to the p130cas substrate domain, inhibited cell spreading by 54%. Both p130cas siRNA and the combined Crk/CrkL siRNAs strongly inhibited (52 and 46% inhibition, respectively) Caco-2 sheet migration on collagen IV and noticeably inhibited lamellipodial extension, whereas paxillin siRNA only inhibited migration by 18% and did not noticeably affect lamellipodial extension. These results suggest that Src may regulate Caco-2 migration on collagen IV via both p130cas and paxillin but that Src phosphorylation of p130cas is more important for this process. We have previously observed that collagen IV regulates Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell spreading and migration via Src kinase and stimulates Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. We observed that collagen IV also stimulated Src-dependent phosphorylation of both paxillin Tyr31 and paxillin Tyr118. Caco-2 transfection with paxillin or p130cas siRNAs inhibited expression of these proteins by more than 90% for at least 5 days after transfection.

Rat p130cas expression after siRNA knock-out of endogenous human p130cas in Caco-2 cells reduced cell spreading inhibition by 71%. In contrast, expression of rat p130cas from which the Src-phosphorylated substrate domain was deleted did not rescue siRNA inhibition of cell spreading. Combined treatment with siRNAs to Crk and CrkL, which bind to the p130cas substrate domain, inhibited cell spreading by 54%. Both p130cas siRNA and the combined Crk/CrkL siRNAs strongly inhibited (52 and 46% inhibition, respectively) Caco-2 sheet migration on collagen IV and noticeably inhibited lamellipodial extension, whereas paxillin siRNA only inhibited migration by 18% and did not noticeably affect lamellipodial extension. These results suggest that Src may regulate Caco-2 migration on collagen IV via both p130cas and paxillin but that Src phosphorylation of p130cas is more important for this process."

Because this receptor is a potential therapeutic target, great interest has been devoted to the identification of efficient antagonists. However, interspecies genetic polymorphism that does not alter cholecystokinin-induced signaling was shown to markedly affect activity of synthetic ligands. In this context, precise structural study of the agonist binding site on the human cholecystokinin receptor-2 is a prerequisite to elucidating the molecular basis for its activation and to optimizing properties of synthetic ligands. In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling, we delineated the binding site for CCK on the human cholecystokinin receptor-2 by mutating amino acids corresponding to that of the rat homolog. By doing so, we demonstrated that, although resembling that of rat homolog, the human cholecystokinin receptor-2 binding site also displays important distinct structural features that were demonstrated by susceptibility to several point mutations (F120A, Y189A, H207A). Furthermore, docking of CCK in the human and rat cholecystokinin receptor-2, followed by dynamic simulations, allowed us to propose a plausible structural explanation of the experimentally observed difference between rat and human cholecystokinin-2 receptors.

Both peptides share an identical carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide sequence but differ in their selectivity for the two CCK receptor subtypes, the CCK1 (CCK1R) and the CCK2 (CCK2R) receptors, on the basis of tyrosine sulfation at the seventh position (CCK) or at the sixth position (gastrin) from the carboxyl terminus. Although both receptors recognize sulfated CCK with comparable high affinity, the CCK2R has high affinity for both sulfated and non-sulfated gastrin (1Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N.

CCK1R and CCK2R are seven-transmembrane spanning receptors that belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors and have ∼50% homology (3de Weerth A. Pisegna J.R. Huppi K. Wank S.A. Biochem.

CCK1Rs are mainly found in the peripheral organs, where they regulate pancreatic secretion and gallbladder and gastrointestinal motility, but are also found in some areas of the central nervous system, where they regulate satiety and analgesia. CCK2Rs are predominantly present throughout the central nervous system, where they regulate anxiety/panic attacks and dopamine release, implicated in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic related movement and behavioral disorders in humans. In the gut, CCK2Rs regulate acid and histamine secretions, gastrointestinal motility, as well as growth in the gastric mucosa (1Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Noble F. Wank S.A. Crawley J.N. Bradwejn J. Seroogy K.B. Hamon M. Roques B.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 745-781PubMed Google Scholar). The important physiological functions mediated by CCK receptors, and therefore their possible implication in associated disorders, have generated considerable interest in the identification of ligands that selectively activate or block CCK1R and CCK2R (6Herranz R. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To date, a large panel of such molecules has been designed covering a wide range of functional activities, such as full, partial, and inverse agonists, as well as antagonists (6Herranz R. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Pharmacological characterization of selective synthetic CCK2R ligands among different species pointed out an interspecies genetic polymorphism that does not alter endogenous hormone-induced signaling but markedly affects both the affinity and activity of synthetic ligands (7Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Schaffer K. Beinborn M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 346-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This is the case for L-365,260 and L-364,718, two reference non-peptidic CCK2R antagonists that present reversal in the affinity rank order on canine or human recombinant CCK2R despite a 93% identity in their protein sequence (8Beinborn M. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kopin A.S. Nature. 1993; 362: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, efficacy of PD-135,158, a CCK2R partial agonist, is 60% of CCK-induced maximal production of inositol phosphates on mouse CCK2R but only 20% on human CCK2R, despite 90% identity (9Kopin A.S.

These interspecies differences toward synthetic ligands were shown to be caused by sequence variations within the binding site of the CCK2R (7Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Schaffer K. Beinborn M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 346-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Such data pointed out the high importance of in vivo and in vitro tests with human protein targets.The aims of the present study, using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling, were to delineate the binding site for CCK on the human CCK2R and to investigate whether insensitivity of endogenous ligands to interspecies polymorphism between rat and human CCK2R can be explained by differences in their positioning into the CCK2R binding site or whether they are related to distinct susceptibilities to mutations. For that purpose, we took advantage of our previous data, which demonstrated an interaction between His207 of rat CCK2R and Asp8 of CCK, between the Tyr189 and Asn358 residues of rat CCK2R and the carboxyl-terminal amide of CCK (10Silvente-Poirot S.

Poirot M. Taillefer J. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Escrieut C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Silvente-Poirot S. Mol.

These key amino acids of the CCK2R binding site were mutated in the human CCK2R, and the mutant receptors were characterized for CCK affinity, as well as efficacy and potency, to stimulate inositol phosphates accumulation. By doing so, we demonstrated that, although resembling that of rat CCK2R, the human CCK2R binding site also displays important distinct structural features that are confirmed by susceptibility to point mutations and docking, followed by dynamic simulations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sulfated [Thr28,Nle31]CCK25–33 (H-Arg-Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Thr-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2, CCK9S), was synthesized as described previously (13Moroder L.

Chem. 1981; 362: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 125I-Sodium (2000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Sulfated [Thr28,Nle31]CCK25–33 was conjugated with Bolton-Hunter reagent, purified, and radioiodinated as described previously (14Fourmy D. Lopez P. Poirot S. Jimenez J. Dufresne M. Moroder L. Powers S.P. Vaysse N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and is referred to as [125I]CCK9S.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Transfection of COS-7 cells—All mutant receptor cDNAs were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the human CCK2R cDNAs cloned into pRFENeo vector as a template. The presence of the desired and the absence of undesired mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing of the complete CCK2R coding sequence (Applied Biosystems).COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, the cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/plate of pRFENeo vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type or mutated CCK2 receptors, using a modified DEAE-dextran method as described previously (10Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Gales C. Fehrentz J.A. Escherich A. Wank S.A. Martinez J. Moroder L. Maigret B. Bouisson M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23191-23197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cells were transferred to 24-well plates at a density of 20,000–150,000 cells/well 24 h after transfection, depending on the transfected mutant and the experiment to be performed.Binding Experiments—Approximately 24 h after the transfer of the transfected cells to 24-well plates, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.3 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, with either 50 pm (wild-type CCK2R, R356K), 100 pm (R57A, F120A, Y189F), 250 pm (H207A, N358A, Y189A, R356A, R356H) or 500 pm (R356D) [125I]CCK9S in the presence or in the absence of unlabeled CCK9S. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and cell-associated radioligand was collected by cell lysis with NaOH 0.1 n. The radioactivity was directly counted in a γ counter (Auto-γ, Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Receptor density and Kd were calculated from homologous [125I]CCK9S/CCK9S competition binding experiments using Ligand software (Kell, Cambridge, UK). Ki values were calculated using the non-linear curve fitting software GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA).Inositol Phosphate Assay—Approximately 24 h after the transfer to 24-well plates and following overnight incubation in DMEM containing 2 μCi/ml myo-2-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences), the transfected cells were washed with DMEM and then incubated for 30 min in 1 ml/well DMEM containing 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. The cells were washed with inositol phosphate buffer, pH 7.45, phosphate-buffered saline containing 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA,10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.3 ml of inositol phosphate buffer with or without increasing CCK9S concentration. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of methanol/HCl to each well, and the content was transferred to a column (Dowex AG 1-X8, formate form, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for the determination of inositol phosphates. The columns were washed twice with 3 ml of distilled water and twice with 2 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate/60 mm sodium formate. The content of each column was eluted by the addition of 2 ml of 1 m ammonium formate/100 mm formic acid. Radioactivity of 1 ml of the eluted fraction was evaluated using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). EC50 values were calculated from dose effect curves by non-linear regression curve fitting using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA).Molecular Modeling of Human CCK2R·CCK Complex and Dynamic Simulations—The human CCK2R model was built by homology modeling from the rat CCK2R·CCK complex model described by Gales et al. (11Gales C. Poirot M. Taillefer J. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Escrieut C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Silvente-Poirot S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using Insight II modules (Homology, Discover 3, Biopolymer, Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Alignment of the human CCK2R sequence on the rat CCK2R sequence was performed using the alignment procedure followed by manual refinement so that motifs common to all G protein-coupled receptors and conserved amino acids between the two sequences precisely matched. The coordinates of the human CCK2R were then assigned to those of the rat CCK2R three-dimensional model, based on this alignment. The resulting model was finally submitted to energy minimization by the steepest descent (until convergence to 2 kcal/mol/Å) and conjugated gradient (until convergence to 0.01 kcal/mol/Å) to remove steric clashes. During minimization, C-α trace was tethered using a quadratic potential. This was performed using the Discover 3 module with the consistent force field. The non-bond cutoff method and the dielectric constant were set up to cell multipole and were distance-dependent, respectively (e = r). The minimized model of human CCK2 receptor was used to perform manual docking of CCK. The conformation of CCK was taken from the optimized complex of rat CCK2R·CCK (11Gales C. Poirot M. Taillefer J. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Escrieut C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Silvente-Poirot S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and docking was performed taking into account the position of CCK in that receptor. The obtained human CCK2R·CCK complex was minimized again according to the previously described minimization protocol, with no C-α restraints, and was further subjected to molecular dynamics in a two-step procedure. In the first step, the complex was heated from 10 K up to 300 K during 5000 fs, and in the second step, it was kept at 300 K until equilibration. The tethering force on the C-α trace was kept in heating and was successively decreased by reducing the force constant value of the quadratic potential from 100 to 80, 50, 30, 10, and 0 every 1000 ps in the second step. The integration time step was set up to 1 fs, and the calculations were performed at constant volume and temperature. A snapshot of the system was saved every 100 fs. Once the system was equilibrated, the coordinates of 20 snapshots were averaged and submitted again to the previously mentioned minimization protocol, with no C-α restraints.RESULTSEffects of R57A, F120A, H207A, Y189F, Y189A, and N353A Mutations in the Human CCK2R on CCK Affinity and Potency— Human R57A, F120A, H207A, Y189A, Y189F, and N353A mutants were constructed and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Scatchard analysis of [I125]CCK9S binding to the wild-type human CCK2R indicated that CCK9S binds to high affinity sites with Ki values of 0.75 ± 0.03 nm (Bmax 3.2 ± 0.3 pmol/106 cells) (Tables I and II). Mutation of Arg57 and Phe120 in alanine or mutation of Tyr189 in phenylalanine slightly reduced, between 4- and 6-fold, CCK9S affinity with Ki values of 3.4 ± 0.4 nm (Bmax 0.85 ± 0.09 pmol/106 cells), 3.1 ± 0.4 nm (Bmax 0.79 ± 0.08 pmol/106 cells), and 4.3 ± 0.4 nm (Bmax 1.1 ± 0.2 pmol/106 cells), respectively (Tables I and II). Y189A, H207A, and N353A mutants displayed between 25- and 73-fold decreased affinity for CCK9S with respective Ki values of 55 ± 8 nm (Bmax 2.7 ± 0.5 pmol/106 cells), 19 ± 2 nm (Bmax 1.1 ± 0.1 pmol/106 cells), and 20 ± 2 nm (Bmax 0.8 ± 0.1 pmol/106 cells) (Tables I and II). In agreement with binding data, the potency of CCK9S to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation was reduced for all mutants (EC50) and directly correlated with the loss of affinity for CCK9. The mutants displayed CCK9S efficacy (Emax, Table I) comparable with that of wild-type CCK2R, except for the Y189A mutant, which presented a 44% decrease of CCK9S maximal effect despite similar receptor density (Table I). Comparison of these results with those from our previous studies performed in exactly the same experimental conditions on rat CCK2R mutants reveals that, except for N353A mutation (the human corresponding mutant of rat N358A), all of the mutations carried out on the human CCK2R less markedly affected CCK affinity and activity, supporting the view that the corresponding residues are differentially involved in the binding sites of the two CCK2Rs (Table II, Fwt).Table IEffects of mutations of amino acids of the human CCK2R on binding affinity and biological activity of CCK9SBindingInositol phosphate productionHigh affinityLow affinityBmaxEC50FWT°EmaxKd1F1WT°Kd2F2WT°High affinityLow affinitynmnmpmol/106 cellsnmWT0.37 ± 0.0212.8 ± 0.310.89 ± 0.052.3 ± 0.20.34 ± 0.051100R57A1.3 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.422 ± 3ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.80.19 ± 0.040.66 ± 0.052.2 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.6100 ± 2F120A1.2 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.317 ± 4ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.60.14 ± 0.030.65 ± 0.051.6 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.599 ± 2Y189F3.2 ± 0.5ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.921 ± 4ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.80.28 ± 0.050.82 ± 0.183.7 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.1197 ± 3Y189A50 ± 5ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.136436 ± 24ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.1560.45 ± 0.052.2 ± 0.537 ± 6ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.10956 ± 2ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.H207A8.3 ± 1.4ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.2751 ± 5ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.180.31 ± 0.050.78 ± 0.1312 ± 2ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.3597 ± 2N353A12 ± 1ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.32114 ± 5ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.410.17 ± 0.060.62 ± 0.0411 ± 1ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.3299 ± 2R356K0.38 ± 0.0213.2 ± 0.411.1 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.30.54 ± 0.061.6100 ± 2R356H3.8 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.1051 ± 10ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.180.21 ± 0.050.71 ± 0.134.1 ± 0.5ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.12100 ± 3R356A28 ± 2ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.760.49 ± 0.0422 ± 4ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.65100 ± 3R356D345 ± 35ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.9321.1 ± 0.176 ± 6ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.224100 ± 2a p < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared to wild-type receptor value.

Because the homologous amino acid in the human CCK2R is Arg356, we determined whether this residue could also be involved in the binding site of the human CCK2R. For this purpose, R356A, R356H, R356K, and R356D mutants were constructed and analyzed. These mutants were designed to remove partially or completely the positive charges of this arginine (R356A, R356H, and R356K mutants) or to introduce a negative charge at that position (R356D mutant). Mutation of Arg356 in lysine did not modify CCK9S affinity (Ki = 0.50 ± 0.05 nm, Bmax 3.9 ± 0.4 pmol/106 cells) nor the potency and efficacy of CCK9S to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation (EC50 = 0.54 ± 0.06 nm). Replacement of Arg356 by a histidine or an alanine reduced 10- and 76-fold, respectively, CCK9S affinity, whereas R356D displayed a 932-fold lower affinity relative to the high affinity component of the wild-type human CCK2R (Table I and Fig. 1). In agreement with binding data, R356H, R356A, and R356D mutants displayed reduced CCK9S potencies to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation but unchanged efficacy (Table I and Fig. 1). These results indicate that positive charges of the amino acid side chain at position 356 of the CCK2R are important for high affinity binding of CCK.Structural Study of Human CCK2R Binding Site Using Docking and Dynamic Simulations—Results from the current site-directed mutagenesis study support the view that homologous residues in the human CCK2R binding sites are differentially involved in the binding site of CCK compared with rat CCK2R, which we previously characterized. Because human and rat CCK2R present non-conserved amino acids in extracellular domains and transmembrane helices (Fig. 2), in a first attempt to explain distinct involvement of His207, we exchanged the neighboring amino acid, namely Val206, for the corresponding amino acid of the rat sequence, Met. However, the resulting CCK2R mutant (V206MH207A) did not display an altered pharmacological profile, as compared with the human H207A mutant (not shown). We also considered the possibility that His207, which can exist in different tautomeric forms, could be differently protonated in human and rat CCK2R. However, pK calculations using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and the generalized Born approach (embodied in the website chekhov.cs.vt.edu/completion/index.php) yielded similar values (pK, for rat 3.3 and 4.2, and for human 3.5 and 4.6) thus ruling out this hypothesis. This led us to hypothesize that non-conserved amino acids, including those in transmembrane helices, likely act collectively to position differently CCK in the binding site of the human CCK2R relative to the rat CCK2R. We therefore performed in silico experiments by building a three-dimensional structure of the human CCK2R·CCK complex based on the coordinates of the rat CCK2R·CCK complex that we previously experimentally validated (11Gales C. Poirot M. Taillefer J. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Escrieut C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Silvente-Poirot S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thereafter, we applied molecular dynamics to assess whether variations in the CCK2R sequence could result in a distinct location of CCK that could explain pharmacological results. A simplified view of the obtained human CCK2R·CCK complex is presented in Fig. 3, A and C. The docking, followed by dynamic simulations, revealed that Arg1 and Asp2 of CCK form internal ionic bonds; sulfated Tyr3 of CCK is in ionic interaction with Arg57 and makes a hydrogen bond with Tyr61; Thr4 forms a hydrogen bond with Arg356; Trp6 forms both a hydrogen bond with His376 and aryl sulfur interactions with Met67 and Cys107 and hydrophobic interactions with Phe120 and Phe110; Nle7 lies in an hydrophobic pocket composed of Pro371, Trp355, and Leu367; the carboxyl group of Asp8 interacts with Arg356 and Ser131; the phenyl group of Phe9 is sited in an aromatic pocket made of Tyr189, Tyr192, Tyr350, Trp346, Phe342, and Phe227; and the carbonyl group of CCK amide forms hydrogen bound with the hydroxyl group of Tyr189, whereas –NH2 of the CCK amide interacts with Asn353 and Thr193 (Fig. 3A). According to these results, the binding site of the human CCK2R resembles that of the rat CCK2R. However, and importantly, CCK drifts deeper in the human CCK2R, representing a difference of ∼1.5 Å, and the C-terminal part of CCK between Trp6 and Phe9 displays a deviation of the backbone of >2.5 Å, as compared with rat CCK2R·CCK complex, which was subjected to the same procedure of dynamic simulations (see Fig. 3C for comparison). In addition, the phenyl group of Phe9 has an affected orientation, as compared with the rat complex, where it approximated Tyr189. In the human complex, Phe9 seems more inserted in a cavity composed of Tyr189, Tyr192, Tyr350, Trp346, Phe342, and Phe227 (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, Asp8 forms stable ionic interactions mostly with Arg356 but less with His, which dominated in the rat complex.Fig. 2Serpentine representation of the human CCK2R. On this representation of the human CCK2R, amino acids Arg57, Phe120, His207, Tyr189, Asn353, and Arg356, which are corresponding amino acids of the rat CCK2R binding site of CCK, are indicated.

Several Tec family kinases (Tec, Itk, Rlk/Txk) are expressed in T cells, but it is still not clear to what degree these are redundant or have unique functions. We recently demonstrated that Tec alone, among the Tec kinase family members examined, can induce nuclear factor of activated T cell-dependent transcription. This unique functional characteristic correlated with a unique pattern of subcellular localization, as Tec (but not other family members) was found in small vesicles, the appearance of which requires signaling through the T cell receptor for antigen. Here we report on our studies of these Tec-containing structures in live T cells, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. With this technique, we showed that, in live T cells, the Tec vesicles are located at the plasma membrane, the vesicles are unique to Tec (and not the related kinase Itk), and their formation and maintenance require T cell receptor signaling through Src family kinases and PI 3-kinase. Finally, we have imaged isolated T cell membranes by confocal microscopy, confirming the membrane-proximal location of Tec vesicles, as well as demonstrating overlap of these vesicles with the tyrosine kinase Lck, the Tec substrate PLC-γ1, and the early endosomal antigen 1 marker EEA1.

The earliest detectable biochemical event after ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; SH, Src homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; PLC-γ1, phospholipase C-γ1; LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1. for antigen is an increase in tyrosine kinase activity. Three classes of tyrosine kinase have been implicated in TCR signal transduction: those of the Src, Syk, and Tec families (1Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Src family kinases Lck and Fyn are responsible for the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in the CD3 and ζ chains, which are associated with the TCR. These phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for the tyrosine kinases ZAP-70 and Syk, which phosphorylate a number of downstream signaling intermediates, including various adaptor proteins and enzymes. Finally, tyrosine kinases of the Tec family become activated; in T cells, these include Itk, Tec, and Rlk/Txk, whereas in B cells, the principal family member is Btk (1Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2Takesono A. Finkelstein L.D. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a tyrosine kinase domain, Tec kinases also contain several protein-protein interaction and localization domains, including an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that mediates interactions with phosphotyrosine moieties, an SH3 domain that mediates interactions with proline-rich sequences, and a domain that mediates membrane recruitment (3Lewis C.M. Broussard C. Czar M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In Tec, Btk, Itk, and BMX, the latter is a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to the PI 3-kinase products PI(3,4)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3, whereas in Rlk, this function is carried out by a cysteine-rich string. Tec kinases also contain a proline-rich sequence that can bind to the SH3 domain of the same molecule, resulting in an intramolecular interaction that negatively regulates kinase activity (4Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A major function of Tec family kinases is apparently to increase the efficiency of phospholipase C-γ activation, which results in the production of the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (5Lucas J.A. Miller A.T. Atherly L.O. Berg L.J. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The former causes release of intracellular calcium, which leads to capacitative calcium influx and activation of calcium-dependent enzymes such as calcineurin. The latter contributes to protein kinase C and Ras activation. Unlike in the B cell lineage, where Btk is absolutely required for development and activation, Tec kinases appear to play a more modulatory role in T cell activation (1Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 3Lewis C.M. Broussard C. Czar M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin.

Res. 2003; 27: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Various knock-out studies have shown that ablation of one or more Tec kinases leads to moderate-to-severe impairment of T cell activation and effector function, although not as severe as the lack of Src or Syk family kinases (5Lucas J.A. Miller A.T. Atherly L.O. Berg L.J. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Schwartzberg P.L. Immunol. Res. 2003; 27: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). One outstanding question regarding Tec family kinase function in T cells is the degree to which Itk, Tec, and Rlk/Txk are redundant or can perform unique functions. There is now evidence that, although Itk contributes preferentially to Th2 helper T cell differentiation, Rlk/Txk activation seems to bias T cells to adopt a Th1 phenotype (8Kashiwakura J. Suzuki N.

Exp. Allergy. 2004; 34: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We recently performed a series of structure/function analyses of several Tec kinases, comparing their ability to activate downstream signaling pathways in T cells, as well as their subcellular localization before and after T cell activation (12Tomlinson M.G. Kurosaki T. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H. Johnston J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13577-13585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We showed that Tec, unlike Itk or Btk, is a potent inducer of NFAT-dependent transcription. This was consistent with previous reports that Tec could activate NFAT and interleukin-2 reporters (13Yang W.C. Ghiotto M. Castellano R. Collette Y. Auphan N. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Yang W.C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We also noted that the ability of Tec to activate NFAT correlated with a rather unique pattern of subcellular localization. Whereas Tec, Itk, and Btk all reside in the cytoplasm of resting T cells, activation by antigen results in different patterns of localization. Itk and Btk are both recruited to the plasma membrane, with especially high concentrations at the site of contact between the T cell and antigen-presenting cell. However, Tec is recruited into punctate structures that are oriented toward the antigen-presenting cell and appear to be at or near the plasma membrane. Further evidence of a requirement for signaling in the formation of these structures came from examination of Tec localization in Jurkat T cells. Recent studies have shown that Jurkat cells have high constitutive levels of PIP3 due to the lack of expression of two PIP3 phosphatases, PTEN and SHIP (15Shan X. Czar M.J. Bunnell S.C. Liu P. Liu Y. Schwartzberg P.L. Wange R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6945-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16Astoul E. Cantrell D.A. Edmunds C. Ward S.G. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 490-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When we examined Tec localization in these cells, it was found constitutively in punctate structures at or near the plasma membrane (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although a high percentage of Itk and Btk appeared to be at the plasma membrane in Jurkat cells, these kinases were not found in the same type of punctate structures. We were interested in examining the Tec-containing structures in live cells, so we turned to a relatively novel technique for studying fluorescently tagged proteins near the cell surface, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Using a highly sensitive TIRF system, we have followed the formation of the Tec-containing structures upon T cell contact with anti-CD3/CD28-coated coverslips. We have also studied the kinetics of their reversal after treatment with tyrosine kinase or PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Finally we have performed confocal microscopy of isolated T cell membrane patches. We show here that the Tec-containing vesicles: 1) form after encounter of T cells with a stimulatory (but not merely adhesive) surface; (2Takesono A. Finkelstein L.D. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) require constant signaling for maintenance, because inhibition of tyrosine kinases or PI 3-kinase results in rapid loss; and (3Lewis C.M. Broussard C. Czar M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) overlap with an early endosomal compartment, as well as with the important signaling molecules Lck and PLC-γ1. Cells—D10.G4.1 is a murine CD4+ Th2 clone that recognizes a fragment of chicken conalbumin presented by the Class II major histocompatibility complex molecule I-Ak (18Kaye J. Porcelli S. Tite J. Jones B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 836-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). We previously reported a subline of the D10 clone that can be maintained for up to one month in medium supplemented with interleukin-2 after restimulation with antigen and that is also amenable to transient transfection (19Kane L.P. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5441-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasmids/Antibodies/Inhibitors—Plasmids encoding Tec-GFP and Itk-GFP have been described previously (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Antibodies to murine CD3 and CD28 (2C11 and 37.51) were obtained from BD Biosciences. Anti-LFA-1 (anti-CD18) was obtained from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). PP2, LY294002, and LY303511 were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-ZAP-70 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to PLC-γ1 and EEA1 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Alexa555-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Transfections—D10 cells were transfected by electroporation essentially as described previously (19Kane L.P. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5441-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, 10 million D10 cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and added to a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette containing 10 μg of plasmid encoding Tec-GFP or Itk-GFP, plus 20 μg of empty pCDNA3 vector as a carrier. Cuvettes were pulsed at 250 V, 959 microfarads in a GenePulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). The cells were placed into culture with 10 ml of complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium + 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, and Hepes buffer, pH 7.3) supplemented with 25 units/ml recombinant human interleukin-2 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, NJ; obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). The next day, live cells were purified with Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) and placed back into culture for 24 h before imaging. Imaging—Glass bottom 35-mm cell culture dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) were precoated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 or LFA-1 and diluted to 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. The dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by distilled H2O, and then left to dry. Transfected D10 cells were settled onto dishes held by a heating collar that maintained medium at a constant 37 °C. The cells were initially imaged as they settled and spread onto the glass coverslip, and then additional cells were imaged after establishing stable interactions with the antibody-coated coverslip (15–30 min after addition to the dish). TIRF imaging was performed basically as described previously (20Keyel P.A. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13190-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged on a Nikon (Melville, NY) TIRF system using a 60 × numerical aperture 1.45 oil immersion objective and a Prairie (Madison, WI) acousto-optic tunable filter controlled laser bench. All experiments used the 488 line on a 150-milliwatt argon source. Images were collected (1 frame/2 s) using Simple PCI software (Compix, Cranberry, PA) and a Q imaging Retiga EXI camera. Time-based series were collected and processed using Simple PCI. Further processing to generate scaled, false-color, images was performed with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, Downington, PA). Grayscale still images were extracted from movies using QuickTime Pro, and all final figures were assembled in Canvas. To prepare T cell membranes for confocal imaging, transfected D10 cells were allowed to settle for 30 min at 37 °C onto glass-bottomed dishes coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. The dishes were then washed vigorously three times with phosphate-buffered saline using a transfer pipette, leaving only tightly adhered T cell membranes attached to the dish, which were then fixed and stained as described previously (19Kane L.P. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5441-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). T cell membranes were imaged on an Olympus Fluo-View 500 confocal microscope, using a 60× (numerical aperture 1.4) objective. Two-color imaging was performed sequentially to eliminate bleed-through between channels. TIFF images (24-bit) were imported into Canvas for presentation. We employed a highly sensitive TIRF system to study the localization and dynamics of the Tec tyrosine kinase during T cell activation (Fig. 1A). TIRF imaging relies on an evanescent wave that is generated when light reflects off a surface at an incident angle, equivalent to or greater than the critical angle. The evanescent wave decays exponentially and effectively penetrates 100–150 nm beyond the coverslip into the cell. The method has a much higher signal:noise ratio than any other fluorescence imaging method, and as such, it allows very small numbers and concentrations of molecules to be excited. D10 T cells transfected with a plasmid encoding Tec-GFP (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were dropped onto anti-CD3/CD28-coated glass-bottomed culture dishes and imaged as shown in Fig. 1A. Tec-GFP-expressing cells in contact with the dish (and therefore receiving stimulation through the TCR and CD28) exhibited a distinct pattern of punctate fluorescence that accounted for a significant fraction of Tec-GFP visible at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B; see also supplemental Movie 1). These appear to be the same structures that we previously observed in Jurkat and D10 T cells by wide field immunofluorescence microscopy and deconvolution (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The localization of Tec in activated T cells was in marked contrast to that of the related kinase Itk. Again, as shown in Fig. 2A, Tec-GFP localized in small punctate structures upon contact with anti-CD3/CD28-coated dishes. However, Itk-GFP (Fig. 2B) adopted a more diffuse pattern of plasma membrane localization, with an increased concentration at what appeared to be a “leading edge,” similar to what is seen with an Akt PH domain-GFP fusion in chemotaxing cells (21Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Indeed, this structure appeared very dynamic, with constant ruffling and apparent exchange of Itk-GFP into and of the leading edge (see supplemental Movie 2). A very similar pattern to Itk-GFP was observed when we imaged a GFP fusion with the PH domain of Akt in D10 cells by TIRF microscopy (data not shown). We next applied T cells transfected with Tec-GFP to dishes coated with antibody specific for the integrin LFA-1 to determine whether the appearance of the Tec-containing vesicles is a specific result of signaling through the TCR-CD3 complex. As shown in Fig. 2C (and supplemental Movie 3), T cells settled onto dishes coated with anti-LFA-1 antibody and began to spread. Some areas of increased GFP fluorescence were noted, but they were of a much lower intensity than those seen when Tec-expressing cells were in contact with anti-CD3-coated dishes (Figs. 1B and 2A). Rather, it appeared that these represented membrane extensions, as they contacted the anti-LFA-1 antibody, whereas the structures seen with anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation appeared to be internal vesicles located at or near the plasma membrane. There also appeared to be a “leading edge” structure, similar to what was noted in anti-CD3-stimulated cells expressing Itk-GFP (Fig. 2B). Thus, adhesion through an integrin results in membrane translocation of Tec-GFP, which is not surprising, because integrins are known to activate PI 3-kinase and Tec family kinases (2Takesono A. Finkelstein L.D. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the distinct pattern of small vesicular fluorescence that is seen when cells encounter anti-CD3 antibody is not seen with an anti-integrin antibody. Tec contains, at its N terminus, a PH domain that is critical for its activation and recruitment to the plasma membrane, as a result of binding to the PI 3-kinase product PIP3 (3Lewis C.M. Broussard C. Czar M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 resulted in gradual loss of punctate Tec-GFP fluorescence over the course of 3–5 min (see supplemental Movie 4). In some experiments, when the Tec-GFP structures were especially bright, we did not see complete loss until nearly 10 min (data not shown). We also employed a control compound, LY303511, that is structurally almost identical to LY294002 but has no detectable activity against PI 3-kinase (22Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This compound did not cause any detectable loss of the punctate Tec-GFP-containing structures, even after 15 min (data not shown). Somewhat different effects were noted when an Src family kinase inhibitor was added to T cells expressing Tec-GFP and stably interacting with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 (and supplemental Movie 5), the addition of PP2 resulted in more rapid loss of the Tec-containing structures from the imaging field than with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor. We saw nearly complete loss of Tec-GFP puncta within 1 min after the addition of PP2, which is significantly faster than the kinetics noted with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (Fig. 3). Therefore, it appears that loss of tyrosine kinase activity results in more rapid loss of Tec-containing structures from the plasma membrane, compared with loss of PI 3-kinase activity. We next sought to confirm our finding of membrane-proximal Tec vesicle localization with another technique; therefore, we prepared isolated T cell membranes and imaged them by standard confocal microscopy. This approach also allowed us to determine with a high degree of certainty what other proteins are contained within membrane-proximal Tec vesicles, because the planar nature of the membranes ensures definitive axial co-localization. The outline of this technique is shown in Fig. 5A. We took advantage of the fact that T cells will adhere very tightly to surfaces coated with antibodies to CD3 and CD28, which allowed us to strip away adhered cells, leaving behind membrane patches. These membrane preparations can be fixed and stained with antibodies for multicolor confocal analysis. As shown in Fig. 5B, left panel, Tec vesicles were observed in membrane patches from D10 T cells transfected with Tec-GFP, reminiscent of what was seen when intact cells were imaged by TIRF microscopy. As with the signaling complexes described by Bunnell et al. (23Bunnell S.C. Hong D.I. Kardon J.R. Yamazaki T. McGlade C.J. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), it is still not clear in which intracellular compartment(s) the Tec vesicles reside. We noted that some Tec vesicles appeared to become internalized during stimulation (see supplemental Movie 1); therefore, we stained membrane preparations with an antibody to EEA1, a marker of early endosomes (24Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, there was obvious, although not complete, overlap between Tec-GFP and EEA1, suggesting that Tec does transit through early endosomes. We have attempted to trace Tec further through the endosomal pathway but have so far failed to see detectable overlap between Tec and a late endosomal marker (data not shown). Our previous study shows substantial overlap of Tec with phosphotyrosine staining, although not with a lipid raft marker (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear what other proteins are found in Tec vesicles after TCR stimulation. We therefore used the membrane patch technique to assess co-localization of Tec with other molecules involved in TCR signaling. Here we have compared Tec vesicle localization with a protein thought to lie immediately upstream of the Tec kinases (the Src family tyrosine kinase Lck) and another protein that is thought to be a direct target of Tec (PLC-γ1) (3Lewis C.M. Broussard C. Czar M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, we observed substantial overlap of both Lck (Fig. 6A) and PLC-γ1 (Fig. 6B) with Tec-GFP. Typically, ∼75% of the Tec-containing vesicles overlapped with staining for either Lck or PLC-γ1. By contrast, when Tec localization was compared with that of ZAP-70 (Fig. 6C), minimal overlap between the two was observed (<20%). Thus, Tec vesicles also contain proteins that are known to function as its direct activators (Lck) and targets (PLC-γ1). These studies have extended the findings described in our previous report, where we showed for the first time that Tec, unique among the Tec family tyrosine kinases, organizes into punctate structures after antigen stimulation (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the Tec structures appear in live T cells after TCR stimulation but not after cross-linking of the integrin LFA-1. Furthermore, based on imaging live cells with TIRF microscopy and membrane patches with confocal microscopy, we can conclude that the Tec-containing structures are at or near the plasma membrane (within ∼100 nm). We have also shown that constant signaling is required for the maintenance of Tec in these structures, because inhibition of either tyrosine kinases or PI 3-kinase results in their disappearance. Using confocal microscopy, Bunnell et al. (23Bunnell S.C. Hong D.I. Kardon J.R. Yamazaki T. McGlade C.J. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) recently described novel structures, which they called “signaling assemblies,” containing many proximal components of TCR signaling. These large macromolecular structures appeared after TCR signaling and included high concentrations of the TCR, ZAP-70, and the adaptors LAT, Grb-2, Gads, and SLP-76. Two differences between our study and that of Bunnell et al. are: 1) we have visualized signaling-dependent kinase localization with TIRF microscopy, which allows us to specifically focus on events at the plasma membrane, whereas their studies employed standard confocal microscopy; and 2) we have used the D10 T cell clone, a non-transformed T cell line, rather than the Jurkat leukemic T cell line. Nonetheless, there are similarities between our observations. First, the formation of Tec-containing structures required signaling through the TCR, as adherence to a non-stimulatory antibody is insufficient for their appearance. Second, the structures containing Tec appeared to be relatively stable once they are formed at the plasma membrane, similar to what was seen with most of the molecules examined by Bunnell et al., including ZAP-70, LAT, and Grb-2. In contrast, they noted an interesting pattern of movement when they examined SLP-76-containing complexes. Thus, SLP-76 complexes appeared to be transported toward the center of the cell by an active process (23Bunnell S.C. Hong D.I. Kardon J.R. Yamazaki T. McGlade C.J. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence for interactions between SLP-76 and Tec family kinases (5Lucas J.A. Miller A.T. Atherly L.O. Berg L.J. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Bunnell S.C. Diehn M. Yaffe M.B. Findell P.R. Cantley L.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2219-2230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we have never observed this type of directed movement by either Tec or Itk (see supplementary Movies). Our live-cell TIRF imaging studies have shown that constant signaling is required for maintenance of the Tec-containing structures at the plasma membrane. Thus, the addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3) or the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 4) resulted in loss of the Tec-containing structures from the T cell surface. However, we did note a difference in the kinetics of the loss, depending on which inhibitor we used. Although inhibition of tyrosine kinases with PP2 resulted in the rather rapid loss of Tec-GFP fluorescence from the cell surface (<1 min), inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a significantly slower loss (at least 3–5 min). It is unclear at this point what precisely accounts for this difference, but it could be the result of down-regulating phosphatases being recruited to the plasma membrane or to the Tec-containing structures at different rates. In the case of tyrosine kinase signaling, a prominent example is SHP-1 (26Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 27Stefanova I. Hemmer B. Vergelli M. Martin R. Biddison W.E. Germain R.N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 28Germain R.N. Stefanova I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 467-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), whereas for the PI 3-kinase pathway the known phosphatases include PTEN and SHIP (29Krystal G. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we have used wide field fluorescence microscopy coupled with deconvolution to investigate the localization of various Tec family kinases in fixed T cells (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have noted that, in unstimulated D10 T cells, Tec is found diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, with the punctate pattern of Tec localization appearing after stimulation of cells with antigen-loaded antigen-presenting cell. We therefore believe that the Tec-containing “vesicles” are formed de novo after stimulation through the TCR, rather than being recruited to the cell surface. Likewise, after inhibition of tyrosine kinase or PI 3-kinase signaling (Figs. 3 and 4), not only did the Tec structures disappear from the cell surface, but they appeared to dissipate completely, because we could not find the Tec vesicles even in standard confocal mode after their loss from the TIRF field (data not shown). We have reported here for the first time that Tec appears to traffic through an endosomal compartment after TCR stimulation. After cross-linking, the TCR-CD3 complex is known to be internalized and trafficks into endosomes (30Alcover A. Alarcon B. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 325-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, we have not observed co-localization of Tec with the TCR after stimulation. 2L. P. Kane and S. C. Watkins, unpublished data. Recent studies have highlighted the apparent importance of endosomal compartments for initiating signal transduction by at least two distinct mechanisms. For instance, Alcover and colleagues (31Das V. Nal B. Dujeancourt A. Thoulouze M.I. Galli T. Roux P. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) recently reported that internalization of TCRs into endosomes is required for their eventual localization to the developing immunological synapse. In addition, it has been known for some time that certain receptors, including the tumor necrosis factor receptor, actually require endocytosis for activation of downstream signaling pathways (32Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Cell. 2001; 106: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase pathway, including its downstream PH domain targets, is a particularly good example of the intersection between signal transduction and endocytosis (24Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It is therefore not very surprising that Tec might function within the endocytic pathway, although it is unclear at this point why other Tec kinase family members do not appear to localize similarly, despite the presence of a PH domain. Nunes and colleagues (34Garcon F. Bismuth G. Isnardon D. Olive D. Nunes J.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Garcon F. Ghiotto M. Gerard A. Yang W.C. Olive D. Nunes J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have also recently investigated the localization and regulation of Tec during T cell activation. Consistent with previous reports (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Garcon F.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it has been found that the PH domain of Tec is critical for the activation of gene transcription in T cells. Nunes and colleagues (34Garcon F. Bismuth G. Isnardon D. Olive D. Nunes J.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Garcon F. Ghiotto M. Gerard A. Yang W.C. Olive D. Nunes J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have also noted that the PH domain of Tec is dispensable for recruitment of Tec to the plasma membrane, in agreement with our previous report (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and, similar to our findings, observed that, although plasma membrane recruitment of Tec lacking a PH domain still occurs, Tec-containing vesicles do not form (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Garcon F. Ghiotto M. Gerard A. Yang W.C. Olive D. Nunes J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding here (Fig. 3) that PI 3-kinase activity was required for the maintenance of Tec in punctate structures. One point of divergence between our studies and previous reports concerns the question of whether the PH domain of Tec is sufficient for membrane recruitment. Although it has been reported that the PH domain is not sufficient (35Garcon F. Ghiotto M. Gerard A. Yang W.C. Olive D. Nunes J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the Tec PH domain can mediate association with the plasma membrane on its own, in isolation from the remainder of the protein (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 3M. G. Tomlinson and L. P. Kane, unpublished data. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear, because we observed this in both Jurkat and D10 cells and used a construct only one amino acid longer than that used in previous studies (35Garcon F. Ghiotto M. Gerard A. Yang W.C. Olive D. Nunes J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the Tec PH domain is not sufficient for localization to the vesicular structures seen with the full-length protein (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Apart from the PH domain, Tec contains a number of other domains that appear to regulate its function and localization. We and others (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Yang W.C. Ching K.A. Tsoukas C.D. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the Tec SH2 domain is required for both proper localization and function. There is, however, conflicting evidence regarding the role of the SH3 domain, which has been variously reported to either negatively (37Tomlinson M.G. Heath V.L. Turck C.W. Watson S.P. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55089-55096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or positively (34Garcon F. Bismuth G. Isnardon D. Olive D. Nunes J.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) regulate Tec, as well as to regulate its localization at the immunological synapse (34Garcon F. Bismuth G. Isnardon D. Olive D. Nunes J.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Garcon F. Ghiotto M. Gerard A. Yang W.C. Olive D. Nunes J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have found that mutation of either the SH3 domain or proline-rich sequence (in the Tec homology domain) in Tec does not inhibit its vesicular localization after TCR stimulation. 4L. P. Kane and S. C. Watkins, unpublished data. Taken together, our results indicate that localization of Tec to vesicles requires both its pleckstrin homology and SH2 domains but not the SH3 and proline-rich sequences. We have now begun to identify other signaling proteins that co-localize with Tec in these vesicles, none of which coincide exactly with the distribution of Tec (Fig. 6). However, our findings thus far are consistent with previous biochemical and genetic studies that identified Src family kinases as direct activators of Tec family kinases and the enzyme PLC-γ1 as a direct target, because localization of Lck and PLC-γ1 do overlap considerably with Tec. On the other hand, we have observed minimal co-localization of ZAP-70 with Tec vesicles. Intriguingly, Bunnell et al. (23Bunnell S.C. Hong D.I. Kardon J.R. Yamazaki T. McGlade C.J. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) reported that different TCR signaling intermediates dissociate from signaling complexes with different kinetics, with ZAP-70 displaying the greatest stability. The ability of Tec to potently activate NFAT correlates with its localization in the vesicles that we have described here and elsewhere (17Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Identification of the full range of signaling molecules found in these vesicles should further clarify the role in T cell activation of, not only Tec, but also the endocytic pathway.

An important interaction between these two proteins occurs between the actin-binding domain (ABD) of plectin and the first pair of fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains and a small part of the connecting segment of β4. Previously, a few amino acids, critical for this interaction, were identified in both plectin and β4 and mapped on the crystal structures of the ABD of plectin and the first pair of FNIII domains of β4. In the present study, we used this biochemical information and protein-protein docking calculations to construct a model of the binary complex between these two protein domains. The top scoring computational model predicts that the calponin-homology 1 (CH1) domain of the ABD associates with the first and the second FNIII domains of β4. Our mutational analysis of the residues at the proposed interface of both the FNIII and the CH1 domains is in agreement with the suggested interaction model. Computational simulations to predict protein motions suggest that the exact model of FNIII and plectin CH1 interaction might well differ in detail from the suggested model due to the conformational plasticity of the FNIII domains, which might lead to a closely related but different mode of interaction with the plectin-ABD. Furthermore, we show that Ser-1325 in the connecting segment of β4 appears to be essential for the recruitment of plectin into hemidesmosomes in vivo. This is consistent with the proposed model and previously published mutational data. In conclusion, our data support a model in which the CH1 domain of the plectin-ABD associates with the groove between the two FNIII domains of β4.

Type II hemidesmosomes are present in simple epithelia, such as that of the gut, and consist of clusters of α6β4 bound to its substrate laminin-5, plectin, and possibly CD151.

Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4039-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the resulting association is not sufficient for efficient recruitment of plectin into hemidesmosomes. Additional interactions of the plectin plakin domain with sites in the connecting segment (CS) and C-tail of β4 must occur to stabilize the association and to enable plectin to be recruited into hemidesmosomes (19Koster J. van Wilpe S. Kuikman I. Litjens S.H.M. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1211-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of both the plectin-ABD and the first pair of FNIII domains of β4 have been determined (22Garcia-Alvarez B. Bobkov A. Sonnenberg A. de Pereda J. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23de Pereda J.M. Wiche G. Liddington R.C.

Jackson R. Sternberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). One of the top scoring solutions, as suggested by the scoring function implemented in 3D-Dock, satisfied all biochemical information that was available at the time. On the basis of that model, we tested residues on the predicted protein-protein interface through mutagenesis followed by yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays. This analysis, combined with computational simulations to predict protein-protein motions, confirmed the proposed model. In addition to validating the computational model, we identified Ser-1325 of β4 (which was not included in the model, as the β4 crystal structure only comprises residues 1126–1320) as a critical residue necessary for the interaction of β4 and plectin in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of a Model for the Plectin-ABD and β4 Complex—We used the crystal structures of plectin (1MB8) and β4 (1QG3) and the 3D-Dock program suite (25Gabb H. Jackson R. Sternberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) to construct a theoretical model of their binary complex. The solutions from 3D-Dock were sorted by the residue level pair potential empirical score (RPscore). The final model on which biochemical experiments were based had the third overall RPscore of 5.024 and the second best overall surface complementarity score (SC-score) of 242. In addition, it was compatible with all biochemical data available at that time.Predictions of Protein Motion—To predict possible motions of the FNIII domains and the plectin-ABD, which could cause conformational alterations that facilitate the binding, we used the Dynamite server (26Barrett C.P. Hall B.A. Noble M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2280-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this procedure, the ensemble of possible conformations is created by a non-Newtonian method (27de Groot B.L. van Aalten D.M. Scheek R.M. Amadei A. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1997; 29: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The trajectory was analyzed with GROMACS (28Lindahl E. Hess B. vd Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) to obtain the principal components of predicted protein motions. For the FNIII structure, the three largest eigenvalues were 20.2, 5.1, and 4.8 (and the motions suggested by the corresponding eigenvectors were considered to be significant and are presented), whereas the fourth eigenvalue was 1.51. For the ABD, the first two eigenvalues were 6.1 and 5.2, and the third eigenvalue was 1.6. Motions were visualized with the VMD program (29Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol.

Stable integration of β4 integrin mutants was performed as described previously (32Geuijen C. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol.

The mouse monoclonal antibody 450-11A against β4 was purchased from Pharmingen. Donkey anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum was obtained from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA), and goat anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).cDNA Constructs—The GAL4 fusion plasmids used in this study are depicted in Figs. 2A, 3 (A and D), and 4A. The construction of β41115–1355, fused in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain of the pACT2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and of plectin-1C1–339, fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the pAS2.1 vector (Clontech), has been described previously (20Geerts D.

Schaapveld R.Q. Oomen L.C. Fontao L. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1659-1672PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the plectin-1C1–339 mutants in pcDNA3-HA, the plectin mutants in pAS2.1 were amplified using an upstream primer containing an EcoRV restriction site and a downstream primer in plectin containing the EcoRV restriction site at position 526 of the plectin-1C cDNA. These fragments were exchanged with the EcoRV fragment of wild-type plectin-1C1–339 in pcDNA3-HA. To construct the IL2R/β4 mutants in pCMV, ScaI-BssHII fragments were isolated from the β41115–1355 mutants in pACT2, and together with a wild-type BglII-ScaI β4 fragment, exchanged with the BglII-BssHII fragment of wild-type IL2R/β4 in pCMV. The plectin-1C CH1/dystrophin CH2 chimera in pAS2.1 was generated by ligation of two separate fragments into pAS2.1. The first fragment (CH1 domain of plectin-1C) was obtained by digestion of plectin-1C1–339 with BstXI and subsequent blunt ending with T4 DNA polymerase without the addition of dNTPs followed by digestion with NdeI. The second fragment (CH2 dystrophin) was obtained by PCR using forward oligonucleotides 5′-GTAAATATCATGGCTGGGATTGCAACA-AACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCGTCGACGGACTCTCCATCAATGAACTGCC-3′ (antisense) containing a SalI site.pLZRS-β4S1325A and pLZRS-β4S1325E were obtained by cloning β4 cDNA fragments derived by site-directed mutagenesis into the retroviral vector pLZRS-IRES-zeo (17Sterk L.M.

All PCR fragments were generated by using the proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). All plasmids were verified by sequencing, and protein expression and size were confirmed by Western blotting.Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae PJ69-4A (a gift from Dr. P.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the host for the two-hybrid assay. The use of PJ69-4A was essentially as described previously (20Geerts D. Fontao L. Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Purkis P.E. Wheeler G.N. Lane E.B. Leigh I.M. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Schaapveld R.Q. Borradori L.

As a quantitative method to measure the strength of interactions, we used a yeast β-galactosidase assay kit (Pierce), as described by the manufacturer. 3 × 5 yeast colonies of each transformation were measured in triplicate.In Vitro Binding Assay and Immunoblotting—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type IL2R/β4 chimera and different plectin-HA-tagged ABD constructs, or alternatively, with wild-type HA-tagged plectin-ABD and different IL2R/β4 chimera mutants. Lysis of the cells, immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody 12CA5, and immunoblotting were performed as described (21Litjens S.H.M. Koster J. Kuikman I. van Wilpe S. de Pereda J.M. Sonnenberg A.

Calyculin A (Cell Signaling, Inc., Beverly, MA) was added at a final concentration of 100 nm for 15 min at 37 °C. β4 was isolated with the monoclonal antibody 450-11A as described above. The entire sample was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, run, and then dried. The film was exposed for 3 h at room temperature. The radioactive β4 bands were then isolated and digested with trypsin, and phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (35Wilhelmsen K. Burkhalter S. van der Geer P.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5161-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).RESULTSComputational Model of the Complex of the Plectin-ABD with β4—Since the complex of plectin with β4 has not been crystallized, we used the separate crystal structures of plectin (1MB8) and β4 (1QG3) and the 3D-Dock program suite (25Gabb H. Jackson R. Sternberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) to construct possible models of their binary complex. The best documented biochemical data available suggested that Asn-149 of plectin and Arg-1225 and Arg-1281 of β4 are essential for their interaction (5Koster J. Kuikman I. Kreft M. Sonnenberg A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1405-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Litjens S.H.M. Koster J. Kuikman I. van Wilpe S. de Pereda J.M. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4039-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). From the 3D-Dock solutions scored by the residue level pair potential empirical score (RPscore), we first selected those that satisfied a criterion for proximity of Asn-149 to β4 residues. After filtering the list of solutions for proximity of Arg-1281 to plectin, most top RPscore ranking solutions were maintained. Filtering for proximity of Arg-1225 eliminated the top ranking solutions. Filtering the initial list of solutions with either Asn-149 or Arg-1281 alone, or with the two together, the same top ranking solution was selected. Notably, this solution had the third overall RPscore (5.024) and the second best overall surface complementarity score (SCscore, 242). Thus we decided to examine that model manually, ignoring the criterion for proximity of Arg-1225. It became immediately obvious that the side chain of Arg-1225 of β4 could easily adopt a conformation that would allow interaction with plectin residues. Given the relatively high atomic displacement factor (B value) for the Arg-1225 atoms (between 26 and 31 Å2, as compared with an overall B value from the Wilson plot of around 14) and the lack of specific interactions with any other atoms in the β4 structure, it is very likely that this residue can indeed adopt alternative conformations and interact with plectin, whereas the overall model is preserved. Thus we decided to use that model (shown in Fig. 1A) as a guide to further predict residues that are likely to be involved in the β4-plectin interaction. The region of β4 predicted to interact with the plectin-ABD extends over an interdomain region that includes the C-C′ and E-F loops in the first FNIII and the lower part of the ABE sheet and the B-C loop of the second FNIII domain. Furthermore, the CH1 domain, but not the CH2 domain, of the plectin-ABD was predicted to be involved in direct binding to this interdomain region of β4. The region of the CH1 domain of plectin predicted to bind to β4 contains helices E and F and the loop preceding helix C, which is in close proximity to helix E. Apart from Asn-149 in plectin and Arg-1225 and Arg-1281 in β4, Gln-131 and Arg-138 in plectin had previously been reported to be important for the interaction with β4, whereas Asp-135 was shown not to be essential for binding (21Litjens S.H.M. Koster J. Kuikman I. van Wilpe S. de Pereda J.M. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4039-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, Asp-135 was not predicted to be involved in the binding, and Gln-131 was calculated to interact with Asp-1166 in β4 (Fig. 1B). However, in our model, Arg-138 was not shown to be close to any of the residues in β4. It was, however, possible that the Glu-1170 in β4 could adopt a conformation that would allow the formation of a salt bridge with Arg-138, and thus Glu-1170 was chosen as a putative binding partner of Arg-138 in plectin. The model also confirms that the amino acids of the plectin-ABD, which were shown not to be required for binding to β4 in yeast two-hybrid assays (Asp-113, Val-178, Glu-183, Glu-184, Lys-188, Glu-189, Glu-200, Gln-203, Asp-208) are indeed not essential. 2S.

Trichomonas vaginalis is an anaerobic protozoan parasite that causes one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in the world. In the United States alone there are an estimated 5 million new cases occurring annually. Infection with the organism often causes vaginitis in women and urethritis in men and is also related to many other diseases (1Petrin D. Delgaty K. Bhatt R. Garber G. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 300-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trichomoniasis has important medical and social implications and augments predisposition to HIV infection (2Laga M. Alary M. Nzila N.

AIDS. 1990; 4: S99-S103PubMed Google Scholar). Metronidazole is the only available drug for treating the disease. But it is teratogenic, carcinogenic in rodents, and has an Antabuse-like reaction with alcohol (5Upcroft P. Upcroft J.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 150-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Isolates of T. vaginalis resistant to metronidazole have been identified since 1989 (6Johnson P.J. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A new approach to chemotherapeutic control of this pathogen is urgently needed. Parasitic protozoa lack de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides in general and must depend on purine salvage to replenish their purine nucleotide pools to survive (7Wang C.C. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concept of exploiting this particular metabolic deficiency among these organisms for anti-parasitic chemotherapeutic gain has been accepted and pursued by many research laboratories in the last 20 years (8Craig III, S.P. Eakin A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20231-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Some successful studies in targeting purine salvage processes in protozoan parasites for cell growth inhibition have been conducted in model organisms such as Tritrichomonas fetus (9Somoza J.R.

The reduced expression or specific inhibition of the crucial enzyme in the purine salvage pathway indeed inhibits the growth of protozoan parasites. These findings indicate not only the feasibility of a “rational approach” to new drug discovery against particular protozoan parasites by purine salvage enzyme inhibitor searching and design, but also the likelihood of using a single enzyme inhibitor to control the growth of certain protozoan parasites due to the simplicity of their purine salvage pathways. T. vaginalis is also a protozoan parasite with a relatively simple scheme for purine salvage (15Munagala N.R. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 127: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), albeit one that is quite distinct from those in T. fetus and G. lamblia. It relies on the functions of two pivotal enzymes, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), 1The abbreviations used are: PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; TvPNP, Trichomonas vaginalis PNP; F-Ade, 2-fluoroadenine; F-Ado, 2-fluoroadenosine; F-araA, 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine; F-dAdo, 2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine; FMA, formycin A. which catalyzes interconversion between purine bases and the corresponding purine nucleosides, and purine nucleoside kinase (PNK), which converts nucleosides to the nucleotides (16Heyworth P.G. Gutteridge W.E. Ginger C.D. FEBS Lett. 1982; 141: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Miller R.L. Lindstead D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Miller R.L. Miller W.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 195: 573-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). T. vaginalis does not incorporate hypoxanthine or inosine into purine nucleotides (19Harris D.I. Beechey R.B. Linstead D. Barrett J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and possesses no detectable activity of purine phosphoribosyltransferase (16Heyworth P.G. Gutteridge W.E. Ginger C.D. FEBS Lett. 1982; 141: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Miller R.L. Lindstead D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, it apparently depends primarily on the sequential reactions catalyzed by PNP and purine nucleoside kinase to incorporate exogenous adenine and guanine into its purine nucleotide pool. Both enzymes are thus amenable to a specific inhibitor design that may lead to effective anti-T. vaginalis drugs if the parasitic enzymes are distinct from their mammalian counterparts in terms of substrate and inhibitor specificities. T. vaginalis PNP (TvPNP) was recently cloned and expressed (20Munagala N. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10382-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The recombinant TvPNP shows remarkable similarity to the bacterial PNPs and differs significantly from the human PNP in terms of primary and quaternary structures as well as substrate and inhibitor specificities. Bacterial PNPs and TvPNP recognize adenine/adenosine as the most efficient substrates, but the mammalian PNPs do not recognize these substrates at all (21Bzowska A. Kulikowska E. Shugar D. Z. Naturforsch. 1990; 45: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Jensen K.F. Nygaard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Takehara M. Ling F. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1987-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This distinction may help to identify some adenine/adenosine analogues as specific inhibitors of TvPNP, as in the case of bacterial PNPs (24Bzowska A. Kulikowska E. Shugar D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For example, formycin A, an adenosine analogue and a useful antibiotic, is totally inactive toward the mammalian PNP but inhibits Escherichia coli and T. vaginalis PNPs by competing with adenosine with a Ki of 5.3 μm and 2.3 μm, respectively (20Munagala N. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10382-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,24Bzowska A. Kulikowska E. Shugar D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Such a selective enzyme inhibition indicates the feasibility of searching for specific inhibitors among adenosine analogues against TvPNP. Two adenosine analogues, 2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (F-dAdo) and 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-araA), are relatively innocuous substances in mammals because they cannot be phosphorolyzed by mammalian PNP (25Secrist III, J.A. Parker W.B. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L.L. Waud W.R. Truss J.W. Fowler A.T. Montgomery J.A. Ealick S.E. Wells A.H. Gillespie G.Y. Gadi V.K. Sorscher E.J. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1999; 18: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). But these substances are well known “subversive substrates” for E. coli PNP because, when cleaved by this enzyme, highly cytotoxic 2-fluoroadenine (F-Ade) is released (26Parker W.B. Allan P.W. Shaddix S.C. Rose L.M. Speegle H.F. Gillespie G.Y. Bennett Jr., L.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This interesting observation was recently developed into a strategy of suicide gene therapy against cancer cells by first expressing E. coli PNP in the cancer cells and then treating the tumor-bearing mice with these subversive substrates (27Parker W.B. King S.A. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L.L. Secrist III, J.A. Montgomery J.A. Gilbert K.S. Waud W.R. Wells A.H. Gillespie G.Y. Sorscher E.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Parker W.B. Allan P.W. Hassan A.E. Secrist III, J.A. Sorscher E.J. Waud W.R. Cancer Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Excellent anti-tumor activities were demonstrated in these cases. This newly developed anticancer strategy announced again the discovery and design of subversive substrates for one of the parasitic enzymes as an alternative means to anti-parasitic chemotherapy (29Nelson D.J. LaFon S.W. Tuttle J.V. Miller W.H. Miller R.L. Krenitsky T.A. Elion G.B. Berens R.L. Marr J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11544-11549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In consideration of the presence of multiple purine salvage enzymes in some protozoan parasite species, which will be difficult to block effectively and simultaneously, and also the possibility of multiple parallel pathways that will enable the parasitic pathogens to overcome the inhibition of a single purine salvage enzyme, the design of subversive substrates for only one of the purine salvage enzymes could be a powerful strategy for anti-parasitic drug discovery. In the case of T. vaginalis, TvPNP apparently bears a structural and a functional as well as a pharmacological resemblance to E. coli PNP, but it differs from human PNP in all these aspects (20Munagala N. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10382-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This activity profile classifies TvPNP as a suitable target for specific inhibitor design as well as subversive substrate research for a potential chemotherapeutic effort. There is a good possibility that F-dAdo and F-araA could also be subversive substrates of TvPNP with a potential anti-trichomoniasis effect. In the present investigation we identified specific inhibitors as well as subversive substrates of TvPNP and tested them on the in vitro growth of T. vaginalis for potential anti-trichomoniasis chemotherapy. We found that F-dAdo is indeed a subversive substrate of TvPNP because it can be cleaved by TvPNP, thus releasing cytotoxic F-Ade. More importantly, both F-dAdo and F-Ade present outstanding inhibition effects on T. vaginalis growth, suggesting that F-dAdo could be a potential chemotherapeutic agent against T. vaginalis. We also crystallized TvPNP complexed with F-dAdo and other substrates and inhibitors. The crystal structures of these complexes were determined by x-ray diffraction. The structural studies revealed a TvPNP homohexamer bearing striking structural similarities to that of the bacterial PNPs. Chemicals—Adenine, adenosine, inosine, 2′-deoxyinosine (dIno), formycin A (FMA), F-Ade, F-araA, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine, 6-thioguanosine, 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine, and 6-methylthio-9-β-d-ribofuranosylpurine were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. F-dAdo was from General Intermediates of Canada. [8-14C]adenine and [8-14C] adenosine were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TvPNP—TvPNP was produced using a previously described procedure (20Munagala N. Wang C.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10382-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The purified protein samples were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, with 2 mm dithiothreitol and 3 mm MgCl2, quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and stored at -80°C. TvPNP Assays and Inhibition Studies—TvPNP activity was assayed at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.8 mm ribose 1-phosphate, 2.5 mm adenine, and 1 μm (0.005 μCi) [8-14C]adenine. TvPNP (23 nm) was added to start the reaction, which was subsequently stopped by adding 1% SDS to the reaction mixture. A sample (10 μl) of each reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, developed in 1.8 m ammonium formate and 1.5% ammonium hydroxide, and exposed to general phosphor storage screens for 22 h. The radiolabeled spots on TLC plates were imaged using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840; Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with ImageQuant software (version 5.2, Molecular Dynamics). Potential inhibitors were titrated in the TvPNP assays with a reaction time of 10 min to estimate their IC50 values. Testing of Potential Subversive Substrates of TvPNP—Potential subversive substrates were tested at 5 mm in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 125 mm Pi, pH 7.2, and 0.8 μm TvPNP for varying durations of time. The reactions were stopped by adding 3% SDS to the mixtures. Samples from the latter were developed on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, imaged under short wave UV light, and quantified as described previously. In Vitro Cultivation of T. vaginalis—T. vaginalis strain 3001 trophozoites were cultivated at 37 °C in a modified semi-defined medium (30Wang C.C. Wang A.L. Rice A. Exp. Parasitol. 1984; 57: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with cell growth monitored by daily cell counting using a hemacytometer. Potential inhibitors were added to the culture medium at time 0 at varying concentrations for IC50 estimation. Crystallization of TvPNP—Purified TvPNP in 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a 10-kDa cutoff Microcon concentrator (Amicon). The protein solution was then subjected to a series of sparse matrix screens (Hampton Research, Emerald Biostructures) to determine initial crystallization conditions. Crystallization was performed using the hanging drop method at 18 °C with drops containing 1.5 μl of the protein solution and 1.5 μl of the reservoir solution. Crystals were observed in a variety of morphologies, mostly from conditions containing polyethylene glycol with a broad range of molecular masses (400-8,000 Da). Trigonal prismatic crystals belonging to space group P3 usually appear within a couple of days. However, these crystals tended to be highly twinned. The most suitable crystals grew as small cubes and took 2-3 months to appear. The crystallization conditions were 50% polyethylene glycol 400, 12% ethylene glycol, 200 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5-8.7. The crystals belong to space group P4132 (a = 136.8 Å), with one monomer per asymmetric unit and a Matthews coefficient of 4.3 Å3/Da, which corresponds to a solvent content of 70%. Preparation of TvPNP-ligand Complexes—To obtain the structure of TvPNP complexed with ligands, native crystals were soaked for 1-2 h with a series of nucleosides at their saturated concentrations. A variety of nucleosides, including F-dAdo, 2-fluoroadenosine (F-Ado), Ado, Ino, and dIno, was used in the soaking experiments (Fig. 1). The stabilization solution used for soaking experiments is similar to the mother liquor, but with a 2-5% higher concentration of polyethylene glycol 400. The crystals were directly flash-frozen by plunging them into liquid nitrogen after the soaking experiments. X-ray Intensity Measurement—The x-ray intensity data were collected at beam line 8BM at the Advanced Photon Source using a Quantum 315 detector and at beam line A1 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source using a Quantum 210 detector. Exposure times ranged from 20 to 40 s per frame with an oscillation range of 0.5°. A total of 18-30° of data was collected for each crystal depending on the crystal orientation. The HKL 2000 suite of programs (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) was used for integration and scaling.

Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). A monomer of the E. coli PNP structure (Protein Data Bank code 1PK9) was used as the search model. The starting R-factors after molecular replacement and rigid body refinement ranged from 42 to 47%. Most of the protein backbone required only minor changes. The side chains were manually adjusted using the interactive graphics program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The structures were refined by alternating cycles of simulated annealing and B-factor refinement using CNS and manually rebuilding using O. The structure of TvPNP complexed with F-dAdo was refined first at 2.4 Å resolution. The loop region from residues 211 to 215 was disordered in all of the ligand complex structures and, therefore, was not built. This region was built in the unliganded structure at a lower σ level (0.8) and showed high B-factors. The F-dAdo complex model was used as the starting point for all of the other data sets. Strong electron density for the ligand was observed in the substrate-binding site of each ligand-complexed structure. The ligand model was built directly into the corresponding electron density. Water molecules were included after refinement of the protein plus ligand model. The final electron density maps were clear and reasonable for the stated resolution (Fig. 2). All seven TvPNP structures have relative high B-factors, which is probably related to crystal quality.

A reaction time of 10 min was chosen for inhibitor testing. More than 25 purine base/nucleoside analogues were tested in the assay. Only four of these turned out to have IC50 values below 1 mm. They were FMA (IC50 of 0.42 mm), 6-methylthio-9-β-d-ribofuranosylpurine (IC50 of 0.35 mm), F-dAdo (IC50 of 0.42 mm), and F-Ade (IC50 of 0.73 mm). Some of the proven or hypothesized subversive substrates for E. coli PNP, such as F-araA, 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine, 6-thioguanosine, and 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine, did not show appreciable inhibitory effects on TvPNP. F-dAdo Is a Subversive Substrate of TvPNP—Because F-dAdo is a known subversive substrate of E. coli PNP and cytotoxic F-Ade is the product from the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the finding that both F-dAdo and F-Ade were inhibitors of TvPNP suggests that F-dAdo could be also a subversive substrate of TvPNP. A test of F-dAdo in the enzyme assay indicated that F-dAdo was indeed most likely phosphorolyzed by TvPNP to produce F-Ade (Fig. 3). F-araA was also tested in the enzyme assay but showed little conversion to the expected product, F-Ade (data not shown). F-dAdo and F-Ade Are Equally Potent Inhibitors of in Vitro T. vaginalis Growth—The biochemical studies encouraged us to test the potential anti-T. vaginalis activity of F-dAdo and F-Ade. The effects of these two compounds on the in vitro growth of T. vaginalis were monitored. The results, shown in Fig. 4, indicate that both compounds are similarly potent inhibitors of T. vaginalis growth with estimated IC50 values of 106 nm for F-dAdo and 84 nm for F-Ade. These similar toxic effects on T. vaginalis from the innocuous compound F-dAdo and the well known cytotoxic agent F-Ade suggest that the toxicity of F-dAdo is probably derived from its conversion to F-Ade by TvPNP. A comparison of the IC50 values against the enzyme with those against the cell growth demonstrated a 4,000-fold enhanced potency of F-dAdo and an 8,600-fold increased activity of F-dAdo against cell growth. The remarkably enhanced toxicities of F-dAdo against T. vaginalis can be attributed either to direct inhibition of TvPNP by the nucleoside analogue or to the cytotoxicity of the cleavage product F-Ade. We favor the latter for several reasons. The in vitro activity of F-dAdo against T. vaginalis compares favorably with the 5.8 μm IC50 value of metronidazole against the in vitro growth of T. vaginalis (6Johnson P.J. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the demonstrated efficacy of F-dAdo in treating the tumor-bearing mice having cancer cells expressing E. coli PNP also indicates the bioavailability of this compound in mammals (27Parker W.B. King S.A. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L.L. Secrist III, J.A. Montgomery J.A. Gilbert K.S. Waud W.R. Wells A.H. Gillespie G.Y. Sorscher E.J. Hum.

Cancer Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All of the evidence thus supports the conclusion that F-dAdo is an attractive lead compound for a new approach to anti-trichomoniasis chemotherapy. Crystal Structure of TvPNP—To gain more in-depth understanding of the interactions between TvPNP and F-dAdo, the crystal structures of the TvPNP·F-dAdo complex and five other TvPNP-ligand complexes were determined by x-ray crystallography. These studies showed that TvPNP is a homohexamer with the approximate dimensions of 60 × 100 × 100 Å (Fig. 5). The overall structure is similar to that of E. coli PNP (38Mao C. Cook W.J. Zhou M.

At the cellular level, IGFBP-3 inhibits IGF action by competitively binding IGFs and thereby preventing their binding to the IGF receptor I (IGF-IR).

Sharoni Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By preventing IGFs from stimulating the IGF-IR, IGFBP-3 inhibits the IGF signaling pathway. However, the effects of IGFBP-3 on IGF-dependent cellular functions are complex, with both stimulatory and inhibitory actions reported, even within the one cell type (8De Mellow J.S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 156: 199-204Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Evidence from several studies has shown that, in addition to its ability to regulate access of IGF to its receptor, IGFBP-3 may have important IGF-independent antiproliferative effects. For example, transfection of human IGFBP-3 cDNA inhibits growth in various cell types, including human breast cancer cells (9Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Benn D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and murine 3T3 fibroblasts (10Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Growth Regul. 1993; 3: 23-26PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Valentinis et al. (11Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that transfection of human IGFBP-3 cDNA inhibits proliferation of fibroblasts with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR. Further evidence has come from studies showing that IGFBP-3 gene expression is induced by potent growth-inhibitory proteins and agents, including tumor suppressor protein p53 (12Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (13Martin J.L.

Pollak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1016-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which suggests that these agents may mediate their inhibitory effects through IGFBP-3. More recently, it has been suggested that the growth-inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3 may be mediated via an induction of apoptosis. Indirect evidence has come from reports that an increase in IGFBP-3 expression is associated with the induction of apoptosis (19Nickerson T. Pollak M. Huynh H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Shen L. Glazer R.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More directly, Nickerson et al. (21Nickerson T. Huynh H. Pollak M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the addition of recombinant IGFBP-3 induces apoptosis in breast carcinoma cells. This effect was abrogated in the presence of an IGF-I analog that binds IGF-IR (but not IGFBP), which suggests that, in this system, IGFBP-3 induces apoptosis indirectly by reducing the bioavailability of ligands for IGF-IR. However, direct pro-apoptotic effects of IGFBP-3 have been reported in cells lacking IGF-IR (22Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) and under conditions where IGF-I could not elicit a survival effect (23Gill Z.P. Perks C.M. Newcomb P.V. Holly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25602-25607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), pointing to the existence of an IGF-independent mode of IGFBP-3 action. Compared with young cells, senescent fibroblasts show substantially up-regulated IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein (24Murano S. Thweatt R. Shmookler Reis R.J. Jones R.A. Moerman E.J. Goldstein S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Goldstein S. Moerman E.J. Jones R.A. Baxter R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1993; 156: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the protein also accumulates in the growth medium of young cells to levels directly correlated with the chronological age of the donor (25Goldstein S. Moerman E.J. Jones R.A. Baxter R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Goldstein S. Moerman E.J. Baxter R.C. J. Cell.

Gerontol. 1993; 28: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Grigoriev et al. (28Grigoriev V.G. Moerman E.J. Goldstein S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) found that IGFBP-3 accumulation in the medium of senescent human diploid fibroblasts can bind and sequester IGFs and thereby attenuate the response of senescent cells to IGF-I. Whether IGFBP-3 exerts its influence on senescent cells through an IGF-independent pathway is still unclear. Increased IGFBP-3 expression appears to suppress growth (but not induce) apoptosis in senescent fibroblasts, because senescent fibroblasts are more resistant to apoptotic stimuli than young cells (29Yeo E.J. Hwang Y.C. Kang C.M. Choy H.E. Park S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 10: 415-422Google Scholar). Buckbinder et al. (12Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) first identified IGFBP-3 as one of the p53-inducible genes by employing EB1 colon carcinoma cells carrying an inducible wild-type p53 transgene and saos-2-D4H cells containing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant. Furthermore, ultraviolet radiation and doxorubicin induced IGFBP-3 expression in fibroblasts containing the wild-type (but not mutant) p53. As well, on the basis of homology to the p53-binding consensus sequence (30EL-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), two p53-binding sites within the IGFBP-3 gene were identified and confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSAs) (12Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Thus, IGFBP-3 expression is positively regulated by p53. However, IGFBP-3 expression could also be induced by a p53-independent pathway (31Choi H.S. Lee J.H. Park J.G. Lee Y.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). During cellular senescence, p53 activity increases greatly (32Atadja P. Wong H. Garkavtsev I. Veillette C. Riabowol K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8348-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered whether the increased p53 activity contributes to overexpression of IGFBP-3 in senescent cells. However, treating senescent cells with the HPV-E6-expressing vector or another p53 inhibitor, PFT-α, did not reduce IGFBP-3 expression. This report describes our subsequent examination of potential 5′ regulatory regions and mechanisms that may be responsible for the up-regulation of IGFBP-3 in senescent human diploid fibroblasts. Analysis of the IGFBP-3 promoter via transient transfection of nested promoter deletions into young and old fibroblasts has identified an enhancer element. This element is located in the 5′-UTR of IGFBP-3 and binds a protein of 27 kDa more avidly in senescent cells than in young cells, which suggests that enhanced binding to this element in senescent cells contributes to the increased expression of IGFBP-3 during senescence. Cells and Cell Culture—Human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast 2BS cells (obtained from the National Institute of Biological Products, Beijing, China) were previously isolated from female fetal lung fibroblast tissue and have been fully characterized (33Tang Z. Zhang Z. Zheng Y. Corbley M.J. Tong T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1994; 73: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The current expected life span is ∼70 population doublings (PD). 2BS cells were considered to be young at PD30 or below and fully senescent at PD55 or above. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Senescent cells used in this study did not reach confluence within 2 weeks after subculturing at a 1:2 split ratio, demonstrated a characteristic large flattened senescent cell morphology, and were positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using an RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA fragments from IGFBP-3 cDNA and GAPDH cDNA were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with use of a random priming kit (Promega, Madison, WI). A quantity of 30 μg of total RNA from each sample was electrophoresed on 1% agrose/2.2 m formaldehyde gels. The RNA was then transferred to nylon membranes and cross-linked by UV light exposure. Blots were hybridized using Expresshyb™ hybridization solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and autoradiographed. Deletion Construct of 5′-Flanking Region of IGFBP-3—The 2-kb human IGFBP-3 promoter containing the 5′-UTR was generated by PCR with plaque-forming unit polymerase. The upper primer was 5′-GCT AGC ACC TGG GAC CTC AAG AAT TGC ATT T-3′ (the underlined sequence is the NheI recognition site), and the lower primer was 5′-AGA TCT CGG AGC AGC ACC AGC AGA GTC AG-3′ (the underlined sequence is the BglII recognition site). The PCR fragment was ligated into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). The resulting plasmid was digested with NheI/BglII to release the 2-kb promoter. Thereafter, the fragment was subcloned into the NheI/BglII site of the pGL3 basic vector (designated pIGFBP-3). For 5′-nested deletion, the restriction endonuclease SacII at position –1303, PmacI at –778, XhoI at –305, SmaI at –141 in the promoter sequence, and NheI in the multicloning site of the pGL3 vector were chosen. pIGFBP-3 was digested with SacII/NheI, PmacI/NheI, XhoI/NheI, and SmaI/NheI. The fragments containing the vector sequence were end-blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The deleted constructs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and transformed to obtain clones that were confirmed by sequencing. These clones were designated as –2031 (full-length), –1303, –778, –305, and –141 relative to the translational start site. For 3′ deletion of the 5′-UTR, the –305 clone in the pGL3 vector was cut with HindIII, filled in with thionucleotides, and redigested with BglII at the 3′ end. After exonuclease III/S1 nuclease treatment, the deleted clones were ligated, screened, and sequenced. The clones with the 3′-end deletion were designated as –58 to +59 and –192 to +59. Transient Transfection—Plasmid DNA was introduced into young and senescent cells with use of Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). To standardize the transfection efficiency, 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV vector (pRL Renilla reniformis luciferase control reporter vector; Promega) was cotransfected in all experiments. Empty pGL3-Basic vector was used as a negative control. At 36–48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). A luciferase assay was performed using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), and activity was measured with an Optocomp luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Promoter activity of each construct is represented by relative light output normalized to pRL-CMV control. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts from young and senescent 2BS cells were prepared as described previously (34Mao Z. Shan S. Zhu Y. Yi X. Zhang H. Shang Y. Tong T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4434-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were synthesized, and double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing equimolar complementary oligonucleotides in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 13 mm MgCl2 as follows: 88 °C for 2 min, 65 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 10 min, and 25 °C for 5 min. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol; FuRui Co., Beijing, China) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the labeled probes were subsequently purified using Sephadex G-50. Binding assays involved the use of a mixture containing 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (0.3 ng), 5 μg of nuclear protein, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) adjusted to 20 μl with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7.5% glycerol). Binding reactions were carried out for 30 min at room temperature. A 15-μl aliquot of each reaction was loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× TBE buffer at 120 V. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. In the competition assays, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added at 100-fold excess before the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. DNase I Footprinting—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (34Mao Z. Shan S. Zhu Y. Yi X. Zhang H. Shang Y. Tong T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4434-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), DNase I footprinting experiments were performed with a fragment corresponding to –63 to +59 of the IGFBP-3 gene transcription starting site. The fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dATP and incubated with nuclear extracts at room temperature for 30 min in a reaction mixture containing 4% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI: dC). After incubation, DNase I was added and incubation was continued for exactly 1 min. Footprinting was done using a Core footprinting system kit from Promega, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were analyzed on a 6% acrylamide/7 m urea denaturing gel. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Bases were mutated using the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A mutagenic primer (45mer) was synthesized and annealed to the double-stranded –305 construct vector DNA. Plaque-forming unit DNA polymerase was used to synthesize the mutagenic promoter, followed by digestion of the parental plasmid by DpnI according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutated plasmid was transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells, and the resulting plasmid was isolated and sequenced to confirm the mutations. Decoy Approach—0–14 μgof IGFBP-3 enhancer element (IEE) decoy was introduced into senescent cells cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in a 10-cm diameter dish by the lipofection method. At 24 h after the administration of DNA solution, total RNA was extracted from the cells, and Northern blot analysis was performed. For control reasons, the mutant IEE oligonucleotides (shown in Fig. 10A) were used.Fig. 1Increased activity of p53 does not contribute to overexpression of the IGFBP-3 gene in senescent 2BS cells.A, Northern blot analysis of IGFBP-3 expression in young (Y, PD21) and senescent (S, PD65) 2BS cells. Northern blot was performed with IGFBP-3 as a probe and GAPDH as a loading control. B, HPV-E6-mediated inhibition of p53 activity in vivo. Senescent cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of the pp53-TA-Luc vectors containing a p53 Cis-acting enhancer element upstream of luciferase reporter gene and the indicated amounts (μg) of HPV-E6 expression plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were assayed for luciferase activity. The results represent luciferase activity (LUC ACTIVITY) from three independent transfections with the S.E. indicated. C, HPV-E6 does not reduce IGFBP-3 gene expression in senescent cells. The RNA of senescent cells treated with the same method as B were isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting, with IGFBP-3 cDNA as a probe and GAPDH as an internal control. D, PFT-α mediated inhibition of p53 activity in vivo. Senescent cells were transfected with 2 μg of the pp53-TA-Luc vectors. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with p53 inhibitor PFT-α (20 μm) for different times (0, 6, 12, 24 h). Following treatment, the cells were assayed for luciferase activity (LUC ACTIVITY). E, the p53 inhibitor PFT-α does not reduce IGFBP-3 gene expression in senescent cells. The RNA of senescent cells treated with the p53 inhibitor PFT-α were isolated at different times (0, 6, 12, 24 h) and analyzed by Northern blotting, with IGFBP-3 cDNA as a probe and GAPDH as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) UV Cross-linking of DNA-Protein Complexes—To estimate the relative molecular mass of the DNA-binding proteins, binding reactions with oligonucleotide 5′-UTR-2 were performed. Twice the amount of the labeled probe (4 × 104 counts/min) and nuclear extracts (10 μg) were used. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the binding reaction was subjected to UV light, and unprotected DNA was digested with DNase I. The samples were irradiated by a 305-nm inverted UV transilluminator at 7 milliwatts/cm2 for 5 min. The cross-linked reactions were electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and visualized by autoradiograph. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays—Constructs containing the wild-type and mutant IEE were made using pGL3 promoter plasmids containing the SV40 promoter (Promega). A total of 30 bp of oligonucleotides was cloned into the MluI/BglII in the multicloning site region upstream of the SV40 promoter and the HindIII/NcoI between the SV40 promoter and the luc+ reporter gene. HindIII/NcoI was chosen because of its proximity to the functional gene (i.e. the in vivo IEE is located in the 5′-UTR of the IGFBP-3 gene). MluI/BglII was chosen to determine whether a changed IEE location affects its transcriptional regulation. These constructs were then co-transfected into young and senescent 2BS cells with pRL-CMV as a transfection efficiency control. Luciferase activity was measured using an Optocomp luminometer and normalized on the basis of pRL-CMV expression. Increased p53 Activity Does Not Contribute to IGFBP-3 Overexpression in Senescent 2BS Cells—Northern blot analysis with IGFBP-3 cDNA as a probe confirmed whether IGFBP-3 expression is increased in senescent 2BS cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, IGFBP-3 expression increased substantially in senescent cells as compared with young cells (24Murano S. Thweatt R. Shmookler Reis R.J. Jones R.A. Moerman E.J. Goldstein S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Goldstein S. Moerman E.J. Jones R.A. Baxter R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many studies have shown that the induction of the IGFBP-3 gene is associated with p53 activity. Coincidentally, p53 activity greatly increases in senescent cells. However, we wondered whether increased p53 activity caused IGFBP-3 overexpression. The expression vector expressing HPV-E6 protein, which is a well known p53 inhibitor, was used to examine whether or not p53 activity is associated with IGFBP-3 expression in senescent 2BS cells. For the positive control, we used a pp53-TA-Luc vector (Clontech) containing a p53 Cis-acting enhancer element upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, because p53 target genes have not been definitely documented in senescent cells. We co-transfected senescent cells with both vectors; after 48 h, luciferase activity was assayed. The result from Fig. 1B showed that luciferase activity was decreased in HPV-E6 vector-treated senescent cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting HPV-E6 vector is functional in antagonizing p53 function in this system. Subsequently, senescent cells were treated with the same method as above; RNA were isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting with IGFBP-3 cDNA as a probe and GAPDH as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 1C, no change in IGFBP-3 expression was observed in HPV-E6 vector-transfected senescent cells, suggesting that elevated p53 activity does not contribute to IGFBP-3 gene overexpression in senescent cells. Such a view was further supported by the results with another p53 inhibitor, PFT-α (as shown in Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, we subsequently cloned the IGFBP-3 promoter and analyzed potential regulatory regions that may be responsible for the up-regulation of IGFBP-3 seen in the senescent 2BS cells. Identification of the Functional Region in the 5′-UTR of IGFBP-3 That Contributes to Overexpression of IGFBP-3 in Senescent Fibroblasts by Deletion Analysis—To determine the basal activity of the IGFBP-3 promoter in young and senescent cells, a 2-kb IGFBP-3 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2A) was used in transient transfection studies. Various 5′-deleted pIGFBP-3 constructs were generated (Fig. 2B) and transiently co-transfected with a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase vector (as an internal control) into young and senescent cells. After 36 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, luciferase activity caused by the full-length IGFBP-3 promoter was ∼3-fold greater in senescent than in young cells. Deletion of segments from the 5′ end, from –2031 to –778, slightly reduced the difference in expression between young and senescent cells. However, further deletion of the IGFBP-3 promoter, to 305 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation site, did not reduce but rather increased the difference in expression by 4–5-fold, which indicates that the region from –305 to +59 strongly contributes to increased expression in senescent cells. We then generated a 3′-nested deletion of the –305 to +59 region to further define the region involved in the differential regulation of IGFBP-3. Fig. 3A shows that deletion of the region from +59 to –58 substantially attenuated luciferase expression in senescent cells, but the luciferase activity in young cells remained relatively unchanged, thus reducing the difference in expression between senescent and young cells (Fig. 3B). Further deletion from +59 to –192 completely abolished luciferase expression in both cells, probably because the transcription initiation site had been removed (Fig. 3A). Thus, a potential binding site for a transcriptional repressor in young cells and/or a transcriptional activator in senescent cells exists in the 100-bp region between –58 and +59. Identification of a 30-bp Enhancer Element with Overlapping Oligonucleotides—To define the region involved in protein binding, we used electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (but not DNaseI) footprinting assays, because the former can semi-quantitate protein-DNA binding. As shown in Fig. 4A, five doubled-stranded 30-bp oligonucleotides, designated 5′-UTR-1 to 5′-UTR-5, were synthesized and used in EMSA of young and senescent cell nuclear extracts. No detectable activity was observed with the 5′-UTR-1, -3, -4, and -5 oligonucleotides (Fig. 4B, lanes 6, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24). A specific complex was formed when 5′-UTR-2 was used as a probe with senescent cell extracts (Fig. 4B, lane 12), whereas the level was dramatically reduced with young cell extracts (Fig. 4B, lane 10). Specificity of the complex was confirmed by incubation with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide, which competed with the labeled probe (Fig. 4B, lanes 11 and 13). Thus, the 30-bp region was involved in protein binding and termed IEE. To rule out the possibility that the nuclear extracts from young 2BS fibroblasts were deficient in DNA binding ability, we performed gel shift studies using the same extracts with an oligonucleotide containing the Sp1-binding site. As shown in Fig. 4C, Sp1-binding activity actually was slightly higher in young cell extracts (lane 2) than in senescent extracts (lane 4). As expected, 100-fold competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide bearing the same Sp1 sequence competed with the complex formed on the labeled Sp1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 5).

The mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase (EC 3.6.3.14) is a multimeric peptide complex composed of the water-soluble F1-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.34), including a central stalk, the membrane bound F0, and a second stalk, which bridges F0 with F1. The ATP synthase is composed of ∼16 unique peptides, which range in stoichiometries from 1 to 10, and has an overall molecular mass of >600 kDa. F1-ATPase is composed of α3β3γδϵ with an overall molecular mass of 370 kDa (1Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). F1-ATPase is water-soluble and contains the active site of the ATP synthase, although by itself, it is only able to catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP. The active site is composed by the α- and β-subunits, and the central stalk is composed of the γ-, δ-, and ϵ-subunits. As such, there are three active sites in a single molecule (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). F0 is a membrane-bound peptide complex that acts as a proton pore, which in the mitochondrion transports protons from the cytosol to the matrix space. ATP is synthesized in the mitochondrion by the coupling of proton translocation from the cytosol through the F0 in the mitochondrion with the phosphorylation of ADP at the F1 portion of the enzyme (3Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). F1F0-ATP synthase is a molecular motor in which F0 acts as a proton turbine that rotates the γ-subunit within the core of F1 (4Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K.

The position of the γ-subunit determines conformation of the active site, thereby alternating the affinity of the active site for nucleotides from high to low (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar, 8Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Noji H. Häsler K. Junge W. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This change in the nucleotide affinity forms the basis for the binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis by the mitochondrial ATP synthase (10Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). The assembly of the mitochondrial ATP synthase is a very intricate process (12Hachiya N. Mihara K. Suda K. Horst M. Schatz G. Lithgow T. Nature. 1995; 376: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Rassow J. Pfanner N. Traffic. 2000; 1: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Mihara K.

The enzyme complex requires the expression and synthesis of nuclear-encoded precursor peptides followed by their import and processing in the mitochondrion. This import requires specific carrier proteins in the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane as well as general chaperones present in the cytosol and the matrix of the mitochondrion. The processing of the precursor peptides requires a specific protease, which cleaves the mitochondrial presequence once the precursor peptide enters the matrix space. The ATP synthase also requires the synthesis of peptides in F0, which are encoded in the mitochondrial genome (three in yeast and two in mammals). After expression, the F0 peptides must associate with nuclear-encoded subunits resulting in the holo-complex. The assembly of F1 and F0 portions of the enzymes require specific chaperone like proteins Atp10p, Atp11p, and Atp12p, which are described as “assembly factors” (17Ackerman S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Ackerman S.H. Gatti D.L. Gellefors P. Douglas M.G. Tzagoloff A.

Dujardin G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and Yta10-12p (22Arlt H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T.

Human homologs for Atp11p and Atp12p have been identified and these genes are broadly expressed across eukaryotes (25Wang Z.G. White P.S. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30773-30778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the synthesis, import, and assembly of the ATP synthase require a large number and a variety of proteins encoded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genome. This study uses yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the assembly and structure/function of the bovine F1-ATPase. The impetus for this study is to provide a basis for the biochemical and structural analysis of mutant variants of the mammalian enzyme. However, this study also provides insight into the evolutionary conservation of the proteins required for the assembly of the ATP synthase and the conservation of the ATP synthase from bovine to yeast. Media—The yeast media and standard recipes are as described previously (26Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar): YPD, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone; YPGal, 2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone; YPG, 3% glycerol, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone; YPAD, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 20 mg·liter-1 adenine sulfate. Minimal medium (SD) 1The abbreviations used are: SD, synthetic dextrose; SC, synthetic complete; 5FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. was supplemented with adenine, histidine, arginine, methionine, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, and tryptophan or uracil at 20 mg·liter-1. SC medium is SD medium with all of the supplements listed above. G418 was added at 0.2 mg·ml-1, and 5-fluoroorotic (5FOA) was added at 1 g·liter-1 when indicated. Agar (2%) was added to all of the plates with yeast medium. Molecular Biology—Standard methods were used for the subcloning and plasmid construction (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue after transformation by electroporation using a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) electroporator using the method recommended by the manufacturer. Yeast was transformed as described previously (28Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Double distilled water was used for all of the reaction buffers. Yeast Strains and Genetics—The S. cerevisiae yeast strain W303-1A (a, ade2-1, his3-1, 15, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1, obtained from B. Trumpower, Dartmouth University, Hanover, NH) was the parent strain of all of the strains used in this study (Table I). The deletion mutations were made as described previously (29Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) by homologous recombination of PCR products using the KanMX resistance module. The primers used for the deletion mutations in the genes encoding the F1 subunits and the subsequent PCR confirmation of the correct deletion mutation as well as the PCR conditions were described earlier (30Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The KanMX module is flanked by the loxP site of recombination of the cre recombinase. Thus, subsequent expression of the cre recombinase on the vector pSH47 (29Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) results in the excision of the KanMX module from the chromosomal location, resulting in gene eviction and leaving a single loxP site. Gene eviction was done by transformation of pSH47 into the yeast strain with selection on SD drop-out medium lacking uracil. Two colonies were selected, and the cre recombinase was induced by incubation of the cells in YPGal medium (3 ml) for 2 h. The cells were counted, and 200 were plated onto YPD plates and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. The colonies were replica-plated to YPD and YPD containing G418 (0.2 mg·ml-1). Colonies that were sensitive to G418 were selected and tested by whole cell PCR to ensure the correct recombination event in the gene eviction. These strains are designated with “gs” in their names in Table I.Table IYeast strains used in this studyYeast strainsRelevant/added genotypeParentW303-1a (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

The order in which the genes were deleted is important because the deletion of ATP3, ATP15, or ATP16 in the absence of a deletion in ATP1 or ATP2 results in the loss of mitochondrial DNA in the cell (31Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At each stage, the strains were checked by whole cell PCR to ensure that the correct integration event or recombination event occurred. Construction of Bovine Expression Plasmids—A list of the plasmids used in this study is shown in Table II. The parent plasmids are the pRS3 series of yeast/E. coli shuttle vectors (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial plasmids for expression of the bovine F1 subunits were described earlier (30Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These constructs were made by gap repair with a PCR product of the bovine cDNA across a linear plasmid that contains the upstream and down-stream elements of the ATP1 or ATP2 genes in yeast. The PCR product is designed to effect recombination across the yeast gene, resulting in a chimeric construct that uses the yeast transcriptional promoter and termination sites as well as the leader peptide for either the α- or β-subunit of the yeast ATPase. The cDNA for the bovine α-subunit was a chimeric gene with the yeast ATP1 gene, whereas the remaining four bovine cDNAs of the β-, γ-, δ-, and ϵ-subunits were chimeras with the yeast ATP2 gene.Table IIPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidsExpressed gene or coding regionYeast promoter/leader peptide/terminatorCloning vectorpRS313, pRS314, pRS315, pRS316NoneRef. 32Sikorski R.S.

The yeast/bovine chimeric genes for the bovine α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ϵ-subunits were cloned into pRS316, pRS313, pRS315, pRS314, and pRS314, respectively (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeric genes for the δ- and ϵ-genes were grouped together on plasmid pRS314 because of the limitation of the number of auxotrophic markers in the yeast strain and the number of different plasmids available. The chimeric gene encoding the bovine ϵ-subunit was also cloned into pRS314 for expression in ΔβΔαΔγΔϵgs. Evolution of the Strains—The strains expressing bovine F1 and bovine F1 with the yeast δ-subunit were evolved to grow on medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. Yeast (ΔαΔβΔγΔϵgs [bαβγϵ]) containing the yeast δ-subunit but otherwise bovine F1 and the entire bovine F1 (ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔϵΔpep4 [bF1]) were spread on YPG plates (estimated 5 × 107 cells) and incubated at 30 °C. The Δpep4 mutation was added to the quintuple deletion strain in an attempt to reduce proteolysis during the purification of the bovine F1-ATPase. The PEP4 gene encodes the major protease present in the vacuole (33Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The largest of the colonies (named first generation) were selected and grown in liquid YPG medium (50 ml) to stationary stage of growth. The cells were spread on YPG plates and incubated at 30 °C, and again the largest colony was selected (named second generation). This scheme was repeated a third time to obtain the third generation strain. The test tube evolution presumably selected for mutations that allowed for better assembly or function of the ATP synthase. To determine whether the mutations were in the genes encoding the bovine subunits, the plasmids were cured from the third generation yeast strain (bF1-G3). This was done by first curing the plasmid containing the gene encoding the bovine α-subunit. The yeast were grown in YPD medium and then plated onto SD medium containing uracil and 5FOA. A single colony was selected that grew on 5FOA and was cultured again in YPD medium (3 ml). Cells were spread on plates containing YPD medium and replica-plated on SD drop-out medium lacking one of each of the auxotrophic markers: adenine; leucine; histidine; tryptophan; or uracil. A colony was selected that was an auxotroph for each of the markers (bF1-G3c). This strain was transformed with each of the plasmids containing the genes encoding the bovine subunits and was tested for growth on YPG medium. This strain ((bF1-G3cp) was able to grow on YPG medium at a rate similar to that of the parent strain (bF1-G3). Isolation of Plasmids from Yeast and DNA Sequence Analysis—Yeast strain bF1-G3 was grown in YPG medium (1.5 liters) for 24 h, the yeast was harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min, and the cells were twice washed in cold distilled water. The cells (15 g) were incubated in 0.1 m Tris-SO4, pH 9.3, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (50 ml) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed, harvested, resuspended in 1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, and 50 mg of lyticase 1000K (Sigma), and incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-Cl (50 ml). A portion of this suspension (1.5 ml) was taken, and plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard Plus SV DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA was dissolved in water (0.04 ml) and used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue. E. coli were transformed by electroporation using the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Bacteria were grown in LB medium with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml), and the plasmid DNA was isolated with the Wizard Plus SV DNA purification system. The cloned plasmid DNAs were tentatively identified by restriction map analysis, and then the entire coding regions encoding the bovine F1 subunits were determined by DNA sequence analysis. DNA sequence analysis was performed at the Cancer Research Center DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Chicago. Biochemical Studies—Mitochondria were isolated from yeast after growth in SC minus tryptophan or YPG after digestion of the cell wall with lyticase as described (34Yaffe M.P. Methods in Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The yeast cell wall was reduced in 0.1 m Tris-SO4, pH 9.3, with 10 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed with cold water and suspended in spheroplasting buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm KPi, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 0.1 g/ml. Lyticase (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) was added (2.5 mg/g yeast), and the cells were incubated for 30-45 min at 30 °C. The cells collected by centrifugation and gently washed with mitochondrial isolation buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then suspended in 5 volumes of mitochondrial isolation buffer. The cells were homogenized to break the cells, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 10 min in the Sorvall SS34 rotor. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice with mitochondrial isolation buffer, frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Partial Purification of the Bovine Mitochondrial ATPase—The mitochondria were suspended to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in mitochondrial isolation buffer, and chloroform (one-half of volume) was added. The solution was rapidly mixed for 20 s, ADP was added to 2 mm, and the solution was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase was taken and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm in an SW 28 rotor. The supernatant was loaded on a HighTrapQ (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 3 ml · min-1. The column was equilibrated with TGE (20 mm Tris-Cl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8). The column was washed with TGE, and then a linear salt gradient (0-0.5 m KCl in TGE, 35 ml) was used to elute the enzyme. The enzyme eluted at ∼0.35 m KCl in TGE. The fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and precipitated with the addition of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 70% saturated ammonium sulfate and was stored at 4 °C. The precipitated enzyme was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in SDX (0.25 ml, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) and purified on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted in SDX at a flow rate of 0.5 ml × min-1. The sample eluted at the same position (15.6 ml) as yeast F1-ATPase. The fractions were pooled, concentrated, and precipitated with ammonium sulfate by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation. SDS gel electrophoresis was done by the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using either a straight 12.5% acrylamide or linear gradient from 9 to 22% acrylamide. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The Western blots were developed using the Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and detected by chemiluminescence using either the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) or Supersignal (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Protein concentration was determined by modified methods of Bradford for water-soluble protein and by the method of Lowry for the membrane preparations with bovine serum albumin as the standard (37Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was determined by a coupled enzyme reaction using 2 mm ATP and 3 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C (38Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5634-5639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Efrapeptin and oligomycin were obtained from Sigma and used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Construction of the Quintuple Deletion Mutant—To express bovine F1 in yeast S. cerevisiae, it was essential to delete the genes encoding the subunits of the yeast F1-ATPase. The genes encoding the α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ϵ-subunits (ATP1, ATP2, ATP3, ATP16, and ATP15, respectively) were deleted sequentially in the order: ATP2; ATP1; ATP3; ATP15; and ATP16. The order of the deletions is important because deletions in ATP3, ATP15, or ATP16 in the absence of a second mutation in either ATP1 or ATP2 result in the loss of mitochondrial DNA (31Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This loss of mitochondrial DNA would preclude the ability for expression of a functional ATPase in the cell. The deletion mutations were made via homologous recombination using PCR products that targeted the site of disruption in the genome and contained a G418 resistance gene, KanMX, module (30Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The module was flanked by loxP sites, which are sites for recombination by the cre recombinase. Thus, the expression of the cre recombinase after deletion of the target gene with the KanMX module leaves only a single copy of the loxP site at the locus, which once contained the gene that was disrupted. Fig. 1 shows whole cell PCR verification of the disruptions in two strains: a quadruple deletion, ΔαΔβΔγΔϵgs, and the quintuple deletion, ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔϵgs. The PCR products at the deletion site reflect the complete removal of the gene with only a single loxP site remaining. Thus, the PCR product is smaller for the mutant site compared with the wild type strain and the difference in size is almost equal to the size of gene that was deleted. Note that ΔαΔβΔγΔϵgs is the parent of ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔϵgs. Complementation of Bovine F1 with Yeast Deletion Mutants— In a previous study (30Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that the expression of the bovine α-, β-, γ-, and ϵ-subunits in the corresponding yeast deletion mutants could complement the mutation as evidenced by growth on a non-fermentable carbon source (YPG). Two questions were asked in the current study. First, can expression of the entire bovine F1-ATPase in yeast complement the quintuple deletion mutant, and second, can the yeast δ-subunit function in an F1-ATPase in which all of the F1 subunits with the exception of the δ-subunit were from bovine? The second question was asked, because the previous study (30Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J.

Thus, it was of interest to determine whether the yeast δ-subunit would function in an otherwise bovine F1. The first question was addressed by the expression of the bovine F1-ATPase in a strain with a deletion mutation in the genes encoding the five peptides of the F1-ATPase ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔϵ. The strain used, ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔϵΔpep4, also included the Δpep4 mutation. The PEP4 gene encodes a vacuolar protease, which is the major protease in yeast (33Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The Δpep4 mutation was added to reduce the amount of proteolysis during purification of the bovine F1 after expression in yeast but was inconsequential in relationship to forming a functional ATP synthase. The second question was addressed by the expression of the bovine α-, β-, γ-, and ϵ-subunits in the strain with a deletion mutation in the corresponding genes, ΔαΔβΔγΔϵ. The individual genes were cloned onto separate plasmids with different selectable markers. The chimeric genes for the δ- and ϵ-subunits were grouped on the same plasmid to limit the number of plasmids to four. As such, the four auxotrophic markers for leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil were all complemented, leaving adenine as the sole auxotrophic marker in the strain. Fig. 2 shows that neither strain containing bovine F1 in the deletion mutants with (ΔαΔβΔγΔϵgs [bαβγϵ]) or without (ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔϵΔpep4 [bF1]) yeast δ-subunit was able to grow on YPG medium. This indicates that the chimeric ATP synthase containing bovine F1 and yeast stalk and F0 is not functional. However, it was observed that, given sufficient time on YPG plates, colonies appeared from the cells expressing bovine F1 that were able to grow on YPG medium. This happened at surprisingly high frequency estimated at ∼10-6. A single colony was selected from both of the strains expressing bovine F1 (with and without yeast δ) that were able to grow on YPG medium, and these strains are designated as yδbF1-G1 from ΔαΔβΔγΔϵgs [bαβγϵ] and bF1-G1 from ΔαΔβΔγΔδΔϵΔpep4 [bF1]. These strains are assumed to have obtained one"
