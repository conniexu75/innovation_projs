About a year before his lamented death he was discoursing on a favorite topic: Man's unnatural treatment of nature and its sad results. To illustrate his point he told how, during the previous summer, he had returned to a little valley in England where he had spent many happy months as a child. Once it had been composed of delightful grassy glades; now it was becoming overgrown with unsightly brush because the rabbits that formerly kept such growth under control had largely succumbed to a disease, myxomatosis, that was deliberately introduced by the local farmers to reduce the rabbits' destruction of crops. Being something of a Philistine, I could be silent no longer, even in the interests of great rhetoric. I interrupted to point out that the rabbit itself had been brought as a domestic animal to England in 1176, presumably to improve the protein diet of the peasantry."

https://openalex.org/W2016646757,"Lewis (1980) examined Voyager optical measurements and low-frequency radio-wave observations related to lightning discharges in Jupiter's atmosphere using whistler measurements from the plasma-wave system and a specific set of assumptions. Estimates of the average planetary lightning stroke rate were found to be from 0.04 to 0.0001 flashes per square kilometer per year. In the present paper, the planetary lightning rate is demonstrated to be as high as several tens of flashes per square kilometer per year. The same whistler data are used; however, different physical assumptions about the source area, including whistler paths and whistler amplitude distributions are incorporated."
