https://openalex.org/W2610353045,"Misinformation can undermine a well-functioning democracy. For example, public misconceptions about climate change can lead to lowered acceptance of the reality of climate change and lowered support for mitigation policies. This study experimentally explored the impact of misinformation about climate change and tested several pre-emptive interventions designed to reduce the influence of misinformation. We found that false-balance media coverage (giving contrarian views equal voice with climate scientists) lowered perceived consensus overall, although the effect was greater among free-market supporters. Likewise, misinformation that confuses people about the level of scientific agreement regarding anthropogenic global warming (AGW) had a polarizing effect, with free-market supporters reducing their acceptance of AGW and those with low free-market support increasing their acceptance of AGW. However, we found that inoculating messages that (1) explain the flawed argumentation technique used in the misinformation or that (2) highlight the scientific consensus on climate change were effective in neutralizing those adverse effects of misinformation. We recommend that climate communication messages should take into account ways in which scientific content can be distorted, and include pre-emptive inoculation messages."

See et al. applied single-cell RNA sequencing and cytometry by time-of-flight to characterize the developmental pathways of these cells. They identified blood DC precursors that shared surface markers with plasmacytoid DCs but that were functionally distinct. This unsuspected level of complexity in pre-DC populations reveals additional cell types and refines understanding of known cell types. Science , this issue p. eaag3009"
https://openalex.org/W2610389172,"The emergence of immuno-oncology as the first broadly successful strategy for metastatic cancer will require clinicians to integrate this new pillar of medicine with chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted small-molecule compounds. Of equal importance is gaining an understanding of the limitations and toxicities of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy was initially perceived to be a relatively less toxic approach to cancer treatment than other available therapies-and surely it is, when compared to those. However, as the use of immunotherapy becomes more common, especially as first- and second-line treatments, immunotoxicity and autoimmunity are emerging as the Achilles' heel of immunotherapy. In this Perspective, we discuss evidence that the occurrence of immunotoxicity bodes well for the patient, and describe mechanisms that might be related to the induction of autoimmunity. We then explore approaches to limit immunotoxicity, and discuss the future directions of research and reporting that are needed to diminish it."

https://openalex.org/W2611708494,"Research shows that married cancer patients have lower mortality than unmarried patients but few data exist for breast cancer. We assessed total mortality associated with marital status, with attention to differences by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES). We included, from the population-based California Cancer Registry, women ages 18 and older with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through December 2013. We estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total mortality by nSES, race/ethnicity, and tumor subtype. Among 145,564 breast cancer cases, 42.7% were unmarried at the time of diagnosis. In multivariable-adjusted models, the MRR (95% CI) for unmarried compared to married women was 1.28 (1.24–1.32) for total mortality. Significant interactions were observed by race/ethnicity (P<0.001), tumor subtype (P<0.001), and nSES (P = 0.009). Higher MRRs were observed for non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders than for blacks or Hispanics, and for HR+/HER2+ tumors than other subtypes. Assessment of interactive effect between marital status and nSES showed that unmarried women living in low SES neighborhoods had a higher risk of dying compared with married women in high SES neighborhoods (MRR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.53–1.67). Unmarried breast cancer patients have higher total mortality than married patients; the association varies by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and nSES. Unmarried status should be further evaluated as a breast cancer prognostic factor. Identification of underlying causes of the marital status associations is needed to design interventions that could improve survival for unmarried breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2611722131,"This paper describes the design, acquisition process and baseline evaluation of the new e-BioSign database, which includes dynamic signature and handwriting information. Data is acquired from 5 different COTS devices: three Wacom devices (STU-500, STU-530 and DTU-1031) specifically designed to capture dynamic signatures and handwriting, and two general purpose tablets (Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and Samsung ATIV 7). For the two Samsung tablets, data is collected using both pen stylus and also the finger in order to study the performance of signature verification in a mobile scenario. Data was collected in two sessions for 65 subjects, and includes dynamic information of the signature, the full name and alpha numeric sequences. Skilled forgeries were also performed for signatures and full names. We also report a benchmark evaluation based on e-BioSign for person verification under three different real scenarios: 1) intra-device, 2) inter-device, and 3) mixed writing-tool. We have experimented the proposed benchmark using the main existing approaches for signature verification: feature- and time functions-based. As a result, new insights into the problem of signature biometrics in sensor-interoperable scenarios have been obtained, namely: the importance of specific methods for dealing with device interoperability, and the necessity of a deeper analysis on signatures acquired using the finger as the writing tool. This e-BioSign public database allows the research community to: 1) further analyse and develop signature verification systems in realistic scenarios, and 2) investigate towards a better understanding of the nature of the human handwriting when captured using electronic COTS devices in realistic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2610759705,"Prolactin (PRL) is a peptidic hormone that displays pleiotropic functions in the organism including different actions in the brain. PRL exerts a neuroprotective effect against excitotoxicity produced by glutamate (Glu) or kainic acid in both in vitro and in vivo models. It is well known that Glu excitotoxicity causes cell death through apoptotic or necrotic pathways due to intracellular calcium ([Ca2+] i) overload. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the molecular mechanisms by which PRL maintains cellular viability of primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons exposed to Glu excitotoxicity. We determined cell viability by monitoring mitochondrial activity and using fluorescent markers for viable and dead cells. The intracellular calcium level was determined by a fluorometric assay and proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway were determined by immunoblot. Our results demonstrated that PRL afforded neuroprotection against Glu excitotoxicity, as evidenced by a decrease in propidium iodide staining and by the decrease of the LDH activity. In addition, the MTT assay shows that PRL maintains normal mitochondrial activity even in neurons exposed to Glu. Furthermore, the Glu-induced intracellular [Ca2+]i overload was attenuated by PRL. These data correlate with the reduction found in the level of active caspase-3 and the pro-apoptotic ratio (Bax/Bcl-2). Concomitantly, PRL elicited the nuclear translocation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB, which was detected by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that PRL prevents Glu excitotoxicity by a mechanism involving the restoration of the intracellular calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial activity, as well as an anti-apoptotic action possibly mediated by the activity of NF-κB. Overall, the current results suggest that PRL could be of potential therapeutic advantage in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2610575150,"Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease whose causes are still unknown and for which epidemiological data are often discordant. The aim of our study is to investigate prevalence and spatial distribution of cases, and identify environmental exposures associated with sarcoidosis in an Italian province.After georeferentiation of cases, the area under study was subdivided with respect to Municipality and Health Districts and to the altitude in order to identify zonal differences in prevalence. The bioaccumulation levels of 12 metals in lichen tissues were analyzed, in order to determine sources of air pollution. Finally, the analysis of the correlation between metals and between pickup stations was performed.223 patients were identified (58.3% female and 41.7% male of total) and the mean age was 50.6±15.4 years (53.5±15.5 years for the females and 46.5±14.4 for the males). The mean prevalence was 49 per 100.000 individuals. However, we observed very heterogeneous prevalence in the area under study. The correlations among metals revealed different deposition patterns in lowland area respect to hilly and mountain areas.The study highlights a high prevalence of sarcoidosis cases, characterized by a very inhomogeneous and patchy distribution with phenomena of local aggregation. Moreover, the bioaccumulation analysis was an effective method to identify the mineral particles that mostly contribute to air pollution in the different areas, but it was not sufficient to establish a clear correlation between the onset of sarcoidosis and environmental risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2611745836,"A biosensing system with optical fibers is proposed for the colorimetric detection of melamine in liquid milk samples by using the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The biosensing system consists of a broadband light source that covers the spectral range from 200 nm to 1700 nm, an optical attenuator, three types of 600 μm premium optical fibers with SMA905 connectors and a miniature spectrometer with a linear charge coupled device (CCD) array. The biosensing system with optical fibers is low-cost, simple and is well-proven for the detection of melamine. Its working principle is based on the color changes of AuNPs solution from wine-red to blue due to the inter-particle coupling effect that causes the shifts of wavelength and absorbance in LSPR band after the to-be-measured melamine samples were added. Under the optimized conditions, the detection response of the LSPR biosensing system was found to be linear in melamine detection in the concentration range from 0μM to 0.9 μM with a correlation coefficient (R2) 0.99 and a detection limit 33 nM. The experimental results obtained from the established LSPR biosensing system in the actual detection of melamine concentration in liquid milk samples show that this technique is highly specific and sensitive and would have a huge application prospects."
https://openalex.org/W2610367253,"Resistance to antimicrobial agents is increasing worldwide and imposes significant life-threatening risks to several different populations, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs). Bacteria can quickly develop or acquire resistance to antimicrobial drugs, and combined with their intrinsic potential to cause disease in humans, these bacteria can become deadly. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii is notorious as a frequent opportunistic pathogen associated with critically ill patients, and understanding the genetic basis of A. baumannii resistance to beta-lactams among patients in ICUs will result in better protocols to prevent the development of resistance as well as improved treatment regimens. In this study, we assessed 1333 patients in five ICUs, 56 of whom developed A. baumannii infections. Most of the A. baumannii isolates were resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs, specifically, 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, and 91.1% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR). The most frequent OXA gene present was OXA-23 (55.1%), which is significantly associated with MDR strains. Most of the A. baumannii isolates (76.8%) were capable of forming a biofilm. The antimicrobial drug classes that were effective against most of these isolates were polymyxins and tigecycline. The molecular profile of the isolates allowed detection of 12 different clusters comprising 2 to 8 isolates each. In conclusion, our data indicate a high incidence of resistance to carbapenems as well as MDR strains among the observed A. baumannii isolates, most of which exhibited a high prevalence of OXA-23 gene expression. Only a few selective drugs were effective, reinforcing the notion that bacterial resistance is an emerging problem that should be prioritized in every healthcare facility."
https://openalex.org/W2610416242,"Ageing, the progressive functional decline of virtually all tissues, affects numerous living organisms. Main phenotypic alterations of human skin during the ageing process include reduced skin thickness and elasticity which are related to extracellular matrix proteins. Dermal fibroblasts, the main source of extracellular fibrillar proteins, exhibit complex alterations during in vivo ageing and any of these are likely to be accompanied or caused by changes in gene expression. We investigated gene expression of short term cultivated in vivo aged human dermal fibroblasts using RNA-seq. Therefore, fibroblast samples derived from unaffected skin were obtained from 30 human donors. The donors were grouped by gender and age (Young: 19 to 25 years, Middle: 36 to 45 years, Old: 60 to 66 years). Two samples were taken from each donor, one from a sun-exposed and one from a sun-unexposed site. In our data, no consistently changed gene expression associated with donor age can be asserted. Instead, highly correlated expression of a small number of genes associated with transforming growth factor beta signalling was observed. Also, known gene expression alterations of in vivo aged dermal fibroblasts seem to be non-detectable in cultured fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2610669338,"The present study investigated how stress affects instrumental learning performance in horses (Equus caballus) depending on the type of reinforcement. Horses were assigned to four groups (N = 15 per group); each group received training with negative or positive reinforcement in the presence or absence of stressors unrelated to the learning task. The instrumental learning task consisted of the horse entering one of two compartments at the appearance of a visual signal given by the experimenter. In the absence of stressors unrelated to the task, learning performance did not differ between negative and positive reinforcements. The presence of stressors unrelated to the task (exposure to novel and sudden stimuli) impaired learning performance. Interestingly, this learning deficit was smaller when the negative reinforcement was used. The negative reinforcement, considered as a stressor related to the task, could have counterbalanced the impact of the extrinsic stressor by focusing attention toward the learning task. In addition, learning performance appears to differ between certain dimensions of personality depending on the presence of stressors and the type of reinforcement. These results suggest that when negative reinforcement is used (i.e. stressor related to the task), the most fearful horses may be the best performers in the absence of stressors but the worst performers when stressors are present. On the contrary, when positive reinforcement is used, the most fearful horses appear to be consistently the worst performers, with and without exposure to stressors unrelated to the learning task. This study is the first to demonstrate in ungulates that stress affects learning performance differentially according to the type of reinforcement and in interaction with personality. It provides fundamental and applied perspectives in the understanding of the relationships between personality and training abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2610194841,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms can develop after person experiences one or more traumatic events. Little research, however, has been done on PTSD symptoms of patients with ovarian cancer. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer in China; the effects of demographic and clinical variables on PTSD symptoms; multiple mediation roles in the association between social support and PTSD symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer in China. We collected demographic and clinical information of patients with ovarian cancer in the first and second hospitals of China Medical University between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. Qualified patients were asked to complete the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, Herth Hope Index (HHI), and Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). 201 patients provided responses. We performed hierarchical linear regression to assess the correlation between social support and PTSD symptoms and bootstrapping to test the mediating role of hope and resilience as potential mediators. After controlling demographic and clinical characteristics, social support negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms (β = -0.406, P < 0.01). Social support explained 14.7% of the variance in PTSD symptoms. Hope and resilience explained 17.0% of the variance in PTSD symptoms. The proportion of the hope mediating effect was 43.37% for social support and the proportion of the resilience mediating effect was 10.64% for social support. Hope and resilience partly mediated the correlation between social support and PTSD symptoms despite accounting for different proportions of the mediating effect. Future intervention plans should pay more attention to social support as well as hope and resilience to prevent, relieve and treat PTSD symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2610843335,"Background Evidence suggests obesity exerts a negative impact on cognition. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is also linked to problems in cognitive functioning. Obesity is highly prevalent in individuals with MDD and is linked to a failure to return to a full level of functioning. The study’s objective was to investigate the effect of obesity on cognitive impairment in participants with MDD. Methods This study compared cognitive performance in obese individuals with MDD and two control populations (obese individuals without a psychiatric illness and non-obese controls). A standardized battery of neuropsychological tests specifically designed to assess performance in declarative memory, executive functioning, processing speed and attention was administered. Mood ratings, physical measurements, nutritional and health questionnaires were also completed. Results We observed a consistent pattern across measures of memory, executive functioning, attention and processing speed. Whereas healthy controls performed better than both bariatric groups across the majority of measures administered, bariatric controls tended to outperform bariatric MDD patients. Limitations The overall sample size of our study was small and thus largely explorative in nature. However, it provides compelling results (while controlling for extraneous variables such as medication load, nutritional status and common metabolic comordidities) that strongly urges for further investigation and study replication with larger sample sizes. Conclusions We found obesity has a subtle impact on cognition in obese individuals, and when obesity is present in individuals with MDD, this impact may be significant. It is important to minimize all modifiable variables that can add to cognitive burden in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2611759606,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a role in tumor angiogenesis and are recruited into the tumor microenvironment (TME) by secreted chemokines, including Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2). Angiogenesis is required to sustain proliferation and enable metastasis of breast cancer (BCa) cells. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of TAM recruitment would allow for the identification of desperately needed novel drug targets. Sushi Domain Containing 2 (SUSD2), a transmembrane protein on BCa cells, was previously shown to promote tumor angiogenesis in a murine model. To identify the role of SUSD2 in angiogenesis, 175 human breast tumors were surveyed by immunohistochemical analysis for the presence of SUSD2 and macrophages. Tumors with high levels of SUSD2 staining contained 2-fold more TAMs, mainly of the M2 pro-angiogenic phenotype. An in vitro co-culture model system was developed by differentiating SC monocytes into SC M0 macrophages. A 2-fold increase in polarized M2 macrophages was observed when M0 macrophages were incubated with SUSD2-expressing BCa cells compared to cancer cells that do not contain SUSD2. Since MCP-1 is known to recruit macrophages, levels of MCP-1 were compared between SUSD2-expressing MDA-MB-231 and MBA-MB-231-vector control cell lines. MCP-1 RNA, intracellular protein and secreted MCP-1 were all significantly increased compared to the vector control. Knockdown of SUSD2 in SKBR3 resulted in significantly decreased levels of secreted MCP-1. Consistently, increased levels of MCP-1 were observed in Susd2-expressing tumors generated from an in vivo isogeneic mouse model compared to the vector control tumors. Because SUSD2 recruits macrophages into the TME and promotes M2 polarization, inhibiting the function of SUSD2 may be an effective therapy for breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2611901747,"Managing the disposal of infectious animal carcasses from routine and catastrophic disease outbreaks is a global concern. Recent research suggests that burial in lined and aerated trenches provides the rapid pathogen containment provided by burial, while reducing air and water pollution potential and the length of time that land is taken out of agricultural production. Survival of pathogens in the digestate remains a concern, however. A potential answer is a 'dual'-barrier approach in which ammonia is used as a secondary barrier treatment to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination when trench liners ultimately leak. Results of this study showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of NH3 is 0.1 M (~1,468 NH3-N mg/L), and 0.5 M NH3 (~7,340 NH3-N mg/L) for ST4232 & MRSA43300, respectively at 24 h and pH = 9±0.1 and inactivation was increased by increasing NH3 concentration and/or treatment time.

https://openalex.org/W2611425307,"A recent study demonstrated the association between inflammation, iron metabolism and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23. The present clinical study aimed to assess associations between anemia, iron metabolism and FGF23 in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This prospective observational study examined a cohort of prevalent HD patients (n = 282). Blood samples were obtained before dialysis sessions to measure baseline levels of hemoglobin (Hb), transferrin saturation (TSAT), ferritin, albumin-adjusted calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), intact (i)-PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, intact (i)-FGF23, high sensitive (hs)-CRP, and interleukin-6. After the baseline measurement, study patients were followed-up for 6 months. Biochemical measurements were subsequently performed at 1 (Hb), 2 (TSAT and ferritin) or 3 (Ca, P and hs-CRP) month intervals. Doses of ESAs and intravenous iron supplementation during the study period were recorded. i-FGF23 was positively correlated with Ca, P, i-PTH and inversely correlated with TSAT and ferritin. However, levels of Hb and hs-CRP and doses of ESAs during the study period did not differ among the i-FGF23 tertiles, with levels of ferritin and TSAT in the higher i-FGF23 tertile being consistently lower than in the middle to lower i-FGF23 tertiles. Multivariate repeated measures analysis indicated that the higher i-FGF23 tertile was independently associated with repeated measurements of ferritin, but not of TSAT. Doses of intravenous iron supplementation were significantly increased in the higher i-FGF23 tertile in multivariate models. In conclusion, high i-FGF23 levels may be associated with prolongation of low levels of ferritin, resulting in increased usages of iron supplementation in HD patients."

A total of 1483 patients with anemic advanced CKD treated with LPD, who started KA supplementation, were enrolled in this study. We analyzed the risks of end stage renal disease and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with influential drugs as time-dependent variables.A total of 1113 events of initiating long-term dialysis and 1228 events of the composite outcome of long-term dialysis or death occurred in patients with advanced CKD after a mean follow-up of 1.57 years. Data analysis suggests KA supplementation is associated with a lower risk for long-term dialysis and the composite outcome when daily dosage is more than 5.5 tablets. The beneficial effect was consistent in subgroup analysis, independent of age, sex, and comorbidities.Among advanced CKD patients that followed LPD, KA supplementation at an appropriate dosage may substantially reduce the risk of initiating long-term dialysis or of developing the composite outcome. KA supplementation represents an additional therapeutic strategy to slow the progression of CKD."

A novel methodology was developed to compare outcomes between propensity-score-matched cohorts (3:1 ratio) from the independent single-arm studies. Patients in PANGAEA (n = 1287) experienced 48% fewer relapses per year than those in PEARL (n = 429; annualized relapse rate ratio: 0.52; p < 0.001). The risk of 3-month or 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) was reduced in PANGAEA versus PEARL (3-month: 37% reduction; hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; p < 0.001; 6-month: 47% reduction; HR, 0.53; p < 0.001). A higher proportion of patients in PANGAEA (n = 1234) than PEARL (n = 401) were free from relapses and 3-month (65.7% vs 38.7%; p < 0.001) or 6-month (68.2% vs 39.2%; p < 0.001) CDP.

However, the association of GGT with the risk of oesophageal carcinoma (OC) has not been fully recognized to date. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between elevated GGT and OC, by also considering the body mass index (BMI) of the subjects. Clinical data from 8,388,256 Korean individuals, who were aged 40 years and over and who received healthcare check-ups arranged by the national insurance program in 2007 and 2008, were analysed. Newly diagnosed OC was identified using claims data during a median follow-up duration of 8.72 years. During the study period, 6,863 individuals (0.08%) developed OC. We found that there was an increased risk of OC in subjects with serum GGT values >18 IU/L. Furthermore, a BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (underweight) was associated with increased OC risk, while a BMI ≥23.0 kg/m2 was associated with a reduced OC risk. Individuals who were both underweight and in the highest GGT quartile (≥40 IU/L) had a far greater risk of OC compared to other individuals (hazard ratio: 3.65, 95% confidence interval: 3.10–4.30). In conclusion, increased serum GGT was associated with an increased risk of developing OC in the general Korean population, regardless of age, sex, smoker status, or alcohol consumption."

Methods We retrospectively analyzed a total of 512 patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the Samsung Medical Center CTO registry. Patients were separated into ≤ 12-month (199, 38.9%) vs. > 12 month (313, 61.1%) based on DAPT duration with aspirin and clopidogrel.

https://openalex.org/W2611556792,"A new species of nemertean worm belonging to the genus Carcinonemertes is described from egg masses of the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus from the Florida Keys, Florida, USA. This is the first species of Carcinonemertes reported to infect P. argus or any other lobster species in the greater Caribbean and western Atlantic Ocean. Carcinonemertes conanobrieni sp. nov. varies in body color from a translucent white to a pale orange, with males ranging in total body length from 2.35 to 12.71 mm and females ranging from 0.292 to 16.73 mm. Among the traits that separate this new species from previously described species in the genus Carcinonemertes are a relatively wide stylet basis, minimal sexual size dimorphism, and a unique mucus sheath decorated with external hooks. Also, juvenile worms were found to encyst themselves next to lobster embryos and female worms lay both long strings of eggs wound throughout the lobster’s setae as well as spherical cases that are attached to lobster embryos. The stylet length and stylet basis remain unchanged throughout ontogeny for both male and female worms. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses separated this newly described species from all other species of Carcinonemertes with available COI sequences. Carcinonemertes spp. are voracious egg predators and have been tied to the collapse of various crustacean fisheries. The formal description of this new species represents the first step to understand putative impacts of this worm on the population health of one of the most lucrative yet already depressed crustacean fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2610466115,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) accumulates multiple genetic mutations, including activating KRAS mutations and inactivating TP53, SMAD4 and CDKN2A mutations, during progression. The combination of mutant KRAS with a single inactivating TP53, SMAD4 or CDKN2A mutation in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) showed that these mutations exert different synergistic effects in PC. However, the effect of the combination of TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations on the trajectory of PC progression is unknown. Here, we report a GEMM that harbors KRAS (KrasG12D), TP53 (Trp53R172H/+), CDKN2A (Ink4flox/+) and Ptf1/p48-Cre (KPIC) mutations. Histopathology showed that KPIC mice developed adenocarcinoma that strongly resembled the pathology of human PC, characterized by rich desmoplastic stroma and low microvascularity. The median survival of KPIC mice was longer than that of LSL-KrasG12D; Ink4flox/flox; Ptf1/p48-Cre mice (KIC) (89 vs 62 days) and shorter than that of KRAS (KrasG12D), TP53 (Trp53R172H/+) and Ptf1/p48-Cre (KPC) mice. Moreover, the neoplastic cells of KPIC mice were epithelial, highly proliferative tumor cells that exhibited ERK and MAPK pathway activation and high glucose uptake. Isolated neoplastic cells from spontaneous KPIC tumors showed all molecular profiles and cellular behaviors of spontaneous KPIC tumors, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) under drug stress as well as tumorigenic, metastatic and invasive abilities in immunocompetent mice. Furthermore, orthotopic and metastatic tumors of KPIC cells almost recapitulated the pathology of spontaneous KPIC tumors. These data show that in addition to spontaneous KPIC tumors, KPIC cells are a valuable tool for preclinical studies of locally invasive and metastatic PC."
https://openalex.org/W2611376437,"Electronic maps (E-maps) provide people with convenience in real-world space. Although web map services can display maps on screens, a more important function is their ability to access geographical features. An E-map that is based on raster tiles is inferior to vector tiles in terms of interactive ability because vector maps provide a convenient and effective method to access and manipulate web map features. However, the critical issue regarding rendering tiled vector maps is that geographical features that are rendered in the form of map symbols via vector tiles may cause visual discontinuities, such as graphic conflicts and losses of data around the borders of tiles, which likely represent the main obstacles to exploring vector map tiles on the web. This paper proposes a tiled vector data model for geographical features in symbolized maps that considers the relationships among geographical features, symbol representations and map renderings. This model presents a method to tailor geographical features in terms of map symbols and ‘addition’ (join) operations on the following two levels: geographical features and map features. Thus, these maps can resolve the visual discontinuity problem based on the proposed model without weakening the interactivity of vector maps. The proposed model is validated by two map data sets, and the results demonstrate that the rendered (symbolized) web maps present smooth visual continuity."

https://openalex.org/W2611006175,"Obesity is a major public health problem that is highly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, two conditions associated with circadian disruption. To date, dieting is one of the only interventions that result in substantial weight loss, but restricting caloric intake is difficult to maintain long-term. The use of artificial sweeteners, particularly in individuals that consume sugar sweetened beverages (energy drinks, soda), can reduce caloric intake and possibly facilitate weight loss. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of the artificial sweetener, rebaudioside A (Reb-A), on circadian rhythms, in vivo insulin action, and the susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. Six month old male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to a control or Reb-A (0.1% Reb-A supplemented drinking water) group for six months. Circadian wheel running rhythms, body weight, caloric intake, insulin action, and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity were assessed. Time of peak physical activity under a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle, mean activity levels, and circadian period in constant dark were not significantly different in mice that consumed Reb-A supplemented water compared to normal drinking water, indicating that circadian rhythms and biological clock function were unaltered. Although wheel running significantly reduced body weight in both Reb-A and control mice (P = 0.0001), consuming Reb-A supplemented water did not alter the changes in body weight following wheel running (P = 0.916). In vivo insulin action, as assessed by glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests, was not different between mice that consumed Reb-A treated water compared to normal drinking water. Finally, Reb-A does not appear to change the susceptibility to diet-induced obesity as both groups of mice gained similar amounts of body weight when placed on a high fat diet. Our results indicate that consuming Reb-A supplemented water does not promote circadian disruption, insulin resistance, or obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2611674105,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to investigate lexical ambiguity resolution during sentence processing in 16 people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 16 healthy controls. Sentences were presented word-by-word on computer screen, and participants were required to decide if a subsequent target word was related to the meaning of the sentence. The task consisted of related, unrelated and ambiguous trials. For the ambiguous trials, the sentence ended with an ambiguous word and the target was related to one of the meanings of that word, but not the one captured by the sentence context (e.g., ‘He dug with the spade’, Target ‘ACE’). Both groups demonstrated slower reaction times and lower accuracy for the ambiguous condition relative to the unrelated condition, however accuracy was impacted by the ambiguous condition to a larger extent in the PD group. These results suggested that PD patients experience increased difficulties with contextual ambiguity resolution. The ERP results did not reflect increased ambiguity resolution difficulties in PD, as a similar N400 effect was evident for the unrelated and ambiguous condition in both groups. However, the magnitude of the N400 for these conditions was correlated with a measure of inhibition in the PD group, but not the control group. The ERP results suggest that semantic processing may be more compromised in PD patients with increased response inhibition deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2610854727,"Transplantation of testicular cells and tissues has been studied for the investigation of immunology of the testis, which is an immunologically privileged organ. However, reports of transplant of the testis at organ level have been extremely limited because of technical difficulties of the orthotopic testis transplantation (OTT) in experimental animals. In the present study, we developed a new and simple model of the heterotopic testis transplantation (HTT), which is donor testis transplantation into the cervical region of recipients, in a syngeneic model in rats [donor Lewis (LEW) graft to LEW recipient]. The duration of HTT was significantly shorter and success rate higher than that of OTT. To histologically evaluate HTT, the local immune responses were compared among the syngeneic model, an acute rejection allogeneic model [donor Augustus Copenhagen Irish (ACI) graft to LEW recipient] and a chronic rejection allogeneic model (donor F344 graft to LEW recipient) at postoperative day 3. We found that allogeneic ACI grafts resulted in mild and not severe orchitic lesions, whereas immune responses of allogeneic F344 grafts seemed intact and were not significantly different from those of syngeneic LEW grafts. These results suggest that our new operative procedure will be useful in future for the investigation of the testicular immunology."

We sought to assess the contribution of PLA denervation on atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility and atrial remodeling.After left thoracotomy in anesthetized dogs (n = 32), electrode catheters were attached to the PLA, left atrial roof, left pulmonary vein and left atrial appendage. Experiment 1 (n = 16): Vagal stimulation (VS group, n = 8) led to more pronounced ERP shortening in PLA than in other sites (CTL:71±7 ms vs VS: 52±6 ms, P<0.05;). Compared with control group (CTL group, n = 8), atropine alone or with propranolol applied to PLA greatly inhibited VS-induced ERP shortening, ERP dispersion increase, and AF inducibility in the left atrium (P<0.05); but ERP was not significantly different between atropine alone and DB conditions (Atro:85±8 ms vs DB:90±9ms, P>0.05). In addition, domain frequency (DF) of VS-induced AF waveform was not affected by atropine alone, while selective double autonomic blockade at PLA significantly decreased DF at all sites (P<0.05). Experiment 2 (n = 16): In group 1 (n = 8), ERP was markedly shortened in the first 2 hours (11-19% decrease) and then stabilized; however, WOV was progressively widened throughout the 6 hours rapid atrial pacing (BS: 51±9ms vs 6th hour: 161±30ms, P<0.05). After drug application, ERP was increased in all sites of atria, the ERP dispersion was significantly decreased (Atro: 2.36±0.02 vs 6th hour: 5.09±0.07, P<0.05) and AF could be induced in only 1 of 8 dogs. In group 2 (n = 8), 6 hours rapid atrial pacing failed to shorten the ERP and increased ERP dispersion, and only 2 episodes of AF could be induced (WOV = 0).Local denervation of PLA, as predominant atrial autonomic profile, greatly inhibits AF inducibility and atrial remodeling."

Its telescopes are all built or adapted by in-house staff and have identical instruments that give astronomers the same view of the heavens whenever and wherever they observe. And using it is more like signing up to an astronomical Netflix than using a telescope. Anyone can log onto the LCO website, create an account, buy some observing time, and request an observation. If the stars are aligned correctly, they could have results in as little as 15 minutes. That makes LCO ideal for “time domain astronomy,” the study of phenomena that change rapidly and have to be caught on the fly. LCO’s speed and flexibility have caught the attention of astronomers and their funders."

That announcement contained something new: language stating that the agency expects the values of diversity and inclusivity would be reflected in proposing teams. That statement stems from a grassroots effort of planetary scientists to calculate the breakdown of NASA planetary missions by sex, finding that, in the past 15 years, the progress of women had stalled. Bids for the competition came due in late April, and many hope NASA’s new awareness could be a first step toward making sure the merits of all applications can be seen."

Notch signaling within and between cells is involved in many processes, including cell fate specification. In the retina, high levels of Notch during retinal progenitor cell (RPC) division promote RPC renewal, whereas low levels promote postmitotic neuron differentiation. Ha et al. found that retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a neighboring tissue to the neural retina, influences asymmetric division by localizing Notch components to the apical side of the adjacent dividing RPC. This positioning required an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, Mib1, which boosts levels of Notch in one sister cell, but not the other. Hence, a neighboring tissue influenced cell-fate specification through Notch signaling, which could also happen in other neural tissues.

Gyroscopes are used in many applications and can be found in devices such as position sensors, inertial navigation systems, and motion stabilizers. Science museum toys consisting of spinning wheels and gimbals illustrate the general principle of operation, but decades of research have focused on their miniaturization and developing alternative operating systems. Optical systems based on the interference of counter-propagating laser beams can be extremely sensitive and robust, but they tend to use bulky components. Liang et al. and Li et al. have developed optical microresonator–based gyroscopes that can fit onto an optical chip. With demonstrated performance better than that of existing microphotonic systems, such components offer the possibility of building more lightweight, robust, and sensitive gyroscopes.

Quotas to increase female representation on academic evaluation committees may unexpectedly hamper efforts to narrow gender gaps in the professoriate. Bagues et al. studied large-scale national evaluation programs for hiring and promotion in Italy and Spain, which use committees drawn randomly from pools of experts. Although female committee members show no greater statistical preference than males for female candidates, female presence on committees leads male committee members to be less favorable toward female candidates. Higher proportions of women on committees do not increase the number of female candidates promoted, nor do they lead to better identification of candidates who ultimately prove to be more productive.

The microtubule-severing enzyme spastin is mutated in the inherited neural disease, or axonopathy, called hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within cells, including neurons, plays a role in defining the position and timing of endosomal tubule fission. Allison et al. identified a role for spastin at ER-endosome contact sites during endosomal tubule fission. Failure of this process caused problems in lysosomal enzyme trafficking. Lysosomal abnormalities developed in primary cortical neurons from a spastin-HSP mouse model, human stem cell–derived neurons from a spastin-HSP patient, and neurons from mice lacking the ER-shaping protein REEP1. All of these neurons developed pathological axonal swellings associated with accumulations of abnormal lysosomes. Failure to correctly manage lysosome biogenesis may play a role in multiple HSPs and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions.

We live and navigate easily in a complex three-dimensional world. However, little is known how this three-dimensional space and our movements within it are represented in the human brain. Kim et al. scanned participants while they were performing a virtual navigation task. Behaviorally, subjects had similarly accurate memory for vertical and horizontal locations. For a direction judgment task, vertical tilt facilitated performance. A brain region called the right anterior hippocampus contains place information that is sensitive to both horizontal and vertical axes. Vertical directional information, however, is represented in the right posterior hippocampus in an area called the retrosplenial cortex.

Polymer films capable of changing their structural properties at the nanoscale in response to physiological temperature changes could have a number of biological applications. To achieve periodic structures with feature sizes below 10 nm, an amphiphilic polymer must join highly immiscible polymer blocks with short chains. Nowak et al. synthesized an amphiphile that joined a disaccharide and a polypropylene oligomer with a triazole linkage. Spin-cast ultrathin films of this material formed “fingerprint” lamellar domains of the blocks that were perpendicular to the surface with a spacing of ∼6 nm at room temperature. However, heating to 38°C for 72 hours led to a nanostructure in which the chains were stacked parallel to the surface in head-tail bilayers.
