https://openalex.org/W2044446186,"Mitomycins and porfiromycin, generally nonreactive in the natural oxidized state, behave as bifunctional ""alkylating"" agents upon chemical or enzymatic reduction, followed by spontaneous loss of the tertiary methoxy (hydroxyl) group and formation of an aromatic indole system. Thus activated, mitomycins and porfiromycin react in vitro with purified DNA, linking its complementary strands. A high content of guanine and cytosine favors this cross-linking reaction, which is the basis of the lethal effect in vivo of these antibiotics. The activation and cross-linking reactions are discussed in terms of reactive sites on the mitomycin and DNA molecules."

Discharge patterns under conditions that do not involve interneuronal feedback are characteristic and self-stabilizing. Paradoxically, increased arrival rates of inhibitory input can increase firing rates, and increased excitatory input rates can decrease firing rates."

Fifteen steaks were cooked and the polynuclear compounds were extracted, separated by chromatography, and identified spectrometrically. Many polynuclear hydrocarbons were identified, but no nitrogen heterocyclic compounds were detected. The carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene was present in the average amount of 8 micrograms per kilogram of steak."

https://openalex.org/W2075612078,"Pyruvic carboxylase activated by acetyl coenzyme A is highly active in the mitochondria of rodent liver, and its activity is increased in fasting and alloxan diabetes. In conjunction with acyl carboxylase activated by di- and tricarboxylic acid, it forms a reciprocating control network. Analog models of similar networks tend to correct for perturbations, stabilizing the overall system."

https://openalex.org/W2083621205,"The antiviral activity of highly purified preparations of chick and mouse interferons has marked species specificity. This species specificity is not explained by a demonstrable difference in adsorption rates. There is no difference in charge between the molecules as measured by combined zone electrophoresis or ion-exchange chromatography. The interferons are distinguishable by thermal inactivation studies and by precise chromatography on G-100 Sephadex columns. With the latter method, interferons produced by the same cell species (i) in vivo or in vitro, or (ii) in response to different viruses, have been shown to be identical. The same virus stimulates physically distinguishable molecules in the two different cell species. These findings indicate that interferon is a virus-induced product of the host genome"

https://openalex.org/W2090987172,"In Calliphora larvae, an inactive precursor of the enzyme phenoloxidase is present in the hemolymph. A special activator enzyme is localized in the cuticle. When phenoloxidase precursor is allowed to react with the activator, it yields a soluble enzyme having the characteristics mainly of a diphenoloxidase. If, however, this conversion takes place in the presence of mitochondria, the phenoloxidase becomes bound to the mitochondria and the resulting preparation shows equally mono- and diphenoloxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972416522,The torque produced by the neck muscles of a locust mounted coaxially in an illuminated cylindrical striped drum follows small sinusoidal oscillations of the drum. Peak-to-peak oscillations of 0.03 degree (+/- 0.02 degree) at 0.1 cy/sec elicit measurable responses. Several features of this visual response to drum oscillation can be expected theoretically on the basis of a formal neural mechanism similar to that inferred by Hassenstein and Reichardt for constant-velocity motion perception in the bettle eye.
https://openalex.org/W2023406334,"Extracts of livers from diabetic rats contain normal amounts of the enzymes needed to convert 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid to nicotinic acid nucleotide. The decreased capacity of diabetic animals to synthesize nicotinic acid is therefore attributed to increased amounts of picolinic carboxylase, which competes for a common intermediate with the spontaneous reaction in which quinolinic acid is formed as a precursor of nicotinic acid. These studies were facilitated by the synthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid labeled with carbon-14 in positions 3 and 6"

No antiviral activity was observed in the heterologous systems, suggesting a virtually complete species barrier to the action of these interferons."

https://openalex.org/W1988961428,"THE story of the increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococci in such man-made selective environments as the hospital ward has been well documented. Similar processes are infrequently encountered in the soil or in other natural situations, and it is rare that antibiotic production can be shown to have ecological significance in a natural environment1. In the course of investigations into the microbial flora of the hedgehog, a naturally occurring biocenose which appears to be selective for penicillin-resistant Staphylococci, has been uncovered."

https://openalex.org/W2043504305,Transection of vagi and carotid sinus nerves in anesthetized cats results in a rise of blood pressure and subsequent decerebration results in a fall. Decerebration alone results in a slight drop in blood pressure unchanged by subsequent nerve section. Rostral brain structures principally influence tonically brainstem mechanisms subserving baroreceptor reflex excitability rather than those maintaining normal blood pressure.

https://openalex.org/W2001451061,"Rabbits were injected with human serum albumin once intravenously or intradermally with this antigen plus complete Freund adjuvant. The hemagglutinating titers of the antiserum and of the heavy and light antibody fractions were followed for several months. Circulation of heavy antibody in the intravenously injected group disappeared in 1 month, but in the intradermally injected group, it rose to a maximum titer, then declined, and then showed a second rise in titer. Light antibody showed increasing and then sustained titers over most of the time period. Heavy antibody failed to precipitate with antigen, even when it showed high hemagglutinating titers. Light antibody, in contrast, gave precipitation even when tested at much lower hemagglutination titers"

The exposure dose from cosmic radiation was found to be 4.4 +/- 0.2 micror/hr, that from natural radioactivity 8.0 +/- 0.3 micror/hr, and the contribution from fission products varied from 2.0 to 7.5 micror/hr during the interval in question."

https://openalex.org/W2000777323,"THE use of the tattoo technique of Abercrombie, Flint and James1 has made it possible to follow more precisely the contraction that occurs in the healing of full thickness small animal wounds. Abercrombie et al., using rats, and Watts, Grillo and Gross2, using guinea pigs, all reported a change in the shape of the individual tattoo marks as contraction occurred. Both groups reported that the marks became elongated and pointed to the centre of the wound. Subsequent removal of granulation tissue for assay was made by using the surface tattoo points as guide lines and cutting vertically into the granulation tissue."
