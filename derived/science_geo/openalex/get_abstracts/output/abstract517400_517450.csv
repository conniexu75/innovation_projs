However, the ultimate goal is to understand the dynamic expression of each of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes and the function of each protein. Uhlén et al. now present a map of protein expression across 32 human tissues. They not only measured expression at an RNA level, but also used antibody profiling to precisely localize the corresponding proteins. An interactive website allows exploration of expression patterns across the human body. Science , this issue 10.1126/science.1260419"

Migrant birds can pick up various species of malaria parasite while overwintering in the tropics. After initial acute malaria, migrant great reed warblers, which nest in Sweden and overwinter in Africa, are asymptomatically infected for life. Asghar et al. discovered that these cryptically infected birds laid fewer eggs and were less successful at rearing healthy offspring than uninfected birds. Furthermore, infected birds had significantly shorter telomeres (the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes) and produced chicks with shortened telomeres. Science , this issue p. 436"
https://openalex.org/W2028755602,"Images from the OSIRIS scientific imaging system onboard Rosetta show that the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko consists of two lobes connected by a short neck. The nucleus has a bulk density less than half that of water. Activity at a distance from the Sun of &gt;3 astronomical units is predominantly from the neck, where jets have been seen consistently. The nucleus rotates about the principal axis of momentum. The surface morphology suggests that the removal of larger volumes of material, possibly via explosive release of subsurface pressure or via creation of overhangs by sublimation, may be a major mass loss process. The shape raises the question of whether the two lobes represent a contact binary formed 4.5 billion years ago, or a single body where a gap has evolved via mass loss."

For instance, chemokines help immune cells locate invading pathogens and ensure that cells position themselves correctly within a developing organ. Cells detect chemokines through G protein–coupled receptors on their surface; however, the molecular details of how these proteins interact remain unclear (see the Perspective by Standfuss). Qin et al. solved the crystal structure of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 bound to the viral chemokine vMIP-II. Burg et al. solved the crystal structure of a viral chemokine receptor bound to the chemokine domain of CX3CL1. Given the role of chemokines in a number of diseases, these results may help in future drug design. Science , this issue p. 1117 , p. 1113 ; see also p. 1071"

Between 3.6 and 3.4 astronomical units inbound, GIADA and OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System) detected 35 outflowing grains of mass 10 −10 to 10 −7 kilograms, and 48 grains of mass 10 −5 to 10 −2 kilograms, respectively. Combined with gas data from the MIRO (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter) and ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) instruments, we find a dust/gas mass ratio of 4 ± 2 averaged over the sunlit nucleus surface. A cloud of larger grains also encircles the nucleus in bound orbits from the previous perihelion. The largest orbiting clumps are meter-sized, confirming the dust/gas ratio of 3 inferred at perihelion from models of dust comae and trails."

The very low reflectance of the nucleus (normal albedo of 0.060 ± 0.003 at 0.55 micrometers), the spectral slopes in visible and infrared ranges (5 to 25 and 1.5 to 5% kÅ −1 ), and the broad absorption feature in the 2.9-to-3.6–micrometer range present across the entire illuminated surface are compatible with opaque minerals associated with nonvolatile organic macromolecular materials: a complex mixture of various types of carbon-hydrogen and/or oxygen-hydrogen chemical groups, with little contribution of nitrogen-hydrogen groups. In active areas, the changes in spectral slope and absorption feature width may suggest small amounts of water-ice. However, no ice-rich patches are observed, indicating a generally dehydrated nature for the surface currently illuminated by the Sun."

The proteasome is critical for protein quality control and for the regulation of numerous cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. The structure of isolated proteasomes is well established, but how intact proteasomes look within the cell is less clear. Asano et al. used an improved approach to electron cryotomography to look at proteasomes in intact hippocampal neurons. Their analysis suggests that these cells only use about 20% of their proteasomes in an unstressed state, which leaves significant spare capacity to deal with proteotoxic stress.

https://openalex.org/W1979668037,"Comets contain the best-preserved material from the beginning of our planetary system. Their nuclei and comae composition reveal clues about physical and chemical conditions during the early solar system when comets formed. ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) onboard the Rosetta spacecraft has measured the coma composition of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with well-sampled time resolution per rotation. Measurements were made over many comet rotation periods and a wide range of latitudes. These measurements show large fluctuations in composition in a heterogeneous coma that has diurnal and possibly seasonal variations in the major outgassing species: water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. These results indicate a complex coma-nucleus relationship where seasonal variations may be driven by temperature differences just below the comet surface."
https://openalex.org/W2073151954,"Heat transport and ice sublimation in comets are interrelated processes reflecting properties acquired at the time of formation and during subsequent evolution. The Microwave Instrument on the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO) acquired maps of the subsurface temperature of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, at 1.6 mm and 0.5 mm wavelengths, and spectra of water vapor. The total H 2 O production rate varied from 0.3 kg s –1 in early June 2014 to 1.2 kg s –1 in late August and showed periodic variations related to nucleus rotation and shape. Water outgassing was localized to the “neck” region of the comet. Subsurface temperatures showed seasonal and diurnal variations, which indicated that the submillimeter radiation originated at depths comparable to the diurnal thermal skin depth. A low thermal inertia (~10 to 50 J K –1 m –2 s –0.5 ), consistent with a thermally insulating powdered surface, is inferred."

https://openalex.org/W2045471690,"That the speed of light in free space is constant is a cornerstone of modern physics. However, light beams have finite transverse size, which leads to a modification of their wavevectors resulting in a change to their phase and group velocities. We study the group velocity of single photons by measuring a change in their arrival time that results from changing the beam's transverse spatial structure. Using time-correlated photon pairs we show a reduction of the group velocity of photons in both a Bessel beam and photons in a focused Gaussian beam. In both cases, the delay is several microns over a propagation distance of the order of 1 m. Our work highlights that, even in free space, the invariance of the speed of light only applies to plane waves. Introducing spatial structure to an optical beam, even for a single photon, reduces the group velocity of the light by a readily measurable amount."

Millot et al. used high-pressure shock waves almost twice that of the center of Earth to melt silica, one of the primary components of planetary interiors. This was possible only by shocking a very dense form of silica called stishovite. Determining the melting point of silica is vital for developing better computational models of the interior of planets several times the mass of Earth.

https://openalex.org/W2093970255,"Objectives Sarcopenia, a novel concept reflecting the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, is an objective indicator of cancer cachexia. We investigated its role as a prognostic biomarker in advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients. Methods This retrospective study consisted of 88 UC patients with cT4 and/or metastases to lymph nodes/distant organs. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), an indicator of whole-body muscle mass, was measured from computed tomography (CT) images at the diagnosis. Sarcopenia was defined as SMIs of <43 cm2/m2 for males with body mass index (BMI) <25 cm2/m2, <53 cm2/m2 for males with BMI ≥25 cm2/m2, and <41 cm2/m2 for females. Predictors of overall survival (OS) were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. Results Sixty-seven patients (76%) died during the median follow-up of 13 months. The median OS rate was 13 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that SMI was a significant and independent predictor of shorter OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.90, P <0.001). In the present cohort, 53 (60%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The median OS rates were 11 and 31 months for sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients, respectively (P <0.001). On multivariate analysis, sarcopenia was a significant and independent predictor of shorter OS (HR 3.36, P <0.001), along with higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.001), upper urinary tract cancer (P = 0.007), higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.047), and higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (P = 0.048). Conclusion Sarcopenia, which is readily evaluated on routine CT scans, is a useful prognostic biomarker of advanced UC. Non-sarcopenic patients can expect long-term survival. Evaluating sarcopenia can be helpful for decision-making processes in the management of advanced UC patients."

Three sources of different types were detected: the pulsar wind nebula of the most energetic pulsar known N 157B, the radio-loud supernova remnant N 132D and the largest non-thermal X-ray shell - the superbubble 30 Dor C. The unique object SN 1987A is, surprisingly, not detected, which constrains the theoretical framework of particle acceleration in very young supernova remnants. These detections reveal the most energetic tip of a gamma-ray source population in an external galaxy, and provide via 30 Dor C the unambiguous detection of gamma-ray emission from a superbubble."

Signaling bias has been documented for several GPCRs, including chemokine receptors. However, most of these studies examined the global signaling bias between G protein- and arrestin-dependent pathways, leaving unaddressed the potential bias between particular G protein subtypes. Here, we investigated the coupling selectivity of chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CCR7 in response to various ligands with G protein subtypes by using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensors monitoring directly the activation of G proteins. We also compared data obtained with the G protein biosensors with those obtained with other functional readouts, such as β-arrestin-2 recruitment, cAMP accumulation, and calcium mobilization assays. We showed that the binding of chemokines to CCR2, CCR5, and CCR7 activated the three Gαi subtypes (Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3) and the two Gαo isoforms (Gαoa and Gαob) with potencies that generally correlate to their binding affinities. In addition, we showed that the binding of chemokines to CCR5 and CCR2 also activated Gα12, but not Gα13. For each receptor, we showed that the relative potency of various agonist chemokines was not identical in all assays, supporting the notion that signaling bias exists at chemokine receptors.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 4The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transfer. constitute one of the largest families of cell surface receptors. They are involved in many physiological processes and are targeted by ∼40% of all modern medicinal drugs (1.Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B. Structural diversity of G protein-coupled receptors and significance for drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Agonist binding to a receptor promotes conformational changes that result in the tight coupling of the receptor to a heterotrimeric G protein. Thereafter, conformation change within the G protein and the exchange of bound GDP for GTP allow the active Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits to interact with effectors to transduce the signal initiated by agonist binding (2.Strange P.G. Signaling mechanisms of GPCR ligands.Curr. Opin. Drug. Discov. Devel. 2008; 11: 196-202PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Gether U. Uncovering molecular mechanisms involved in activation of G protein-coupled receptors.Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In humans, genes encoding at least sixteen Gα subunits, five Gβ subunits, and twelve Gγ subunits have been identified, several of which have splice variants (4.Marrari Y. Crouthamel M. Irannejad R. Wedegaertner P.B. Assembly and trafficking of heterotrimeric G proteins.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7665-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Specific combinations of α, β, and γ subunits in G proteins affects which downstream targets are activated, providing the means to integrate the various signals coming into a cell. In addition to the canonical G protein-dependent pathways, G protein-independent signaling pathways have also been reported (5.Rajagopal S. Rajagopal K. Lefkowitz R.J. Teaching old receptors new tricks: biasing seven-transmembrane receptors.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2010; 9: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 6.Whalen E.J. Rajagopal S. Lefkowitz R.J. Therapeutic potential of β-arrestin- and G protein-biased agonists.Trends Mol. Med. 2011; 17: 126-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar7.Kenakin T. Functional selectivity and biased receptor signaling.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2011; 336: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are arrestins, which were originally considered to be solely involved in receptor desensitization and now have been identified as multifunctional scaffolds interacting with a number of signaling proteins such as MAPKs, PI3K, or protein kinase B (8.Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. β-Arrestin-mediated receptor trafficking and signal transduction.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2011; 32: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, a growing number of biased ligands have been reported that preferentially activate G protein- or arrestin-dependent pathways, and several of these biased ligands were shown to possess distinct functional properties when compared with “balanced” ligands (5.Rajagopal S. Rajagopal K. Lefkowitz R.J. Teaching old receptors new tricks: biasing seven-transmembrane receptors.Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2010; 9: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 7.Kenakin T.

G protein-coupled receptor bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. From a therapeutic point of view, molecules that selectively activate the arrestin pathway without affecting G protein-dependent signaling, or the inverse, could have improved efficacy or decreased side effects (6.Whalen E.J. Rajagopal S. Lefkowitz R.J. Therapeutic potential of β-arrestin- and G protein-biased agonists.Trends Mol. Med. 2011; 17: 126-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Biased signaling therefore appears to be a novel and promising concept that challenges our knowledge of GPCR function and raises new opportunities for the use of these receptors as therapeutic targets (9.Fuxe K. Kenakin T. The changing world of G protein-coupled receptors.J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 2010; 30: 271Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to identify ligands and receptors that possess biased signaling properties and to understand how agonist binding induces the selective activation of a signaling pathway within the cell. Chemokines are a good model system for the analysis of GPCR signaling bias. Chemokines are small basic proteins that control the homing and migration of immune cells. Approximately 40 chemokines and more than 20 chemokine receptors have been identified so far (10.Bonecchi R. Galliera E. Borroni E.M. Corsi M.M. Locati M. Mantovani A. Chemokines and chemokine receptors: an overview.Front. Biosci. (Landmark Ed). 2009; 14: 540-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Each receptor has its own specific repertoire of chemokine ligands, ranging from a one to a half a dozen. There is therefore significant redundancy in the chemokine system, but relatively little is known regarding the selectivity of pathways activated by chemokines downstream of their common receptor. Signaling selectivity has been first described for the two natural ligands of the chemokine receptor CCR7, CCL19, and CCL21. Both CCL19 and CCL21 were reported to activate G protein-dependent pathways, but only CCL19 was proposed to recruit β-arrestin and activate MAPK Erk1/2 (11.Zidar D.A. Violin J.D. Whalen E.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Selective engagement of G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) encodes distinct functions of biased ligands.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Arrestin 3 mediates endocytosis of CCR7 following ligation of CCL19 but not CCL21.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4723-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As a result, CCR7 became a prototypical example of biased signaling, particularly with respect to natural agonists. Based on these first studies, it was anticipated that other chemokine receptors might display a similar bias by preferentially activating either G protein- or arrestin-dependent pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis, Rajagopal et al. (14.Rajagopal S. Bassoni D.L. Campbell J.J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Wehrman T.S. Biased agonism as a mechanism for differential signaling by chemokine receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 35039-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) recently reported that other chemokine receptors have different tendencies to induce either G protein- or arrestin-dependent signaling. In addition, selectivity might exist in the activation of different G protein subtypes or isoforms. However, until recently, it was difficult to elucidate which G protein subtype was activated. In this paper, we used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) biosensors to monitor the conformational changes in G proteins during their activation and determined which G protein subtypes were activated by various chemokines. We combined the use of these sensors with other functional assays to revisit the signaling bias previously identified for CCR7 and to analyze the signaling selectivity of various chemokine ligands through activation of the closely related receptors CCR2 and CCR5.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, detached, and resuspended in PBS plus 0.1% (w/v) glucose at room temperature. The cells were then distributed (80 μg of proteins/well) in a 96-well microplate (Optiplate; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). BRET2 between RLuc8 and GFP10 was measured 1 min after addition of coelenterazine 400a/deep blue C (5 μm, Gentaur). BRET readings were collected using an Infinite F200 reader (Tecan Group Ltd). The BRET signal was calculated as the ratio of emission of GFP10 (510–540 nm) to RLuc8 (370–450 nm). cAMP inhibition was assayed by BRET as previously described (18.Barak L.S. Salahpour A. Zhang X.

Briefly, plasmids encoding YFP-Epac-RLuc biosensor and receptors of interest were cotransfected into HEK293T cells by using the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were collected and seeded in 96-well microplates (catalog no. 165306; Nunc) and cultured for an additional 24 h.

Chemokines were added 5 min after coelenterazine h, and 5 μm forskolin was added 5 min later. After 5 min of incubation, BRET readings were collected using a Mithras LB940 multilabel reader (Berthold Technologies). The BRET signal was calculated as the ratio of emission of YFP (520–570 nm) to RLuc (370–480 nm). β-Arrestin recruitment was measured by a BRET proximity assay as previously described (17.Saulière A.

Deciphering biased-agonism complexity reveals a new active AT(1) receptor entity.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids encoding Rluc-β-arrestin 2 and receptors fused to Venus were cotransfected into HEK293T cells by using the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were collected and seeded in 96-well microplates (catalog no. 165306; Nunc) and cultured for an additional 24 h. Cells were then rinsed once with PBS and incubated in PBS plus 0.1% (w/v) glucose at 25 °C to slow down kinetics of arrestin recruitment and improve temporal resolution. BRET1 between RLuc and YFP was measured after the addition of coelenterazine h (5 μm; Promega). Chemokines were added 5 min after coelenterazine h, and BRET readings were collected using a Mithras LB940 Multilabel Reader (Berthold Technologies). The BRET signal was calculated as the ratio of emission of YFP (520–570 nm) to RLuc (370–480 nm). Calcium mobilization was measured in HEK293 cells expressing CCR2 or CCR7 with an aequorin-based assay as previously described (15.El-Asmar L. Springael J.Y. Ballet S. Andrieu E.U. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Evidence for negative binding cooperativity within CCR5-CCR2b heterodimers.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because signals induced by chemokines were barely detectable in HEK293 cells expressing CCR5, calcium mobilization was performed in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing CCR5. Briefly, cells expressing apoaequorin and the receptor of interest were incubated for 4 h in the dark in the presence of 5 μm coelenterazine h (Promega) and then diluted before use to reach the appropriate cell density. The cell suspension (25,000 cells/well) was added to wells containing various concentrations of chemokines, and luminescence was recorded for 30 s in an EG&G Berthold luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HEK293 cells expressing CCR7 were starved for 12–18 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were collected by centrifugation and heated to 100 °C for 5 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Whole cell lysates were resolved on 10% Tris/Tricine polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and β-arrestins were detected by using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (catalog no. 4370; Cell Signaling; 1:1,000) and anti-ERK1/2 (catalog no. 4695S; Cell Signaling; 1:2,000) antibodies. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using ECL Plus reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The bias index (β) was estimated by using the following equation, where RA denotes the relative efficacy of a ligand (Lig) through pathway a and pathway b relative to a reference agonist (ref) chosen arbitrary (15.El-Asmar L. Springael J.Y. Ballet S. Andrieu E.U. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Evidence for negative binding cooperativity within CCR5-CCR2b heterodimers.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Bias index=LogRAab,LigRAab,ref=LogEmax,aEC50,aEC50,bEmax,b×Emax,bEC50,bEC50,aEmax,a(Eq. 1) Statistical analyses were performed where appropriate using one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post-test, and statistical significance related to the reference balanced ligand was taken as p < 0.05. In a competition binding assay, we first confirmed that CCL19 and CCL21 compete with radiolabeled CCL19 for CCR7 binding with nearly equivalent pIC50 values (Fig. 1A and Table 1). We next investigated the panel of G proteins activated by CCR7 upon binding of CCL19 or CCL21 by using BRET-based biosensors directly monitoring the activation of G proteins. This technology relies on the large interdomain movement that occurs within heterotrimeric G proteins upon GDP/GTP exchange, resulting in a decrease of the BRET signal between probes inserted at specific locations within Gα and Gγ subunits (16.Galés C. Van Durm J.J. Schaak S. Pontier S. Percherancier Y. Audet M. Paris H. Bouvier M. Probing the activation-promoted structural rearrangements in preassembled receptor-G protein complexes.Nat. Struct.

This technology detects early signaling events that occur shortly after receptor stimulation, enabling us to identify the G protein subtypes activated by a receptor. CCR7 was transiently coexpressed in HEK-293T cells with ten different biosensors belonging to the four major classes of G proteins (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13), and stimulated with either CCL19 or CCL21. Among the ten G protein isoforms tested, neither chemokine significantly activated the Gαq, Gα11, Gαs, Gα12, or Gα13 proteins at 100 nm (data not shown). CCL19 binding triggered a significant activation of the three Gαi subtypes (Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3) and the two Gαo isoforms (Gαoa and Gαob) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, CCL21 binding led to less efficient activation of the Gαi/o proteins. A dose-response curve indicated that CCL21 activates Gαi and Gαo at least ten times less potently than CCL19 (Fig. 1, C–E, and Table 1). We are, however, uncertain of the maximal efficacy of Gα activation by CCL21 because we did not saturate the BRET signal at 100 nm. We next measured the inhibition of cAMP production as a representative readout of Gαi/o proteins activation and showed that CCL21 inhibited cAMP production triggered by forskolin at lower potency but similar efficacy compare with CCL19, in complete agreement with data generated with the G protein biosensors (Fig. 1F). We also investigated the ability of CCR7 to recruit β-arrestin by a BRET proximity assay, which measures the energy transfer between β-arrestin-2-Rluc and CCR7 fused to the yellow fluorescent protein Venus. Because of the rapid recruitment of arrestin at 37 °C, our assays were performed at 25 °C to decrease the reaction kinetics and gain temporal resolution. CCL21 (at 100 nm) induced the recruitment of β-arrestin-2 slower than CCL19 (Tau values of 4.6 and 2.4 min, respectively), in perfect agreement with previously published data (11.Zidar D.A. Violin J.D. Whalen E.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Selective engagement of G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) encodes distinct functions of biased ligands.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It should be noted that the maximal BRET value (BRETmax) reached with CCL21 stimulation is also 30% lower than the BRETmax with CCL19 stimulation. This might reflect distinct conformations of receptor-arrestin complexes (12.Kohout T.A. Nicholas S.L. Perry S.J. Reinhart G. Junger S. Struthers R.S.

Indeed, we showed that CCL21 activates β-arrestin-2 ten times less potently than CCL19 (Fig. 1H and Table 1). Finally, we showed that CCL21 also triggered calcium mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation less potently than CCL19 (Fig. 1, I and J). Collectively, our data indicate that CCL21 binds CCR7 as efficiently as CCL19 but is less potent in activating all the assays including G proteins and β-arrestin-2, thus challenging the notion of signaling bias as previously claimed between these two pathways.TABLE 1Binding and signaling properties of CCR7Ligands[125I]CCL19Gαi2Gαi3Gαoaβ-Arr2cAMPCa2+MAPKpIC50pKipEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxCCL19−8.5 ± 0.1−8.8 ± 0.1−8.1 ± 0.2−0.11 ± 0.01−8.3 ± 0.1−0.19 ± 0.01−8.2 ± 0.1−0.11 ± 0.01−8.6 ± 0.10.17 ± 0.01−9.7 ± 0.247 ± 3−8.1 ± 0.325 ± 4−8.8 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.2CCL21−8.1 ± 0.1−8.4 ± 0.1NDND−7.3 ± 0.2−0.15 ± 0.03−7.6 ± 0.1−0.07 ± 0.01NDND−8.8 ± 0.356 ± 8NDND−7.4 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab To further analyze the signaling selectivity of chemokine receptors, we also investigated the activation of G proteins through CCR5, a receptor that binds multiple chemokines. We first measured the binding affinities of some of these chemokines (CCL-3, -4, -5, -8, and -13) and showed that they compete with radiolabeled CCL4 for CCR5 binding with calculated pIC50 values consistent with previous estimates (Fig. 2 and Table 2) (19.Blanpain C. Migeotte I. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist.Blood. 1999; 94: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next compared the ability of these chemokines to trigger G protein activation by using BRET-based G protein biosensors. CCR5 was coexpressed with the various biosensors and stimulated with the agonist chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, and CCL13. As controls, cells were also exposed to the antagonist chemokine CCL7 and to TAK779 and Maraviroc, two small molecules displaying inverse agonist properties. Stimulation of CCR5 by CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, and CCL13 at 100 nm significantly activated all Gαi and Gαo isoforms and also Gα12, with CCL13 activating each G protein the least (Fig. 3). Stimulation of cells expressing the biosensors without CCR5 was used as negative control and generated signals of much weaker magnitude (Fig. 3). No significant BRET signal was detected for the Gαq, Gα11, Gαs, or Gα13 proteins (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The chemokine antagonist CCL7 had no significant effect, whereas TAK779 and Maraviroc displayed a tendency to increase the BRET signal for some biosensors (Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαoa) in the presence of CCR5, in agreement with their inverse agonist properties. Dose-response curves performed with some representative G protein biosensors also indicated that the calculated pEC50 values are similar for the different Gα proteins. CCL5 was the most potent agonist in these assays, despite having a similar CCR5 binding affinity than CCL3 and CCL4. CCL13 was the least potent agonist, in agreement with its lower affinity for CCR5 (Fig. 4 and Table 2). However, the calculated Emax values were more variable for specific chemokines and Gα proteins, with CCL13 being the agonist with the lowest efficacy. Collectively, our data did not reveal major activation bias among chemokines and between the Gαi, Gαo, and Gα12 protein subtypes, although CCL5 displayed higher potency in most assays, and CCL8 tended to be less effective in activating Gαo proteins. We next used cAMP accumulation as a representative readout of Gαi/o protein activation. As expected, all chemokine agonists inhibited the cAMP production triggered by forskolin with relative potencies compatible with our binding data. The calculated pEC50 values are lower than those estimated with the G protein biosensors, likely as a consequence of the higher sensitivity of this assay caused by signal amplification along the cascade (Fig. 5A and Table 2). CCL13 inhibited cAMP accumulation with a lower potency, but with a similar efficiency compared with the other agonist chemokines. Finally, we showed that agonist chemokines activated calcium mobilization with similar pEC50 and Emax values, with the exception of CCL13, which was again less potent in this assay (Fig. 5B and Table 2). In contrast to the stimulation of CCR7, our data showed that stimulation of CCR5 triggered the activation of G12, indicating that chemokine receptors can activate distinct G proteins. Moreover, our results also showed that CCR5 activated Gα12 but not Gα13, although they belong to the same family (Fig. 3).TABLE 2Binding and signaling parameters of CCR5Ligands[125I]CCL4Gαi1GαobGα12β-Arr2cAMPCa2+pIC50pKipEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxpEC50EmaxCCL3−8.7 ± 0.1−8.9 ± 0.1−8.1 ± 0.4−0.09 ± 0.02−8.1 ± 0.4−0.08 ± 0.02−8.6 ± 0.3−0.017 ± 0.002−8.6 ± 0.20.08 ± 0.01−10.6 ± 0.243 ± 3−7.2 ± 0.1119 ± 12CCL4−9.2 ± 0.1−9.4 ± 0.1−8.5 ± 0.2−0.07 ± 0.02−8.3 ± 0.2−0.10 ± 0.01−8.1 ± 0.2−0.016 ± 0.002−8.1 ± 0.10.10 ± 0.01−9.1 ± 0.144 ± 3−8.2 ± 0.275 ± 5CCL5−8.2 ± 0.1−8.4 ± 0.1−9.1 ± 0.5−0.09 ± 0.02−9.2 ± 0.1−0.10 ± 0.01−9.0 ± 0.3−0.020 ± 0.001−8.1 ± 0.20.10 ± 0.01−10.3 ± 0.334 ± 2−8.0 ± 0.291 ± 3CCL8−8.2 ± 0.1−8.4 ± 0.1−8.2 ± 0.1−0.09 ± 0.01−8.1 ± 0.3−0.06 ± 0.01−8.1 ± 0.4−0.015 ± 0.003−7.0 ± 0.20.08 ± 0.01−9.2 ± 0.239 ± 3−7.4 ± 0.189 ± 3CCL13−7.2 ± 0.1−7.4 ± 0.1NDND−7.6 ± 0.1−0.05 ± 0.01NDNDNDND"

After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells transition from axon myelination to a demyelinated state that supports neuronal survival and ultimately remyelination of axons. Reprogramming of gene expression patterns during development and injury responses is shaped by the actions of distal regulatory elements that integrate the actions of multiple transcription factors. We used ChIP-seq to measure changes in histone H3K27 acetylation, a mark of active enhancers, to identify enhancers in myelinating rat peripheral nerve and their dynamics after demyelinating nerve injury. Analysis of injury-induced enhancers identified enriched motifs for c-Jun, a transcription factor required for Schwann cells to support nerve regeneration. We identify a c-Jun-bound enhancer in the gene for Runx2, a transcription factor induced after nerve injury, and we show that Runx2 is required for activation of other induced genes. In contrast, enhancers that lose H3K27ac after nerve injury are enriched for binding sites of the Sox10 and early growth response 2 (Egr2/Krox20) transcription factors, which are critical determinants of Schwann cell differentiation. Egr2 expression is lost after nerve injury, and many Egr2-binding sites lose H3K27ac after nerve injury. However, the majority of Egr2-bound enhancers retain H3K27ac, indicating that other transcription factors maintain active enhancer status after nerve injury.

https://openalex.org/W1993621543,"Aim The purpose of the study was to determine anxiety and depression, quality of life, and their determinants in long-term survivors of malignant melanoma. Methods In a state cancer registry a cohort of survivors of malignant melanoma was contacted via the physician registered. Of 1302 contactable patients, 689 (52.2%) completed a questionnaire including the Patient Health Questionnaire with generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ 30). Based on multiple regression analysis, predictors of quality of life and distress were identified. Comparison data were assessed in two waves of representative face-to-face household surveys of the adult German population. Results An average of 8.4 (5.7 to 12.2) years after diagnosis, distress was higher in women compared to men and in middle adulthood (vs. older patients). Symptoms were higher in women than in men, and there was a decline of functioning and increase of symptoms across the age range of both genders. Compared to the general population, there were slightly increased depression and anxiety (only women), but no impaired global quality of life. Yet, survivors evidenced functional decline and more physical symptoms. Distress and reduced quality of life were consistently predicted by lack of social support, fear of recurrence, pessimism and self-blame. Distress was increased by a family history of melanoma, and additional mental and somatic diseases. Conclusion Overall, long-term survivors have adjusted well achieving a global quality of life comparable to the general population. Yet, compromised functional dimensions, physical symptoms and distress indicate the need for integrating psychooncological screening into oncological follow-up, which might be guided by predictors such as family history or social support. Further prospective study is needed to determine the course of adaptation to the disease and corroborate the risk factors identified."

The aim of this study was to compare aortic PWV determined by a recently developed oscillometric device with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Methods PWV was assessed in 40 volunteers with two different methods. The oscillometric method (PWVOSC) is based on a transfer function from the brachial pressure waves determined by oscillometric blood pressure measurements with a common cuff (Mobil-O-Graph, I.E.M. Stolberg, Germany). CMR was used to determine aortic PWVCMR with the use of the transit time method based on phase-contrast imaging at the level of the ascending and abdominal aorta on a clinical 1.5 Tesla scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Results The median age of the study population was 34 years (IQR: 24–55 years, 11 females). A very strong correlation was found between PWVOSC and PWVCMR (r = 0.859, p < 0.001). Mean PWVOSC was 6.7 ± 1.8 m/s and mean PWVCMR was 6.1 ± 1.8 m/s (p < 0.001). Analysis of agreement between the two measurements using Bland-Altman method showed a bias of 0.57 m/s (upper and lower limit of agreement: 2.49 m/s and -1.34 m/s). The corresponding coefficient of variation between both measurements was 15%. Conclusion Aortic pulse wave velocity assessed by transformation of the brachial pressure waveform showed an acceptable agreement with the CMR-derived transit time method."

However, the knowledge of carotenoid accumulation genetic control in this root vegetable is still limited. In order to identify the genetic variants linked to this character, we performed an association mapping study with a candidate gene approach. We developed an original unstructured population with a broad genetic basis to avoid the pitfall of false positive detection due to population stratification. We genotyped 109 SNPs located in 17 candidate genes – mostly carotenoid biosynthesis genes – on 380 individuals, and tested the association with carotenoid contents and color components. Total carotenoids and β-carotene contents were significantly associated with genes zeaxanthin epoxydase (ZEP), phytoene desaturase (PDS) and carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) while α-carotene was associated with CRTISO and plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) genes. Color components were associated most significantly with ZEP. Our results suggest the involvement of the couple PDS/PTOX and ZEP in carotenoid accumulation, as the result of the metabolic and catabolic activities respectively. This study brings new insights in the understanding of the carotenoid pathway in non-photosynthetic organs."
https://openalex.org/W2016164582,"Previous research has suggested that patients meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD) display altered self-related information processing. However, experimental studies on dysfunctional self-referential information processing in BPD are rare. In this study, BPD patients (N = 30) and healthy control participants (N = 30) judged positive, neutral, and negative words in terms of emotional valence. Referential processing was manipulated by a preceding self-referential pronoun, an other-referential pronoun, or no referential context. Subsequently, patients and participants completed a free recall and recognition task. BPD patients judged positive and neutral words as more negative than healthy control participants when the words had self-reference or no reference. In BPD patients, these biases were significantly correlated with self-reported attributional style, particularly for negative events, but unrelated to measures of depressive mood. However, BPD patients did not differ from healthy control participants in a subsequent free recall task and a recognition task. Our findings point to a negative evaluation bias for positive, self-referential information in BPD. This bias did not affect the storage of information in memory, but may be related to self-attributions of negative events in everyday life in BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2083175589,"The human mitochondrial Hsp70, also called mortalin, is of considerable importance for mitochondria biogenesis and the correct functioning of the cell machinery. In the mitochondrial matrix, mortalin acts in the importing and folding process of nucleus-encoded proteins. The in vivo deregulation of mortalin expression and/or function has been correlated with age-related diseases and certain cancers due to its interaction with the p53 protein. In spite of its critical biological roles, structural and functional studies on mortalin are limited by its insoluble recombinant production. This study provides the first report of the production of folded and soluble recombinant mortalin when co-expressed with the human Hsp70-escort protein 1, but it is still likely prone to self-association. The monomeric fraction of mortalin presented a slightly elongated shape and basal ATPase activity that is higher than that of its cytoplasmic counterpart Hsp70-1A, suggesting that it was obtained in the functional state. Through small angle X-ray scattering, we assessed the low-resolution structural model of monomeric mortalin that is characterized by an elongated shape. This model adequately accommodated high resolution structures of Hsp70 domains indicating its quality. We also observed that mortalin interacts with adenosine nucleotides with high affinity. Thermally induced unfolding experiments indicated that mortalin is formed by at least two domains and that the transition is sensitive to the presence of adenosine nucleotides and that this process is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ ions. Interestingly, the thermal-induced unfolding assays of mortalin suggested the presence of an aggregation/association event, which was not observed for human Hsp70-1A, and this finding may explain its natural tendency for in vivo aggregation. Our study may contribute to the structural understanding of mortalin as well as to contribute for its recombinant production for antitumor compound screenings."

The purpose of the present study was to identify those neuropsychological tests that most reliably tell euthymic bipolar patients and controls apart, and to clarify the extent to which these cognitive impairments are clinically significant as judged from neuropsychological norms.Patients with bipolar disorder (type I: n = 64; type II: n = 44) and controls (n = 86) were examined with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery yielding 47 measures of executive functioning, speed, memory, and verbal skills. Multivariate analysis was used to build a model of cognitive performance with the ability to expose underlying trends in data and to reveal cognitive differences between patients and controls.Patients with bipolar disorder and controls were partially separated by one predictive component of cognitive performance. Additionally, the relative relevance of each cognitive measure for such separation was decided. Cognitive tests measuring set shifting, inhibition, fluency, and searching (e.g., Trail Making Test, Color-Word) had strongest discriminating ability and most reliably detected cognitive impairments in the patient group.Both bipolar disorder type I and type II were associated with cognitive impairment that for a sizeable minority is significant in a clinical neuropsychological sense.

https://openalex.org/W1984642820,"We have recently demonstrated that the PI3K class II-α isoform (PI3K-C2α), which generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphates, plays crucial roles in angiogenesis, by analyzing PI3K-C2α knock-out mice. The PI3K-C2α actions are mediated at least in part through its participation in the internalization of VEGF receptor-2 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor S1P1 and thereby their signaling on endosomes. TGFβ, which is also an essential angiogenic factor, signals via the serine/threonine kinase receptor complex to induce phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3). SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) protein, which is localized in early endosomes through its FYVE domain, is required for Smad2/3 signaling. In the present study, we showed that PI3K-C2α knockdown nearly completely abolished TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). PI3K-C2α was necessary for TGFβ-induced increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphates in the plasma membrane and TGFβ receptor internalization into the SARA-containing early endosomes, but not for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate enrichment or localization of SARA in the early endosomes. PI3K-C2α was also required for TGFβ receptor-mediated formation of SARA-Smad2/3 complex. Inhibition of dynamin, which is required for the clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis, suppressed both TGFβ receptor internalization and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. TGFβ1 stimulated Smad-dependent VEGF-A expression, VEGF receptor-mediated EC migration, and capillary-like tube formation, which were all abolished by either PI3K-C2α knockdown or a dynamin inhibitor. Finally, TGFβ1-induced microvessel formation in Matrigel plugs was greatly attenuated in EC-specific PI3K-C2α-deleted mice. These observations indicate that PI3K-C2α plays the pivotal role in TGFβ receptor endocytosis and thereby Smad2/3 signaling, participating in angiogenic actions of TGFβ. We have recently demonstrated that the PI3K class II-α isoform (PI3K-C2α), which generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphates, plays crucial roles in angiogenesis, by analyzing PI3K-C2α knock-out mice. The PI3K-C2α actions are mediated at least in part through its participation in the internalization of VEGF receptor-2 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor S1P1 and thereby their signaling on endosomes. TGFβ, which is also an essential angiogenic factor, signals via the serine/threonine kinase receptor complex to induce phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3). SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) protein, which is localized in early endosomes through its FYVE domain, is required for Smad2/3 signaling. In the present study, we showed that PI3K-C2α knockdown nearly completely abolished TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). PI3K-C2α was necessary for TGFβ-induced increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphates in the plasma membrane and TGFβ receptor internalization into the SARA-containing early endosomes, but not for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate enrichment or localization of SARA in the early endosomes. PI3K-C2α was also required for TGFβ receptor-mediated formation of SARA-Smad2/3 complex. Inhibition of dynamin, which is required for the clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis, suppressed both TGFβ receptor internalization and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. TGFβ1 stimulated Smad-dependent VEGF-A expression, VEGF receptor-mediated EC migration, and capillary-like tube formation, which were all abolished by either PI3K-C2α knockdown or a dynamin inhibitor. Finally, TGFβ1-induced microvessel formation in Matrigel plugs was greatly attenuated in EC-specific PI3K-C2α-deleted mice. These observations indicate that PI3K-C2α plays the pivotal role in TGFβ receptor endocytosis and thereby Smad2/3 signaling, participating in angiogenic actions of TGFβ. PI3Ks are a family of enzymes that phosphorylate membrane inositol phospholipids at the 3′ position of the inositol ring and comprise three classes (classes I–III) (1.Engelman J.A. Luo J.

Signaling of VEGFR2 and S1P1 was defective in PI3K-C2α-depleted EC: the receptor endocytosis was inhibited, and the signaling on endosomes, particularly Rho GTPase activation, was impaired. These defects result in impaired migration, proliferation, and intercellular junction formation in EC. It is unknown whether and how PI3K-C2α regulates signaling of other angiogenic receptors.

TGFβ binds to type II receptor, which phosphorylates and activates type I receptors, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1, and ALK5. ALK1 and ALK5 in turn phosphorylate the receptor-regulated Smads, Smad1 and Smad5 (Smad1/5) and Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3), respectively. Phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads form complexes with the common mediator Smad4 and the Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. It was proposed that TGFβ signaling pathways via ALK1 and ALK5 in EC may play a balancing role for controlling proliferation and migration of EC during angiogenesis (24.Goumans M.J.

It is likely that PI3Ks are involved in TGFβ receptor internalization, the endosomal localization of SARA, and thus TGFβ signaling. However, it is unknown which isoform of PI3K is engaged in the processes of TGFβ signaling. In the present study, we studied a role for PI3K-C2α in TGFβ-induced Smad2/3 signaling in EC. We found that TGFβ-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation, Smad2/3-dependent gene expression, and angiogenic responses were strongly dependent on PI3K-C2α. PI3K-C2α was required for TGFβ receptor internalization but not the endosomal localization of SARA. These observations suggest that PI3K-C2α plays an indispensable role in endosomal TGFβ receptor signaling.

The cells were washed in PBS and lysed in the cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with Complete Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by scraping, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 16, 000 × g at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were taken, electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% BSA and incubated with respective antibodies overnight. The antibodies used are PI3K-C2α (catalog no. 611046; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), PI3K-C2β (catalog no. 611342; BD Biosciences), p110α (catalog no. 4249; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), Vps34 (catalog no. 4263; Cell Signaling), total Smad2/3 (catalog no. 610842; BD Biosciences), phosphorylated Smad2 (p-Smad2) (catalog no. 3101; Cell Signaling), phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) (catalog no. 9520; Cell Signaling), total ERK1/2 (catalog no. 9102; Cell Signaling), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (catalog no. 4370; Cell Signaling), total Smad4 (catalog no. 9515; Cell Signaling); SARA (catalog no. sc-9135; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), phosphoserine (catalog no. 618100; Invitrogen), and β-actin (catalog no.

The membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG antibody, catalog no. 7056; anti-rabbit IgG antibody, catalog no. 7054) (Cell Signaling) and visualized by color reaction using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The band intensities were determined using Image Gauge (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The values were normalized for the value of β-actin as a loading control and expressed as multiples over the normalized values of untreated controls. For immunoprecipitation assay, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the expression vectors for FLAG-Smad3, either FLAG-SARA or FLAG-ΔSBD-SARA, and either FLAG-wtALK5 or FLAG-constitutively activated ALK5 (caALK5) and 72 h later were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with Complete Protease inhibitor cocktails. The lysates were incubated with anti-SARA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking, followed by the incubation with protein G-agarose beads (catalog no. 1-719-416; Roche) for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed five times, they were mixed with 2× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer and boiled. The resultant samples were analyzed with immunoblotting using respective antibodies. HUVECs were plated onto type I collagen-coated glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) and allowed to adhere to dishes in EGM-2 growth medium overnight. The cells were rinsed with prewarmed PBS once and fixed in prewarmed 4% fresh paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min when necessary.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate cross-sectional and combined associations of metabolic syndrome with body composition and physical fitness in a community based geriatric population. Methods A total of 628 community-dwelling elders attending a geriatric health examination were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was based on the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criterion with Asian cutoff of waist girth was adopted in this study. Body composition was obtained using bioimpedance analysis, and physical fitness was evaluated through the measurement of muscle strength (handgrip force), lower extremity muscle endurance (sit-to-stand test), flexibility (sit-and-reach test), and cardiorespiratory endurance (2-minute step test). Multivariable logistic regression and correlation analysis were performed to determine the association of metabolic syndrome with body composition and functionality variables. Results Metabolic syndrome was associated with increased skeletal muscle index (SMI) (odds ratio (OR), 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25–2.07) and decreased flexibility (OR, 0.97, 95% CI, 0.95–0.99) compared with those without metabolic syndrome. When body mass index was accounted for in the analysis, the association of SMI with metabolic syndrome was reduced. Waist circumference was positively correlated with SMI but negatively correlated with flexibility, whereas high density lipoprotein was positively correlated with flexibility but negatively correlated with SMI. Conclusion Reduced flexibility was positively associated with metabolic syndrome independent of age, gender, body composition, and functionality measurements in a community based geriatric population. Significant associations between metabolic syndrome with muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in the elderly were not observed. Furthermore, flexibility should be included in the complete evaluation for metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2079370407,"Common scab of potatoes is a disease, which is difficult to manage due to complex interactions of the pathogenic bacteria (Streptomyces spp.) with soil, microbial community and potato plants. In Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in the Czech Republic two sites (Vyklantice and Zdirec) were selected for a study of common scab disease suppressivity. At both sites, a field with low disease severity occurs next to one with high severity and the situation was regularly observed over four decades although all four fields undergo a crop rotation. In the four fields, quantities of bacteria, actinobacteria and the gene txtB from the biosynthetic gene cluster of thaxtomin, the main pathogenicity factor of common scab, were analyzed by real-time PCR. Microbial community structure was compared by terminal fragment length polymorphism analysis. Soil and potato periderm were characterized by contents of carbon, nitrogen, phosporus, sulphur, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Quality of organic matter was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography of soil extracts. The study demonstrated that the suppressive character of the fields is locally specific. At Zdirec, the suppressivity was associated with low txtB gene copies in bulk soil, while at Vyklantice site it was associated with low txtB gene copies in the tuberosphere. The differences were discussed with respect to the effect of abiotic conditions at Zdirec and interaction between potato plant and soil microbial community at Vyklantice. Soil pH, Ca soil content or cation concentrations, although different were not in the range to predict the disease severity. Low severity of common scab was associated with low content of soil C, N, C/N, Ca and Fe suggesting that oligotrophic conditions may be favorable to common scab suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2018165812,"Many G-protein-coupled receptors carry C-terminal ligand motifs for PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains; via interaction with PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins, this allows for integration of receptors into signaling complexes. However, the presence of PDZ domain proteins attached to intracellular membranes suggests that PDZ-type interactions may also contribute to subcellular sorting of receptors. The protein interacting specifically with Tc10 (PIST; also known as GOPC) is a trans-Golgi-associated protein that interacts through its single PDZ domain with a variety of cell surface receptors. Here we show that PIST controls trafficking of the interacting β1-adrenergic receptor both in the anterograde, biosynthetic pathway and during postendocytic recycling. Overexpression and knockdown experiments show that PIST leads to retention of the receptor in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), to the effect that overexpressed PIST reduces activation of the MAPK pathway by β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) agonists. Receptors can be released from retention in the TGN by coexpression of the plasma membrane-associated scaffold PSD-95, which allows for transport of receptors to the plasma membrane. Stimulation of β1 receptors and activation of the cAMP pathway lead to relocation of PIST from the TGN to an endosome-like compartment. Here PIST colocalizes with SNX1 and the internalized β1AR and protects endocytosed receptors from lysosomal degradation. In agreement, β1AR levels are decreased in hippocampi of PIST-deficient mice.

https://openalex.org/W2061707213,"Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a climatically active gas released into the atmosphere from oceans. It is produced mainly by bacterial enzymatic cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and six DMSP lyases have been identified to date. To determine the biogeographical distribution of bacteria relevant to DMS production, we investigated the diversity of dddP—the most abundant DMS-producing gene—in the northwestern Pacific Ocean using newly developed primers and the pyrosequencing method. Consistent with previous studies, the major dddP-containing bacteria in coastal areas were those belonging to the Roseobacter clade. However, genotypes closely related to the SAR116 group were found to represent a large portion of dddP-containing bacteria in the surface waters of the oligotrophic ocean. The addition of DMSP to a culture of the SAR116 strain Candidatus Puniceispirillum marinum IMCC1322 resulted in the production of DMS and upregulated expression of the dddP gene. Considering the large area of oligotrophic water and the wide distribution of the SAR116 group in oceans worldwide, we propose that these bacteria may play an important role in oceanic DMS production and biogeochemical sulfur cycles, especially via bacteria-mediated DMSP degradation."

In 1991, it was observed that free oligosaccharides accumulate in mature fish eggs and during the early stages of embryogenesis of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). This led to the discovery of PNGase in animal sources, and a possible role for PNGase-mediated deglycosylation in the embryogenesis of fish was suggested (6.Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S.

PNGase F hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of asparagine-linked glycoproteins to generate carbohydrate-free peptides and detached full-length oligosaccharides. PNGase F has been used extensively in protein glycosylation/deglycosylation studies. Despite the fact that PNGase F remained the only proximal N-glycosidase identified in bacteria for many years, its biological significance has remained elusive. Recently, several genes encoding proteins with predicted PNGase structures, including candidate PNGase proteins from Deinococcus radiodurans (GenBankTM identifier (GI): 15807985) and Bacteroides fragilis (GI: 3288840), were identified in genome projects. However, to the best of our knowledge, these proteins have not been characterized so far. In 2012, our group isolated an E. meningoseptica strain (FMS-007) from a T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient and obtained its complete genome sequence in one contig (GenBankTM accession number CP006576). 6G. Sun and L. Chen, submitted for publication. In addition to the known PNGase F gene, a putative gene encoding a protein with significant structural homology to PNGase F at its C-terminal end was identified by bioinformatics analysis in this E. meningoseptica strain. The protein was expressed, purified, and subjected to biochemical and structural analyses. The results suggest that the candidate protein is a new PNGase identified from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica with a novel domain structure and catalytic specificity. It has been named PNGase F-II or type 2 PNGase F. The DNA sequence of the putative PNGase gene was obtained from the whole genome sequence of the clinical isolate (FMS-007) of E. meningoseptica. Conserved domains in the putative PNGase were identified using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTp) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Web site. Protein sequences for the other PNGase used in the multiple-sequence alignment were downloaded from GenBankTM. For proteins with known structures, the .pdb files were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using Align X®. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA version 5.2.2) software. The position of the signal peptide on the putative PNGase was predicted using the online program, SignalP (version 4.1). The target gene was cloned into the pET28a vector (kanr; Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Tiangen, Shanghai, China) as follows. The candidate gene without the predicted signal peptide was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from E. meningoseptica strain FMS-007, and a pair of designed oligonucleotides (5′-atccatggcccagacttatgaaattacttatc-3′ and 5′-acctcgagttcttgccctaagagaacg-3′). The amplified PCR product was ligated between the NcoI and XhoI cloning sites on the pET28a plasmid. The constructed expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the transformants were cultured at 37 °C for 12 h in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.0 mm) was used to induce the expression of the candidate protein at 28 °C for 12 h. The expressed protein was purified in sequential steps. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2683 × g (Beckman Coulter AllegraTM 25R centrifuge, TA-14-250 rotor) for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The suspended cells were treated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and sonicated (program: 3 s of sonication followed by a pause (5 s) per cycle, 30% power, φ = 10) for 20 min on ice or disrupted using a high pressure homogenizer (JNBIO®, Guangzhou, China). The debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 15,455 × g using a TA-14-50 rotor) at 4 °C. The supernatant was purified using a B-PER His6 fusion protein purification kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce) or a HisTrapTM column (GE Healthcare). The loaded column was washed twice with a wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and the candidate protein was eluted in an elution buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex® 200 16/60 preparation grade column (GE Healthcare) in a gel filtration buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). For the in vitro biochemical assays, the elution buffer was replaced with 10 mm PBS (pH 7.4) by ultrafiltration through a filter with MWCO of 30,000 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 2173 × g (Beckman Coulter AllegtaTM 25R, TA-14-50 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce) or by measuring the absorption of UV light at A280. The purity of the candidate protein was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis. The amount of purified PNGase F-II obtained from different batches was 70–90 mg/liter of culture. PNGase F-II was stable at −80, −20, and 4 °C in PBS buffer for 1 month. Prior to crystallization, the purified protein was concentrated to 60 mg/ml using an Amicon® Ultra centrifugal device from Millipore. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. PNGase F was used as the positive control for all subsequent assays. A similar procedure was adopted to clone, express, and purify PNGase F with a pair of PNGase F-specific oligonucleotides (5′-atccatggatgctccggctgataatacc-3′ and 5′-ccctcgaggtttgtaactatcggagcactaat-3′). To verify the N-glycosidase activity of the candidate protein, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B (RNase B) with N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich) was chosen as the standard substrate glycoprotein and subjected to cleavage by PNGase F (New England Biolabs) and the candidate protein. The oligosaccharides cleaved by the two enzymes were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (17.Zhang W. Wang H. Tang H. Yang P.

For each reaction, 100 μg of RNase B in ammonium bicarbonate reaction buffer was denatured in a 95 °C water bath for 10 min and then mixed with 90 μl of PBS containing 5 μg of PNGase F and the purified candidate protein in separate vials. The digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 12 h, and the released glycans were collected by ultrafiltration using a filter with a molecular weight cut-off of 3000 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 2683 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. One microliter of the filtered solution was deposited on the MALDI plate with 1 μl of saturated 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid using the dried droplet method for MS analysis. Profiling of the glycans was performed in the positive ion reflectron mode in an AXIMA MALDI-quadrupole ion trap TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) using a nitrogen pulsed laser (337 nm) and an acceleration voltage of 20 kV (17.Zhang W.

The enzymatic activity was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A panel of representative substrate N-glycoproteins, including RNase B with N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides, ovalbumin with N-linked hybrid oligosaccharides, human IgG with N-linked complex oligosaccharides (provided by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with α→1,3 core-fucosylated oligosaccharides (which is resistant to PNGase F digestion; Biodee Biotechnology, Beijing, China) were selected for use in this study. Glycoprotein (10 mg/ml) dissolved in ultrapure water (native substrate) or heat-denatured at 100 °C for 10 min (denatured substrate) was assayed. All reactions were conducted in 10 mm PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 12 h. The treated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Periodic acid-Schiff staining was applied for positive and negative detection of the glycosylated substrate and deglycosylated product, respectively. Denatured HRP was treated with PNGase F and PNGase F-II separately in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 12 h and separated by electrophoresis. The gel was cut into two halves; one half was stained using Coomassie Blue for protein detection, and the other half was stained using periodic acid-Schiff reagent, according to the instructions provided in the glycoprotein staining kit manual (Thermo Scientific Pierce). Western blot using anti-HRP polyclonal antibodies (LifeSpan BioSciences) was performed to verify the HRP protein. The digestion of α→1,3 core-fucosylated asparagine oligosaccharide by PNGase F-II was verified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Selenomethionine (Se-Met)-substituted PNGase F-II was obtained by expressing the protein in M9 medium supplemented with 60 mg/liter Se-Met (Sigma-Aldrich). Se-Met PNGase F-II was purified as described above, except that 1 mm DTT was added to the gel filtration buffer. Se-Met PNGase F-II (15 mg/ml) was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C. The optimized crystallization condition contained 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 0.01 m MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, and 0.05 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Native PNGase F-II crystals were obtained in a crystallization condition comprising 12% PEG 3350 and 0.1 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in the mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the BL17U beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. All diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of native PNGase F-II was determined by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of PNGBf (B. fragilis; Protein Data Bank code 3KS7) as the search model. The crystal structure for Se-Met PNGase F-II was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of native PNGase F-II as the search model. All of the structures were displayed using the PyMOL molecular graphics system (version 1.4.1). All structural refinement was carried out using the REFMAC5 program of the CCP4 suite (21.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13864) Google Scholar). Five percent of the data were randomly selected and set aside for free R-factor cross-validation calculations. 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps were used for manual rebuilding of the peptide chain as well as for the addition of solvent molecules using COOT (22.Emsley P.

Open table in a new tab To further define the function of the catalytic domain of PNGase F-II, a similar procedure was applied for the cloning, expression, and purification of PNGase F-IIΔNBL (residues 184–537, without the NBL domain). The mutant gene was amplified by PCR using the following primer pair (5′-atccatgggaaagagcagatttatcactattcctg-3′ and 5′-acctcgagctattcttgccctaagagaacg-3′). The amplified product was inserted between the NcoI and XhoI cloning sites on the pET28a plasmid. The constructed expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the transformants were cultured at 37 °C for 12 h in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The enzymatic activity of the mutant protein PNGase F-II-ΔNBL was subjected to the same assays applied for PNGase F-II. FMS-007 is a clinical strain of E. meningoseptica that was isolated from the sputum collected from a T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient; its whole genome sequence (comprising 3,938,967 base pairs in one contig) was obtained in 2012. Bioinformatics analysis of the genome led to the identification of an ORF with a mature protein of 537 amino acids plus a signal peptide of 30 amino acids. The protein contained a domain with unknown function at the N terminus (residues 1–170) followed by a PNGase F domain (PNGF domain; residues 184–537). The protein was named PNGase F-II. The pngF-II gene (FMSX7GL000700) was localized in the Scaffold1:749867–751570 (−) of the genome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of the PNGF domain with other PNGase (both published and predicted) in GenBankTM revealed that the proteins could be divided into two separate clades, with PNGase F in one clade and the newly predicted PNGase in the other (Fig. 1C). Clade-specific conserved amino acids were also identified from the alignment (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that the candidate protein might have PNGase activity distinct from that reported for well characterized PNGase F protein. The profile of the released glycans from RNase B (Fig. 2A) was compared with that obtained for the PNGase F control (Fig. 2B). The result generated by PNGase F was consistent with that reported in previous studies (23.van Hoek A.N. Wiener M.C. Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Verkman A.S. Purification and structure-function analysis of native, PNGase F-treated, and endo-β-galactosidase-treated CHIP28 water channels.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2212-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The glycans released by the candidate protein were identical to the ones produced by PNGase F (Fig. 2). This result indicated that the putative PNGase has activity similar to that of PNGase F; they both hydrolyzed the glycan moiety in the innermost N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from denatured RNase B. Therefore, the candidate protein was named PNGase F-II. To define the substrate specificity of PNGase F-II, three representative glycoproteins with N-linked glycans (RNase B (high mannose type), ovalbumin (hybrid type), and IgG (complex type)) were digested with PNGase F-II and PNGase F. Substrate digestion was verified by the downward shift of the substrate glycoprotein band observed on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). The results revealed that PNGase F-II could release N-linked glycans from denatured but not native RNase B and ovalbumin (Fig. 3, A1 and A2), whereas PNGase F could cleave both denatured and native substrates (Fig. 3, B1 and B2). Both enzymes were more active toward native IgG than toward denatured IgG (Fig. 3, A3 and B3). To further distinguish the activities of PNGase F-II and PNGase F, plant N-glycoprotein HRP was used as the substrate in the deglycosylation assay. HRP contains α→1,3 core-fucosylated glycans and is known to be resistant to PNGase F digestion (24.Tretter V. Altmann F. März L. Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F cannot release glycans with fucose attached α1→3 to the asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue.Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). When heat-denatured HRP was treated with PNGase F-II and PNGase F, a band down-shifted to an approximate size of 35 kDa was detected only for the PNGase F-II-treated sample (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis indicated that anti-HRP antibodies recognized the down-shifted band. To confirm that the down-shifted band was a deglycosylated product of PNGase F-II digestion, the proteins on the gel were subjected to glycoprotein staining. The 35 kDa band was negative for glycan staining, whereas the intact HRP band stained positive (Fig. 4A). The glycans released from HRP on PNGase F-II digestion were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS; the resultant profile was consistent with the reported N-glycan profile for HRP (25.Yang B.Y. Gray J.S. Montgomery R. The glycans of horseradish peroxidase.Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 287: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because PNGase F does not show activity toward proteins with α→1,3 core fucosylation, the digestion of HRP by PNGase F-II indicated that PNGase F-II might have a function distinct from that of PNGase F. PNGase F-II, crystallized in two different space groups, C2 (Fig. 5, A and B) and P21 (Fig. 5, C and D). Native PNGase F-II crystallized in the P21 space group with four molecules in the asymmetric unit; the crystals diffracted x-rays to a resolution of 2.8 Å. Se-Met PNGase F-II crystallized in the C2 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit; the crystals diffracted x-rays to a resolution of 1.9 Å. The crystal structures of both forms were solved by molecular replacement. Because the structures of both forms were identical, the Se-Met PNGase F-II structure was used as the reference structure for all structural analyses. The structure of PNGase F-II contained two spatially independent domains, an N-terminal bowl-like (NBL) domain with unknown function (residues 1–170; Fig. 5A) and a core catalytic domain. The bridge between the NBL domain and the PNGF domain was a “linker” α-helix. In the P21 space group (native PNGase F-II), there were four molecules in the asymmetric unit: chains A, B, C, and D (Fig. 5C). These four chains and the single chain in the C2 asymmetric unit (Se-Met PNGase F-II) shared a common structure with minor differences. Structural alignment of the five different chains revealed that the “linker” α-helix might function to provide flexibility (Fig. 5D) between the two domains. Chains B and C of the P21 space group had the same structure, whereas chains A, D, and Se-Met PNGase F-II showed minor variations. When the PNGF domains of chains A, D, and Se-Met PNGase-II were aligned with that of chain B/C as the reference molecule, the NBL domains of chains A, D, and Se-Met PNGase-II were shifted by 9.2, 11.9, and 17.6°, respectively, from the “linker” α helix. Thus, the “linker” α-helix may play a role in coordinating the location of the NBL domain with respect to the PNGF domain. The hexahistidine tag and the bound Zn2+ at the C terminus were derived from the pET28a expression vector. Like all of the other PNGases, the core catalytic domain of PNGase F-II consists of two eight-stranded antiparallel β sheets, PNGF-N (β1 and β4–10) and PNGF-C (β11–15 and β17–19) (Figs. 1B and 5A). These two eight-stranded antiparallel β sandwiches lie side by side with parallel principal axes. Unlike PNGase F, which contains three pairs of disulfide bonds, only one disulfide bond was detected in PNGase F-II (between Cys460 and Cys488), and these two residues were conserved in the PNGase family (Fig. 1B). The substrate-binding region of the core catalytic domain was identified by superimposing its crystal structure on the structure of PNGase F with or without a glycan product (Fig. 6, A and B; EmPNG (Protein Data Bank code 1PNF), crystal structure complexed with the product N,N′-diacetylchitobiose; EmPNG (Protein Data Bank code 1PNG), crystal structure without the product). As in PNGase F, an N-glycan-binding groove located between the two eight-stranded antiparallel β sandwiches with a negatively charged surface was identified (Fig. 6F). Previous studies indicated that the residues Asp60, Glu118, and Glu206 in EmPNG are essential for catalytic activity, with Asp60 as the primary catalytic residue (26.Kuhn P. Guan C. Cui T.

https://openalex.org/W1964187103,"Image and signal analysis applications are substantial in scientific research. Both open source and commercial packages provide a wide range of functions for image and signal analysis, which are sometimes supported very well by the communities in the corresponding fields. Commercial software packages have the major drawback of being expensive and having undisclosed source code, which hampers extending the functionality if there is no plugin interface or similar option available. However, both variants cannot cover all possible use cases and sometimes custom developments are unavoidable, requiring open source applications. In this paper we describe IQM, a completely free, portable and open source (GNU GPLv3) image and signal analysis application written in pure Java. IQM does not depend on any natively installed libraries and is therefore runnable out-of-the-box. Currently, a continuously growing repertoire of 50 image and 16 signal analysis algorithms is provided. The modular functional architecture based on the three-tier model is described along the most important functionality. Extensibility is achieved using operator plugins, and the development of more complex workflows is provided by a Groovy script interface to the JVM. We demonstrate IQM’s image and signal processing capabilities in a proof-of-principle analysis and provide example implementations to illustrate the plugin framework and the scripting interface. IQM integrates with the popular ImageJ image processing software and is aiming at complementing functionality rather than competing with existing open source software. Machine learning can be integrated into more complex algorithms via the WEKA software package as well, enabling the development of transparent and robust methods for image and signal analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1977173329,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently one of the top lethal cancers with an increasing trend. Deregulation of MYC in HCC is frequently detected and always correlated with poor prognosis. As the zebrafish genome contains two differentially expressed zebrafish myc orthologs, myca and mycb, it remains unclear about the oncogenicity of the two zebrafish myc genes. In the present study, we developed two transgenic zebrafish lines to over-express myca and mycb respectively in the liver using a mifepristone-inducible system and found that both myc genes were oncogenic. Moreover, the transgenic expression of myca in hepatocytes caused robust liver tumors with several distinct phenotypes of variable severity. ~5% of myca transgenic fish developing multinodular HCC with cirrhosis after 8 months of induced myca expression. Apoptosis was also observed with myca expression; introduction of homozygous tp53-/- mutation into the myca transgenic fish reduced apoptosis and accelerated tumor progression. The malignant status of hepatocytes was dependent on continued expression of myca; withdrawal of the mifepristone inducer resulted in a rapid regression of liver tumors, and the tumor regression occurred even in the tp53-/- mutation background. Thus, our data demonstrated the robust oncogenicity of zebrafish myca and the requirement of sustained Myc overexpression for maintenance of the liver tumor phenotype in this transgenic model. Furthermore, tumor regression is independent of the function of Tp53."
https://openalex.org/W2124336160,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are abundant in complex organisms. Due to their promiscuous nature and their ability to adopt several conformations IDPs constitute important points of network regulation. The family of Brain Expressed and X-linked (Bex) proteins consists of 5 members in humans (Bex1-5). Recent reports have implicated Bex proteins in transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration, cancer, cell cycle and tumor growth. However, structural and biophysical data for this protein family is almost non-existent. We used bioinformatics analyses to show that Bex proteins contain long regions of intrinsic disorder which are conserved across all members. Moreover, we confirmed the intrinsic disorder by circular dichroism spectroscopy of Bex1 after expression and purification in E. coli. These observations strongly suggest that Bex proteins constitute a new group of IDPs. Based on these findings, together with the demonstrated promiscuity of Bex proteins and their involvement in different signaling pathways, we propose that Bex family members play important roles in the formation of protein network hubs."
https://openalex.org/W2000887954,"Serotonergic neurotransmission is modulated by the membrane-embedded serotonin transporter (SERT). SERT mediates the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neurons. Conformational changes in SERT occur upon binding of ions and substrate and are crucial for translocation of serotonin across the membrane. Our understanding of these conformational changes is mainly based on crystal structures of a bacterial homolog in various conformations, derived homology models of eukaryotic neurotransmitter transporters, and substituted cysteine accessibility method of SERT. However, the dynamic changes that occur in the human SERT upon binding of ions, the translocation of substrate, and the role of cholesterol in this interplay are not fully elucidated. Here we show that serotonin induces a dualistic conformational response in SERT. We exploited the substituted cysteine scanning method under conditions that were sensitized to detect a more outward-facing conformation of SERT. We found a novel high affinity outward-facing conformational state of the human SERT induced by serotonin. The ionic requirements for this new conformational response to serotonin mirror the ionic requirements for translocation. Furthermore, we found that membrane cholesterol plays a role in the dualistic conformational response in SERT induced by serotonin. Our results indicate the existence of a subpopulation of SERT responding differently to serotonin binding than hitherto believed and that membrane cholesterol plays a role in this subpopulation of SERT."

These differences could influence driving performance, but the influence of morningness-eveningness preference on driving behavior and accident risk has not been comprehensively studied. As morningness-eveningness preference is associated with personality characteristics, we also investigated how the interaction between morningness-eveningness preference and personality may be related to dangerous driving behaviors. Two hundred and ninety five drivers completed the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the Dula Dangerous Driving Index, and personality scales for agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism, and reported demographic information (gender, age, level of education, driving years and annual average driving mileage) and self-reported traffic violations (accidents, penalty points and fines). The results showed that more Risky Driving, Aggressive Driving, Negative Cognitive/Emotional Driving and Drunk Driving, as measured by the Dula Dangerous Driving Index, were all significantly correlated with more eveningness, corresponding to lower scores on the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Moreover, eveningness was correlated with self-reported traffic accidents, penalty points and fines. Furthermore, a moderation effect was found: eveningness was more strongly associated with risky driving and negative emotional driving in those who scored high for trait agreeableness."
https://openalex.org/W2060764319,"The sequence, activity, and antigenicity of TcdB varies between different strains of Clostridium difficile. As a result, ribotype-specific forms of TcdB exhibit different toxicities and are not strongly cross-neutralized. Using a combination of biochemical and immunological approaches, we compared two important variants of TcdB (TcdB012 and TcdB027) to identify the mechanisms through which sequence differences alter epitopes and activity of the toxin. These analyses led to the discovery of a critical variation in the 1753–1851 (B2′) region of TcdB, which affects the exposure of neutralizing epitopes in the toxin. Sequence comparisons found that the B2′ region exhibits only 77% identity and is the most variable sequence between the two forms of TcdB. A combination of biochemical, analytical, and mutagenesis experiments revealed that the B2′ region promotes protein-protein interactions. These interactions appear to shield neutralizing epitopes that would otherwise be exposed in the toxin, an event found to be less prominent in TcdB012 due to sequence differences in the 1773–1780 and 1791–1798 regions of the B2′ domain. When the carboxyl-terminal domains of TcdB012 and TcdB027 are swapped, neutralization experiments suggest that the amino terminus of TcdB interacts with the B2′ region and impacts the exposure of neutralizing epitopes in the carboxyl terminus. Collectively, these data suggest that variations in the B2′ region affect protein-protein interactions within TcdB and that these interactions influence the exposure of neutralizing epitopes.

Variations in TcdB activity and the hypervirulence of emerging strains of Clostridium difficile.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001061Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Earlier findings from our group suggested that conformational variations may influence the differences in toxicity between the two forms of TcdB. For example, experiments found that TcdB produced by the hypervirulent C. difficile 027 ribotype (TcdB027) undergoes unfolding and exposure of hydrophobic domains at a higher acidic pH than TcdB produced by the less virulent C. difficile ribotype (termed TcdB012 herein and representative of several historical ribotypes, such as 001, 003, 012, and 087) (22Lanis J.M. Barua S. Ballard J.D. Variations in TcdB activity and the hypervirulence of emerging strains of Clostridium difficile.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001061Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown TcdB027, but not TcdB012, adopts a structure where the CPD is occluded from external labeling by a substrate-based fluorescent probe (21Lanis J.M. Hightower L.D. Shen A. Ballard J.D. TcdB from hypervirulent Clostridium difficile exhibits increased efficiency of autoprocessing.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 84: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This conformational difference corresponds with more efficient autoprocessing by TcdB027. As a result, TcdB027 appears to intoxicate cells more efficiently than TcdB012 (21Lanis J.M. Hightower L.D. Shen A. Ballard J.D. TcdB from hypervirulent Clostridium difficile exhibits increased efficiency of autoprocessing.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 84: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Lanis J.M. Barua S. Ballard J.D. Variations in TcdB activity and the hypervirulence of emerging strains of Clostridium difficile.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001061Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Corresponding to the sequence differences and possible variations in structure, we also reported that rabbit polyclonal antisera recognizing the carboxyl-terminal domains (residues 1652–2366) of TcdB027 and TcdB012 do not strongly cross-neutralize (20Lanis J.M. Heinlen L.D. James J.A. Ballard J.D. Clostridium difficile 027/BI/NAP1 encodes a hypertoxic and antigenically variable form of TcdB.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003523Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which substantial conformational differences, rather than more subtle sequence variation in specific epitopes, limits cross-neutralization is not known. In the current study, we show that the carboxyl-terminal domain of TcdB027 is prone to intermolecular interactions and forms a higher order complex, which precludes the exposure of neutralizing epitopes through a process we termed “epitope cloaking.” Cloaking appears to require a distinct 98-residue domain, which exhibits only 77% identity between the two forms of the toxin. These findings support a model in which TcdB027 exists in a conformation that can both impact toxicity and the exposure of neutralizing epitopes. Native TcdB was produced by culturing C. difficile (VPI 10463 or NAP1/BI/027) with the dialysis method as described previously (22Lanis J.M. Barua S. Ballard J.D. Variations in TcdB activity and the hypervirulence of emerging strains of Clostridium difficile.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001061Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). From these cultures, supernatants were isolated, and TcdA was removed by a thyroglobulin affinity chromatography protocol. After removing TcdA, TcdB was purified using anion exchange (Q-Sepharose) chromatography in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mm CaCl2. This method yields pure native TcdB, as demonstrated by a single 270 kDa band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant TcdB was expressed and purified in a Bacillus megaterium system (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) as described previously by others (23Yang G. Zhou B. Wang J. He X. Sun X. Nie W. Tzipori S. Feng H. Expression of recombinant Clostridium difficile toxin A and B in Bacillus megaterium.BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The tcdB027 gene was amplified from C. difficile genomic DNA and cloned into the B. megaterium expression plasmid (pC-His1622) between the BsrGI and NgoMIV restriction sites. The tcdB012 gene in pC-His1622 was a gift from B. Lacy. Hybrid forms of TcdB were generated where the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 1668–2366) of each toxin was swapped. This resulted in TcdB012 that had the carboxyl terminus from TcdB027 (TcdB012/B2′B3027) and TcdB027 that had the carboxyl terminus from TcdB012 (TcdB027/B2′B3012). To perform this switch, a BspEI site was engineered into both the tcdB012 and tcdB027 genes in the pC-His1622 plasmid. This BspEI site was created between nucleotides 4996 and 5001 by changing a single nucleotide with the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). This nucleotide substitution did not alter the amino acid sequence of either TcdB012 or TcdB027. After creating this restriction site, both tcdB012 and tcdB027 were digested with BsrGI and BspEI, which created a fragment containing the amino terminus of TcdB (amino acids 1–1667). TcdB027/B2′B3012 was generated when the segment of DNA containing the amino terminus of TcdB027 was ligated into pC-His1622-TcdB012 that had the amino terminus removed by digesting with BsrGI and BspEI. TcdB012/B2′B3027 was produced using a similar method. DNA sequencing was used to confirm the construction of TcdB027/B2′B3012 and TcdB012/B2′B3027. To express recombinant TcdB, pC-His1622-TcdB was transformed into B. megaterium following the manufacturer's instructions (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany). After selecting for TcdB-positive clones, B. megaterium containing pC-His1622-TcdB was grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml tetracycline. The culture were grown to an A600 of 0.3 and then induced for 5 h with 0.5% d-xylose. After induction, cells were isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The cells were then lysed, and TcdB was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. After elution, TcdB was buffer-exchanged into a storage buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE analysis of purity demonstrated that recombinant TcdB was ∼90% pure. The B2′B3-encoding region of the tcdB gene (nucleotides 4961–7111; amino acids 1651–2366) from ribotype 012 or 027 was codon-optimized for Escherichia coli and cloned into pET15b expression plasmid (20Lanis J.M. Heinlen L.D. James J.A. Ballard J.D. Clostridium difficile 027/BI/NAP1 encodes a hypertoxic and antigenically variable form of TcdB.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003523Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). From these clones, PCR was used to amplify the regions encoding the B3 and the 1751–1852 fragment. These PCR products were cloned into the pENTR vector (Invitrogen) and transferred into expression vectors by a recombination reaction using LR Clonase (Invitrogen). The expression vectors used to express these carboxyl-terminal fragments were pET61Dest (EMD Millipore) and pDest17 (Invitrogen). The B2′B3 mutants described in the legend to Fig. 1 were generated in pET15b-B2′B3 using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). To express and purify these proteins, E. coli (BL21 star DE3; Invitrogen) were transformed with pET15b-B2′B3, pET61Dest-B3, or pDest17–1752-1853. Then cultures of the transformed E. coli were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with 300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 16 °C. These proteins were then purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and were ∼90% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant GTD was produced by using PCR to amplify the regions encoding GTD from the tcdB012 or tcdB027 gene codon optimized for E. coli. These PCR products were cloned into the pENTR vector (Invitrogen) and transferred into the pDest15 (Invitrogen) expression vectors using LR Clonase (Invitrogen). The pDest15 vector allowed for the expression of the GTD with an amino-terminal GST tag in E. coli. After transforming the pDest15-GTD into E. coli (BL21 star DE3; Invitrogen), cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with 300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 16 °C. From these cultures, the GST fusion protein was isolated via affinity chromatography using glutathione-Superflow agarose (Pierce). SDS-PAGE was used to demonstrate that ∼90% purity was achieved. These assays use the ability of TcdB to reduce CHO cell viability as a method to quantify TcdB neutralization. The antiserum used in these assays was produced by immunizing rabbits with B2′B3012. In these experiments, CHO cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 6% CO2 with F12-K containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to these assays, CHO cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. In these assays, TcdB was combined with a 1:100 dilution of serum in culture medium and incubated for 30 min before adding this mixture to cells. The toxin-exposed cells were incubated for 24 h, and cell viability was measured by the CCK-8 assay (Sigma), a WST-8 dye-based colorimetric reaction. In the blocking assays, the antiserum was incubated for 30 min with B2′B3, and then toxin was added. The incubation was continued for another 30 min, and then the incubation was added to CHO cells to assess neutralization. For examining the potential linear epitope (positions 1773–1780), this blocking assay was performed using a 19-amino acid peptide spanning residues 1769–1787 of TcdB012. This peptide was synthesized and purified to 95% by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The B2′B3 or B3 fragment was cross-linked using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), which is a water-soluble homobifunctional cross-linking agent that reacts with primary amine groups. The cross-linking reaction was performed with 35 μm purified proteins and 700 μm BS3 in a buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 500 mm NaCl. The reaction proceeded for 30 min at 25 °C and then was quenched with 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0. To perform gel filtration, 300 μg of purified protein was loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 250 μl/min. Chromatography was performed in a buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 500 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Protein standards (Bio-Rad) were run under the same conditions in order to gauge the retention times of the proteins analyzed in these experiments. In these experiments, 2 μm His-tagged B2′B3 was combined with 450 nm native TcdB (no tag) in 50 μl of a buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20 (binding buffer). These proteins were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then cobalt-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Invitrogen) were added in order to isolate His-tagged proteins. After incubating for 5 min, the magnetic beads were separated from the input and washed three times in binding buffer. The pulled down proteins were eluted in binding buffer with 300 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A similar method was utilized to examine binding between His-tagged B2′B3 and GST-tagged GTD. Densitometry analysis of Coomassie-stained bands was carried out on digitized images using ImageJ version 1.37 software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). The thermal stability (Tm) of purified B2′B3012 and B2′B3027 was determined by combining these proteins with SYPRO Orange and performing protein melt reactions. SYPRO Orange increases fluorescence emission by binding to hydrophobic regions of proteins that become exposed during temperature-induced unfolding. In these experiments, an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system was used to monitor fluorescence emission of the protein/dye mixture as temperature was stepped from 25 to 99 °C. These reactions were performed in quadruplicate with 0.5 mg/ml protein in a buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 137 mm NaCl. The Tm was determined by plotting the first derivative of fluorescence versus temperature and then locating the temperature at the midpoint of the transition from folded to unfolded. Fig. 1A shows an overview of the primary structure and domain organization of TcdB. A nomenclature consistent with its characteristics as a single polypeptide A-B toxin was adopted in this study. The GTD is labeled as the A domain, and the remainder of the protein is labeled as subdomains of the B fragment, which constitute the putative cell-binding, autoprocessing, and pore-forming domains of the toxin. The overall sequence identity between TcdB027 and TcdB012 is 92% (22Lanis J.M. Barua S. Ballard J.D. Variations in TcdB activity and the hypervirulence of emerging strains of Clostridium difficile.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001061Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, the level of identity among the different domains of the toxin ranges from 88 to 96%, with the least amount of consensus sequence found in the carboxyl-terminal portion (B2′B3) (Fig. 1A). The B2′ region shows 77% identity, and shorter regions reveal patches of sequence in the B2′ region with little or no identity. For example, the 1773–1810 region exhibits 17 residue differences (55% identity), including a smaller (residues 1791–1798) region with 6 of 7 residues that differ between the two forms of the toxin (Fig. 1C). Our previous work found that the B2′B3 region of TcdB027 does not generate neutralizing antibodies against either form of the toxin, although the same region of TcdB012 does induce protection against TcdB012 but not against TcdB027 (20Lanis J.M. Heinlen L.D. James J.A. Ballard J.D. Clostridium difficile 027/BI/NAP1 encodes a hypertoxic and antigenically variable form of TcdB.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003523Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the same study, solid phase ELISA analysis using synthetic peptides found distinct differences in reactive epitopes between the two forms of TcdB. Interestingly, the sequences of many of these epitopes were identical or nearly identical in the two forms of TcdB yet were only reactive in one form of the toxin and not the other. Because of this, we hypothesized that the B2′B3 region of TcdB existed in distinct conformational states that led to significant differences in the exposed epitopes. In the initial set of experiments, biochemical differences between B2′B3012 and B2′B3027 were examined. First, the thermal stability of the B2′B3012 and B2′B3027 was measured using differential scanning fluorimetry. These experiments revealed that B2′B3012 had a Tm value of 49.9 °C, whereas B2′B3027 had a Tm value of 44.3 °C (Fig. 1B). These differences in the Tm values suggested that the two forms of B2′B3 have distinct biochemical properties. These biochemical properties were further explored using both cross-linking and gel filtration approaches. As shown in Fig. 2, the B2′B3 domains of TcdB027 and TcdB012 were treated with the cross-linker BS3, and the reaction was examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) or SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) (Fig. 2B). As shown by SDS-PAGE analysis, the B2′B3 fragments formed higher order complexes in the presence, but not in the absence, of the cross-linker (Fig. 2A). A comparison of B2′B3027 and B2′B3012 revealed that the multimers formed by B2′B3027 were more extensive than those formed by B2′B3012 (Fig. 2A). Cross-linked B2′B3012 formed bands that migrated as dimers, tetramers, and other multimers, whereas the majority of cross-linked B2′B3027 was too large to enter the gel (Fig. 2A). Because cross-linked B2′B3027 formed a large complex that could not be resolved by SDS-PAGE, SDS-AGE was used to evaluate the cross-linked form of B2′B3027. As shown by SDS-AGE, cross-linked B2′B3027 migrated more slowly through this gel than cross-linked B2′B3012 (Fig. 2B). The same cross-linking procedure was applied to the B3 domain to determine whether the B2′ region was necessary for multimer formation. Results from this experiment revealed that the isolated B3 regions did not form substantial higher order complexes in the presence of cross-linker (Fig. 2). These data suggest that B2′B3027 could exist in a substantially higher order complex than B2′B3012 because of sequence differences in the B2′ region. To examine multimer formation more closely, the next set of experiments used gel filtration (GF) to follow multimer formation in solution and examine the effects of mutating candidate residues in the B2′ region of B2′B3012. In line with the cross-linking data, neither B3 domain formed a higher order complex (Fig. 3, A and B), and only a small amount of B2′B3012 was able to multimerize (Fig. 3C). However, GF analysis revealed that all of the B2′B3027 eluted in the void volume (Fig. 3D), which is indicative of a high order complex larger than 600 kDa. Experiments were next performed to determine whether specific B2′027 residues involved in multimerization could be identified. To accomplish this, select mutants (summarized in Fig. 1C) were generated wherein residues in B2′B3012 were replaced with the corresponding sequence from B2′027 (Fig. 3, E–H). Although none of the mutants exhibited a GF profile identical to that of B2′B3027, GF analysis revealed that three of the four mutants (B2′mut1, B2′mut2, and B2′mut5) had either minor or major peaks indicative of complexes larger than observed with B2′B3012. Additionally, these mutants were analyzed by BS3 cross-linking, and increased multimerization was also observed in B2′mut1, B2′mut2, and B2′mut5 (Fig. 3J). Finally, candidate residues in B2′B3027 were mutated to alanines (Fig. 1C) and examined to determine whether this decreased multimer formation. As shown by GF, alanine substitutions at the target residues in B2′B3027 reduced the ability of B2′B3027 to form multimers (Fig. 3I). Collectively, these data suggest that amino acids 1773–1780 (B2′mut1 and B2′mut6) and 1791–1798 (B2′mut2) help support multimerization in B2′B3027. The data shown in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 indicate that purified B2′B3027 exists in a higher order complex that is dependent on a set of residues in the B2′ region. We next asked whether these differences in complex formation might impact the exposure of neutralizing epitopes. To identify regions targeted by neutralizing antibodies, we utilized an assay (Fig. 4) in which B2′B3 fragments were assessed for their ability to block neutralizing antiserum. Specifically, polyclonal rabbit serum raised against B2′B3012 (αB2′B3012), which we had previously reported to neutralize TcdB012, was incubated with the entire B2′B3012 region (residues 1652–2366) or the B3 region (residues 1853–2366) to adsorb antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2052916580,"Naevus count is the strongest risk factor for melanoma. Body Mass Index (BMI) has been linked to melanoma risk. In this study, we investigate the link between naevus count and height, weight and bone mineral density (BMD) in the TwinsUK cohort (N = 2119). In addition we adjusted for leucocyte telomere length (LTL) as LTL is linked to both BMD and naevus count. Naevus count was positively associated with height (p = 0.001) but not with weight (p = 0.187) despite adjusting for age and twin relatedness. This suggests that the previously reported melanoma association with BMI may be explained by height alone. Further adjustment for LTL did not affect the significance of the association between height and naevus count so LTL does not fully explain these results. BMD was associated with naevus count at the spine (coeff 18.9, p = 0.01), hip (coeff = 18.9, p = 0.03) and forearm (coeff = 32.7, p = 0.06) despite adjusting for age, twin relatedness, weight, height and LTL. This large study in healthy individuals shows that growth via height, probably in early life, and bone mass are risk factors for melanoma via increased naevus count. The link between these two phenotypes may possibly be explained by telomere biology, differentiation genes from the neural crests but also other yet unknown factors which may influence both bones and melanocytes biology."
https://openalex.org/W1967171257,"The analgesic efficacy of opioids is well known to vary widely among individuals, and various factors related to individual differences in opioid sensitivity have been identified. However, a prediction model to calculate appropriate opioid analgesic requirements has not yet been established. The present study sought to construct prediction formulas for individual opioid analgesic requirements based on genetic polymorphisms and clinical data from patients who underwent cosmetic orthognathic surgery and validate the utility of the prediction formulas in patients who underwent major open abdominal surgery.To construct the prediction formulas, we performed multiple linear regression analyses using data from subjects who underwent cosmetic orthognathic surgery. The dependent variable was 24-h postoperative or perioperative fentanyl use, and the independent variables were age, gender, height, weight, pain perception latencies (PPL), and genotype data of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To examine the utility of the prediction formulas, we performed simple linear regression analyses using subjects who underwent major open abdominal surgery. Actual 24-h postoperative or perioperative analgesic use and the predicted values that were calculated using the multiple regression equations were incorporated as dependent and independent variables, respectively.Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the four SNPs, PPL, and weight were retained as independent predictors of 24-h postoperative fentanyl use (R² = 0.145, P = 5.66 × 10⁻¹⁰) and the two SNPs and weight were retained as independent predictors of perioperative fentanyl use (R² = 0.185, P = 1.99 × 10⁻¹⁵). Simple linear regression analyses showed that the predicted values were retained as an independent predictor of actual 24-h postoperative analgesic use (R² = 0.033, P = 0.030) and perioperative analgesic use (R² = 0.100, P = 1.09 × 10⁻⁴), respectively.We constructed prediction formulas, and the possible utility of these prediction formulas was found in another type of surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2079548084,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adding a low-dose β1-blocker to milrinone improves cardiac function in failing cardiomyocytes and the underlying cardioprotective mechanism.The molecular mechanism underlying how the combination of low-dose β1-blocker and milrinone affects intracellular Ca(2+) handling in heart failure remains unclear.We investigated the effect of milrinone plus landiolol on intracellular Ca(2+) transient (CaT), cell shortening (CS), the frequency of diastolic Ca(2+) sparks (CaSF), and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) concentration ({Ca(2+)}SR) in normal and failing canine cardiomyocytes and used immunoblotting to determine the phosphorylation level of ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and phospholamban (PLB).In failing cardiomyocytes, CaSF significantly increased, and peak CaT and CS markedly decreased compared with normal myocytes. Administration of milrinone alone slightly increased peak CaT and CS, while CaSF greatly increased with a slight increase in {Ca(2+)}SR. Co-administration of β1-blocker landiolol to failing cardiomyocytes at a dose that does not inhibit cardiomyocyte function significantly decreased CaSF with a further increase in {Ca(2+)}SR, and peak CaT and CS improved compared with milrinone alone. Landiolol suppressed the hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 (Ser2808) in failing cardiomyocytes but had no effect on levels of phosphorylated PLB (Ser16 and Thr17). Low-dose landiolol significantly inhibited the alternans of CaT and CS under a fixed pacing rate (0.5 Hz) in failing cardiomyocytes.A low-dose β1-blocker in combination with milrinone improved cardiac function in failing cardiomyocytes, apparently by inhibiting the phosphorylation of RyR2, not PLB, and subsequent diastolic Ca(2+) leak."
https://openalex.org/W2093217480,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with accelerated cardiovascular disease and heart failure. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) Glu298Asp single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype has been associated with a worse phenotype amongst patients with established heart failure and in patients with progression of their renal disease. The association of a cardiac functional difference in non-dialysis CKD patients with no known previous heart failure, and eNOS gene variant is investigated. Methods 140 non-dialysis CKD patients, who had cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and tissue doppler echocardiography as part of two clinical trials, were genotyped for eNOS Glu298Asp SNP retrospectively. Results The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 50mls/min and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 74% with no overt diastolic dysfunction in this cohort. There were significant differences in LVEF across eNOS genotypes with GG genotype being associated with a worse LVEF compared to other genotypes (LVEF: GG 71%, TG 76%, TT 73%, p = 0.006). After multivariate analysis, (adjusting for age, eGFR, baseline mean arterial pressure, contemporary CMR heart rate, total cholesterol, high sensitive C-reactive protein, body mass index and gender) GG genotype was associated with a worse LVEF, and increased LV end-diastolic and systolic index (p = 0.004, 0.049 and 0.009 respectively). Conclusions eNOS Glu298Asp rs1799983 polymorphism in CKD patients is associated with relevant sub-clinical cardiac remodelling as detected by CMR. This gene variant may therefore represent an important genetic biomarker, and possibly highlight pathways for intervention, in these patients who are at particular risk of worsening cardiac disease as their renal dysfunction progresses."
https://openalex.org/W2016588493,"We assessed the reactivity of Sb(V) in human blood. Sb(V) reactivity was determined using an HPLC-HG-AFS hyphenated system. Sb(V) was partially reduced to Sb(III) in blood incubation experiments; however, Sb(III) was a highly unstable species. The addition of 0.1 mol L(-1) EDTA prevented Sb(III) oxidation, thus enabling the detection of the reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III). The transformation of Sb(V) to Sb(III) in human whole blood was assessed because the reduction of Sb(V) in human blood may likely generate redox side effects. Our results indicate that glutathione was the reducing agent in this reaction and that Sb(V) significantly decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio from 0.32 ± 0.09 to 0.07 ± 0.03. Moreover, the presence of 200 ng mL(-1) of Sb(V) increased the activity of superoxide dismutase from 4.4 ± 0.1 to 7.0 ± 0.4 U mL(-1) and decreased the activity of glutathione peroxidase from 62 ± 1 to 34 ± 2 nmol min(-1) mL(-1)."

The maintenance of high affinity antigen-specific serum antibodies was impaired in CDH17(-/-) mice and the number of antigen-specific MBCs was reduced as compared to wild-type mice (WT). Also, specific responses to secondary antigens were ablated in CDH17(-/-) mice, whereas primary antibody responses were the same as those in WT mice. Cell cycle analysis revealed a decline in the proliferation of CDH17(-) MBCs as compared to CDH17(+) MBCs. In addition, we identified a subpopulation of splenic stromal cells, MAdCAM-1(+) blood endothelial cells (BEC), which was CDH17(+). Taken together, these results suggest that CDH17 plays a role in the long-term survival of MBCs, presumably via an ""MBC niche"" comprising, at least in part, BEC in the spleen."

The assembly and proteolytic activity of this enzyme require the correct interaction of the 19 transmembrane domains (TMDs) present in its four subunits, including presenilin (PS1 or PS2), the γ-secretase catalytic core. GXXXG and GXXXG-like motifs are critical for TMDs interactions as well as for protein folding and assembly. The GXXXG motifs on γ-secretase subunits (e.g. APH-1) or on γ-secretase substrates (e.g. APP) are known to be involved in γ-secretase assembly and in Aβ peptide production, respectively. We identified on PS1 and PS2 TMD8 two highly conserved AXXXAXXXG motifs. The presence of a mutation causing an inherited form of Alzheimer disease (familial Alzheimer disease) in the PS1 motif suggested their involvement in the physiopathological configuration of the γ-secretase complex. In this study, we targeted the role of these motifs on TMD8 of PSs, focusing on their role in PS assembly and catalytic activity. Each motif was mutated, and the impact on complex assembly, activity, and substrate docking was monitored. Different amino acid substitutions on the same motif resulted in opposite effects on γ-secretase activity, without affecting the assembly or significantly impairing the maturation of the complex. Our data suggest that AXXXAXXXG motifs in PS TMD8 are key determinants for the conformation of the mature γ-secretase complex, participating in the switch between the physiological and pathological functional conformations of the γ-secretase.

https://openalex.org/W2034473104,"Multiplex methodologies, especially those with high-throughput capabilities generate large volumes of data. Accumulation of such data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.) is fast becoming more common and thus requires the development and implementation of effective data mining strategies designed for biological and clinical applications. Multiplex microbead immunoassay (MMIA), on xMAP or MagPix platform (Luminex), which is amenable to automation, offers a major advantage over conventional methods such as Western blot or ELISA, for increasing the efficiencies in serodiagnosis of infectious diseases. MMIA allows detection of antibodies and/or antigens efficiently for a wide range of infectious agents simultaneously in host blood samples, in one reaction vessel. In the process, MMIA generates large volumes of data. In this report we demonstrate the application of data mining tools on how the inherent large volume data can improve the assay tolerance (measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity) by analysis of experimental data accumulated over a span of two years. The combination of prior knowledge with machine learning tools provides an efficient approach to improve the diagnostic power of the assay in a continuous basis. Furthermore, this study provides an in-depth knowledge base to study pathological trends of infectious agents in mouse colonies on a multivariate scale. Data mining techniques using serodetection of infections in mice, developed in this study, can be used as a general model for more complex applications in epidemiology and clinical translational research."
https://openalex.org/W1998046989,"We investigate the laws governing people’s decisions and interactions by studying the collective dynamics of a well-documented social activity for which there exist ample records of the perceived quality: the attendance to movie theaters in the US. We picture the flows of attendance as impulses or “shocks” driven by external factors that in turn can create new cascades of attendances through direct recommendations whose effectiveness depends on the perceived quality of the movies. This corresponds to an epidemic branching model comprised of a decaying exponential function determining the time between cause and action, and a cascade of actions triggered by previous ones. We find that the vast majority of the ~3,500 movies studied fit our model remarkably well. From our results, we are able to translate a subjective concept such as movie quality into a probability of the deriving individual activity, and from it we build concrete quantitative predictions. Our analysis opens up the possibility of understanding other collective dynamics for which the perceived quality or appeal of an action is also known."
