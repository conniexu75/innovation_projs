The light fraction obtainable in yields of 75’+& consists of 15oj, protein and 85% polysaccharide. It sediments as a single component and has a sedimentation constant at infinite dilution of 10.5 S. The heavy fraction, easily sedimentable, and obtainable in yields of 13oj,, consists of about 50% protein and 50% polysaccharide, and sediments completely at 10,000 X g. It is not clear whether the heavy fraction consists of a single component. Degradation of both the heavy and the light fractions with alkali appears to yield the same polysaccharide, chondroitin sulfate A. REFERENCES 1. SHATTON, J., AND SCHUBERT, M., J. Biol.

Mitochondria, microsomes, and cell sap all contribute to the methylcholanthrene effect on the incorporation of free amino acid."

https://openalex.org/W2049217557,"ULCERATED squamous cell carcinomas of the human skin frequently show a red fluorescence when examined under ultra-violet radiation1–3. This red fluorescence is usually restricted to small areas of the necrotic surface. Hitherto the substance or substances responsible for this phenomena have not been identified. This is probably due to the fact that very small amounts of material are available for study in any single case. Recently, Ghadially4 observed that experimentally produced squamous cell carcinomas of the skin of many animals show a similar red fluorescence. It seemed to us that by pooling material from a number of tumours, sufficient might be obtained for a chemical analysis. Six rabbits with large ulcerated carcinomas produced by repeated painting of the skin with a 2 per cent solution w/w of 9 : 10 dimethyl 1 : 2 benzanthracene in a mixture of equal parts of lanolin and paraffin were available for study. After many attempts, we were ultimately able to collect one large (5 gm.) pooled sample for analysis. Another large sample was obtained from a single rabbit which died as a result of a very large fungating carcinoma of the ear. Here about 5 gm. of red fluorescent debris had collected on the carcinoma and within the ear over a prolonged period of time. The results obtained in each case were essentially similar."

The secretion of attractants in virgin queens increased with age. Old virgins were as attractive as mated queens. A rapid assay for queen attractiveness is described.

Although this compound is readily incorporated into deoxyribonucleic acid in the absence of ionizing radiation, we find that whole-body exposure to as little as 10 r will significantly inhibit its incorporation."

https://openalex.org/W2042702983,"THE nerve supply to many sympathetic effector organs contains cholinergic nerve fibres as well as adrenergic fibres. Recently, the hypothesis has been put forward that a cholinergic mechanism is involved in sympathetic transmission1,2. It has been suggested that acetylcholine released from cholinergic nerve endings liberates from a local tissue store sympathetic transmitter which in turn acts on the effector organ."

Boys and girls with large-chested parents were taller and heavier during the growing period and were more advanced in skeletal development than offspring of narrow-chested parents.
