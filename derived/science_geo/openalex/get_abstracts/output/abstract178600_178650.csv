https://openalex.org/W2048258494,"To rigorously test the in vivo cell fate specificity of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we generated chimeric animals by transplantation of a single green fluorescent protein (GFP)-marked HSC into lethally irradiated nontransgenic recipients. Single HSCs robustly reconstituted peripheral blood leukocytes in these animals, but did not contribute appreciably to nonhematopoietic tissues, including brain, kidney, gut, liver, and muscle. Similarly, in GFP+:GFP- parabiotic mice, we found substantial chimerism of hematopoietic but not nonhematopoietic cells. These data indicate that ""transdifferentiation"" of circulating HSCs and/or their progeny is an extremely rare event, if it occurs at all."

The low-field drift mobility values were determined by using the time-of-flight technique on thick, intrinsic, freestanding diamond plates and were verified by current-voltage measurements on p-i junction diodes. The improvement of the electronic properties of single-crystal diamond and the reproducibility of those properties are encouraging for research on, and development of, high-performance diamond electronics."
https://openalex.org/W1986546695,"A high-resolution crystallographic analysis of the nitrogenase MoFe-protein reveals a previously unrecognized ligand coordinated to six iron atoms in the center of the catalytically essential FeMo-cofactor. The electron density for this ligand is masked in structures with resolutions lower than 1.55 angstroms, owing to Fourier series termination ripples from the surrounding iron and sulfur atoms in the cofactor. The central atom completes an approximate tetrahedral coordination for the six iron atoms, instead of the trigonal coordination proposed on the basis of lower resolution structures. The crystallographic refinement at 1.16 angstrom resolution is consistent with this newly detected component being a light element, most plausibly nitrogen. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the cofactor would have important implications for the mechanism of dinitrogen reduction by nitrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2125338577,"The higher-order assembly of chromatin imposes structural organization on the genetic information of eukaryotes and is thought to be largely determined by posttranslational modification of histone tails. Here, we study a 20-kilobase silent domain at the mating-type region of fission yeast as a model for heterochromatin formation. We find that, although histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3 Lys 9 ) directly recruits heterochromatin protein Swi6/HP1, the critical determinant for H3 Lys 9 methylation to spread in cis and to be inherited through mitosis and meiosis is Swi6 itself. We demonstrate that a centromere-homologous repeat ( cenH ) present at the silent mating-type region is sufficient for heterochromatin formation at an ectopic site, and that its repressive capacity is mediated by components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. Moreover, cenH and the RNAi machinery cooperate to nucleate heterochromatin assembly at the endogenous mat locus but are dispensable for its subsequent inheritance. This work defines sequential requirements for the initiation and propagation of regional heterochromatic domains."
https://openalex.org/W1982709334,"Previous studies have revealed that autoantibodies, complement components, and Fc receptors each participate in the pathogenesis of erosive arthritis in K/BxN mice. However, it is not known which cellular populations are responsive to these inflammatory signals. We find that two strains of mice deficient in mast cells, W/Wv and Sl/Sld, were resistant to development of joint inflammation and that susceptibility was restored in the W/Wv strain by mast cell engraftment. Thus, mast cells may function as a cellular link between autoantibodies, soluble mediators, and other effector populations in inflammatory arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2126527044,"The lead-lead isochron age of chondrules in the CR chondrite Acfer 059 is 4564.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (Ma), whereas the lead isotopic age of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) in the CV chondrite Efremovka is 4567.2 +/- 0.6 Ma. This gives an interval of 2.5 +/- 1.2 million years (My) between formation of the CV CAIs and the CR chondrules and indicates that CAI- and chondrule-forming events lasted for at least 1.3 My. This time interval is consistent with a 2- to 3-My age difference between CR CAIs and chondrules inferred from the differences in their initial 26Al/27Al ratios and supports the chronological significance of the 26Al-26Mg systematics."
https://openalex.org/W2155907836,"To examine the local actions of IGF signaling in skeletal tissue in a physiological context, we have used Cre-mediated recombination to disrupt selectively in mouse osteoblasts the gene encoding the type 1 IGF receptor (Igf1r). Mice carrying this bone-specific mutation were of normal size and weight but, in comparison with normal siblings, demonstrated a striking decrease in cancellous bone volume, connectivity, and trabecular number, and an increase in trabecular spacing. These abnormalities correlated with a striking decrease in the rate of mineralization of osteoid that occurred despite an unexpected osteoblast and osteoclast hyperactivity, detected from the significant increments in both osteoblast and erosion surfaces. Our findings indicate that IGF1 is essential for coupling matrix biosynthesis to sustained mineralization. This action is likely to be particularly important during the pubertal growth spurt when rapid bone formation and consolidation are required.

Our findings indicate that IGF1 is essential for coupling matrix biosynthesis to sustained mineralization. This action is likely to be particularly important during the pubertal growth spurt when rapid bone formation and consolidation are required. Body size and linear bone growth in mammals is affected by cellular signaling pathways controlled by growth factors and hormones (1Efstratiadis A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 955-976PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, a major growth-promoting signaling system consisting of the insulin-like growth factors (IGF, 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; AP, alkaline phosphatase IGF1 and IGF2) and the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) regulates embryonic growth, as shown by gene knockout experiments in mice (1Efstratiadis A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 955-976PubMed Google Scholar). IGF1 acting through IGF1R also plays central roles in postnatal growth either independently or by mediating growth hormone functions (2Lupu F. Terwilliger J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Signaling through the IGF1R tyrosine kinase receptor not only promotes cell proliferation, but also mediates anti-apoptotic actions (3Baserga R. Resnicoff M. D'Ambrosio C. Valentinis B. Vitam. Horm. 1997; 53: 65-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Nakae J. Kido Y. Accili D. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 818-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The IGF system includes a second receptor (IGF2R) devoid of signaling properties, but serving IGF2 turnover, and at least six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) of obscure functional significance (single and also some double mouse mutations ablating IGFBPs have not revealed as yet significant consequences in growth impairment). 2J. Pintar, personal communication. The IGFs are produced locally in various tissues, including bones, and exert autocrine/paracrine functions, but they are also present in serum, mostly associated with IGFBPs. Whether the circulating IGFs act systemically as hormones is currently controversial (5Yakar S. Liu J.L. Stannard B. Butler A. Accili D. Sauer B. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 6D'Ercole A.J. Calikoglu A.S. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2001; 11: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A number of in vitro and in vivo studies are progressively unraveling the significance of the IGF system for skeletal development and metabolic control (for a review see Ref. 7Conover C.A. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2000; 10 Suppl. B: S107-S110Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). IGF1, by stimulating the proliferation of chondrocytes in the growth plate, plays an essential role in longitudinal bone growth (2Lupu F. Terwilliger J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and is also involved in the formation of trabecular bone. In fact, chondrocytes and bone cells produce IGFs and express IGF1R (see for example Refs. 8Shinar D.M. Endo N. Halperin D. Rodan G.A. Weinreb M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 9Wang E. Wang J. Chin E. Zhou J. Bondy C.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using osteoblast culture systems have shown that IGF1 stimulates osteoblast proliferation, accelerates their differentiation, and enhances bone matrix production (10Canalis E. Bone. 1993; 14: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Birnbaum R.S. Bowsher R.R. Wiren K.M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, IGF1 is being recognized as a critical factor for bone cell survival (12Parfitt A.M. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. Hughes D.E. Boyce B.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 13Hughes D.E. Boyce B.F. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Hill P.A. Tumber A. Meikle M.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Finally, IGF1 also appears to regulate bone resorption, either directly or through its action on osteoblasts that stimulate in turn the formation and function of osteoclasts (15Hill P.A. Reynolds J.J. Meikle M.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 124-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of complex relationships in the signaling processes of the IGF regulatory system (1Efstratiadis A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 955-976PubMed Google Scholar) on one hand, and intricacies in bone development (16Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 17Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) on the other, it has been quite difficult to define individualin vivo aspects of the skeletal actions of IGF1, especially those brought about by local (autocrine/paracrine) mechanisms. Nevertheless, progress is being made with the use of genetically modified mice. For example, mice with targeted overexpression of IGF1 in osteoblasts exhibited an increased bone formation rate and increased trabecular and cortical bone volume (18Zhao G. Monier-Faugere M.C. Langub M.C. Geng Z. Nakayama T. Pike J.W. Chernausek S.D. Rosen C.J. Donahue L.R. Malluche H.H. Fagin J.A. Clemens T.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2674-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Remarkably, these changes occurred without an increase in the total number of osteoblasts, suggesting that locally produced IGF1 could exert its anabolic effects primarily by increasing the performance of resident osteoblasts. Nevertheless, firm establishment of causal relationships necessitates complete ablation of IGF signaling by elimination of IGF1R function. In this regard, however, the invariable neonatal lethality ofIgf1r nullizygous mice (19Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) precluded an examination of the skeletal role of IGF1 during postnatal growth and development. To circumvent this problem, we have now disrupted selectively theIgf1r gene in mouse osteoblasts using thecre/loxP recombination system, and evaluated the bone phenotype. As we report here, this site-specific ablation of IGF signaling impairs the rate of bone formation and severely retards mineralization of osteoid resulting in decreased cancellous bone volume and altered trabecular structure. A DNA fragment representing the human osteocalcin (OC) promoter (20Clemens T.L. Tang H. Maeda S. Kesterson R.A. DeMayo F. Pike J.W. Gundberg C.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1570-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pBluescript SK(−) vector to create pOC. A plasmid containing a cDNA encoding cre, which was modified to include a nuclear localization sequence and the human β-actin 3′-untranslated region (provided by Dr. Thomas Doetschman, University of Cincinnati), was cloned into the pKBpA plasmid (18Zhao G. Monier-Faugere M.C. Langub M.C. Geng Z. Nakayama T. Pike J.W. Chernausek S.D. Rosen C.J. Donahue L.R. Malluche H.H. Fagin J.A. Clemens T.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2674-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) downstream from a sequence representing the rabbit β-globin second intron flanked by remnants of truncated exons. The derived fused (globin-cre) sequences were then subcloned into pOC downstream from the osteocalcin promoter, to create pOC-cre (Fig. 1 A). The insert of this plasmid (OC-cre) was excised and microinjected into fertilized eggs (FVB-N mouse strain). Transgenic lines were established from 11 founders that were identified by Southern analysis of genomic DNA. Two of the transgenic lines (4 and 6) were analyzed in detail and used in our experiments (see “Results”). Differences in the level and specificity of transgenic expression between the two lines were not detected. Expression of cre mRNA was determined by Northern analysis of total RNA (10 μg per lane) using acre cDNA probe. All animals received humane care in compliance with the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. OC-cre mice were mated with homozygous conditional mutants carrying modified Igf1ralleles (with loxP sites flanking exon 3; (21Dietrich P. Dragatsis I. Xuan S. Zeitlin S. Efstratiadis A. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), to generate OC-cre/Igf1rflox/+ progeny, which were used in subsequent crosses (see “Results”). The OC-cre mice were also crossed with Z/AP reporter mice (22Lobe C.G. Koop K.E. Kreppner W. Lomeli H. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), to estimate the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination (see “Results”). For routine genotyping of progeny, thecre transgene was detected by PCR (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 53 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, for 30 cycles) using the primers: 5′-CAAATAGCCCTGGCAGATTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGATACAAGGGACATCTTCC-3′ (reverse) to generate a 260-bp product corresponding to a portion of the OC promoter and the rabbit β-globin intron. The Igf1rlocus was detected by PCR (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 61 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, for 30 cycles) with the primers 2 and 3 (see Fig. 1): 5′-CTTCCCAGCTTGCTACTCTAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGGCTTGCAATGAGACATGGG-3′ (reverse), which generate a 120-bp product from the wild-type allele or a 220-bp product from the floxed allele. To detect the recombined allele, another primer (primer 1; Fig. 1) 5′-TGAGACGTAGCGAGATTGCTGTA-3′ was used in combination with primer 3, to generate a 320-bp product. Whole-mount lacZ staining was used to genotype the Z/AP reporter mice, as described below. To determine the specificity and efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination, OC-cre mice from two Cre-expressing lines (3 and 6) were crossed with the Z/AP mice (17Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) carrying a “double reporter” transgene (see Fig. 2 A and “Results”). When recombination occurs, the LacZ site is excised, and the downstream human Hplap gene is expressed. Mice were sacrificed and organs were harvested, rinsed in PBS, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde plus 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS on ice for 2 h. For whole-mount staining, each calvarium was cut in half longitudinally, one half was used for lacZ staining and the other for AP as described (22Lobe C.G. Koop K.E. Kreppner W. Lomeli H. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For lacZ staining, the fixed samples were washed three times for 5 min in lacZ wash buffer (2 mmMgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet-P40, 5 mm EGTA in PBS). Staining was carried out in lacZ staining buffer (1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 5 mm potassium ferricyanide in lacZ wash buffer) at 37 °C for 4 h to overnight, with shaking and protection from light. After staining, samples were rinsed with PBS, post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) for 10 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and then twice with 70% ethanol prior to storage in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. For alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, the fixed calvaria were washed three times with PBS for 5 min, and then incubated in PBS at 70–75 °C for 30 min to inactivate endogenous AP. Samples were rinsed in PBS, washed in AP buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgSO4, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet-P40) for 10 min, and stained with NBT/BCIP stain (0.4 mg/ml NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium chloride), 0.19 mg/ml BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate, toluidine-salt), in AP buffer) for at least 90 min or until staining was evident. After staining, samples were washed in PBS and 70% ethanol and stored in 70% ethanol. Stained calvaria halves were dehydrated, infiltrated and embedded in paraffin. Blocks were sectioned at 10 μm, placed onto slides, and coverslipped. Non-skeletal tissues were sectioned prior to staining. Samples were washed in PBS three times for 5 min after fixation and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C and then in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. They were then embedded in OCT, sectioned, and placed onto slides. Prior to staining, slides were refixed in cold PBS containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. For lacZ staining, slides were washed three times for 5 min in lacZ wash buffer and then stained in lacZ staining buffer for 3–4 h at 37 °C, protected from light. After staining, slides were rinsed in PBS, postfixed (see above) before dehydration through a graded ethanol series and coverslipped. For AP staining, after fixation, slides were washed three times in PBS for 5 min and endogenous AP was inactivated by incubating slides in PBS at 75 °C for 30 min. Slides were then rinsed with PBS, washed in AP buffer for 10 min, and stained with NBT/BCIP stain for 5–15 min at room temperature. After staining, slides were washed in PBS, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and then coverslipped. The three-dimensional microarchitecture of the intact right femurs was evaluated using a high-resolution, desktop microtomographic imaging system (μCT20, Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) (23Ruegsegger P. Koller B. Muller R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1996; 58: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Three regions were evaluated: the entire femur, cortical bone in the mid-diaphysis, and secondary spongiosa in the distal metaphysis. For evaluation of the entire femur and mid-diaphyseal cortical bone, the bone was scanned using a 34-μm slice increment, requiring ∼100–150 μCT slices per specimen. For evaluation of the secondary spongiosa in the distal metaphysis, the bone was scanned using a 9-μm slice increment, beginning approximately at the growth plate and extending proximally for 200 CT slices. A region of interest including only cancellous bone was constructed, beginning 0.25 mm proximal to the growth plate and extending proximally for 1.25 mm. Images were reconstructed, filtered, and thresholded as previously described (24Alexander J.M. Bab I. Fish S. Muller R. Uchiyama T. Gronowicz G. Nahounou M. Zhao Q. White D.W. Chorev M. Gazit D. Rosenblatt M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The images were stored in three-dimensional arrays with an isotropic voxel size of either 34 μm (for the whole bone) or 9 μm (for the distal femoral metaphysis). Morphometric parameters were computed using a direct three-dimensional approach that does not rely on any assumptions about whether the underlying structure is either plate or rod-like (25Pfeilschifter J. Laukhuf F. Muller-Beckmann B. Blum W.F. Pfister T. Ziegler R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For the whole bone, we computed the total bone volume (BV, mm3) and the apparent volume density (AVD, %), defined as the percent of mineralized tissue volume divided by the total volume defined by the external bone envelope (24Alexander J.M. Bab I. Fish S. Muller R. Uchiyama T. Gronowicz G. Nahounou M. Zhao Q. White D.W. Chorev M. Gazit D. Rosenblatt M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For the cortical region, the bone volume (BV, mm3), bone volume density (BV/TV, %), and cortical thickness (μm) were computed in a 1-mm thick region at the mid-diaphysis. For the cancellous bone region in the distal metaphysis, bone volume density (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, μm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, μm), trabecular number (Tb.N, mm−1), and connectivity density (mm−3) were assessed. Distal femora and calvaria were fixed in 100% ethanol. After dehydration, bone samples were embedded in methyl methacrylate (26Malluche H.H. Faugere M.C. Atlas of Mineralized Bone Histology. Karger, New York1986Google Scholar), and 4-μm sections were cut with a heavy-duty microtome (Microm, C. Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). This thickness allows analysis of the same histologic features in slides prepared for light and fluorescent microscopy. Four bone sections were stained using the modified Masson-Goldner trichrome technique (27Goldner J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 14: 237-243Google Scholar), and four others serial to the stained sections were left unstained for fluorescent microscopy. Static and dynamic parameters of bone structure, formation, and resorption were measured using a semi-automatic method (Osteoplan II, Kontron, Munich, Germany) (18Zhao G. Monier-Faugere M.C. Langub M.C. Geng Z. Nakayama T. Pike J.W. Chernausek S.D. Rosen C.J. Donahue L.R. Malluche H.H. Fagin J.A. Clemens T.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2674-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 28Malluche H.H. Sherman D. Meyer W. Massry S.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In 6-week-old mice, measurements were confined to the secondary spongiosa of the distal femur to ensure that only remodeling sites were analyzed. In 3-week-old mice, measurements were made in the epiphysis due to the lack of sufficient trabecular bone in the secondary spongiosa. For dynamic endpoints, 3- and 6-week-old animals were injected with calcein intraperitoneally on days 1 and 4 and sacrificed 2 or 3 days later. All parameters comply with the recommendations of the Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (29Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4921) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. All statistical tests were two-sided. An assigned significance level of 0.05 was used. Comparability of the two groups at any given time was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Comparability of data from a group at different time points was done using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. All computations were performed using the SPSS software package for Windows release 7.5 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Tissue-specific conditional mutagenesis requires crosses between Cre-producing and Cre-responding strains of mice. Responders used in this study, in which exon 3 of theIgf1r gene is “floxed” (flanked by loxP sites in direct orientation), have been described previously (21Dietrich P. Dragatsis I. Xuan S. Zeitlin S. Efstratiadis A. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To drivecre expression in the osteoblasts of producer mice, we used the osteocalcin (OC) gene promoter and generated OC-cretransgenic mice (see “Materials and Methods”). Northern analysis demonstrated that the transgene encoding the recombinase was expressed in bones and in no other of the examined tissues (Fig.1 B). For the purposes of our experiments, it was important to demonstrate the specificity and efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination in osteoblasts. However, the floxed Igf1r allele could not serve itself as a reporter for this purpose, because the heterogeneity of skeletal tissue constituents precluded an assessment of the level of DNA excision by Southern analysis (osteoblasts represent only a minor bone component). Also unsuitable were (feasible, but difficult for bone tissue) alternative analyses, such as in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, since quantitative results could not be obtained. For these reasons, we used an indirect approach and crossed OC-cre producers with Z/AP mice (17Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) carrying a “double reporter” transgene, which consists of a sequence (βgeo) encoding β-galactosidase and a selectable marker flanked by twoloxP sites that is followed by a human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPLAP) gene (Fig.2 A). The latter gene is expressed after Cre-mediated excision of βgeo. Thus, the efficiency of Cre action can be estimated by determining in various tissues the reduction in X-gal staining and the appearance of staining for alkaline phosphatase. To determine the time of commencement of the OC-cretransgene expression during development, whole calvaria harvested from OC-cre/Z/AP embryos were stained for AP. As shown in Fig. 2 B, AP-positive cells were first detected in E17 calvaria at the primary ossification centers. Examination of sections from these calvaria revealed that the AP-positive elements were osteoblasts and osteocytes (Fig.2 C). Such sections were also stained for X-gal, to estimate the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination. Osteoblasts, osteocytes, lining cells and cells within the marrow cavities of calvaria fromZ/AP embryos consistently stained positive for X-gal and were AP-negative (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, calvaria derived from OC-cre/Z/AP double transgenics exhibited a marked reduction in X-gal staining and the appearance of AP staining in the cells of the osteoblast lineage (Fig.2 C; the latter staining was less uniform than that for X-gal, possibly due to less efficient penetration of the AP reaction reagents into the whole mount preparation). In the double transgenic embryos, cells within the marrow (likely representing derivatives of hematopoetic origin) continued to stain positive for X-gal. To also provide an approximate quantitative estimate for the degree of Cre-mediated DNA excision brought about by the OC-cretransgene (“excision index”), we counted the numbers of X-gal-positive osteoblasts and osteocytes in calvarial sections from OC-cre/Z/AP andZ/AP (control) mice (4 sections each). We found that 84.4 ± 0.7% of the cells being monitored (2752 of 3261 cells) were positive for β-galactosidase expression in the control mice, whereas the corresponding score in the double transgenic calvarial sections was only 9.8 ± 1.4% (248 of 2530 cells). Thus, the estimated excision index in osteoblasts and osteocytes was [1-(9.8/84.4)] × 100 or 88.4%. Non-skeletal tissues including bladder, heart, and skeletal muscle from the same OC-cre/Z/AP mice consistently stained positive for lacZ and negative for AP (Fig. 2 D). Moreover, PCR analysis using DNA templates from tissues of OC-cre/Igf1r flox/floxoffspring confirmed that Cre-mediated recombination occurred exclusively in bone (Fig.3 B). Despite the fact that a direct estimation of the excision index for theIgf1rflox allele in osteoblasts and osteocytes is not feasible, we believe that assigning a level of nearly 90% by extrapolation from the results with the Z/AP reporter (documenting the successful performance of the OC-cre transgene) is justifiable, on the basis of the following consistent results. Whenever the Igf1rflox locus was used in combination with various high-performance cre transgenes analogous to OC-cre, including a liver-specific albumin-cre(5Yakar S. Liu J.L. Stannard B. Butler A.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), practically complete Cre-mediated recombination has been observed. 3S. Xuan and A. Efstratiadis, unpublished data. Among the progeny of crosses between OC-cre/Igf1r +/flox andIgf1r flox/flox mice, female animals with an OC-cre/Igf1r flox/floxgenotype were selected for a detailed study of mutational effects using the femur as a long bone representative, whereas theirIgf1r flox/flox female siblings served as controls. The abnormalities described below were qualitatively similar, but less pronounced in male experimental animals (data not shown). Because of the expression of the cre transgene from E17 onward, osteoblasts appearing for the first time postnatally in the long bones of OC-cre/Igf1r flox/floxmice possess an Igf1r Δflox/Δfloxmutant genotype. For simplicity, these experimental animals will be referred to below as ΔIgf1r mice, although in all cells other than osteoblasts the floxed alleles of the Igf1r gene remain intact. Also by convention, the genetically modified, but normal (control) mice will be considered as indistinguishable from wild-type. To assess quantitatively bone mass, architecture, and turnover, static and dynamic histomorphometric analyses were performed on female ΔIgf1r and control littermates at 3 and 6 weeks of age, when the skeletal modeling in the mouse is very active (33Richman C. Kutilek S. Miyakoshi N. Srivastava A.K. Beamer W.G. Donahue L.R. Rosen C.J. Wergedal J.E. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At these ages, the mutant and normal animals were indistinguishable in size and weight. Moreover, no differences in femoral lengths were detected at 6 weeks (measured in mm with a dial caliper; 14.31 ± 0.45 and 14.41 ± 0.34 for ΔIgf1r and control female mice, respectively, with corresponding values for males of 15.18 ± 0.46 and 15.0 ± 0.53). Thus, disruption of the Igf1r gene in osteoblasts did not appear to affect the overall postnatal growth in the mutants. Although the 6-week measurements were focused on the secondary spongiosa of the distal femur, the histomorphometric analysis at 3 weeks was performed on the femoral epiphysis because at this age there is a greater amount of bone at this site (TableI). These quantitative data, which were consistent with qualitative evaluations of the trabecular bone in the primary and secondary spongiosa, revealed that the rate of epiphyseal bone formation (normalized for bone surface) was dramatically reduced in ΔIgf1r mice (∼42% of normal; Table I and Fig.4). Moreover, significant reductions in osteoblast and osteoclast numbers per bone perimeter (67–69% of normal) were observed (Table I and Fig. 4). However, differences between mutants and controls in trabecular bone volume fraction or architecture were not detected at this time point.Table IBone histomorphometryBone parameteraValues are shown as mean ± S.E.

To explore it, monkeys were trained to judge whether successive visual displays contained the same quantity of items. Many neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex were tuned for quantity irrespective of the exact physical appearance of the displays. Their tuning curves formed overlapping filters, which may explain why behavioral discrimination improves with increasing numerical distance and why discrimination of two quantities with equal numerical distance worsens as their numerical size increases. A mechanism that extracts the quantity of visual field items could contribute to general numerical ability."

To identify previously unknown antiviral activities, we screened mammalian complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries for genes that prevent infection by a genetically marked retrovirus. Virus-resistant cells were selected from pools of transduced clones, and an active antiviral cDNA was recovered. The gene encodes a CCCH-type zinc finger protein designated ZAP. Expression of the gene caused a profound and specific loss of viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from the cytoplasm without affecting the levels of nuclear mRNAs. The finding suggests the existence of a previously unknown machinery for the inhibition of virus replication, targeting a step in viral gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2147817030,"Distal limb development and specification of digit identities in tetrapods are under the control of a mesenchymal organizer called the polarizing region. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is the morphogenetic signal produced by the polarizing region in the posterior limb bud. Ectopic anterior SHH signaling induces digit duplications and has been suspected as a major cause underlying congenital malformations that result in digit polydactyly. Here, we report that the polydactyly of Gli3 -deficient mice arises independently of SHH signaling. Disruption of one or both Gli3 alleles in mouse embryos lacking Shh progressively restores limb distal development and digit formation. Our genetic analysis indicates that SHH signaling counteracts GLI3-mediated repression of key regulator genes, cell survival, and distal progression of limb bud development."
https://openalex.org/W2075526088,"We reported earlier that the tobacco early ethylene-responsive gene NtER1 encodes a calmodulin-binding protein (Yang, T., and Poovaiah, B. W. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 38467–38473). Here we demonstrate that there is oneNtER1 homolog as well as five related genes inArabidopsis. These six genes are rapidly and differentially induced by environmental signals such as temperature extremes, UVB, salt, and wounding; hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid; and signal molecules such as methyl jasmonate, H2O2, and salicylic acid. Hence, they were designated as AtSR1–6 (A rabidopsisthaliana signal-responsive genes). Ca2+/calmodulin binds to all AtSRs, and their calmodulin-binding regions are located on a conserved basic amphiphilic α-helical motif in the C terminus. AtSR1 targets the nucleus and specifically recognizes a novel 6-bp CGCG box (A/C/G)CGCG(G/T/C). The multiple CGCG cis-elements are found in promoters of genes such as those involved in ethylene signaling, abscisic acid signaling, and light signal perception. The DNA-binding domain in AtSR1 is located on the N-terminal 146 bp where all AtSR1-related proteins share high similarity but have no similarity to other known DNA-binding proteins. The calmodulin-binding nuclear proteins isolated from wounded leaves exhibit specific CGCG box DNA binding activities. These results suggest that the AtSR gene family encodes a family of calmodulin-binding/DNA-binding proteins involved in multiple signal transduction pathways in plants. We reported earlier that the tobacco early ethylene-responsive gene NtER1 encodes a calmodulin-binding protein (Yang, T., and Poovaiah, B. W. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 38467–38473).

These results suggest that the AtSR gene family encodes a family of calmodulin-binding/DNA-binding proteins involved in multiple signal transduction pathways in plants. Plants are constantly exposed to a variety of adverse environmental conditions such as temperature extremes, UV light, salt, and pathogen attacks. Thus, plants have to endure these stresses by modulating the expression of specific genes. Regulated gene expression is one of the most complex activities in cells. It involves many transcription factors that contribute to the basal transcription machinery or mediate gene regulation in response to developmental, environmental, or metabolic cues. Based on data from theArabidopsis genome project, it was predicted that there would be more than 1709 transcription factor genes (about 6.7% of total 25,498 genes) that encode proteins with significant similarity to known classes of plant transcription factors classified by conserved DNA-binding domains. However, less than 10% of these factors have been genetically characterized (1Arabidopsis Nature. 2000; 408: 823-826Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that Ca2+-mediated signaling is involved in the transduction of physical signals such as temperature, wind, touch, light, and gravity; oxidative signals such as those arising from pathogen attacks; and hormone signals such as ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), 1The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; CaM, calmodulin; MCP, 1-methylcyclopropene; SA, salicylic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; oligo, oligonucleotide; SF, subfamilies; MJ, methyl jasmonate. gibberellins, and auxin (2Bush D.S.

Recently, the signal-induced nuclear free calcium changes were also observed (8Pauly N. Knight M.R. Thuleau P. van der Luit A.H. Moreau M. Trewavas A.J. Ranjeva R. Mazars C. Nature. 2000; 405: 754-755Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ changes are sensed by a number of Ca2+-binding proteins that usually contain a common structural motif, the “EF-hand,” a helix-loop-helix structure (9Natalie C. Strynadaka J. Jams M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-958Google Scholar). One of the best characterized Ca2+-binding proteins is calmodulin (CaM), a highly conserved and multifunctional regulatory protein in eukaryotes. Its regulatory activities are triggered by its ability to modulate the activity of a certain set of CaM-binding proteins after binding to Ca2+, and thereby generating physiological responses to various stimuli (10Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1987; 6: 47-103Google Scholar, 11Roberts D.M. Harmon A.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 375-414Google Scholar, 12Poovaiah B.W.

The CaM-regulated basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors was reported in mammals, where CaM inhibits the protein-DNA interaction by competing with the DNA-binding domain in certain proteins (16Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundstrom T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Google Scholar). In plants, TGA3, a member of a family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors, showed the Ca2+/CaM enhanced-binding activities to C/G box (17Szymanski D.B. Liao B. Zielinski R.E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1069-1077Google Scholar). However, the CaM-binding property of TGA3 was not defined. We cloned and characterized an early ethylene-responsive gene (NtER1) in tobacco that encodes for a CaM-binding protein (18Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Google Scholar). Bouche et al. (19Bouche N. Scharlat A. Snedden W. Bouchez D. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21851-21861Google Scholar) reported that a Brassica homolog BnCAMTA is a CaM-binding protein with nonspecific DNA-binding activity. They also showed that one of theArabidopsis homologs (AtCAMTA1) encodes a CaM-binding protein with a transcription activation domain. The Arabidopsis genome has one NtER1 homolog (AtSR1) and five related genes (AtSR2–6). Here we report that these six genes exhibit rapid and differential response to environmental stimuli such as UV, extreme temperatures, high salt concentration, and physical wounding; hormones such as ethylene and ABA; and signal elicitors such as methyl jasmonate (MJ), H2O2, and salicylic acid (SA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that calcium/CaM binds to a 23-mer peptide in all AtSRs that corresponds to the CaM-binding region of NtER1. We also show that AtSR1 targets the nucleus and has the specific binding activity to a novel DNA element (A/C/G)CGCG(G/T/C), referred to as “CGCG box.” Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia were grown in a 1:1 mixture of soil mix and vermiculite under a 14-h photoperiod/10-h dark at 20–22 °C in a greenhouse or growth room. The 3-week-old seedlings were subjected to various treatments. Temperature stress plants were incubated at 4 or 42 °C; physical wounding leaves were crushed using blunt forceps; UVB plants were exposed to two 15-watt UVB (280–320 nm) lamps (F15T8.UVB 15 watts; UVP Inc.) at a dose of 2 kJ/m2 after an irradiation period of 5 min; salt stress 200 mm NaCl was applied to soil; ethylene and MJ plants were placed in 4-liter sealed jars with 100 ppm C2H4 or 0.2 μmMJ, some plants were treated with 50 ppm MCP for 2 h prior to ethylene treatment; ABA, H2O2, and SA plants were sprayed with 100 μm ABA, 10 mmH2O2, or 400 μm SA in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) with 1% Triton X-100, the control plants were sprayed with the buffer alone. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All the treatments were performed at room temperature except the temperature stress treatment. After each treatment, whole plants were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. The 5′ end 488 bp of AtSR1 was cloned by PCR from an ArabidopsiscDNA ZAPII expression library using a gene-specific primer (AtSR1-P1, Table I) and T3 primer in the vector. The largest fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced from both sides. The full coding region ofAtSR1 was cloned by PCR from the library with two gene-specific primers (AtSR1-P2/P3) based on the 5′-cloning results (forward primer) and data base predicted cDNA sequence (reverse primer). The Pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was used for PCR amplification to maintain a high fidelity of amplification. The amplified fragment was subcloned into pET101 expression vector as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) and was sequenced from both sides.Table IOligonucleotide sequencesNameSequencesAtSR1-P1CCGGTTAAAAGAAGTAGAAACTCTAAtSR1-P2ATGGCGGAAGCAAGACGATTCAGAtSR1-P3GTGATTTAACTGGTCCACAAAGATGAAtSR1-P4ATGCAAAGGACTGAAGACGCGGCAtSR1-P5ATGGCGGAAGCAAGACGATTCAGAtSR1-P6ACTGGTCCACAAAGATGAGGAAtSR1-P7ATCCGGTTAAAAGAAGTAGAAACTCAtSR1-P8ATGCAAAGGACTGAAGACGCGGCAtSR1-AATGGCGGAAGCAAGACGATTCAGAtSR1-BATCAAACATAAAAACAGACCCACTTGAtSR2-AGAGTCAGAGAAAGTGATTCCCAGAGAtSR2-BATCAGTGTCATCCTGCCAATTAAAAtSR3-ACGTCCTTGTACATTACCGTGATACAAtSR3-BGCAGATTGGTTATTAAGATCGGTTGAtSR4-ACAGACACAGCCTTCTACTTTTGGTTAtSR4-BCCAAATAAGGCAAGATCAGTAGCATAtSR5-ACATACTCTTGTAAGCAAGCAACCAAtSR5-BGAAGAAACCGAGAATTCAAAAGACAAtSR6-AGGAACTCGTACTCAAGTTCGATCAAtSR6-BGGTTGGATGAGATTGTTGCTAATAtACT8-AATGAAGATTAAGGTCGTGGCAtACT8-BTCCGAGTTTGAAGAGGCTACOS-1CAGGGCTAGTGGATCCC-N30- GGGAGATCTGGAATTCGAOS-2TCGAATTCCAGATCTCCCOS-3CAGGGCTAGTGGATCCC Open table in a new tab The templates coding the N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants ofAtSR1 were produced by PCR amplification from the cDNA with AtSR1-specific primers cloned into the pET101 expression vector (Invitrogen). The primers (Table I) were AtSR1-P2/P1 for C-terminal deletion ΔC-(147–1032), and AtSR1-P4/P3 for ΔN-(1–146). ΔC was fused to the His6 tag in pET101 by C-terminal fusion, and ΔN was inserted to pET101 without fusion with the His6 tag. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned fragments derived by PCR amplification were determined from both sides. AtSR1 and deletion mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. The recombinant AtSR1 and ΔN were extracted and purified with CaM-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described (18Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Google Scholar), and the recombinant ΔC was purified with HisTrap column as described by manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of protein was estimated by the method of Bradford using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransfered onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and incubated with35S-labeled recombinant CaM with 0.1 mmCaCl2 or 0.5 mm EGTA as described (18Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Google Scholar). The membrane was washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 0.5 mm EGTA, or 0.5 mm MgCl2, and then exposed to x-ray film overnight. The synthetic peptides were prepared using an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer 431A in the Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Biotechnology, Washington State University. Samples containing 240 pmol (4 μg) of bovine CaM (Sigma) and differing amounts of purified synthetic peptides in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and either 0.1 mmCaCl2 or 0.5 mm EGTA in a total volume of 30 μl were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE as described (18Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Google Scholar). The full-length AtSR1 or ΔC-(147–1032) or ΔN-(1–146) were amplified by PCR amplification withPfu DNA polymerase using the gene-specific primers listed in Table I. The primers were AtSR1-P5/6 for AtSR1, AtSR1-P5/7for ΔC, and AtSR1-P8/6 for ΔN. In the 5′ of each primer, an adaptor sequence of GTCTAGCGGATCC was added to create an artificialBamHI site. The 3′ was created in-frame fusion with the GFP reading frame. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pBluescript KS vector, and the DNA was sequenced from both sides for verification. These plasmids were digested with BamHI and ligated with the BamHI-digested psmGFP, which has aBamHI site between cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and GFP (20Davis S.J. Vierstra R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 521-528Google Scholar). psmGFP was used as a control. GFP expression was monitored by a transient assay using leaves of 3-week-oldArabidopsis seedlings. Plasmid DNA was introduced by particle bombardment using the method described by Christou (21Christou P. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 375-382Google Scholar). Seven-μm gold spheres were coated with plasmid DNA and accelerated by a 7-kV discharge toward the leaves placed on agar Petri plates. After bombardment, the leaves were kept in the dark for 24 h prior to confocal microscopic examination. The images were processed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal laser scanning system with a Nikon microscope. The leaves were directly examined on a glass slide using argon laser (488 nm) for green fluorescence. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants after the wounding treatment for 4 h or control plants that grew in normal conditions. Nuclear proteins were extracted from harvested samples (30 g) following protocol described by Green et al. (22Green P.J. Kay S.A. Chua N.H. EMBO J. 1987; 18: 4689-4699Google Scholar). The nuclear proteins were further purified with CaM-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) according to Yang and Poovaiah (23Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4097-4102Google Scholar). The purified nuclear proteins as well as the recombinant proteins were dialyzed and concentrated with Centricon YM-50 or YM-10 (Millipore) against a nuclear extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C before gel retardation assays. The oligo selection procedure was performed as described by Wang et al. (24Wang Z. Yang P. Fan B. Chen Z. Plant J. 1998; 16: 515-522Google Scholar). Briefly, a pool of double-stranded random oligo molecules was labeled by primed synthesis of the random oligo OS-1 using the OS-2 primer (Table I). The labeled probe was purified by 8% non-denaturing PAGE. After gel retardation assays, the retarded DNA was eluted and labeled by PCR amplification using the OS-3 primer (Table I). The amplified probe was purified by electrophoresis and used as a probe for the next round of selection with gel retardation assays. All other probes were labeled by primed synthesis of the synthesized oligos (containing an OS-2 complementary adaptor sequence in 3′) using the OS-2 primer. The labeled probes were purified by electrophoresis. DNA binding assays were performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 3 μg of recombinant proteins or 20 μg of nuclear proteins or 2 μg of CaM-binding nuclear proteins and 1–2 ng of labeled double-stranded DNA fragments (24Wang Z. Yang P. Fan B. Chen Z. Plant J. 1998; 16: 515-522Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 20 min and were separated on a 10% PAGE gel in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. RNA isolation was performed as described previously by Yang and Poovaiah (18Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis was performed using gene-specific primers, which were designed from the least conserved regions in the central portion of each of theAtSR genes except AtSR1. Instead, the gene-specific primers for AtSR1 were designed from the 5′-region where the differences were observed between this study and the GenBankTM prediction. The forward/reverse primers are as follows: AtSR1-A/B, AtSR2-A/B, AtSR-3A/B, AtSR4-A/B, AtSR5-A/B, and AtSR6-A/B. The actin 8 gene (AtACT8) was used as a positive internal control. The PCR primers for detection of AtACT8mRNAs were AtACT8-A/B. All primers are listed in Table I. Two μg of total RNA were treated with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by 5 min at 90 °C to inactivate the DNase. The reverse transcription was carried out using 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 as a primer in a 20-μl reaction mixture as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μl of reverse-transcribed cDNA as the template, two gene-specific primers (0.5 μm each), and 1.5 mm MgCl2. To maintain the amplification of the internal control and AtSRs within the exponential phase, the number of PCR cycles was adjusted to 25 cycles for AtACT8 and 34 cycles for all AtSR genes or otherwise indicated. The PCR products for each pair of primers were subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced first time to confirm the specificity of PCR amplification. The experiments were repeated three times. The amplified PCR products (9 μl) were electrophoresed on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and scanned using an image analyzer. The Real Time quantitative PCR was performed in the PE Biosystems GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system using the SYBR green detection as recommended by the manufacturer. Each reaction (25 μl) contained 2.5 μl of the 10× SYBR green buffer; 200 nm dATP, dGTP, and dCTP; 400 nmdUTP; 2 mm MgCl2; 0.625 units of Amplitaq Gold DNA polymerase; 250 nm forward and reverse primers (listed in Table I), and 1 μl of the cDNA from reverse transcription.AtACT8 was used as an internal control. The reactions were performed in a MicroAmp 96-well plate capped with MicroAmp optical caps. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The data generated from the SYBR green detection were analyzed as described by Schmittgen et al. (25Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Mills A.G. Gorn V. Singer M.J. Reed M.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 194-204Google Scholar). Briefly, we used ΔΔC t method, in which the end point C t is defined as the PCR cycle number that crosses an arbitrarily placed signal threshold. The fold change of the gene expression was calculated by 2−(ΔΔCt), where ΔΔC t = (C tAtSRs −C tAtACT8)timeX − (C tAtSRs −C tAtACT8)time0. GenBankTM accession numbers for the genes are as follows: AF506697 (AtSR1), AF253511(NtER1), AF096260 (LeER66), AF303397(EICBP), S48041 (parsley CG-1), AU174776 (rice EST), BF278589 (cotton EST), AV835190 (barley EST), BE341351 (Sorghum EST), BE341351 (potato EST), BAA74856 (human1, KIAA0833),BAA74932 (human2, KIAA0909), and AAM10969 (Brassica BnCAMTA). The Arabidopsis data base was searched using NtER1 amino acid sequences. One NtER1 homolog (AtSR1) and five related proteins (AtSR2–6) were found in theArabidopsis genome, with gene identification numbers At2g22300, At5g09410, At3g16940, At5g64220, At1g67310, At4g16150, respectively. Based on the alignment of the amino acid sequences of AtSR1–6, some variations were observed in the N-terminal portions of AtSR1 and AtSR6, whereas AtSR2–5 showed higher similarity to each other (see Fig. 1 in the Supplemental Material). To verify the cDNA sequence of AtSR1, a gene-specific primer (AtSR1-P1) and T3 primer in the vector were used to clone the 5′ region of AtSR1. The longest DNA fragment (∼490 bp) was subcloned, and DNA sequencing revealed that the first 54 amino acids in AtSR1 were different from the prediction in GenBankTM but showed a linear similarity with other AtSRs N-terminal regions (see Fig. 1 in the Supplemental Material). Comparison of AtSR1 cDNA sequences with the genomic sequence indicated the differences resulted from the different RNA splicing sites in introns 1 and 2 (data not shown). Further cloning of the full cDNA showed that sequences in other region were the same as predicted. Reddy et al. (26Reddy A.S. Reddy V.S. Golovkin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 762-769Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a clone (EICBP, a partial cDNA sequence was reported in GenBankTM) which had the same cDNA sequence as the GenBankTM prediction, suggesting this gene could have two types of transcripts. AtSR1 has 3302 nucleotides, and its largest open reading frame encodes a protein composed of 1032 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 116 kDa. The predicted AtSR1 is an acidic and hydrophilic protein (pI 5.3) with no obvious membrane-spanning domains, and an overall secondary structure of α-helices. AtSR1 contains several noteworthy structural features as follows: 1) N-terminal 62–79 has a typical bipartite nuclear targeting signal (27Schwechheimer C. Zourelidou M. Bevan M.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 127-150Google Scholar); 2) C-terminal 900–922 has an almost identical amino acid sequence as the characterized CaM-binding region in NtER1 (18Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Google Scholar); 3) the central portion 661–726 has two ankyrin-like repeats which is a motif known to be responsible for mediating protein-protein interactions (28Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Google Scholar); 4) the C-terminal 853–896 has two IQ motifs, which is a CaM-binding motif in many proteins (29Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Google Scholar); and 5) the C-terminal 1003–1019 has an acidic domain with 11 acidic amino acids. The amino acid sequences of AtSR6 were corrected based on the reported EST (GenBankTM accession number T04795) (see Fig. 1 in the Supplemental Material). AtSR2–6 had predicted lengths ranging from 852 (AtSR3) to 1035 amino acids (AtSR5) with pI values of 5.2–8. Overall similarity among six homologs ranges between 43 and 78%. They shared very high similarity in the N-terminal portion and in the C-terminal portions but not in the central portions (see Fig. 1 in the Supplemental Material). In the C terminus, all six AtSRs and NtER1 showed over 75% similarity and 65% identity, especially in the CaM-binding region with greater than 90% similarity and 79% identity. In the N-terminal portions, AtSR1–6 had over 66% similarity and 50% identity. Similar to AtSR1, AtSR2–5 have a predicted nuclear targeting signal sequence in the N terminus, one or two ankyrin repeat(s) in the center portion (except AtSR6), and more than two IQ motifs around the CaM-binding region. All six AtSRs have just one copy each in theArabidopsis genome. Five Arabidopsis chromosomes have one AtSR gene each, except chromosome 5 which has two, separated by about 20,000 kb. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AtSR1–6 could be grouped into four subfamilies (SF); SF1 (AtSR1), SF2 (AtSR2, 4), SF3 (AtSR 3, 6), and SF4 (AtSR5) (data not shown). The overall conserved structure of all the AtSRs suggests that they may diverge from a single ancestral origin. AtSR2 and -4 share the highest similarity and are both located on chromosome 5, which suggests that they evolved by gene duplication most recently. Fig. 1 A shows the alignment of the CaM-binding region of AtSR1 with other AtSRs, tobacco NtER1 and tomato LeER66. The predicted CaM-binding domains (23 amino acids) corresponding to the NtER1 CaM-binding region are highly conserved. For example, AtSR1 has only two conserved amino acid sequence substitutions as compared with the counterpart of NtER1 in this portion (amino acids 900–922). Helical wheel projection in GCG 10 (version 10 of the GCG program) revealed that AtSR1–6 had the basic amphiphilic α-helix structure (data not shown), a typical secondary structure for most characterized CaM-binding proteins (18Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Google Scholar, 30O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Google Scholar, 31Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Google Scholar). To determine that the AtSRs are CaM-binding proteins, the full-length AtSR1 and two truncated constructs were expressed inE. coli. The ΔC-(147–1032) was fused to a His tag in the C terminus and was purified by His-Trap column chromatography. The full-length and ΔN-(1–147) recombinant proteins were purified by a CaM-Sepharose column. The recombinant proteins were then subjected to a CaM binding assay. The results revealed that CaM binds to both AtSR1 and ΔN, but not ΔC, in the presence of 0.1 mmCaCl2 (Fig. 1 B). No CaM binding was observed for all proteins when 0.1 mm CaCl2 was replaced by either 0.5 mm calcium chelator EGTA (Fig. 1 B) or other divalent ions such as 0.5 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). Therefore, CaM binding to AtSR1 was Ca2+-dependent, and the CaM-binding region was within the C-terminal residues 147–1032. Furthermore, four peptides (representing four SFs) corresponding to the putative CaM-binding domains of AtSR1,2,3,5 were synthesized. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that CaM bound to all of them in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Two examples (AtSR1 and AtSR3) are shown in Fig. 1 C. These results indicated that AtSR1–6 were all Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding proteins. Because many IQ motifs were CaM-binding domains, the peptides corresponding to the two IQ motifs of AtSR1 were used for the mobility shift assay. CaM did not bind to these two peptides, either in the presence of CaCl2 or EGTA (data not shown). A search of GenBankTM revealed that several partial clones from both dicots and monocots had over 66% similarity and 50% identity with AtSRs N-terminal portion (AtSR1, amino acids 13–134). These plants included parsley, potato, cotton, rice, barley and sorghum. This portion also showed over 56.6% similarity and 42.4% identity with two predicted proteins, KIAA0833 and KIAA0909, based on cDNA isolated from adult human brains. Alignment of these sequences indicated that they had the similar secondary structure with several predicated α-helices and two β-sheets, as well as several positive charged amino acids (more than 10 net positive charges) in this portion. In particular, they all have conserved bipartite nuclear localization signals (AtSR1, amino acids 62–79). We further selected AtSR1 for detailed studies on its subcellular localization by making the full-length of AtSR1, ΔN-(1–146) and ΔC-(147–1032) with GFP fusion constructs. Transient transformation into Arabidopsis leaves was performed by DNA bombardment, and the image was analyzed 24 h after transformation using a confocal microscope. The green fluorescence was throughout the cytoplasm for the GFP control construct. However, both AtSR1:GFP fusion and ΔC:GFP fusion predominantly were localized to the nucleus. In contrast, the ΔN:GFP fusion was visualized as patches in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). Thus AtSR1 targets nuclei, and the nuclear localization signals are within N-terminal 146 amino acids. Furthermore, the fact that all other AtSRs and related proteins have conserved bipartite nuclear localization signals suggests that they all are nuclear proteins. Parsley CG-1 (147 amino acids) is a partial clone with high similarity with N-terminal portion of AtSRs. da Costa e Silva (32da Costa e Silva O. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 921-924Google Scholar) reported that parsley CG-1 bound to a DNA fragment CGCGTTTAATCTCCAACAAACCCCTTCTAG in which CGCG was crucial for DNA binding. The gel retardation assay showed that neither full-length AtSR1 nor deletion mutants bound to this DNA fragment (data not shown). In order to test whether the nuclear protein AtSR1 had specific interacting DNA elements, an oligo selection procedure was used with a pool of 30 completely random sequences of oligonucleotides. Because the putative DNA-binding domain was located in the N terminus, the recombinant AtSR1ΔC-(147–1032) was used for gel retardation assays to avoid the potential negative effects of other domains on DNA binding. The poly(dI-dC) was used as a nonspecific competitor. After three rounds of selection, gel-retarded oligo DNA molecules were amplified, and then a library enriched in DNA inserts containing specific sequences recognized by ΔC was established. The DNA sequencing revealed that half of the positive clones had a common DNA element of 6-bp ACGCGG (or CCGCGT). However, AtSR1 also bound to other fragments with ACGCGT (30%), CCGCGG (10%), ACGCGC (or G"

The two molecules undergo a strong coherent dipole-dipole coupling that produces entangled sub- and superradiant states. Under intense laser illumination, both molecules are excited via a two-photon transition, and the fluorescence from this doubly excited system displays photon bunching. Our experimental scheme can be used to optically resolve molecules at the nanometer scale and to manipulate the degree of entanglement among them."
https://openalex.org/W2126806448,"In eukaryotic cells, double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are generally repaired by the pathway of homologous recombination or by DNA nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Both pathways have been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, but no equivalent NHEJ system has been identified in prokaryotes. The NHEJ pathway requires a DNA end-binding component called Ku. We have identified bacterial Ku homologs and show that these proteins retain the biochemical characteristics of the eukaryotic Ku heterodimer. Furthermore, we show that bacterial Ku specifically recruits DNA ligase to DNA ends and stimulates DNA ligation. Loss of these proteins leads to hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation in Bacillus subtilis. These data provide evidence that many bacteria possess a DNA DSB repair apparatus that shares many features with the NHEJ system of eukarya and suggest that this DNA repair pathway arose before the prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages diverged."

This reaction constitutes an economically attractive and environmentally favorable synthesis of linear aliphatic amines.
https://openalex.org/W2024004416,"Initiation of apoptosis by many agents is preceded by mitochondrial dysfunction and depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here we demonstrate that, in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC), cisplatin induces mitochondrial dysfunction associated with hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and that these events are mediated by protein kinase C (PKC)-α and ERK1/2. Cisplatin induced sustained decreases in RPTC respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and increases in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), which were preceded by the inhibition of F0F1-ATPase and cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria, accompanied by caspase-3 activation, and followed by RPTC apoptosis. Cisplatin also decreased active Na+ transport as a result, in part, of the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase. These changes were preceded by PKC-α and ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of cisplatin-induced PKC-α and ERK1/2 activation using Go6976 and PD98059, respectively, abolished increases in ΔΨm, diminished decreases in oxidative phosphorylation, active Na+ transport, and decreased caspase-3 activation without blocking cytochrome c release. Caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) did not prevent increases in ΔΨm. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC-α did not prevent cisplatin-induced ERK1/2 activation. We concluded that in RPTC: 1) cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, decreases in active Na+transport, and apoptosis are mediated by PKC-α and ERK1/2; 2) PKC-α and ERK1/2 mediate activation of caspase-3 by acting downstream of cytochrome c release from mitochondria; and 3) ERK1/2 activation by cisplatin occurs through a PKC-α-independent pathway.

Higher concentrations of cisplatin that induce cell necrosis (0.1–2.0 mm) cause disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as a result of inhibition of complexes I–IV (2Safirstein R.L. Winston J. Moel D. Dikman S. Guttenplan J. Int. J. Androl. 1987; 10: 325-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Brady H.R. Kone B.C. Stromski M.E. Zeidel M.L. Giebisch G. Gullans S.R. Am.

Cell Death Diff. 1998; 5: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The residual electron flow through the respiratory chain is the source of reactive oxygen species, but formation of reactive oxygen species is not a direct cause of the renal cell toxicity induced by high concentrations of cisplatin (17Kruidering M. van de Water B. Zhan Y. Baelde J.J. de Heer E. Mulder G.J. Stevens J.L. Nagelkerke J.F. Cell Death Diff. 1998; 5: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Zhang J.G Lindup W.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2215-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These changes are accompanied by the decrease in state 3 respiration and intracellular ATP content (9Brady H.R. Kone B.C. Stromski M.E. Zeidel M.L. Giebisch G. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1181-F1187PubMed Google Scholar). Cisplatin also inhibits mitochondrial phosphate transport, possibly by a direct interaction with the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (26Tkacova E. Kuzela S. Neoplasma. 1985; 32: 679-683PubMed Google Scholar). So far, however, mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported only in renal proximal tubules exposed to higher concentrations of cisplatin. Therefore, the first goal of this study was to determine whether lower concentrations of cisplatin cause alterations in mitochondrial function that may contribute to toxicity of this drug. Cisplatin activates multiple signal transduction pathways, which can lead to different cellular responses (27Persons D.L. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Cui W. Pelling J.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1007-1014PubMed Google Scholar). In various cancer cells, cisplatin activates the MEK1 cascade and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (27Persons D.L. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Cui W. Pelling J.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1007-1014PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sanchez-Perez I. Perona R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39435-39443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Activation of these kinases results in p53 phosphorylation, activation of caspase-3, generation of catalytic domains of different isozymes of protein kinase C (PKC), including PKC-δ, PKC-ε, and PKC-ζ, and is followed by cell death (30Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z., Wu, X. Jones S.N. Roni Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 31Persons D.L. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Pelling J.C. J. Biol.

PKC isozymes have been implicated in cisplatin toxicity in renal proximal tubules as well (4Ikeda S. Fukuzaki A. Kaneto H. Ishidoya S. Orikasa S. Int. J. Urol. 1999; 6: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Zhang J.G. Lindup W.E. Toxicol. Lett. 1996; 89: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cisplatin administration in vivo increases protein levels of PKC-α in renal proximal tubules and that pretreatment with general protein kinase inhibitors protects kidneys from cisplatin-induced injury (4Ikeda S. Fukuzaki A. Kaneto H. Ishidoya S. Orikasa S. Int. J. Urol. 1999; 6: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are reports showing that the exposure of renal cortical slices to cisplatin decreases total PKC activity (33Zhang J.G. Lindup W.E. Toxicol. Lett. 1996; 89: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PKC-α and ERK1/2 are present in RPTC and play an important role in the responses of these cells to various types of injury. However, the effect of cisplatin on PKC-α and ERK1/2 in RPTC is not known, and it is unknown whether these kinases are involved in cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the second goal of this study was to determine whether PKC-α and/or ERK1/2 play roles in cisplatin-induced injury in RPTC and whether these kinases mediate cisplatin effects on mitochondrial function. Female New Zealand White rabbits (2.0–2.5 kg) were purchased from Myrtle's Rabbitry (Thompson Station, TN). Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) was supplied by Aldrich. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).l-Ascorbic acid-2-phosphate magnesium salt and cell culture media were obtained from Wako BioProducts (Richmond, VA) and Invitrogen, respectively. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 fluorometric substrates (DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC) and LEHD-AFC, respectively), AFC, and buffers for caspase assays were purchased from BioVision (Palo Alto, CA). PKC-α inhibitor (Go6976) and MEK inhibitors (PD98059 and UO126) were supplied by Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). zVAD-fmk was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures were supplied by Oncogene (San Diego, CA) and Sigma, respectively. Phospho-p44/42 ERK, phospho-PKC-δ, and active caspase-3 antibodies were obtained fromCell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Phospho-PKC-α and phospho-PKC-ε antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). PKC-α and p44/42 ERK antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA) and cytochromec antibody from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase were supplied by Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) and Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrate by Pierce. The sources of the other reagents and cell culture hormones have been described previously (34Nowak G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2072-C2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit renal proximal tubules were isolated by the iron oxide perfusion method and grown in 35-mm culture dishes in optimized conditions as described previously (34Nowak G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2072-C2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the renal proximal tubular segments isolated by this method is ∼96%. The culture medium was a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mix without phenol red, pyruvate, and glucose, supplemented with 15 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm Hepes, and 6 mm lactate (pH 7.4, 295 mosmol/kg). Human transferrin (5 μg/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (50 nm), bovine insulin (10 nm), and l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (50 μm) were added to the medium immediately before daily media change (2 ml/dish). RPTC monolayers reached confluence within 6 days and were treated with cisplatin on day 6 of culture. Samples of RPTC were taken at various time points (between 0.5 and 24 h) of cisplatin exposure for immunoblotting, measurements of mitochondrial functions, and caspase activities. Various inhibitors (Go6976, PD98059, UO126, zVAD-fmk) were added 0.5 h prior to cisplatin treatment. Control RPTC were treated with diluent (dimethyl sulfoxide; 0.1% final concentration) Mitochondrial function was assessed by measurements of oxygen consumption, intracellular ATP content, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. RPTC monolayers were gently detached from the dishes with a rubber policeman, suspended in 37 °C culture medium, and transferred to the QO2measurement chamber. QO2 was measured polarographically using Clark type electrode as described previously (34Nowak G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2072-C2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal QO2 was measured in each run prior to any additions. Oligomycin-sensitive QO2 was used as a marker of oxidative phosphorylation, measured in the presence of oligomycin (0.6 μg/ml), and calculated as a difference between basal and oligomycin-insensitive QO2. Uncoupled QO2 was used as a marker of the activity of electron transport through the respiratory chain and was measured after addition of carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 2 μm). ATP content in RPTC was measured by the luciferase method in freshly prepared cellular lysates using the ATP bioluminescence assay kit supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals and instructions provided by the manufacturer. ΔΨm was assessed using JC-1, a cationic dye that exhibits potential-dependent accumulation and formation of red fluorescent J-aggregates in mitochondria. In contrast, changes in plasma membrane potential do not affect the JC-1 status. The JC-1 monomer accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it produces green fluorescence. Formation of J-aggregates in the mitochondria is indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green (525 nm) to red (590 nm). Mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio. At different time points of cisplatin exposure, RPTC monolayers were loaded with 10 μm JC-1 for 30 min at 37 °C. After loading, media were aspirated, monolayers kept on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped off culture dishes, washed, and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) using excitation by a 488-nm argon-ion laser. The JC-1 monomer (green) and the J-aggregate (red) were detected separately in FL1 (emission, 525 nm) and FL2 (emission, 590 nm) channels, respectively. The JC-1 accumulation in mitochondria of control and cisplatin-treated RPTC was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. RPTC were loaded with JC-1 as described above, washed twice, and overlaid with ice-cold PBS. Live RPTC monolayers were examined under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope (Axioskop) using water immersion objective. Mitochondria were isolated from RPTC as described by Lash and Sall (35Lash L.H. Sall J.M. Methods in Toxicology. 2. Academic Press, Orlando1993: 8-28Google Scholar). RPTC were homogenized in the ice-cold isolation buffer (225 mmsucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) using Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice by re-suspending in the isolation buffer followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 25 mmsucrose, 75 mm mannitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.05 mm K2EDTA, 5 mmH3PO4, and used for measurement of F0F1-ATPase activity and immunoblotting. The supernatant collected after the first centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min (mitochondrial pellet) was further spun down at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant resulting from this centrifugation was used as the cytosolic fraction. F0F1-ATPase activity was determined in freshly isolated RPTC mitochondria by measuring the release of Pi from ATP as described by Law et al. (36Law R.H.P. Manon S. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 133-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were isolated from RPTC at various time points of cisplatin exposure. Mitochondria were isolated from RPTC as described above. The supernatant resulting from the mitochondrial spin was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic fraction, which was used to examine protein levels of cytochrome c by means of immunoblotting. Ouabain-sensitive QO2 was used as a marker of active Na+transport in RPTC as described previously (34Nowak G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2072-C2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ouabain-sensitive QO2 was measured in the presence of 1.0 mmouabain and calculated as a difference between basal and ouabain-insensitive QO2. RPTC lysates were prepared as described previously (37Nowak G. Carter C.A. Schnellmann R.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 167: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 mg of RPTC protein was added to 0.1 ml of 25 mm imidazole buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.065% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Following incubation for 10 min at 22 °C, 0.6 ml of 0.3% bovine serum albumin in 25 mm imidazole buffer was added to lower the SDS concentration and aliquots were used for measurement of Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Na+/K+-ATPase activity was determined in cellular lysates by measuring the difference between total ATPase activity and ouabain-insensitive ATPase activity as described previously (37Nowak G. Carter C.A. Schnellmann R.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 167: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity was quantified by fluorometric detection of free AFC after cleavage from DEVD-AFC. In brief, the media were aspirated from the culture dishes, then the RPTC monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped off culture dishes, and spun down at 1,000 × g for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in cell lysis buffer (BioVision, Palo Alto, CA), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were discarded and the supernatants used for caspase assays. Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of reaction buffer optimized for caspase activity assays (BioVision), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm DEVD-AFC. The fluorescence was read at 380/500 nm (excitation/emission), and the amount of product cleaved was determined from the AFC standard curve. Immunoblot analysis was used for the measurement of protein levels of both total and phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, PKC-α, PKC-δ, and PKC-ε in the total RPTC homogenates and RPTC mitochondria and also for the assessment of protein levels of cytochrome c and active caspase 3 in RPTC cytosol. RPTC homogenates and mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of RPTC were lysed and boiled for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer (60 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8 containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE. Following electroblotting of the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, blots were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 0.5% casein and 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer. Following washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase and washed again. The supersignal chemiluminescent system was used for protein detection and scanning densitometry for the quantification of results. RPTC nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. The monolayers were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed with PBS, and incubated in the presence of 8 μmDAPI for 2 h at room temperature. Following staining, RPTC monolayers were rinsed with PBS, coverslips mounted, and the nuclei evaluated under a Zeiss Fluorescent Microscope. Total and apoptotic nuclei were counted in 6–8 different areas of each monolayer using two plates per each experimental group. Protein concentration in all samples was determined using bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Data are presented as means ± S.E. and were analyzed for significance by analysis of variance. Multiple means were compared using Student-Newman-Keuls test. Statements of significance were based on p < 0.05. Renal proximal tubules isolated from an individual rabbit represented a separate experiment (n = 1) consisting of data obtained from two to four plates. Basal QO2 in control confluent quiescent RPTC monolayers was 21.1 ± 1.2 nmol of O2/mg of protein/min. Exposure of RPTC to 5 and 10 μm cisplatin for 48 h had no effect on basal QO2 (data not shown). Two-hour exposure to 50 μm cisplatin decreased basal QO2 by 23%, but this decrease was transient and basal QO2 returned to control level at 4 h of the treatment (Fig.1 A). However, at 24 h of cisplatin exposure, basal QO2 in RPTC decreased by 49% and was accompanied by cell death (Figs. 1 A and12 B).Figure 12The effect of cisplatin on caspase-3.Caspase-3 activity was quantified by fluorometric detection of free AFC after cleavage from 50 μm DEVD-AFC, and the amount of product cleaved was determined from the AFC standard curve.A, the effect of inhibitors of ERK1/2 activation (50 μm PD98059 and 3 μm UO126) on cisplatin (50 μm)-induced caspase-3 activation.

This interaction can be inhibited by Smac/DIABLO, a polypeptide released from mitochondria upon initiation of the apoptotic signaling process. Here we demonstrate that the first 4–8 N-terminal amino acids of Smac/DIABLO fused to theDrosophila antennapaedia penetratin sequence, a carrier peptide, enhance the induction of apoptosis and long term antiproliferative effects of diverse antineoplastic agents including paclitaxel, etoposide, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), and doxorubicin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Similar effects were observed in additional breast cancer and immortalized cholangiocyte cell lines. Further analysis demonstrated that the Smac-penetratin fusion peptide crossed the cellular membrane, bound XIAP and cIAP1, displaced caspase-3 from cytoplasmic aggregates, and enhanced drug-induced caspase action in situ. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of IAP proteins can modulate the efficacy of antineoplastic agents. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) interact with and inhibit caspases-3, -7, and -9.

Apoptosis is a distinct form of cell death that is provoked by a variety of stimuli, including cancer chemotherapeutic agents (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev.

The morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis reflect, at least in part, the activation of a class of cysteine proteases called caspases (3Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Different members of this family not only transduce various signals into protease activity but also cleave substrates that are required for cellular integrity and continued survival. Collectively, cleavages by effector caspases, particularly caspases-3 and -6, result in diminished integrity of the actin and intermediate filament networks within the cell, inhibit protein synthesis, disable the DNA repair machinery, and activate degradative enzymes such as the caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (9Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). Because of the potentially dire consequences of inadvertent caspase activation, caspase activity within cells is tightly regulated.

Smac/DIABLO is synthesized with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is proteolytically removed during maturation to the mature polypeptide. During apoptosis Smac/DIABLO is released from mitochondria into the cytosol, where it binds to IAPs and facilitates caspase activation (38Nicholson D.W.

A number of observations have implicated IAPs in the regulation of apoptosis in situ. First, overexpression studies demonstrated that XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 diminish apoptosis after treatment with a variety of agents (16Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G.

Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) demonstrated that active caspase-3 is sequestered in cytoplasmic aggregates after treatment of tissue culture cells with TRAIL. This sequestration was particularly dramatic in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells transiently transfected with procaspase-3 but was also observed in other cell lines. Studies using MCF-7 cells stably transfected with procaspase-3 not only demonstrated that the activity of cleaved caspase-3 was inhibited in these aggregates but also suggested that XIAP might be present within them (55Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Meng X.W. Svingen P.A. Ruchaud S. Mesner Jr., P.W. Boerner S.A. Samejima K. Henriquez N.V. Chilcote T.J. Lord J. Salmon M. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol.

These observations prompted us to examine the effect of antagonizing XIAP in this model system as well as other cell lines. In the present study, we demonstrate that the N-terminal sequence of Smac/DIABLO, when delivered into cells by fusion to a peptide carrier, can bind endogenous XIAP and cIAP1, displace caspase-3 from these cytoplasmic aggregates, and enhance cleavage of caspase target polypeptides in situ. These interactions result in increased apoptosis after treatment with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and enhanced long term antiproliferative effects as assessed by colony forming assays.

To assess the long term antiproliferative effects of the Smac/penetratin peptide in concert with chemotherapeutic agents, multiple aliquots containing 750 MCF-7/wt1 cells were plated in 35-mm plates and allowed to adhere for 16–18 h. Triplicate samples were then treated with varying drug concentrations for 24 h in the absence or presence of Smac/penetratin peptide, washed, and incubated in drug-free medium in the continued presence or absence of Smac/penetratin peptide. After 14 days to allow colony formation, plates were washed, stained with Coomassie Blue, and manually counted. After cells were treated for 3 h (58Schwarze S.R., Ho, A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F.

At the predetermined time point, adherent cells were released from tissue culture plates with trypsin-EDTA or cell scrapers, combined with the non-adherent cells, sedimented at 500 × g for 5 min, fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1 v/v), stained with 1 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 in 50% glycerol containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 21 °C), and examined by fluorescence microscopy. A minimum of 500 cells/treatment were scored for apoptotic changes (chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation) as illustrated previously (59Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Martins L.M.

Samples were photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with an N.A. 1.40 63× objective, a 365-nm excitation filter, and a 420-nm emission filter. Alternatively, for some experiments cells were stained with 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride for 3 h and examined by fluorescence microscopy using excitation and emission filters of 380 and 430 nm, respectively. Parental MCF-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid encoding the C163S mutant of procaspase-3 fused in-frame with enhanced GFP at its C terminus in the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) as described previously (55Kottke T.J.

Cells were incubated with biotinylated Smac/penetratin peptide for 30 min. At the completion of the incubation, cells were released by brief trypsinization, pelleted for 5 min at 500 rpm, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. All further steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by incubation for 20 min in lysis buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) thiodiglycol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 20 nm microcystin, 1 mmα-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. After lysis, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min. Smac/penetratin fusion peptide was recovered from the supernatant by incubation for 3 h with 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting complexes were washed 5 times in lysis buffer and recovered from the beads by heating for 20 min at 70 °C in SDS sample buffer. Polypeptides were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE on a 5–15% acrylamide gradient gel and probed as described below. Treated cells were pelleted at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer consisting of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5 at 21 °C), 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (61Kaufmann S.H.

Polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with antibodies, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using techniques described previously (63Kaufmann S.H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Data shown are representative of the indicated number of replicate experiments. Differences in paired groups were analyzed using a χ2 pairwise analysis withp values indicated in the text. All statistical analysis was done in collaboration with the Department of Statistics, Mayo Clinic and Foundation (Rochester, MN). Smac/DIABLO has been shown to interact with a number of IAPs in vitro and in vivo. Based on structural analyses, which showed that the N-terminal four amino acids of Smac/DIABLO are critical for binding to XIAP (39Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J., Wu, J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that 4–8 amino acids might be sufficient to mediate the effects of Smac/DIABLO in situ. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized peptides (Fig. 1 A) containing 4–8 of the N-terminal amino acids of Smac/DIABLO fused to the penetratin sequence of the Drosophila transcription factor antennapaedia. This peptide carrier was chosen because it is well characterized and has little toxicity when applied to cells in the absence of cargo (64Prochaintz A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 65Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochaintz A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal alanine of Smac/DIABLO has been reported previously (39Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J., Wu, J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) to be critical for the Smac/XIAP interaction, a peptide containing an alanine-to-methionine mutation (A1M peptide, Fig. 1 A) was synthesized as a negative control. To determine whether a Smac/penetratin fusion peptide could successfully interact with IAPs, we treated two cell lines, MCF-7/wt1 and MDA-MB-468, with a biotinylated version of the 8-mer peptide. After a 30-min incubation, cells were washed and lysed in neutral detergent. Polypeptides bound to the Smac/penetratin fusion peptide were recovered with streptavidin-agarose, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. This analysis demonstrated that the Smac/penetratin fusion peptide interacted with XIAP and cIAP1 in both cell lines tested (Fig. 1 B). Reactions run without peptide as well as those run with the A1M mutant peptide served as negative controls. Previous studies have suggested that cleaved caspase-3 is sequestered in cytoplasmic aggregates (54MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J.

This effect is particularly prominent in MCF-7 cells transfected either transiently or stably with procaspase-3 (54MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J.

Fractionation studies indicated that XIAP was present in the same insoluble cell fraction (55Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Meng X.W. Svingen P.A. Ruchaud S. Mesner Jr., P.W. Boerner S.A. Samejima K.

Because release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria would be expected to disrupt caspase-3/XIAP interactions, we examined Smac expression and release from mitochondria in MCF-7 cells. Immunoblotting revealed that Smac was readily detectable in each of the 10 human breast cancer cell lines examined (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). When cells were harvested 48–72 h after the initiation of a 24-h paclitaxel treatment, Smac was readily detectable in cytosol of floating (apoptotic) MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). In contrast, Smac was not released to the cytosol in apoptotic MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), possibly reflecting the recently reported dependence of Smac release on caspase activity (67Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To determine whether this paucity of Smac release might contribute to caspase-3 aggregation in MCF-7 cells, MCF-7 cells transfected with a procaspase-3/GFP fusion construct were treated with paclitaxel in the absence or presence of 80 μg/ml Smac/penetratin peptide. When transfected cells were treated with either diluent or Smac/penetratin peptide alone, none of the cells became apopt"
https://openalex.org/W2056283979,"The Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-binding proteins (GGAs) are multidomain proteins that bind mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) in the Golgi and have an essential role in lysosomal enzyme sorting. Here the GGAs and the coat protein adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) were shown to colocalize in clathrin-coated buds of the trans-Golgi networks of mouse L cells and human HeLa cells. Binding studies revealed a direct interaction between the hinge domains of the GGAs and the gamma-ear domain of AP-1. Further, AP-1 contained bound casein kinase-2 that phosphorylated GGA1 and GGA3, thereby causing autoinhibition. This could induce the directed transfer of the MPRs from GGAs to AP-1. MPRs that are defective in binding to GGAs are poorly incorporated into AP-1-containing clathrin-coated vesicles. Thus, the GGAs and AP-1 interact to package MPRs into AP-1-containing coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2066007662,"The principles that the auditory cortex uses to decipher a stream of acoustic information have remained elusive. Neural responses in the animal auditory cortex can be broadly classified into transient and sustained activity. We examined the existence of similar principles in the human brain. Sound-evoked, blood oxygen level–dependent signal response was decomposed temporally into independent transient and sustained constituents, which predominated in different portions—core and belt—of the auditory cortex. Converging with unit recordings, our data suggest that this spatiotemporal pattern in the auditory cortex may represent a fundamental principle of analyzing sound information."

https://openalex.org/W2021610897,"We previously reported that monoclonal antibodies to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and other membrane-impermeant PDI inhibitors prevented HIV-1 infection. PDI is present at the surface of HIV-1 target cells and reduces disulfide bonds in a model peptide attached to the cell membrane. Here we show that soluble PDI cleaves disulfide bonds in recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp120 and that gp120 bound to the surface receptor CD4 undergoes a disulfide reduction that is prevented by PDI inhibitors. Concentrations of inhibitors that prevent this reduction and inhibit the cleavage of surface-bound disulfide conjugate prevent infection at the level of HIV-1 entry. The entry of HIV-1 strains differing in their coreceptor specificities is similarly inhibited, and so is the reduction of gp120 bound to CD4 of coreceptor-negative cells. PDI inhibitors also prevent HIV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion but have no effect on the entry of HIV-1 pseudo-typed with murine leukemia virus envelope. Importantly, PDI coprecipitates with both soluble and cellular CD4. We propose that a PDI·CD4 association at the cell surface enables PDI to reach CD4-bound virus and to reduce disulfide bonds present in the domain of gp120 that binds to CD4. Conformational changes resulting from the opening of gp120-disulfide loops may drive the processes of virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. The biochemical events described identify new potential targets for anti-HIV agents.

The entry of HIV-1 strains differing in their coreceptor specificities is similarly inhibited, and so is the reduction of gp120 bound to CD4 of coreceptor-negative cells. PDI inhibitors also prevent HIV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion but have no effect on the entry of HIV-1 pseudo-typed with murine leukemia virus envelope. Importantly, PDI coprecipitates with both soluble and cellular CD4. We propose that a PDI·CD4 association at the cell surface enables PDI to reach CD4-bound virus and to reduce disulfide bonds present in the domain of gp120 that binds to CD4. Conformational changes resulting from the opening of gp120-disulfide loops may drive the processes of virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. The biochemical events described identify new potential targets for anti-HIV agents. human immunodeficiency virus protein-disulfide isomerase glycoprotein envelope oligomeric form of gp120 containing the ectodomain of gp41 surface receptor of gp120 soluble CD4 murine leukemia virus amphotropic MLV phenylarsine oxide para-amino PAO 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) triiodothyronine N-acetylated T3 biotinyl 3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3–6-dioxaoctane diamine glutathione RNase S-peptide antibody monoclonal antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 2-mercaptoethanol long terminal repeat horseradish peroxidase 4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)aminophenylarsenoxide The entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 into target cells requires three successive virus-cell interactions, namely the binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Env) to the primary receptor CD4, the attachment of CD4-bound gp120 to coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar), and ultimately, the fusogenic activation of envelope glycoprotein gp41 (2Chan D.C. Fass D.

It is generally accepted that virus binding to CD4 causes major conformational changes in gp120 (5Thali M. Moore J.P. Furman C. Charles M., Ho, D.D. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3978-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7383-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanisms triggering these changes have not been fully characterized. Immunologically detectable conformational changes in gp120 occur upon its binding to the soluble ectodomain of CD4 (sCD4). They expose new gp120 epitopes, one of which overlaps with the binding site of gp120 to coreceptor CCR5 (7Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A.

No cell-mediated triggering factors that for instance would compare with the acid pH-induced conformational changes, which drive the entry of influenza virus, have been identified in HIV-1 entry. Here we describe how a known membrane-associated oxidoreductase, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.2), may cause the major structural changes in HIV-1 envelope that lead to virus entry. PDI is a well characterized 57-kDa oxidoreductase (9Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) that forms, breaks, and rearranges disulfide bonds in nascent proteins reaching the endoplasmic reticulum (10Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Its redox function is based on the presence in its two active sites of a Cys-Gly-His-Cys (CXXC) motif. When the cysteines of CXXC are oxidized, PDI interacts with two cysteinyl thiol groups of a neighboring peptide to form a disulfide bond. When CXXC bears two cysteinyl thiols, it cleaves neighboring disulfide bonds. In the endoplasmic reticulum, PDI acts predominantly as an oxidase (10Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 11Freedman R.B. Hawkins H.C. Murant S.J. Reid L. Biochem. Soc.

An interchange generates two free thiols in a target protein and an oxidized CXXC motif (22Jeng M.F. Holmgren A. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10101-10105Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PDI is inherently a promiscuous enzyme. Its property to bind to different peptides is essential to its function both inside the cell and at the cell surface. The surface functions of PDI are many and include interacting with the receptor of diphtheria toxin to facilitate the transport of the toxic fragment into the cytoplasm (13Mandel R. Ryser H.J.

Rudd M.A. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). PDI may reach the surface in association with other endoplasmic reticulum proteins transported to the cell membrane through a pathway that is subject to regulation (54Rivera A. The Cell Surface-reductive Function of Mammalian Cells and Its Inhibition by Agents That Interfere with Thiol:Sulfide InterchangeDoctoral dissertation.

Cell surface and endoplasmic PDI are biochemically and immunologically identical (23Yoshimori T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol.

Rudd M.A. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Jiang X.M. Fitzgerald M. Grant C.M. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The surface-associated reductive activity of PDI was first demonstrated by monitoring the cleavage of a disulfide-containing poly(d-lysine) conjugate attached nonspecifically to fibroblasts (25Feener E.P. Shen W.C. Ryser H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18780-18785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide reduction was inhibited by membrane-impermeant DTNB and pCMBS that block free thiols (25Feener E.P. Shen W.C. Ryser H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18780-18785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by monoclonal anti-PDI antibodies (13Mandel R. Ryser H.J. Ghani F., Wu, M. Peak D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4112-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We showed subsequently that monoclonal anti-PDI antibodies and two small molecular PDI inhibitors prevented HIV-1 infection and that prevention was observed only when the agents were present at the time of virus-cell interaction (26Ryser H.J. Levy E.M. Mandel R. DiSciullo G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4559-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This suggested that inhibitors interfered with virus entry. This finding led to the hypothesis that surface PDI associates with the HIV receptor CD4, and through that association, it reaches and reduces a gp120-disulfide bond situated in the region of gp120 that binds to CD4. This hypothesis implied that the cleavage of a loop-forming disulfide bond might cause the conformational changes in gp120 that are required to activate the fusogenic function of gp41. The following sequence of experiments was carried out to support this hypothesis. 1) We confirmed that HIV-1 target cells are capable of reducing disulfide bonds in proteins that bind to their surface (Fig. 1 A). 2) The physical association of PDI and CD4 was demonstrated by coprecipitation of soluble CD4 with affinity-labeled soluble PDI (Fig. 1 C) and by coprecipitation of cellular PDI with affinity-labeled cellular CD4 (Fig. 1 D). 3) We showed that soluble PDI is capable of reducing disulfide bonds in soluble gp120 and that the PDI-induced opening of a disulfide loop caused conformational changes in gp120 (Fig. 2). 4) We showed that gp120 bound to the primary HIV receptor CD4 on target cells also undergoes a disulfide reduction that is inhibited by PDI inhibitors (Fig. 3). 5) We showed that the same inhibitors at the same concentrations also prevent HIV entry into target cells (Fig. 4).Figure 2Reduction by soluble PDI of the gp120-disulfide bond forming the V3 loop. Recombinant gp120IIIB was incubated in the presence of the following reagents. Lane 1, thrombin alone (Th); lane 2, 5% 2ME; lane 3, thrombin followed by 2-ME (Th-2ME); lane 4, PDI alone (50 μg/ml in 1.0 mm GSH); lane 5, thrombin followed by PDI (Th PDI), which followed by GSH alone failed to fragment gp120; lane 6, PDI followed by thrombin (PDI Th). Thrombin followed by 2ME (lane 3) or by PDI (lane 5) cause fragmentations of gp120 in 70- and 50-kDa moieties. When gp120 was treated first with PDI followed by thrombin, more than two fragments were detected (lane 6). Used alone, thrombin (lane 1), 2ME (lane 2), and PDI (lane 4) do not fragment gp120. The top band in lanes 1 and 4–6 corresponds to a gp120 oligomer that is dissociated by 2ME (lanes 2 and 3). Env and its fragments are detected with polyclonal anti-gp140 Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Reduction of disulfide bonds in recombinant gp120 and gp140 upon binding to the CD4 receptor of target cells.

The thiol-specific biotinylating agents and biotin-specific reagents used were as follows: membrane-impermeant biotinyl 3-maleimido propionamidyl-3–6-dioxaoctane diamine (MPDOD, Molecular BioSciences, Boulder, CO); Biotin-BMCC, Ultralink Immobilized NeutrAvidin, and HRP-NeutrAvidin (all from Pierce); phenylarsine oxide (PAO), T3, and DTNB; and thrombin and anti-CD4-FITC mAb Q4120 (Sigma). Para-amino-PAO (aPAO) was prepared according to a published procedure (28Stevenson K.J. Hale G. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To increase water solubility of T3, its α-amino group was acetylated as follows: 100 mg of T3 and 50 mg of N-acetic acidN-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester were dissolved separately in 0.5 ml of dimethylformamide. The two solutions were mixed and allowed to react overnight at room temperature. The reacted mixture was added to 30 ml of 1 × 10−3m HCl and kept for 30–45 min at 4 °C to precipitate N-acetylated T3 (AT3). After centrifugation, the precipitate was washed 3 times with 20 ml of water and dried at room temperature under vacuum. The purity of AT3 determined by thin-layer chromatography was >90%, and unreacted T3 was the only byproduct. The inhibitory potency of AT3 was routinely tested on the reductive activity of the cell surface. AMD3100 was a gift from AnorMED (Langley, British Columbia, Canada). Several hybridomas producing anti-PDI antibodies, in particular mAb RL77 used here for immunodetection, were provided by C. S. Kaetzel (29Kaetzel C.S. Rao C.K. Lamm M.E. Biochem.

Anti-CCR5-FITC mAb 2D7 was from BD Biosciences, and anti-mouse Ig(H+L)-FITC was from Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). Anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a, anti-HLA-DR-FITC mAb 243 as well as FACScan and CellQuest software were from BD Biosciences. The following reagents were obtained through the National Institutes of Health (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS): antibodies, anti-CXCR4 mAb 12G5 (from J. Hoxie), CD4 antiserum T4-4 (from R. Sweet), CD4 hybridoma SIM-2 (from J. Hildreth), and 1G5 (from E. Aguilar-Cordova and J. Belmont); cell lines, U87.CD4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 (from H. K. Deng and D.

Purified PDI was assayed by measuring its ability to cleave the disulfide of [125I]tyramine-SS-poly(d-lysine) in solution (13Mandel R. Ryser H.J. Ghani F., Wu, M. Peak D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Glutathione (GSH) (0.1 mm) was added to ensure that the CXXC motif of PDI was in a reduced state. No such addition was required to measure the activity of cell surface PDI, indicating that PDI is present on the cell surface in a reduced redox state. To assay the reductive activity of the cell surface, labeled [125I]tyramine-SS-poly(d-lysine) was bound to cells at 0 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed and incubated in PBS (30 min at 37 °C). After PDI had been inactivated by 80 mm N-ethylmaleimide, cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100, and the 25% trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity released during incubation was determined. Soluble PDI biotinylated on its thiols with membrane-impermeant MPDOD was purified by ultrafiltration and mixed with an equimolar amount of non-biotinylated soluble CD4 (1 h at 25 °C). After precipitation with immobilized avidin, separation by SDS-PAGE, and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, PDI and CD4 were immunodetected on the same blot with mAb RL77 and CD4 antiserum. In control experiments, CD4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-CD4 mAb Leu3a and, upon probing with HRP-NeutrAvidin, was not biotinylated. CD4 cDNA (30Maddon P.J. Littman D.R. Godfrey M. Maddon D.E.

A similar procedure was used to engineer the cDNAs of coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to obtain Spep coreceptors (32Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M., Di Marzio P. Marmon S.

Spep-tagged CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 were functional in mediating cell-cell fusion. 2M. Trahey, S. J. Larson, and J. H. Nunberg, manuscript in preparation. Human 293 cells (1 × 106/6-cm dish) were transfected with CD4-, CCR5-, and CXCR4-Spep plasmids using FuGENE 6 Reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Two days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% Brij-97, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Lysates were precleared with 100 μl of bovine serum albumin-agarose (4 °C for 30 min) and then mixed (2 h at 4 °C) with 50 μl of S-protein-agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) to precipitate Spep-tagged proteins. Precipitates were washed 5 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and proteins eluted with Laemmli buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and duplicate blots were probed for CD4 with mAb SIM-2 or for PDI with mAb RL77. The surface of 5 × 107 U937 cells was labeled with 1 ml of 0.5 mm membrane-impermeant thiol-specific MPDOD (0 °C for 30 min) to tag the thiols of PDI and other surface proteins. Cells were washed with cold Hanks' buffered saline solution and lysed in 200 mm Tris, pH 8.3, containing 0.6% CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Biotinylated proteins were isolated with immobilized avidin and resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred. The membrane was probed for PDI with mAb R77, stripped, and reprobed for CD4 with CD4 anti-serum. Cellular CD4 and PDI have a similar electrophoretic mobility. This probing identified both proteins. Recombinant gp120IIIB (100 μg/ml) was treated with thrombin (200 μg/ml, 120 min at 37 °C) to make a proteolytic cut near the tip of the V3 loop. Subsequent reduction of the V3-disulfide bond is known to cleave gp120 into a 70-kDa N-terminal and a 50-kDa C-terminal fragment (33Clements G.J. Price-Jones M.J. Stephens P.E. Sutton C. Schulz T.F.

Reduction was carried out with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (control) or with PDI (50 μg/ml in 1 mmGSH). Following separation by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, gp120 and its fragments were detected with polyclonal anti-gp140 antibody R2143. Recombinant gp120IIIB, gp120JR-FL, or oligomeric gp140IIIB(BH8) (10 μg/ml) (34Earl P.L. Broder C.C. Long D. Lee S.A. Peterson J. Chakrabarti S. Doms R.W. Moss B. J.

After washing, cells were labeled (40 min, at 0 °C) with Biotin-BMCC (0.5 mm) to biotinylate newly generated thiols, washed, and lysed (20 min at 4 °C) in PBS containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 (or 0.6% CHAPS), 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. When using gp140, the envelope glycoprotein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-gp140 antibody R2143 and immobilized protein G, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for biotin using HRP-NeutrAvidin. Western blots were stripped and reprobed with mouse anti-gp120 mAb D19 to assess Env binding to CD4. When using gp120IIIB, thiol-biotinylated surface proteins were isolated with immobilized avidin. Western blots were then probed for Env with Ab R2143 and probed for PDI with mAb RL77. They were stripped and reprobed for CD4 with CD4 antiserum. In other experiments, the CCR5-tropic gp120JR-FL was incubated with U87.CD4 cells that did or did not express the CCR5 coreceptor. The newly generated protein thiols were biotinylated, isolated, and probed for envelope as in experiments using gp120IIIB. HIV-1NL4-3 and HIV-1JR-FL were generated by infection of SupT1 cells and PM1 cells, respectively, with cell-free viruses. Alternatively, SupT1 cells were transfected with pNL4-3. The pseudotyped HIV-1 was generated by transfection of COS-7 with pSV-A-MLV-Env and with pHIV-gpt (15 μg each) according to Page et al. (35Page K.A. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 titers were measured using an HIV-1 p24 antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Coulter Immunotech, Hialeah, FL). Harvested viruses were filtered and stored at −80 °C. The virus stocks were routinely tested for contamination with proviral or plasmid DNA by PCR and, if necessary, were treated with RNase-free DNase. Ecotropic MLV pseudotyped murine stem cell virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein was generated according to Hawley et al. (36Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T."

Middle Archean mantle depletion events initiated craton keel formation and early harzburgitic diamond formation. Late Archean accretionary events involving an oceanic lithosphere component stabilized the craton and contributed a younger Archean generation of eclogitic diamonds. Subsequent Proterozoic tectonic and magmatic events altered the composition of the continental lithosphere and added new lherzolitic and eclogitic diamonds to the Archean diamond suite.
https://openalex.org/W2096303236,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) glycoprotein (gp) 120 is a highly disulfide-bonded molecule that attaches HIV to the lymphocyte surface receptors CD4 and CXCR4. Conformation changes within gp120 result from binding and trigger HIV/cell fusion. Inhibition of lymphocyte surface-associated protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) blocks HIV/cell fusion, suggesting that redox changes within Env are required. Using a sensitive assay based on a thiol reagent, we show that (i) the thiol content of gp120, either secreted by mammalian cells or bound to a lymphocyte surface enabling CD4 but not CXCR4 binding, was 0.5-1 pmol SH/pmol gp120 (SH/gp120), whereas that of gp120 after its interaction with a surface enabling both CD4 and CXCR4 binding was raised to 4 SH/gp120; (ii) PDI inhibitors prevented this change; and (iii) gp120 displaying 2 SH/gp120 exhibited CD4 but not CXCR4 binding capacity. In addition, PDI inhibition did not impair gp120 binding to receptors. We conclude that on average two of the nine disulfides of gp120 are reduced during interaction with the lymphocyte surface after CXCR4 binding prior to fusion and that cell surface PDI catalyzes this process. Disulfide bond restructuring within Env may constitute the molecular basis of the post-receptor binding conformational changes that induce fusion competence."
https://openalex.org/W2040146794,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a member of an emerging family of immediate-early gene products that coordinate complex biological processes during differentiation and tissue repair. Here we describe the role of CTGF in integrin-mediated adhesive signaling and the production of extracellular matrix components in human mesangial cells. The addition of CTGF to primary mesangial cells induced fibronectin production, cell migration, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. These functional responses were associated with recruitment of Src and phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK and protein kinase B. The inhibition of CTGF-induced p42/44 MAPK or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B pathway activities abrogated the induction of fibronectin expression. In addition, anti-β3integrin antibodies attenuated the activation of both the p42/44 MAPK and protein kinase B and the increase in fibronectin levels. CTGF also induced mesangial cell migration via a β3integrin-dependent mechanism that was similarly sensitive to the inhibition of the p42/44 MAPK and PI3K pathways, and it promoted the adhesion of the mesangial cells to type I collagen via up-regulation of α1 integrin. Transient actin cytoskeletal disassembly was observed following treatment with the ligand over the course of a 24-h period. CTGF induced the loss of focal adhesions from the mesangial cell as evidenced by the loss of punctate vinculin. However, these processes are p42/44 MAPK and PI3K pathway-independent. Our data support the hypothesis that CTGF mediates a number of its biological effects by the induction of signaling processes via β3 integrin. However, others such as actin cytoskeleton disassembly are modulated in a β3integrin/MAPK/PI3K-independent manner, indicating that CTGF is a complex pleiotropic factor with the potential to amplify primary pathophysiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1999902547,"The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) is a type 1 transmembrane protein found primarily on endothelium that binds both protein C and activated protein C with similar affinity. EPCR augments the activation of protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. To determine the physiological importance of EPCR, we generated EPCR-deficient mice by homologous targeting in embryonic stem cells. Genotyping of progeny obtained from EPCR+/− interbreeding indicated that EPCR−/− embryos died on or before embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). Reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed the absence of EPCR mRNA in EPCR−/− embryos. EPCR−/− embryos removed from extra-embryonic membranes and tissues at day E7.5 and cultured in vitro developed beyond E10.5, suggesting a role for EPCR in the normal function of the placenta and/or at the materno-embryonic interface. Immunohistochemistry revealed the lack of EPCR in trophoblast giant cells of EPCR−/− embryos. These cells, which normally express EPCR, are in direct contact with the maternal circulation and its clotting factors. In EPCR−/− embryos, greatly increased fibrin deposition was detected around these cells. To prevent this fibrin deposition, EPCR+/−-crossed female mice received a daily subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin through pregnancy.

Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Haematologia. 1999; 84: 363-368Google Scholar). Thrombin not only activates platelets and clots fibrinogen, but it also binds to thrombomodulin (TM)1 on the endothelium, at which time the procoagulant activities of thrombin are blocked, whereas the activation of the anticoagulant protein C is potently enhanced (2Esmon C.T. Owen W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2249-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar,3Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Harris K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7944-7947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) binds protein C and increases the rate of protein C activation on the endothelium (4Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar).In vivo, protein C binding to EPCR enhances the amount of activated protein C (APC) generated in response to thrombin infusion more than 10-fold (5Taylor Jr., F.B. Peer G.T. Lockhart M.S. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2001; 97: 1685-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the receptor plays a key physiological function in the activation complex. EPCR is a type 1 transmembrane receptor that shares homology with the major histocompatibility class 1/CD1 family of proteins involved in the immune response (6Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Simmonds R.E. Lane D.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the sequence homology, the crystal structure of EPCR reveals that, like the CD1 family of molecules, EPCR has a tightly bound lipid located in a groove that is structurally similar to that used by the CD1 family for antigen presentation (8Oganesyan V. Oganesyan N. Terzyan S., Qu, D. Dauter Z. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24851-24854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In adults, EPCR is primarily localized on endothelial cells of large blood vessels (9Laszik Z. Mitro A. Taylor Jr., F.B. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), but during development, EPCR is expressed at high levels on the trophoblast giant cells (10Crawley J.T.B., Gu, J.-M. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). EPCR expression is very low or absent from the microvasculature endothelium of most tissues, with the major exception being the sinusoidal capillaries of the liver (9Laszik Z. Mitro A. Taylor Jr., F.B. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Both cellular and soluble EPCR (sEPCR) appear to have biological functions. sEPCR is present in normal plasma (∼100 ng/ml) (11Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is released from the endothelium by a metalloproteinase (12Xu J., Qu, D. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 6038-6044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A variety of mediators, including interleukin-1, hydrogen peroxide, phorbol esters, and thrombin dramatically increase EPCR shedding from the endothelium. This probably explains the elevated levels of plasma sEPCR found in patients with sepsis or lupus erythematosus (13Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Carson C.W. D'Angelo A. Della Valle P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 725-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased shedding of cellular EPCR and the up-regulation of its mRNA in a sepsis model implies that this process may be important for some physiological function of EPCR (14Gu J.-M. Katsuura Y. Ferrell G.L. Grammas P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2000; 95: 1687-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, sEPCR has been shown to retain its binding affinity for protein C/APC (11Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). sEPCR also binds to activated leukocytes, in a process mediated in part through proteinase 3 (15Kurosawa S. Esmon C.T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4697-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the autoantigen of Wegener's granulomatosis. The proteinase 3-sEPCR complex binds to integrins on the surface of activated neutrophils. Interestingly, in a baboon sepsis model, blocking protein C binding to EPCR exacerbated the coagulation and inflammatory responses that result from low level Escherichia coli infusions (16Taylor Jr., F.B. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Ferrell G. Chang A.C.K. Laszik Z. Kosanke S. Peer G. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2000; 95: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, massive polymorphonuclear cell influx into specific areas of the adrenal gland, liver, and kidneys of these animals suggests that EPCR might also function in neutrophil interactions and leukocyte trafficking. Recently, several heterozygous EPCR mutations were identified in an Italian population (17Biguzzi E. Merati G. Liaw P.C.Y. Bucciarelli P. Oganesyan N., Qu, D., Gu, J.-M. Fetiveau R. Esmon C.T. Mannucci P.M. Faioni E.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, homozygous EPCR deficiency has not been described in humans to date. To better define the physiological and pathophysiological role of EPCR, we disrupted the EPCR gene in embryonic stem (ES) cells and subsequently generated mice that carried the disrupted EPCR gene to their progeny. In this work, we report that homozygous EPCR-deficient embryos die in utero on or before embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). The severe EPCR-null phenotype is associated with fibrin deposition at the materno-embryonic interface of EPCR−/− embryos, particularly around the trophoblast giant cells that normally express high levels of EPCR. This observation provides the first genetic evidence that EPCR plays a critical role in the regulation of blood coagulation. To construct a gene targeting vector, the vector, p1338 (a kind gift from Dr. Tim Ley, Washington University, St. Louis), containing the 1.7-kb neomycin/G418 resistance (neoR) gene under control of the mouse PGK-1 promoter and flanked by two directly repeated LoxP sites (5′-AACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTAT-3′) (18Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) was used. A 3.0-kb, NotI/XhoI fragment, corresponding to exons 2–4 of the murine EPCR gene, was inserted downstream of the neoR sequence. The 3.0-kbHindIII/BamHI fragment (representing 0.8 kb of the EPCR 5′-promoter region, exon 1, and 1.2 kb of intron 1 (19Liang Z. Rosen E.D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)) was then inserted into the above vector, upstream of the neoR sequence. To facilitate the deletion ofEPCR exon 1, a third LoxP site was positioned in theEPCR promoter region (−158, Bsu36I site) (Fig.1). Restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing of ligation junctions confirmed the structure of the targeting vector. We utilized the Cre/Lox system in order to facilitate generation of mutant mice for future investigations. The targeting vector was linearized with HindIII and introduced by electroporation into AB2 129 mouse ES cells (Lexicon Genetics). Transfected ES cells were grown on irradiated neomycin-resistant mouse embryonic fibroblasts and LIF (1000 units/ml) (Invitrogen) and selected for in the presence of G-418 (300 μg/ml). Initially, PCR was used to screen the G-418-resistant clones (primers mP2170, 5′-GCCATAATGAAACCCCTTACTATACATAC-3′, complementary to a region of the EPCR promoter upstream of the segment used in the targeting vector; Lox5a, 5′-ACATTATACGAAGTTATACGCGTGCAG-3′, complementary to the sequence of the first loxP site). PCR conditions involved 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min, with a final 10-min extension. The PCR-positive ES clones were further confirmed by Southern blot using three different probes: 5′-external probe (probe “a,” 918 bp, BclI/EcoRV fragment), 3′-external probe (probe “b,” 700 bp,XhoI/HincII fragment), and a “neo” probe (1 kb). To delete the region of the EPCR gene flanked by LoxP sites, those ES cells exhibiting correct homologous targeting were transiently transfected with the vector pBS-500/Cre-GFP (a gift of Dr. B. Sauer, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK) and grown in the absence of G-418. Thereafter, PCR was performed to screen for loss of the EPCR exon 1/intron 1/neoR gene fragment. A 0.65-kb PCR product was generated by primers for the mutant allele: mP280, 5′-CTCCCCCTTTTCCGCTCCTCCTC-3′ (in the promoter region of the EPCR construct); mINb, 5′-GAGGGCAGAGTCAGCGCGTCA-3′ (in intron 1 of theEPCR construct). Southern blotting was employed to further confirm the deletion of this region using probes a and b after digestion of ES cell DNA with either BglII,HincII, or BclI (Fig. 1). Heterozygous ES cells (LoxK + Cre, clone 7E10-1A1) carrying targeted homologous recombination at the EPCR locus and also exhibiting normal karyotype were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and surgically implanted into uteri of pseudopregnant foster mothers. 10 chimeric males (50–100% coat color) were generated, and at 6 weeks of age were mated with female Black Swiss mice. From these matings, four chimeras demonstrated germ-line transmission. Tail biopsies were obtained from agouti (F1) mice for genotyping. Starting at F2, the heterozygous EPCR (EPCR+/−) mice were interbred to generate homozygous EPCR (EPCR−/−) progeny. To reduce the generation of congenicity in the mouse lines, breeding partners were regularly intermixed. All animals used in this research were housed in an AAALAC-approved animal facility at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. Genomic DNA from ES cells and embryos was prepared by proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform (24:1) extraction, and precipitation with isopropyl alcohol. Mouse tail DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and used directly for PCR. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA (∼15 μg) was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, electrophoresed through 0.9% agarose gels, and transferred to an N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized at 42 °C for at least 16 h with DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). PCR was performed to genotype embryos and tail biopsies. PCR primers were selected to generate a product specific for either the wild-type (WT) or the mutant EPCR alleles. Two PCRs were performed on each DNA sample and electrophoresed in adjacent lanes. For the WT allele, a 660-bp PCR product was generated using primers mP280 and mg3720 (5′-TAGGGTTTCCCTATCTGTCCATCTC-3′, a region of EPCR intron 1 absent in the mutant allele), or a 360-bp PCR product using primers mP280 and M1 (5′-CATCGGAGTTACAAAGGGCGCAG-3′, a region ofEPCR exon 1). For the mutant allele, a truncated 640-bp PCR product was generated by sense primer mP280, and antisense primer mINb. In WT mice, a PCR product was found only with primers to the WT EPCR allele; both PCR products were found in EPCR+/− mice, and only the PCR product generated by primers to the mutant allele was found in EPCR−/− mice. PCR conditions were as described earlier using an extension time of 1 min. For genotyping of microscope sections, embryonic tissue was scraped from several slides under the microscope and pooled in 30 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% Nonidet-40, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 55 °C overnight. Lysates were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged for 5 min, and 1 μl of lysate was used for PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from embryos using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA was prepared using the Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Super First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed using murine EPCR-specific primers (20Gu J.M. Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12481-12488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), TM-specific primers (sense primers, 5′-GCAGCTTGGAGAATGGTGGCTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GAACTTCTGCAGCGTCCGATCAG-3′), and murine α-actin primers (Clontech), which amplified 300-bp, 1.0-kb, and 530-bp PCR products, respectively. Embryos (n = 12) were dissected from EPCR+/−-crossed females at E7.5. The decidual tissue and embryonic membranes (yolk sac, etc.) were removed and embryos rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Embryos were placed in 6-cm dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 50% rat serum and 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) (21Baldwin H.S. Lloyd T.R. Solursh M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Healy A.M. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Weiler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Embryos were cultured for 4 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with gentle agitation and monitored daily under the microscope. Timed matings between EPCR+/− mice were set up. The developmental progress of the developing embryos was estimated by the gestational age, with day 0.5 post-coitum defined as the morning that a vaginal plug was detected. Pregnant mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, and placental/embryonic tissues were removed. For whole mount analysis, embryos were removed and viewed directly under the microscope. For sectioning, tissues were washed briefly with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C for 2 h, and cryo-protected in 0.5 m sucrose/PBS. Finally, specimens were mounted in OCT compound, snap-frozen in isopentane-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To evaluate the contribution of thrombus formation to EPCR−/− embryo development, pregnant EPCR+/−-crossed mice received a daily subcutaneous injection of the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin (4 μg/g of body weight) beginning at the 4th day of pregnancy. Some mice were injected daily to full term, and others were sacrificed, and the embryonic/maternal decidual tissue was removed for genotyping and immunohistochemistry. Two rat monoclonal antibodies (1560 and 1559, both IgG2b), and a goat polyclonal antibody, all reactive with murine EPCR were used as described previously (10Crawley J.T.B., Gu, J.-M. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the identification of endothelial cells and leukocytes, rat anti-murine CD31 and rat anti-murine CD45 antibodies (Pharmingen) were used. Non-immune rat IgG2b (Pharmingen) or preimmune goat serum used as negative controls consistently gave no staining. Primary antibodies were detected with rabbit anti-rat IgG (mouse-adsorbed) or rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies conjugated to either biotin or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector). Biotinylated antibodies were detected with streptavidin coupled to either horseradish peroxidase or Texas Red (Vector). For the detection of fibrin, a mouse anti-human fibrin antibody (a gift from Dr. M. Runge, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) was biotinylated using EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This antibody has been reported previously (23Healy A.M. Hancock W.W. Christie P.D. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 4188-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be specific for mouse fibrin and not fibrinogen. For the purposes of immunostaining, this antibody was tested. Briefly, EAhy926 cells were grown to confluency in 4-well chamber slides. Mouse fibrinogen (25 μg) in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to each well. To two wells, 5 units of bovine thrombin was also added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then fixed and immunostained, using streptavidin-Texas Red for detection. Cells incubated with both mouse fibrinogen and thrombin stained strongly for fibrin, whereas staining was undetectable on those cells incubated with mouse fibrinogen alone (not shown). For histological analysis, hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed upon sections of mouse maternal/embryonic specimens. Immunostaining using the antibodies described above was performed upon serially cut sections (8 μm) of mouse tissue specimens as reported previously (10Crawley J.T.B., Gu, J.-M. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Plasma sEPCR and tissue EPCR were measured using goat anti-murine EPCR polyclonal antibodies and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (14Gu J.-M. Katsuura Y. Ferrell G.L. Grammas P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2000; 95: 1687-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except plasma samples were used rather than serum. The murineEPCR gene spans 8.8 kb and is composed of 4 exons and 3 introns (6Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To facilitate disruption of the EPCR gene, we generated a targeting vector in which exon 1 (encoding the 5′-untranslated region, ATG start codon, signal peptide, and part of the extracellular domain) and part of intron 1 of the murineEPCR gene (1.56 kb) was flanked by two loxP sites. This vector contained an additional LoxP-flanked neoR cassette for selection purposes. Following introduction of the targeting vector into AB2 ES cells, we identified 17 positive clones (out of a total of 880 G418-resistant colonies) that by PCR screening were found to contain the targeted EPCR gene. Southern blot analysis revealed 6 clones with the correct homologous recombination at theEPCR locus (Fig. 1). Subsequently, 3 positive ES clones were transiently transfected with a Cre recombinase expression vector, and those clones in which theEPCR exon 1/intron 1/neoR had been excised were identified by Southern blotting. Mice were raised from the targeted ES cells and shown to transmit the mutant allele to their offspring by two independent PCR strategies. Macroscopic examination of EPCR+/− embryos suggested that the heterozygotes develop normally. By the comparison of the Theiler stages of EPCR+/− and EPCR+/+ littermates, we found no obvious developmental abnormalities associated with EPCR heterozygosity (not shown). Adult EPCR+/− mice were of normal size and weight and appeared to have normal viability and fertility. Out of 176 EPCR+/− mice monitored during the initial observation period of 10 months, none died or showed any evidence of thrombotic complications, as determined by gross examination. Microscopic examination of the major organs of adult heterozygous EPCR+/− mice did not indicate any abnormalities when compared with tissues obtained from EPCR+/+ littermates (not shown). The amount of sEPCR in plasma and tissue EPCR in whole lung extracts from EPCR+/− mice (58 ± 17 ng/ml (n = 16) and 302 ± 145 ng/g (n = 22), respectively) was approximately half that detected in WT mice (106 ± 30 ng/ml (n = 16) and 582 ± 257 ng/g (n = 22), respectively). Crosses between EPCR+/− mice did not result in any viable EPCR−/− progeny. Out of 410 mice born to heterozygous breeding pairs of agouti mice (50% Black Swiss/50% 129SvEv), 117 (29%) were identified as EPCR+/+, 293 (71%) were EPCR+/−, and 0 were homozygous EPCR−/−. Of 109 mice born from EPCR+/− pairs back-crossed with the 129SvEv genetic background, 43 (39%) were EPCR+/+, 66 (61%) were EPCR+/−, and again no EPCR−/−mice were identified. Because of the origin of the ES cells utilized, when the chimeras were bred to 129SvEv mice, the resultant offspring were in a pure 129SvEv background. The ∼2:1 ratio of EPCR+/− to EPCR+/+ progeny highlights the normal viability of EPCR+/− mice. Furthermore, the absence of any EPCR−/− pups demonstrates that homozygous EPCR deficiency in mice results in an embryonic lethal phenotype. To determine at what point during gestation EPCR−/−embryos were lost, male and female EPCR+/− mice were interbred. Embryos were collected at different developmental time points (E7.5–E14.5) and genotyped (TableI). The numbers of EPCR−/−embryos began to deviate from a normal predicted Mendelian distribution on or before day E10.5. Genotyping of E9.5 embryos was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig.2 B). RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from embryonic tissues demonstrated, as expected, that EPCR transcripts were detectable in WT, at decreased levels in EPCR+/−, and absent from EPCR−/− embryos. After E10.5, only EPCR+/+ and EPCR+/− embryos were found. The remains of resorbed embryos that were frequently seen after this time (and presumed to be primarily of EPCR−/−origin) could not be genotyped using these methods.Table IProgeny from EPCR+/− interbreedingEmbryo stageNo. littersNo. offspringNo. embryos genotypedEPCR genotypeNo. resorptionsNo. observed (% offspring)+/++/−−/−E7.544242923100(21)(55)(24)(0)E8.533232714110(22)(44)(34)(0)E9.04444211238aEmbryos were visually smaller and developmentally retarded.2(25)(55)(21)(4)E9.55514612259aEmbryos were visually smaller and developmentally retarded.5bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).(24)(49)(17)(10)E10.5429257162aEmbryos were visually smaller and developmentally retarded.bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).4bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).(24)(55)(7)(14)E11.5327185130bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).9bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).(19)(48)(0)(33)E12.5430228140bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).8bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).(27)(47)(0)(27)E14.5432257180bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).7bp < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions).(22)(56)(0)(22)Expected %255025<2a Embryos were visually smaller and developmentally retarded.b p < 0.01 (difference between observed and expected frequencies derived by the confidence interval for binomial distributions). Open table in a new tab Immunostaining has revealed previously that in WT mouse embryos, EPCR is produced by the embryonic trophoblast giant cells of the trophectoderm at E7.5 (10Crawley J.T.B., Gu, J.-M. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which surround the embryo and are in direct contact with the maternal circulation. Staining of EPCR−/− embryos demonstrated the absence of EPCR from these cells at this time (not shown). The effects of the ablation of EPCR expression were not evident at this stage, as EPCR−/− embryos were indistinguishable either by size or morphology from their littermates. However, from E8.0 certain differences between the EPCR+/+ or EPCR+/− and the EPCR−/− embryos were observed. Although the EPCR-null embryos appeared morphologically normal, they were smaller than their EPCR+/+ or EPCR+/− littermates (Fig.3, A and B). By E8.5, all embryos typically had between 6 and 12 pairs of somites. At this time, EPCR−/− embryos appeared relatively normal with respect to their morphological characteristics, including the formation of neural folds and the development of a primitive heart (Theiler stage 11), although the size difference between these embryos and their EPCR+/+ and EPCR+/− littermates was more apparent. The extra-embryonic membranes, including the yolk sac, amnion, and Reichert's membrane/parietal endoderm were present and appeared normal in all genotypes. In addition, islands of nucleated red blood cells could be clearly seen within the yolk sac, indicating that EPCR is unlikely to have a major function in the development of the yolk sac vasculature. This hypothesis corroborated our previous finding that EPCR is undetectable in the yolk sac of WT embryos (10Crawley J.T.B., Gu, J.-M. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At E9.5, EPCR-null embryos were markedly smaller than their EPCR+/+ and EPCR+/− littermates (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, they appeared developmentally retarded. While by E9.5, EPCR+/+ and EPCR+/− embryos had generally reached Theiler stage 14–15 (optic vesicle and limb bud formation), homozygotes did not seem to progress past Theiler stage 13. Indeed, no EPCR−/− embryos examined were found to have completed axial rotation (normally completed ∼E9.5; Theiler stage 15). Despite their reduced size at E9.5, the heart of EPCR−/− embryos was identifiable (Fig.3D, red box). This sagittal section depicts an EPCR−/− embryo that exhibits signs of the onset of resorption, highlighted by the disappearance of the embryonic space, which is normally filled with amniotic fluid. Furthermore, the extra-embryonic membranes are discontinuous, and the embryo appears compacted. The trophoblast giant cells at the feto-maternal border (identifiable by their large nuclei) were the only cell type of embryonic derivation found to stain positive for EPCR in either EPCR+/+ (Fig. 3, C and E) or EPCR+/− embryos at E9.5. No staining for EPCR was seen in the trophoblast giant cells of EPCR−/− embryos (Fig. 3,D and F). It therefore seems likely the absence of EPCR expression from the giant cells contributes to the embryonic lethality at this developmental stage. EPCR was detected in comparatively high amounts in endothelial cells and the cells of the compact decidual layer of the EPCR+/−maternal uterus. More"

Recently, ∼180 secretory and 114 lipoprotein signal peptides were predicted to direct protein export from the cytoplasm. Whereas most exported proteins appear to use the Sec pathway, 69 of these proteins could potentially use the Tat pathway, as their signal peptides contain RR- or KR-motifs. In the present studies, proteomic techniques were applied to verify how many extracellular B. subtilis proteins follow the Tat pathway. Strikingly, the extracellular accumulation of 13 proteins with potential RR/KR-signal peptides was Tat-independent, showing that their RR/KR-motifs are not recognized by the Tat machinery. In fact, only the phosphodiesterase PhoD was shown to be secreted in a strictly Tat-dependent manner. Sodium azide-inhibition of SecA strongly affected the extracellular appearance of de novosynthesized proteins, including the lipase LipA and two other proteins with predicted RR/KR-signal peptides. The SecA-dependent export of pre-LipA is particularly remarkable, because its RR-signal peptide conforms well to stringent criteria for the prediction of Tat-dependent export in Escherichia coli. Taken together, our observations show that the Tat pathway makes a highly selective contribution to the extracellular proteome of B. subtilis.

Taken together, our observations show that the Tat pathway makes a highly selective contribution to the extracellular proteome of B. subtilis. The Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, is well known for its ability to secrete a large variety of proteins into its extracellular environment. Based on the complete genome sequence (1Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar), it was recently predicted that the extracellular proteome of this organism is composed of ∼180 different proteins (2Tjalsma H.

Indeed, a two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis showed that about 200 distinct spots representing extracellular proteins can be separated, among which 82 different proteins were identified (4Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To date, it is not known to what extent each of the various known protein export pathways contributes to the composition of the extracellular proteome.Four pathways for protein export are known to be present inB. subtilis. As judged by the characteristic tripartite structure of their signal peptides, the majority of secretory proteins (∼160) has the potential to be exported from the cytoplasm via the Sec (protein secretion) pathway (2Tjalsma H.

In addition, this pathway is required for the export of 114 potential lipoproteins that remain anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane (5Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z., Wu, H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Notably, some of these lipoproteins are released into the growth medium by secondary processing events (4Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In contrast, small numbers of proteins are exported via the dedicated pseudopilin export pathway (Com) for competence development (∼4) andATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (∼4) (2Tjalsma H.

Importantly, the number of proteins exported via the Tat 1The abbreviations used are: Tat, twin-arginine translocation; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; Km, kanamycin 1The abbreviations used are: Tat, twin-arginine translocation; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; Km, kanamycin(twin-arginine translocation) pathway of B. subtilis was, so far, difficult to estimate on the basis of signal peptide predictions (6Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Typical twin-arginine (RR) signal peptides that direct Tat-dependent protein export in Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, or Tat-dependent protein import into the thylakoid lumen of chloroplasts, are characterized by the presence of a so-called “twin-arginine” consensus motif (RRXφφ, where φ is a hydrophobic residue). In this RR-motif, the twin-arginines and the hydrophobic residues at the +2 and +3 positions were shown to be important for Tat-dependent export. Furthermore, it was reported that these RR-signal peptides are generally longer and less hydrophobic than Sec-type signal peptides (7Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M., Ma, X. Cline K. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Brink S. Bogsch E.G. Edwards W.R. Hynds P.J. Robinson C.

Strikingly, however, the first arginine residue of the typical RR-pair, which was initially believed to be invariant, could be substituted for a lysine residue without blocking the Tat-dependent export of the E. coliSufI protein (12Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Moreover, naturally occurring KR-signal peptides, in which the first of the two invariant arginine residues was replaced with a lysine residue, were shown to direct the Tat-dependent translocation of the Salmonella enterica TtrB protein and the Spinacia oleracea Rieske Fe/S protein (13Hinsley A.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42761-42766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Even an RNR-signal peptide was recently shown to direct a pre-pro-penicillin amidase into the Tat pathway of E. coli (15Ignatova Z. Hornle C. Nurk A. Kasche V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The discovery of these atypical RR-signal peptides shows that the prediction of signal peptides that direct Tat-dependent protein transport cannot be based exclusively on the presence of twin-arginine residues. This view is underscored by our recent two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of theB. subtilis proteins that are exported under conditions of phosphate starvation. Of the four detected proteins with an RR-motif in their signal peptide only one, the phosphodiesterase PhoD, was exported in a strictly Tat-dependent manner (6Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).The presently best characterized bacterial Tat translocase is that ofE. coli. In contrast to the Sec translocase, which facilitates the export of loosely folded proteins only, the Tat translocase allows the passage of fully folded proteins across the inner membrane (for a recent review see Ref. 16Robinson C. Bolhuis A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The key components for twin-arginine translocation are the integral membrane proteins TatA, TatB, and TatC (17Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 18Bogsch E. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The TatA paralogue TatE has overlapping functions with TatA, but TatA appears to be far more important for translocation than TatE. In contrast to E. coliand most other eubacteria, which contain only one tatC gene,B. subtilis contains two tatC genes (denoted tatCd and tatCy). The TatCd protein was shown to be specifically involved in the export of the RR-protein PhoD, unlike its paralogue TatCy (6Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Each of the tatC genes is preceded by a tatA gene (denoted tatAd andtatAy respectively). A third tatA gene (tatAc) is not genetically linked to the tatCgenes. Notably, the three B. subtilis TatA proteins show sequence similarity with both the E. coli TatA/E and TatB proteins (6Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is presently not known to what extent the B. subtilis TatA proteins are functionally equivalent to the E. coli TatA/E or TatB proteins.The present studies were aimed at answering the question to what extent the Tat pathway of B. subtilis contributes to the extracellular accumulation of proteins. For this purpose, the extracellular proteomes of multiple tat mutant strains were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The results show that out of 69 candidate proteins with RR- and KR-signal peptides (Table I), only one protein is secreted in a strictly Tat-dependent manner, whereas 13 other proteins that can be visualized by proteomic techniques are secreted Tat-independently. In fact, the extracellular accumulation of three of these 13 proteins was shown to be Sec-dependent. The observation that the export of LipA 2Please note that LipA is referred to as Lip in the SubtiList database (genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/). 2Please note that LipA is referred to as Lip in the SubtiList database (genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/). is Sec- and not Tat-dependent was salient, because its RR-motif conforms to the most stringent criteria for the prediction of RR/KR-signal peptides that direct Tat-dependent export.Table IPredicted RR- and KR-signal peptides of B. subtilisPutative RR- and KR-signal peptides were identified in two ways. First, the presence of the consensus sequence RRXφφ or KRXφφ (φ is a hydrophobic residue), immediately in front of an N-terminal hydrophobic region as predicted with the TopPred2 algorithm (45Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 46Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was determined. To this purpose, the first 60 residues of all annotated proteins of B. subtills in the SubtiList database (genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/) were used. Second, within the group of potential RR/KR-sorting signals, cleavable signal peptides were identified with the SignalP algorithm (47Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar, 48Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Conserved residues of the consensus sequence (RRXφφ or KRXφφ) are indicated in bold. In addition, positively charged residues that could function as a so-called Sec avoidance signal (49Bogsch E. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) are indicated in bold and italics. Note, however, that the positively charged residues in the signal peptides of LipA and YolA do not cause Sec avoidance. The hydrophobic H-domain is indicated in gray shading and the average hydrophobicity (h) of each of these domains, as determined by the algorithms of Kyte and Doolittle (50Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar), is indicated. To calculate these hydrophobicities, the ProtScale Tool was used, which is available through the ExPASy server at us.expasy.org/tools/pscale/Hphob.Doolittle.html.Please note that the hydrophobicity scale values for different amino acids are dimension-less. In signal peptides with a predicted signal peptidase I cleavage site, residues from position −3 to −1 relative to the signal peptidase I cleavage site are underlined. Notably, some of these proteins contain one or more putative transmembrane segments elsewhere in the protein (indicated with “TM”), or are putative lipoproteins. Residues forming a so-called lipobox for signal peptidase II cleavage are enlarged in size (51Tjalsma H. Zanen G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Dalbey R.E. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 3-26Google Scholar). Proteins containing cell wall binding repeats in the mature part of the protein are indicated with “W.” Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONRecent developments in genomics and bioinformatics provide ample possibilities to predict biochemical pathways that might be active in organisms of which the genomes have been sequenced. However, such predictions are of limited value without a biochemical or proteomic verification. In the present studies, we have used proteomic approaches to verify our previous genome-based predictions concerning the role of the Tat pathway within the so-called secretome of B. subtilis. By definition, the secretome includes both the pathways for protein export from the cell and the extracellular proteome (2Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D.H. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). B. subtilis is an excellent model organism for a proteomic verification of predictions concerning protein export from the cytoplasm, because exported proteins are released into the growth medium unless they have retention signals that anchor them to the cytoplasmic membrane or the cell wall. Moreover, many proteins that are synthesized with membrane or cell wall retention signals end up in the growth medium due to proteolytic shaving or alternative release mechanisms (4Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which allows the verification of predictions concerning their export. Our present results show that out of 69 proteins with potential RR- or KR-signal peptides (Table I), 14 can be detected on the extracellular proteome of B. subtilis cells grown in rich medium or under conditions of phosphate starvation. These are AbnA, BglC, BglS, LipA, LytD, OppA, PbpX, PhoD, WapA, WprA, YdhF, YfkN, YhcR, and YolA. The remaining 55 proteins were not detected in the growth medium under the laboratory conditions tested. This could be due to lack of expression of the corresponding genes (note that phoD and ydhF are only expressed under conditions of phosphate starvation), protein synthesis at levels below detection, or poor separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, some of these 55 proteins with predicted RR/KR-signal peptides may not be exported from the cytoplasm, or may be retained in the membrane or cell wall. Indeed, these 55 proteins include 10 potential membrane proteins and 11 potential lipoproteins.Of the 14 proteins with predicted RR/KR-signal peptides that can be detected in the growth medium, only PhoD was secreted in a strictly Tat-dependent manner as previously documented (6Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast, 13 detectable proteins of this category were secreted by strains containing multiple tat mutations, and the secretion of three of these 13 proteins (LipA, WapA, and YolA) apparently depended on SecA. Remarkably, the secretion of LipA was influenced to some extent by tatCd mutations, but it was not affected in the total-tat mutant. Consistent with the Tat-dependent extracellular accumulation of PhoD, the signal peptide of this protein conforms to the most stringent criteria for the prediction of Tat-dependence as defined for known RR-signal peptides of E. coli (hydrophobic residues at the +2 and +3 positions and a hydrophobicity of less than 2.1; Refs. 9Cristóbal S. de Gier J.W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar and 37de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Saaf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-146451Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, these stringent criteria also apply to LipA and LytD, which display a Tat-independent extracellular accumulation. This implies that the present criteria for the prediction of true RR/KR-signal peptides need to be refined, at least forB. subtilis. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind that the predicted RR/KR-signal peptides of the 11 remaining Tat-independently secreted proteins, which can be detected by proteomics, are imperfect. As one of these signal peptides has a highly hydrophobic H-domain (hydrophobicity of 2.3), while 10 others have non-hydrophobic residues at the +2 or +3 positions (Table I), it seems that signal peptides of B. subtilis should,at least, conform to the stringent criteria defined for RR-signal peptides of E. coli in order to direct Tat-dependent protein secretion.The observation that mutations in tatCd reduce the amounts of LipA in the growth medium, whereas the total-tat mutation has no effect on the extracellular appearance of LipA, is intriguing. On the one hand, there could be a direct effect of the absence of TatCd on LipA secretion as this protein does have a potential RR-signal peptide (Table I) and can be exported via the Tat pathway ofE. coli when fused to the RR-signal peptide of the trimethylamine N-oxide reductase TorA. 3P. G. Braun and M. J. Dröge, unpublished observations. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the reduced levels of LipA in the medium oftatCd mutant cells are due to indirect effects on the synthesis of this protein. If there is a direct effect of thetatCd mutation on the export of LipA, this effect is clearly suppressed in the total-tat mutant. The Tat-independent export of LipA is particularly evident under conditions of LipA overproduction. In fact, as demonstrated by depletion of the translocation motor SecA and/or SecA inhibition with sodium azide, the export of overproduced LipA is Sec-dependent, irrespective of the absence or presence of a functional Tat machinery. As judged by the outcome of SecA depletion experiments, the translocation of pre-LipA appears to require higher cellular levels of SecA than that of pre-AmyQ, which is secreted in a strictly Sec-dependent (azide-sensitive) manner (40Bolhuis A. Broekhuizen C.P. Sorokin A. van Roosmalen M.L. Venema G. Bron S. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21217-21224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This difference in SecA-requirement is reminiscent of that observed between the B. subtilis levansucrase SacB and the α-amylase AmyE. Compared with AmyE, the export of SacB was shown to require much higher cellular levels of SecA (41Leloup L. Driessen A.J.M. Freudl R. Chambert R. Petit-Glatron M.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1820-1826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our observations show that LipA secretion is fully Sec-compatible. As the Sec machinery is known to transport proteins in a loosely folded conformation, it can be concluded that the folding of LipA into its active conformation can occur after its translocation across the membrane. This would be consistent with the fact that the export of active LipA does not require the Tat pathway, which can transport folded proteins. In order to refine the parameters for the prediction of Tat-dependent protein export in B. subtilis, we are currently investigating which changes in the LipA signal peptide are required to secrete this protein in a strictly Tat-dependent manner.The secretion of 9 of the 26 most dominant identified extracellular proteins of B. subtilis is inhibited by sodium azide, indicating that their membrane translocation is powered by SecA. Of these nine proteins, six are synthesized with typical Sec-type signal peptides and three (LipA, WapA, and YolA) with predicted RR/KR-signal peptides that appear to be ignored by the Tat machinery. The latter observation shows that the lysine residues in the C-terminal regions of the signal peptides of LipA and YolA do not function as effective Sec-avoidance signals (Table I). Consistent with their apparently Sec-independent (azide-resistant) secretion, five extracellular proteins (FliD, Hag, KatA, RocF, and YwjH) lack signal peptides of a known type. Two other azide-resistant extracellular proteins, YflE and YfnI, are synthesized as integral membrane proteins, which may not necessarily require SecA for membrane translocation and subsequent processing by signal peptidases (39Hirose I. Sano K. Shioda I. Kumano M. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). For example, it was previously shown that bacterial membrane proteins can be inserted into the membrane in a process that requires the Sec translocation channel components SecY, E, and G, but not SecA (42Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Manting E.H. Urbanus M.L. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29883-29888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is presently not clear, why no effect of azide on the secretion of the ten remaining identified extracellular proteins was observed. However, eight of these ten proteins are synthesized with typical Sec-type targeting signals (2Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D.H. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), whereas two of them (AbnA and OppA) have imperfect KR-signal peptides that resemble Sec-type signal peptides. Thus, it seems most likely that the membrane translocation of these ten proteins depends on the Sec machinery. If so, very low levels of SecA activity would be sufficient for this process.Although PhoD represents ∼8–10% of the extracellular proteome under conditions of phosphate starvation, our present observations show that, in general, the Tat pathway makes a highly selective contribution to the extracellular proteome of B. subtilis. At present, we can only speculate why this is the case. One possibility would be that B. subtilis uses the Tat pathway mainly for the export of folded (cofactor-binding) proteins, which are localized and active at the membrane-cell wall interface. This seems to apply, at least, to the iron-sulfur cluster-binding Rieske protein QcrA, which has a consensus RR-signal peptide that apparently lacks a signal peptidase cleavage site (Table I). In contrast, the Sec pathway of B. subtilis, which has an enormous capacity for protein secretion, would be used preferentially for the extracellular accumulation of proteins that are involved in the provision of nutrients and cell-to-cell communication. Notably, the fact that the PhoD protein is present on the extracellular proteome might argue against this possible division of tasks for the Tat and Sec pathways of B. subtilis. On the other hand, pre-PhoD is processed at a very low rate and substantial amounts of this protein can be detected at the membrane-cell wall interface (43Müller J.P. Wagner M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As no Tat-dependently exported proteins are detectable on the cell wall proteome of B. subtilis (44Antelmann H. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. Hecker M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is the aim of our ongoing research to determine to what extent the Tat pathway of B. subtilis is involved in the biogenesis of membrane proteins. The Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, is well known for its ability to secrete a large variety of proteins into its extracellular environment. Based on the complete genome sequence (1Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar), it was recently predicted that the extracellular proteome of this organism is composed of ∼180 different proteins (2Tjalsma H.

Jongbloed J.D.H. de Jong A. Bron S. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and its closest relatives. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2001: 337-355Google Scholar). Indeed, a two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis showed that about 200 distinct spots representing extracellular proteins can be separated, among which 82 different proteins were identified (4Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To date, it is not known to what extent each of the various known protein export pathways contributes to the composition of the extracellular proteome. Four pathways for protein export are known to be present inB. subtilis. As judged by the characteristic tripartite structure of their signal peptides, the majority of secretory proteins (∼160) has the potential to be exported from the cytoplasm via the Sec (protein secretion) pathway (2Tjalsma H.

In addition, this pathway is required for the export of 114 potential lipoproteins that remain anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane (5Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z., Wu, H. Meima R. Venema G.

S. epidermidis has the ability to attach to indwelling materials coated with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen. To identify the proteins necessary for S. epidermidisattachment to collagen, we screened an expression library using digoxigenin-labeled collagen as well as two monoclonal antibodies generated against the Staphylococcus aureuscollagen-adhesin, Cna, as probes. These monoclonal antibodies recognize collagen binding epitopes on the surface of S. aureus andS. epidermidis cells. Using this approach, we identified GehD, the extracellular lipase originally found in S. epidermidis 9, as a collagen-binding protein. Despite the monoclonal antibody cross-reactivity, the GehD amino acid sequence and predicted structure are radically different from those of Cna. The mature GehD circular dichroism spectra differs from that of Cna but strongly resembles that of a mammalian cell-surface collagen binding receptor, known as the α1 integrin I domain, suggesting that they have similar secondary structures. The GehD protein is translated as a preproenzyme, secreted, and post-translationally processed into mature lipase. GehD does not have the conserved LPXTG C-terminal motif present in cell wall-anchored proteins, but it can be detected in lysostaphin cell wall extracts.

In the past 20 years it has emerged as a frequent cause of infections associated with indwelling devices such as catheters, artificial heart valves, and orthopedic implants (1Garrett D.O. Jochimsen E. Murfitt K. Hill B. McAllister S. Nelson P. Spera R.V. Sall R.K. Tenover F.C. Johnston J. Zimmer B. Jarvis W.R. Infect. Control. Hosp. Epidemiol. 1999; 20: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In certain populations such as low birth weight infants and immuno-compromised patients S. epidermidis can be a prominent source of morbidity and mortality (2de Silva G.D.I. Justice A. Wilkinson A.R.

The molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of S. epidermidisdisease are not well understood, but as with most infections, bacterial adherence to host surfaces is recognized as the first crucial step in the infection process and a prerequisite for colonization. A two-step process of S. epidermidis adherence is often described in which the first step is bacterial attachment to the biomaterial, and the second step includes microbial proliferation, intercellular adhesion, and biofilm formation. Almost all S. epidermidisstrains are able to attach to native abiotic surfaces (3Hogt A.H. Dankert J. Feijen J. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1986; 20: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 4Pascual A. Fleer A. Westerdaal N.A. Verhoef J. Eur. J. Clin.

However, any foreign material implanted into the human body is quickly coated with various plasma proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin (7Herrmann M. Vaudaux P., D. Pittet R.A.

Biomaterials. 1994; 15: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and Staphylococcus aureus, which is also a common cause of biomaterial centered infections, appears to adhere to this protein coat via adhesins of the microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs)1 type. Analysis of the adherence behavior of S. epidermidissuggests that this organism also expresses MSCRAMMs. In fact, a gene encoding a fibrinogen binding MSCRAMM (sdrG, also calledfbe) was cloned and sequenced from S. epidermidis(9Nilsson M. Frykberg L. Flock J.I. Lindberg M. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2666-2673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SdrG, a 119-kDa MSCRAMM, has a structural organization similar to the clumping factor (ClfA) from S. aureus and specifically recognizes the N-terminal region of the fibrinogen Bβ chain (10Davis S.L. Gurusiddappa S. McCrea K.W. Perkins S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, the autolysin AtlE, necessary for S. epidermidisattachment to polystyrene, was shown to specifically bind to biotin-labeled vitronectin (11Heilmann C. Hussain M. Peters G. Gotz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). These data indicate that S. epidermidis, similarly to S. aureus, may express specific MSCRAMMs that mediate cell attachment to host protein-conditioned surfaces. In the present communication, we report that the GehD (12Longshaw C.M. Farrell A.M. Wright J.D. Holland K.T. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) lipase binds to collagen type I, II, and IV and may mediate the adherence ofS. epidermidis cells to immobilized collagens. We identified GehD probing a S. epidermidis expression library with labeled collagen type I and monoclonal antibodies generated against theS. aureus collagen-binding protein, Cna. Staphylococcal lipases have been implicated as possible virulence factors in localized infections such as absesses (13Hedström S.A. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. Sect.

Nilsson-Ehle P. Acta Pathol. Mocrobiol. Immunol. Scand. Sect. B Microbiol. 1987; 95: 109-113PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence that they are highly expressed during infection in a murine model (16Lowe A.M. Beattie D.T. Deresiewicz R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The contribution of these enzymes to virulence is not clearly understood, although lipases may be important for the colonization and persistence of organisms on the skin (17Gribbon E.M. Cunliffe W.J. Holland K.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1745-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Another class of proteins that function as collagen binding adhesion receptors are the mammalian integrins. These proteins mediate the attachment of eukaryotic cells to the extracellular matrix. The integrins are transmembrane αβ heterodimeric proteins that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions of mammalian cells. In this extensive family of proteins, α1β1 and α2β1 are the primary collagen binding integrins. Within the α subunit of the collagen binding integrins, the ligand binding region is called I domain (33Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 2387-2392Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our data predict that mature GehD may adopt a structure that resembles that of the integrin α1 I-domain. The data described here show that the GehD lipase binds to collagens and may promote S. epidermidis attachment to immobilized collagens. Our data indicate that the GehD lipase may be a bifunctional molecule, acting as a glycerol ester hydrolase and a collagen adhesin. S. epidermidis strains 146, 9491, 12228, 14852, and 14990 were obtained from the ATCC collection. S. epidermidis 9, 2J24 (gehC::ermC), and KIC82 (gehD::ermC) were created by Christopher M. Longshaw (12Longshaw C.M. Farrell A.M. Wright J.D. Holland K.T. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). S. aureus Cowan 1 spa::tet R strain was generously donated by T. Foster (University of Dublin, Ireland). All strains were grown in brain heart infusion or tryptic soy broth media (Difco) at 37 °C overnight. For the monoclonal antibody reactivity assays, bacteria were harvested and re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (140 mm NaCl, 270 μm KCl, 430 μm Na2HPO4, 147 μmKH2PO4) 0.02% sodium azide, washed, and adjusted to a cell density of 1010 cells/ml using a standard curve relating the A 600 to the cell number determined by counting cells in a Petroff-Hausser chamber. The cells were then heat-killed at 88 °C for 10 min. For all other assays, overnight cultures were diluted 1:1000 into fresh tryptic soy broth media, and the resultant culture was incubated until it reached logarithmic growth phase (A 6000.3–0.6). Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation and used in attachment or Western assays. A S. epidermidis 9491 λZAP Express (Stratagene) expression library was constructed as follows. S. epidermidis 9491 chromosomal DNA was partially digested with MboI, and the fragments corresponding to 3–11 kilobases were isolated and purified. The purified fragments were ligated to the ZAP Express® (Stratagene) vector, predigested withBamHI, and dephosphorylated with CIAP (calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase). The resultant ligation product was packaged into phage particles using the Gigapack III Gold (Stratagene)-packaging extract. The obtained library was amplified and screened using the Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF′ strain. Clones of interest were excised from the λ ZAP Express® phage using the ExAssist® helper phage to generate the pBK-CMV phagemid vector packaged as filamentous phage particles. The filamentous phage stock was used to infect the E. coli XLOLR strain. The resultant colonies carrying the excised pBK-CMV phagemid vector were used for subsequent subcloning and dideoxy sequencing of the cloned inserts. A DNA fragment encoding the mature domain of the GehD lipase was PCR-amplified from S. epidermidis 9491 genomic DNA. The oligonucleotides primers 5′-TTT GAA TTC TGC GCA AGC TCA ATA TAA and 5′-TTT GCG GCC GCT ATC GCT ACT TAC GTG TAA were used to amplify the fragment designated as mature GehD. Constructs generated by PCR were cloned into the pETBlue-2 System using the E. coli NovaBlue strain as a cloning host and the E. coli Tuner (DE3) pLacI strain as the expression host. Large scale expression and preparation of recombinant proteins were as described previously using HiTrap nickel-chelating chromatography (10Davis S.L. Gurusiddappa S. McCrea K.W. Perkins S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm as measured on a Beckman Du-70 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The molar extinction coefficient of the proteins was calculated using the method of Pace et al. (18Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar). Purified collagen I (Vitrogen®, Cohesion, Palo Alto CA) was labeled with digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-ε-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxy-succinimide ester (digoxigenin) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To label recombinant proteins with biotin, 7.5 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin; Pierce) was dissolved in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and combined with 0.5 mg of recombinant protein in PBS. The total reaction (1 ml volume) was incubated in an end-over-end rotator at room temperature for 2 h then dialyzed against PBS and stored at 4 °C. Digoxigenin-labeled collagen or mAbs 11H11 and 1F6 (19Visai L., Xu, Y. Casolini F. Rindi S. Höök M. Speziale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39837-39845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were used to screen the S. epidermidis 9491 λZAP Express (Stratagene) expression library. The library was plated using standard methods according to the vector manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). After blocking additional protein binding sites on the filter lifts with a solution containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4), digoxigenin-labeled collagen (0.5 μg/ml in TBST) was incubated with the filters. The bound digoxigenin-labeled collagen was incubated with anti-digoxigenin Fab conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:5000 in TBST, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). When mAbs 11H11 or 1F6 (1:500 in TBST) were used as probes, goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:4000 in TBST) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies. Clones expressing collagen-binding proteins were identified by developing the membranes with 5-bromo-4-chlor-3-indoyl phosphatep-toluidine salt and p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Bio-Rad). To test the reactivity of the mAbs generated against bacterial surface proteins, microtiter wells (Dasit, Milan, Italy) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of human fibronectin in 100 μl of 50 mmsodium carbonate, pH 9.5, to provide a surface for bacterial attachment. The wells were washed five times with 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.13 m NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST), and additional protein binding sites were blocked with a solution of 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS. Suspensions of 1 × 108 cells of S. epidermidis or S. aureus Cowan 1 spa::tet R) whole cells were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by 5 washes with PBS to remove unbound cells. Solutions of 2 μg of each monoclonal antibody in 100 μl of 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS were added, incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed extensively with PBST, and detected with a 1:500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Gostrup, Denmark). The conjugated enzyme was incubated with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as a substrate, and the color development absorbance was monitored at 492 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). To test protein-protein interactions, microtiter plates (Immulon 4, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 1 μg of type I collagen in 100 μl of PBS/well overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed 3 times with PBS and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h before the addition of varying concentrations of the biotinylated recombinant protein. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking, the wells were extensively washed with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST). Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted 10,000-fold with blocking buffer and added to the wells. After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, the wells were washed with PBST. For color development, 100 μl of 1.3m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, containing 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) was added to the wells. Absorbance at 405 nm (A 405 nm) was measured using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA) after 1 h of incubation at room temperature. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated with independently prepared protein preparations. Binding to BSA-coated wells was considered as background level and subtracted from binding to collagen. Data were presented as the mean value ± S.E. ofA 405 nm from a representative experiment (n = 3). The effect of antibodies as inhibitors of proteins binding to collagen was examined as described above except that biotinylated proteins were mixed with antibodies at varying ratios and added to the wells. The secondary structural composition of recombinant proteins was examined by CD spectroscopy. Far UV CD data were collected using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter calibrated with a 0.1% (w/v) d-10-camphorsulfonic acid solution using a bandwidth of 1 nm and integrated for 4 s at 0.2-nm intervals. All sample concentrations were less than 30 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Spectra were recorded at ambient temperatures in 0.2-mm path length cuvettes. Thirty scans were averaged for each spectrum, the contribution from the buffer was subtracted, and quantitation of secondary structural elements was performed by deconvolution software provided by University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (Piscataway, NJ) and D. Greenwood (Softwood Co., Brooksfield, CT). These deconvolution programs (SELCON and VARSLC1) are derived from databases of known protein structures. Analyses were performed using the BIAcore 1000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (20Xu Y. Gurusidappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The Cna protein was tested in HBS (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The α1 I domain was tested in HBS containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and mature GehD was tested in both HBS and glycine buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 7.4). Data from the equilibrium portion of the sensorgrams were used for analysis and calculation of the K D and n. Purified mature GehD was dialyzed in PBS, pH 7.4, before being sent to Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA) for immunization in rabbits and production of polyclonal antisera. IgGs were purified from both immune and preimmune serum by chromatography using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Microtiter plates (Immulon 4, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 1 μg of type I collagen in 100 μl of PBS/well overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed 3 times with PBS and then blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h before the addition of bacteria. Early log-phase S. epidermidis cultures (A 600 of 0.5) were added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After gentle washes, adherent cells were fixed with 100 μl of 25% (v/v) aqueous formaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min. The plates were then washed gently, stained with crystal violet, then washed again and read on an ELISA plate reader at 590 nm. To study inhibition of collagen binding by IgGs, S. epidermidis suspensions were preincubated with serial dilutions of purified IgGs in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The cell suspensions were then transferred to ELISA plates coated with 1 μg of collagen/well, and their ability to attach to collagen was tested as described above. For whole-cell SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207530) Google Scholar), 2 × 107 S. epidermidis (previously treated with lysostaphin) cells or E. coli cells were boiled in 2% (w/v) SDS for 3–5 min under reducing conditions and subjected to electrophoresis through a 10% acrylamide gel at 150 V for 45 min. The separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For Western ligand blot assays, whole cell lysates, or purified proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamide gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a semi-dry electroblot system (Bio-Rad). Additional binding sites on the membrane were blocked by incubating in 2% (w/v) BSA in TBST for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by three 10-min washes in TBST. The membrane was then incubated at room temperature with 0.5 μg of digoxigenin-labeled collagen/ml TBST for 1 h, washed, and incubated with 1:5000 anti-digoxigenin Fab alkaline-phosphatase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in TBST for 1 h. The membrane was washed, and collagen-binding proteins were visualized with 150 μg of 5-bromo-4-chlor-3-indoyl phosphate p-toluidine salt/ml and 300 μg of p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/ml (Bio-Rad) in carbonate bicarbonate buffer (14 mmNa2CO3, 36 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, pH 9.8). The clinical isolate S. epidermidis 9491 was chosen as a prototype strain in our search for new MSCRAMMs. We tested its ability to adhere to immobilized bovine collagen type I, human fibrinogen, and human fibronectin. Each protein was immobilized in microtiter wells, and the bacteria attached to the wells were detected using crystal violet. The results presented in Fig.1 show that S. epidermidis9491 has the ability to attach to collagen, fibrinogen and fibronectin. Although previous studies have shown that S. epidermidisattachment to human fibrinogen is mediated by proteins such as Fbe and SdrG (9Nilsson M. Frykberg L. Flock J.I. Lindberg M. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2666-2673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Davis S.L. Gurusiddappa S. McCrea K.W. Perkins S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27799-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the bacterial components that mediate attachment to collagen or fibronectin were up to this point not identified. A panel of 22 monoclonal antibodies was previously generated against theS. aureus MSCRAMM Cna-(151–318) (19Visai L., Xu, Y. Casolini F. Rindi S. Höök M. Speziale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39837-39845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We explored the possibility that at least some of these mAbs would cross-react with collagen-binding proteins on S. epidermidis by examining a panel of strains (S. epidermidis 146, 9491, 12228, 14852, and 14990). Two monoclonals, 11H11 and 1F6, cross-reacted with whole cells of all the S. epidermidis strains tested. Both of these antibodies were raised against the ligand binding central region of Cna-(151–318). Furthermore, these antibodies were shown to inhibit collagen binding to Cna and recognize conformationally dependent epitopes, presumably located in the ligand binding site of Cna-(151–318) (19Visai L., Xu, Y. Casolini F. Rindi S. Höök M. Speziale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39837-39845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As expected, all of the anti-Cna mAbs bind toS. aureus Cowan 1 cells. The S. epidermidisstrains are recognized only by two antibodies. These results suggest that S. epidermidis exposes on its surface proteins that form epitopes similar to those present on Cna and that these proteins are recognized by 1F6 and 11H11. We constructed an expression library ligating MboI partially digested, size-selected genomic DNA from S. epidermidis 9491 to BamHI-digested λZAP Express II® vector. Using mAbs 1F6 and 11H11 as well as digoxigenin-labeled collagen, we screened ∼690,000 plaques. We isolated three clones that reacted with each mAb and labeled collagen. DNA sequencing of the excised phagemids revealed that 2 of the clones were identical, and the third had an additional 36 bp of upstream sequence. Further sequence analysis revealed that the cloned DNA immediately downstream of the T7lac sequence from the phagemid is 97% identical to the previously identified S. epidermidis second lipase gene, gehD (12Longshaw C.M. Farrell A.M. Wright J.D. Holland K.T. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). Previous studies of GehD and other staphylococcal lipases have shown that they are transcribed and translocated as 650–700-amino acid precursors that are processed post-translationally to extracellular mature lipases of about 360 amino acids with a size of ∼45 kDa (12Longshaw C.M. Farrell A.M. Wright J.D. Holland K.T. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To simulate the native protein in the mature form, we used the PCR to construct recombinant mature GehD (Fig. 2 A). The PCR product encoding mature GehD was cloned into the expression vector pETBlue-2 (Novagen). The protein was expressed as a C-terminal polyhistidine (His tag) fusion and purified by nickel-chelating chromatography. Mature GehD appears as a single polypeptide at ∼45 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Amino acid sequence comparisons did not reveal any significant similarities between the linear amino acid sequences of Cna and mature GehD. Furthermore, the CD spectra of mature GehD shown in Fig.3 A is very different from that of Cna (Fig. 3 C). Deconvolution of the mature GehD data using the SELCON and VARSLC1 programs revealed that the predicted overall secondary structure of mature GehD consists of ∼26.5% α-helix, 20.6% β-sheet, and 52.9% coil. This secondary structure composition differs markedly from that of the reported crystal structure of Cna-(151–318): 8% α-helix, 53% β-sheet, and 39% coil (29Fagan P.K. Reinscheid D. Gottschalk B. Chhatwal G.S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4851-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mature GehD CD spectra strongly resembles that of a mammalian cell-surface collagen binding receptor known as the α1 integrin I domain (Fig. 3 B). The secondary structure composition of this domain is 33.2% α-helix, 20.7% β-sheet, and 46.1% coil, which is comparable with that of mature GehD. The collagen binding activity of the recombinant, mature GehD was analyzed by Western ligand blot. Purified protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with digoxigenin-labeled collagen, mAbs 11H11 (anti-Cna), or 7E8 (anti-His tag) (Fig. 2 B, lane 4 and 5, respectively). In this assay, the recombinant, mature GehD binds collagen and both antibodies. It should be noted that a second lower mass polypeptide is detected in lanes 4 and 5. This is a contaminating polypeptide that is recognized by the secondary anti-mouse antibody used to detect mAbs11H11 and anti-His. The collagen binding activity of the recombinant, biotin-labeled mature GehD was also assessed by a solid phase, ELISA-type assay. Mature GehD bound in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner to collagens I, II, and IV coated on microtiter wells (Fig.4), whereas the binding to wells coated with albumin was minimal. From the ELISA-type assay we estimated that half-maximum binding occurred at about 0.25 μm mature GehD. In addition, we examined the ability of unlabeled mature GehD to inhibit the binding of biotinylated mature GehD to immobilized collagen. Unlabeled GehD could inhibit the binding of the labeled protein to immobilized collagen, whereas a fibrinogen binding recombinant protein from S. epidermidis (SdrG) had no inhibitory effect (data not shown). This suggests that both biotin-labeled and unlabeled mature GehD bind with similar affinity to immobilized collagen. We also tried to characterize the binding of mature GehD to collagen by surface plasmon resonance. In this assay, soluble recombinant mature GehD is run over a sensory chip coated with type I collagen. Using a Hepes-based buffer system, we could calculate a K Dof 4 μm for the interaction. Using a glycine buffer we recorded equilibrium data and calculated a K D of 3 μm and 1 binding site for mature GehD per collagen monomer. However, not only was the interaction of mature GehD with collagen dependent on the buffer system used, but the collagen binding activity declined as the purified mature GehD was stored for long periods of time. Clearly, these are aspects of the mature GehD binding to collagen that we do not understand at the present, and theK D values reported above must be taken with caution. We used a microtiter well attachment assay to study the adherence of S. epidermidis to collagen. Two independent, identical clones of S. epidermidis carrying a deletion of the g"

More recent studies have implicated TRAP-Mediator as a coactivator for a broad range of nuclear hormone receptors as well as other classes of transcriptional activators. Here we present evidence that TRAP-Mediator plays a functional role in androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription. We show that several subunits of the complex ligand-dependently coimmunoprecipitate with AR from both prostate cancer LNCaP cells and from HeLa cells stably transfected with AR. The 220-kDa subunit of the complex (TRAP220) can contact the ligand-binding domain of AR in vitro, possibly implicating TRAP220 involvement in targeting AR to the holocomplex. Consistent with a TRAP-Mediator coactivator role, transient overexpression of the TRAP220, TRAP170, and TRAP100 subunits enhanced ligand-dependent transcription by AR in cultured cells. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that TRAP220 is recruited to the androgen-responsive prostate-specific antigen gene promoter in vivo in ligand-stimulated LNCaP cells.

All NRs share a common modular structure consisting of a variable N-terminal domain, a conserved DNA binding domain, a hinge region, and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Transcriptional regulation by NRs involves the binding and recruitment of auxiliary factors (termed coactivators and corepressors) to target gene promoters (12McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). The p160 family of proteins are among the best characterized NR coactivators (13McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 14Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By virtue of their ability to associate with potent histone acetyltransferase enzymes like p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), the p160 coactivators are thought to play an essential regulatory role in targeted chromatin modification (12McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 13McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

The p160 proteins contact NRs through consensus LXXLL motifs (also termed NR boxes), which act as binding surfaces for ligand-activated AF2 domains (15Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W.

Surprisingly, AR appears to differ from other NRs in that an intramolecular interaction between its ligand-activated AF2 domain and its N-terminal AF1 domain is functionally required for the binding of p160 proteins (18Ikonen T.

A second type of NR coactivator complex is the multimeric thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-associated protein (TRAP)-Mediator complex, composed of at least 16 different polypeptides ranging in size from ∼15 to 240 kDa (reviewed in Ref. 22Ito M. Roeder R.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Most (if not all) TRAP-Mediator subunits have been identified in other metazoan holocomplexes including NAT, DRIP, ARC, and CRSP (reviewed in Ref. 23Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cell-free transcription assays show that TRAP-Mediator significantly enhances TR-mediated transcription on nonchromatin DNA templates (24Fondell J.D., Ge, H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 25Fondell J.D. Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to the chromatin-modifying activity of p160-CBP·p300 complexes, TRAP-Mediator appears to function by directly influencing the basal transcription machinery, possibly by facilitating direct recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Consistent with this view, several TRAP-Mediator subunits are human homologs of proteins found within yeast Mediator, a large coactivator complex directly associated with both transcriptional activators and the yeast RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (26Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Evidence for a TRAP-Mediator coactivator role in other NR signaling pathways came from the purification of a similar, if not identical, complex of cofactors (termed DRIPs), which associate with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and stimulate VDR-mediated transcription in vitro (27Rachez C.

A single TRAP-Mediator subunit, TRAP220 (also termed PBP (28Zhu Y., Qi, C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

Interestingly, and analogous to the p160 proteins, TRAP220 contains two centrally located LXXLL motifs that facilitate ligand-dependent interactions with the AF-2 domain of TR and VDR (29Ren Y.

However, the potential physiological role of TRAP-Mediator in androgen signaling pathways remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigated whether TRAP-Mediator plays a functional role in AR-mediated gene expression. Using human prostate cancer LNCaP cells and a HeLa cell line stably expressing an epitope-tagged AR gene, we found that several components of the TRAP-Mediator complex coimmunoprecipitate with AR in the presence of ligand. Consistent with a TRAP-Mediator coactivator role, we found that transient overexpression of the TRAP220, TRAP170, and TRAP100 subunits enhanced ligand-dependent transcription by AR. We also found that the AR LBD can bind to TRAP220 in vitro in the presence of ligand, possibly revealing a molecular basis for AR interaction with the holocomplex. We further show that both TRAP220 and AR are recruited to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter in a ligand-dependent manner within intact LNCaP cells. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the idea that TRAP-Mediator plays a coregulatory role in AR-mediated gene expression. The pSG5-HA-TRAP220 expression vector was described previously (37Zhang J. Fondell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

Genomics. 1998; 49: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Hirohide Yoshikawa (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). To construct pSG5-FLAG-TRAP170, aKpnI/XbaI fragment from pBS II KS-EXLM1 was first subcloned into the KpnI/XbaI sites of pFLAG (AS)-7 generating pFLAG (AS)-7-TRAP170. A BamHI fragment from pFLAG (AS)-7-TRAP170 was then subcloned into the BamHI site of pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pBS-SK-TRAP100 (KIAA0130) plasmid was a gift from N. Kusuhara (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). To generate pBK-RSV-TRAP100, a SalI/NotI fragment from KIAA0130 was inserted into the SalI/NotI sites of pBK-RSV (Stratagene). The pGEX-2TK-AR-AF2 vector was constructed by PCR, generating BamHI and SmaI restriction sites at amino acids 622 and 919, respectively, and subsequently subcloning the fragment into the corresponding sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). The pGEX-2TK-AR-AF1 construct was generated by PCR by generating BamHI/AflII sites at AR amino acids 1 and 170 and subcloning the corresponding fragment, together with a AflII/HindIII-blunted fragment from pSV-AR0 (amino acids 171–564) (39Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), intoBamHI/SmaI-digested pGEX-2TK. The androgen-responsive luciferase reporter genes pMMTV-Luc, pARE2-DS-Luc, and pPB(−285/+32)-Luc were described previously (39Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The pGL3-promoter vector was obtained from Promega Corp. The pAP-1-Luc was a gift from D. Kalvakolanu (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD). HeLa-derived E19 cells stably expressing a tetracycline-regulated FLAG epitope-tagged AR (39Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). LNCaP cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, E19 cells were grown in 15-cm plates (lacking tetracycline and selection antibiotics) in the presence or absence of testosterone (10−7m) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS (HyClone) for 24 h. LNCaP cells were grown in 15-cm plates in RPMI1640 containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS, with or without testosterone (10−7m), for 24 h. The cells (∼1 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of lysates was determined by Bradford assay. Coimmunoprecipitation of FLAG-AR-cofactor complexes were facilitated by adding anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to agarose beads (M2 Affinity Resin; Sigma) (20 μl packed) to the cellular lysate (2.5 mg of protein). The mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. For reciprocal anti-TRAP220, -TRAP100, -TRAP230, or -TRAP170 coimmunoprecipitation, 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-TRAP220 and anti-TRAP100 (37Zhang J. Fondell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) or 100 μl of goat polyclonal antibody (anti-TRAP230 and anti-TRAP170; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog nos. SC-5372 and SC-9420, respectively) were added to 2.5 mg of cellular protein lysate (as above) and rotated slowly at 4 °C for 1 h. For TRAP220 and TRAP100 coimmunoprecipitations, 20 μl (packed) of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then added, and the mixtures were allowed to rotate overnight. For TRAP230 and TRAP170 coimmunoprecipitations, 20 μl (packed) of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added. The beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed twice with 1.5 ml of ice-cold buffer A. After the final wash, the precipitated protein complexes were resuspended in SDS-sample loading buffer, fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The Western blots were blocked for 1 h in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% powdered milk and then incubated with specific antibodies. The blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant baculovirus expressing HA-TRAP220 was generated by transfecting the pVL1393-HA-TRAP220 expression construct into Sf9 cells along with linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold; Pharmingen) using cationic liposomes (Insectin; Invitrogen). Subsequent expression and purification of recombinant proteins in Sf9 cells was essentially as described (40Fondell J.D. Brunel F. Hisatake K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that purification of HA-TRAP220 was performed using anti-HA-Agarose (Sigma) with subsequent elution using an HA peptide (N-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala-C). The pGEX-2TK-AR-AF1 and pGEX-2TK-AR-AF2 constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS, and the GST-fusion proteins were purified as described (29Ren Y. Behre E. Ren Z. Zhang J. Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5433-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In 250 μl of BC100/Nonidet P-40 (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% powdered milk), 5 μg of GST fusion protein (0.34 μm GST-AR-AF1 or 0.23 μm GST-AR-AF2 final) was added together with 80 ng of baculovirally expressed HA-TRAP220 (1.84 nm final) in the presence or absence of dihydrotestosterone (10−7m) or testosterone (10−7m) and then mixed for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. Protein complexes were precipitated by gentle centrifugation and washed three times in BC100/Nonidet P-40 followed by resuspension in SDS-sample loading buffer. Following 8% SDS-PAGE fractionation, the bound proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed by Western blot with anti-TRAP220 antibodies as described above. Transient transfections were carried out using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) alone or in combination with PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). For E19 and COS cell transfections, the cells were plated in 12-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS (HyClone) 24 h prior to transfection. A DNA mixture containing 0.4 μg of reporter plasmid (pMMTV-Luc, pARE2-DS-Luc, or pAP-1-Luc), 0.2 μg of the internal control plasmid pSV-β-gal, and 0.1 μg of pSG5-HA-TRAP220 or the empty pSG5 vector was combined in LipofectAMINE reagent and added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h before replacing the media with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS containing or lacking testosterone (10−7mfinal), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10−7m final) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. For LNCaP transfections, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS 24 h prior to transfection. A DNA mixture containing 1 μg of reporter plasmid (pPB(−285/+32)-Luc, pMMTV-Luc, or pGL3-promoter), 0.3 μg of pSV-β-gal, and 0.7 μg of either TRAP expression vector (pSG5-HA-TRAP220, pSG5-FLAG-TRAP170, or pBK-RSV-TRAP100) or the empty vector (pSG5 or pBK-RSV) was combined in LipofectAMINE reagent and added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h before replacing the media with fresh RPMI 1640, 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS containing testosterone (10−7m final) or vehicle alone. The cells were further incubated for 48 h (E19 cells and LNCaP cells) or 18 h (COS cells) and then harvested with a lysis buffer supplied in a kit (Luciferase Assay System; Promega Corp.). Luciferase activity was then measured in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G Wallace, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The β-galactosidase activity of the lysed transfected cells (as above) was determined using a kit (β-galactosidase enzyme assay system; Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luciferase units. LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS for 3 days before being treated with R1881 (10−7m) for 1 h. The cells were treated with the cross-linking reagent formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature; cross-linking was terminated upon the addition of glycine (0.125 m final concentration). Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS, collected by centrifugation, and washed once in cold PBS plus 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then swollen on ice in buffer I (5 mm Pipes (pH 8.0), 85 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 ng/ml aprotinin, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin) for 20 min. Nuclei were collected by microcentrifugation and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 1% SDS, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 100 ng/ml aprotinin, and 100 ng/ml leupeptin) followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Samples were then sonicated on ice for 10 min (i.e.until the average length of sheared genomic DNA was 1000–1500 bp), followed by centrifugation for 10 min. The supernatant (i.e.chromatin solution) was then incubated with either 5 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-AR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-TRAP220 antibodies (37Zhang J. Fondell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) on a rotator at 4 °C for 24 h. As a control for total chromatin input (see PCR step below), an aliquot of the chromatin solution from each reaction was saved (prior to the addition of antibodies) and subsequently processed in parallel with the eluted chromatin immunoprecipitates (see cross-link reversal step below). Immunoprecipitated chromatin complexes were isolated by adding 10 μl of (packed) protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and rotating the reactions for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were sequentially washed twice with dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA), followed by four washes in IP wash buffer (100 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid). To elute the immunoprecipitated chromatin complexes from the resin, 150 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 50 mm NaHCO3) was added to the beads, and the tubes were vortexed for 15 min. The supernatant was collected, and the elution was repeated with a fresh 150 μl of elution buffer. After combining the eluates in one tube, the protein-DNA cross-linking was reversed by adding 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm. RNA was removed from the samples by adding 10 μg of RNase A (Roche Biochemicals), followed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h. The DNA in each sample was precipitated overnight at −20 °C by adding 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. Samples were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 25 μl of 5× proteinase K buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 1.25% SDS, and 25 mm EDTA), and 1.5 μl of proteinase K and subsequently incubated at 42 °C for 2 h. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the DNA was precipitated with one-tenth volume of 5 m NaCl, 3m NaAc (pH 5.3), 5 μg of tRNA, and 2 volumes of ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The DNA was pelleted by microcentrifugation, resuspended in 25 μl of H2O, and analyzed by PCR. PCRs contained 5 μl of immunoprecipitate or total input (see above), a 50 μm concentration of each primer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dNTP mixture, 1× thermophilic buffer (Promega), and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in a total volume of 100 μl. The PSA promoter was analyzed using the 5′ primer 5′-GAG GTT CAT GTT CAC ATT AGT ACA C-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-ATT CTG GGT TTG GCA GTG GAG TGC-3′. Initially, PCR was performed with a serial dilution of input DNA to determine the linear range of the amplification. Following 30 cycles of amplification, PCR products were run on 1% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. We recently generated a HeLa-derived cell line (termed E19) that stably expresses a tetracycline-regulated FLAG-tagged human AR (f:AR), thereby rendering the cells responsive to androgens (39Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As evidenced by our ability to purify f:AR in association with specific p160 proteins 2Q. Wang and J. D. Fondell, unpublished results. and the coactivator CBP (39Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the E19 line can serve as a useful tool for isolating AR-coregulatory factor complexes that assemble in vivo. In this study, we used E19 cells to begin to investigate whether components of the TRAP-Mediator complex can associate with AR within intact cells. Using anti-FLAG antibodies, f:AR was immunoprecipitated from E19 cells grown in the presence or absence of testosterone. Immunocomplexes were then transferred to a membrane and probed by Western blot with antibodies against various TRAP subunits. As shown in Fig. 1 A (upper panel), the subunit TRAP220 is clearly associated with f:AR in an androgen-dependent manner. To examine whether testosterone affects overall f:AR expression, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with antibodies against AR. As shown in Fig. 1 A(lower panel), f:AR expression levels are roughly the same in the presence or absence of ligand, thus suggesting that the association of TRAP220 with AR is probably regulated by ligand and not by fluctuating AR protein expression. We next performed reciprocal experiments in which TRAP220 was immunoprecipitated from testosterone-treated or -untreated E19 cells and subsequently probed by Western blot with anti-AR antibodies. In close agreement with the initial findings, AR precipitated with TRAP220 in a ligand-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 B,top), and TRAP220 expression was not significantly affected by testosterone (Fig. 1 B, bottom). To confirm that these findings were not just restricted to E19 cells, we performed similar immunoprecipitation experiments using the prostate cancer LNCaP line, which expresses AR endogenously. Consistent with the E19 line, AR precipitated together with TRAP220 in a ligand-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 C, upper panel), and once again, TRAP220 expression was not significantly affected by testosterone (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). To address whether the association of AR with"

In many cell types, endogenous SGK-1 steady-state protein levels are very low but can be acutely up-regulated after glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcriptional activation; in breast epithelial and cancer cell lines, this up-regulation is associated with promotion of cell survival. We and others have noted that ectopically introduced full-length SGK-1 is poorly expressed, although SGK-1 lacking the first 60 amino acids (Δ60SGK-1) is expressed at much higher-fold protein levels than wild-type SGK-1 in both human embryonic kidney 293T and MCF10A mammary epithelial cells. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that the low steady-state expression level of SGK-1 is due to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. Deletion of the amino-terminal 60 amino acids of SGK-1 results in a mutant SGK-1 protein that is neither efficiently polyubiquitinated nor degraded by the 26S proteasome, accounting for the higher steady-state levels of the truncated protein. We also demonstrate that a subset of SGK-1 localizes to the plasma membrane and that the polyubiquitin-modified SGK-1 localizes to a membrane-associated fraction of the cell. Taken together, these data suggest that a significant fraction of SGK-1 is membrane-associated and ubiquitinated. These findings are consistent with the recently described role of SGK-1 in phosphorylating the membrane-associated protein Nedd4-2 and the integral membrane Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of SGK-1.

Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor by ligand binding directly regulates the transcription of several potential downstream mediators of this survival pathway, including SGK-1 (3Webster M.K.

SGK-1 is a member of an important subfamily of protein kinases known as the “AGC” subfamily that includes protein kinase A, protein kinase B, protein kinase G, and protein kinase C isoforms. SGK-1 is 54% identical in its catalytic domain to protein kinase Bα, also known as AKT-1. Two other isoforms of sgk, sgk-2 and sgk-3 (or cytokine-independent survival kinase, cisk), have been identified, and all three products can be phosphorylated and activated following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway signaling to downstream phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinases including phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 and -2 (5Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 and -2 activation of AKT, SGK-1, and SGK-3/CISK (6Xu J. Liu D. Gill G. Songyang Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) can promote cell survival under a variety of conditions that normally favor apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 7Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar).In addition to SGK-1 regulation via reversible phosphorylation,sgk-1 transcription is acutely up-regulated after glucocorticoid receptor activation, serum stimulation, and cell stress (8Lang F. Cohen P. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtrans;2001/108/re17)PubMed Google Scholar). The role of transcriptional activation in modulating a serine-threonine kinase is unusual and to date has not been implicated in the regulation of either sgk-2 or sgk-3expression (5Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).Another increasingly recognized mechanism of regulation of signaling proteins is through posttranslational modification via covalent addition of one or more ubiquitin molecules (reviewed in Ref. 9Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of ubiquitin, either as a single molecule or as a polyubiquitin chain, can regulate a variety of processes including protein degradation and subcellular trafficking of the substrate protein. For example, activity of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl has been recently shown to be down-regulated by a ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway (10Echarri A. Pendergast A.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1759-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, protein kinase C-λ is ubiquitinated and down-regulated by the Von Hippel Lindau-Cul 2 E31ubiquitin ligase (11Okuda H. Saitoh K. Hirai S. Iwai K. Takaki Y. Baba M. Minato N. Ohno S. Shuin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43611-43617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination also directly regulates the ability of TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, which in turn activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-p38 kinase pathway (12Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Finally, the PHD domain of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase-1 was recently found to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and to thereby mediate ubiquitination and degradation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (13Lu Z., Xu, S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).In the present study we demonstrate that the serine-threonine kinase SGK-1 is modified by polyubiquitination and ultimately degraded by the 26S proteasome. The rapid degradation of SGK-1 suggests that in addition to transcriptional up-regulation and reversible phosphorylation, ubiquitin modification plays an important role in determining the availability of SGK-1 as a kinase. We also demonstrate that the amino terminus of SGK-1 contains a domain that regulates both ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation and efficient association of SGK-1 with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, fractionation studies reveal that although SGK-1 is found in both membrane and cytosolic fractions, the ubiquitin-modified SGK-1 is predominantly membrane-associated. Taken together, these findings suggest that SGK-1, a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates Nedd4-2 (14Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7676-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is negatively regulated by ubiquitin modification and proteasome degradation.DISCUSSIONAlthough it is well-established that sgk-1 mRNA is up-regulated as an immediate early response to serum and glucocorticoid stimulation, the regulation of SGK-1 kinase activity is only partly understood. It has been previously established that SGK-1 is phosphorylated and activated by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway on conserved serine and threonine residues homologous to those found in AKT-1. However, in most cell types, steady-state levels of SGK-1 are far less abundant than AKT-1 (8Lang F. Cohen P. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtrans;2001/108/re17)PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that in addition to the transcriptional regulation of sgk-1, SGK-1 protein levels are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, adding another dimension to the mechanism of regulation of this unusual serine-threonine kinase. We also show that polyubiquitin-modified SGK-1 is predominantly localized to the membrane-associated fraction of the cell. These observations suggest that SGK-1 is ubiquitinated at or near the membrane rather than in the cytosol. Alternatively, deubiquitinating enzymes may preferentially act on SGK-1 in the cytosolic compartment, thereby resulting in accumulation of polyubiquitinated SGK-1 in the membrane fraction.While these studies were ongoing, SGK-1 was shown to directly phosphorylate and inactivate Nedd4-2, a known membrane-associated protein that is the E3 ligase responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (14Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Prat J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This raises the interesting possibility that SGK-1 may both phosphorylate and act as an E3 substrate of Nedd4-2 (or another E3 ligase), thereby achieving a tight negative feedback of SGK-1 activity. Our finding that the majority of ubiquitinated SGK-1 is associated with the plasma membrane is consistent with this proposed model (see Fig.6).Unlike SGK-3 (CISK), which contains a complete phosphatidylinositol phosphate-binding PX domain that is required to localize SGK-3 to early endosomes (24Virbasius J.V. Song X. Pomerleau D.P. Zhan Y. Zhou G.W. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), SGK-1 contains only the α-helix-2 of this domain and does not co-localize with early endosomes. 2C. A. Mikosz and S. D. Conzen, unpublished data. Furthermore, mutation of the α-helix-2 domain arginine residues that are predicted to be required for binding phosphatidylinositols (25Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol.

Conzen, unpublished data. Therefore, SGK-1 appears to use an independent mechanism, perhaps via a protein-protein interaction requiring the amino terminus, for translocation to the cell membrane.In summary, we have demonstrated that the steady-state protein levels and kinase activity of SGK-1 are down-regulated via polyubiquitin modification of the membrane-associated fraction of SGK-1. Regulation of serine-threonine kinases via ubiquitin modification underscores the potential importance of phosphorylation-independent mechanisms in the regulation of signaling molecules. In cell types or disease conditions in which phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is constitutively high (e.g. with HER-2/neu amplification, Ras mutations, or PTEN deletions), the availability of downstream targets is likely to be of critical importance to the activity of these pathways. Glucocorticoid receptor activation in mammary epithelial cells (1Moran T.J. Gray S. Mikosz C.A. Conzen S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar) and hepatocytes (2Evans-Storms R.B. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) initiates a potent antiapoptotic signaling pathway. Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor by ligand binding directly regulates the transcription of several potential downstream mediators of this survival pathway, including SGK-1 (3Webster M.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16649-16654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). SGK-1 is a member of an important subfamily of protein kinases known as the “AGC” subfamily that includes protein kinase A, protein kinase B, protein kinase G, and protein kinase C isoforms. SGK-1 is 54% identical in its catalytic domain to protein kinase Bα, also known as AKT-1. Two other isoforms of sgk, sgk-2 and sgk-3 (or cytokine-independent survival kinase, cisk), have been identified, and all three products can be phosphorylated and activated following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway signaling to downstream phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinases including phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 and -2 (5Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 and -2 activation of AKT, SGK-1, and SGK-3/CISK (6Xu J. Liu D. Gill G. Songyang Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) can promote cell survival under a variety of conditions that normally favor apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 7Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In addition to SGK-1 regulation via reversible phosphorylation,sgk-1 transcription is acutely up-regulated after glucocorticoid receptor activation, serum stimulation, and cell stress (8Lang F. Cohen P. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtrans;2001/108/re17)PubMed Google Scholar). The role of transcriptional activation in modulating a serine-threonine kinase is unusual and to date has not been implicated in the regulation of either sgk-2 or sgk-3expression (5Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Another increasingly recognized mechanism of regulation of signaling proteins is through posttranslational modification via covalent addition of one or more ubiquitin molecules (reviewed in Ref. 9Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of ubiquitin, either as a single molecule or as a polyubiquitin chain, can regulate a variety of processes including protein degradation and subcellular trafficking of the substrate protein. For example, activity of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl has been recently shown to be down-regulated by a ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway (10Echarri A. Pendergast A.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1759-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, protein kinase C-λ is ubiquitinated and down-regulated by the Von Hippel Lindau-Cul 2 E31ubiquitin ligase (11Okuda H. Saitoh K. Hirai S. Iwai K. Takaki Y. Baba M. Minato N. Ohno S. Shuin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43611-43617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination also directly regulates the ability of TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, which in turn activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-p38 kinase pathway (12Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Finally, the PHD domain of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase-1 was recently found to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and to thereby mediate ubiquitination and degradation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (13Lu Z., Xu, S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that the serine-threonine kinase SGK-1 is modified by polyubiquitination and ultimately degraded by the 26S proteasome. The rapid degradation of SGK-1 suggests that in addition to transcriptional up-regulation and reversible phosphorylation, ubiquitin modification plays an important role in determining the availability of SGK-1 as a kinase. We also demonstrate that the amino terminus of SGK-1 contains a domain that regulates both ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation and efficient association of SGK-1 with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, fractionation studies reveal that although SGK-1 is found in both membrane and cytosolic fractions, the ubiquitin-modified SGK-1 is predominantly membrane-associated. Taken together, these findings suggest that SGK-1, a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates Nedd4-2 (14Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7676-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is negatively regulated by ubiquitin modification and proteasome degradation. DISCUSSIONAlthough it is well-established that sgk-1 mRNA is up-regulated as an immediate early response to serum and glucocorticoid stimulation, the regulation of SGK-1 kinase activity is only partly understood. It has been previously established that SGK-1 is phosphorylated and activated by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway on conserved serine and threonine residues homologous to those found in AKT-1. However, in most cell types, steady-state levels of SGK-1 are far less abundant than AKT-1 (8Lang F. Cohen P. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/oc_sigtrans;2001/108/re17)PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that in addition to the transcriptional regulation of sgk-1, SGK-1 protein levels are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, adding another dimension to the mechanism of regulation of this unusual serine-threonine kinase. We also show that polyubiquitin-modified SGK-1 is predominantly localized to the membrane-associated fraction of the cell. These observations suggest that SGK-1 is ubiquitinated at or near the membrane rather than in the cytosol. Alternatively, deubiquitinating enzymes may preferentially act on SGK-1 in the cytosolic compartment, thereby resulting in accumulation of polyubiquitinated SGK-1 in the membrane fraction.While these studies were ongoing, SGK-1 was shown to directly phosphorylate and inactivate Nedd4-2, a known membrane-associated protein that is the E3 ligase responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (14Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Prat J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O.

This raises the interesting possibility that SGK-1 may both phosphorylate and act as an E3 substrate of Nedd4-2 (or another E3 ligase), thereby achieving a tight negative feedback of SGK-1 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2061285041,"T cells expressing T cell receptor (TCR) complexes that lack CD3δ, either due to deletion of the CD3δgene, or by replacement of the connecting peptide of the TCRα chain, exhibit severely impaired positive selection and TCR-mediated activation of CD8 single-positive T cells. Because the same defects have been observed in mice expressing no CD8β or tailless CD8β, we examined whether CD3δ serves to couple TCR·CD3 with CD8. To this end we used T cell hybridomas and transgenic mice expressing the T1 TCR, which recognizes a photoreactive derivative of the PbCS 252–260 peptide in the context of H-2Kd. We report that, in thymocytes and hybridomas expressing the T1 TCR·CD3 complex, CD8αβ associates with the TCR. This association was not observed on T1 hybridomas expressing only CD8αα or a CD3δ− variant of the T1 TCR. CD3δ was selectively co-immunoprecipitated with anti-CD8 antibodies, indicating an avid association of CD8 with CD3δ. Because CD8αβ is a raft constituent, due to this association a fraction of TCR·CD3 is raft-associated. Cross-linking of these TCR-CD8 adducts results in extensive TCR aggregate formation and intracellular calcium mobilization. Thus, CD3δ couples TCR·CD3 with raft-associated CD8, which is required for effective activation and positive selection of CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568679764,"We examined the regulation of α4β1 integrin function in melanoma cells and T cells by ligands of CD47. A CD47 antibody (B6H12) that inhibited αvβ3-mediated adhesion of melanoma cells induced by CD47-binding peptides from thrombospondin-1 directly stimulated α4β1-mediated adhesion of the same cells to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 or thrombospondin-2. B6H12 also stimulated α4β1- as well as α2β1- and α5β1-mediated adhesion of CD47-expressing T cells but not of CD47-deficient T cells. α4β1 and CD47 co-purified as a detergent-stable complex on a CD47 antibody affinity column. CD47-binding peptides based on C-terminal sequences of thrombospondin-1 also specifically enhanced adhesion of melanoma cells and T cells to α4β1 ligands. Unexpectedly, activation of α4β1 function by the thrombospondin-1 CD47-binding peptides also occurred in CD47-deficient T cells. CD47-independent activation of α4β1required the Val-Val-Met (VVM) motif of the peptides and was sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin. These results indicate that activation of α4β1 by the CD47 antibody B6H12 and by VVM peptides occurs by different mechanisms.

In addition to its known functional and physical interactions with αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and α2β1 integrins, several publications have suggested an association of CD47 with α4β1 integrin. CD47 and α4β1 were colocalized on microvilli of K562 erythroleukemia cells (18Abitorabi M.A. Pachynski R.K. Ferrando R.E. Tidswell M. Erle D.J. J.

In the latter study, ligation of CD47 by TSP1 or signal-regulatory protein 1α was inferred to activate α4β1integrin on T cells, although this was not demonstrated either functionally or biochemically.We recently found that CD47 expression is required for stimulation of T cell motility and expression of MMP-2 stimulated by α4β1 integrin ligands (19Li Z.

Thus, TSP1 could potentially regulate its own interaction with α4β1 integrin through simultaneous interactions with CD47 and α4β1 integrin on a T cell, analogous to the ability of soluble TSP1 to stimulate αvβ3integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion to immobilized TSP1 (21Sipes J.M. Krutzsch H.C. Lawler J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22755-22762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).To define a molecular basis for functional cross-talk between these two receptors, we have examined the effect of CD47 ligands on the function of α4β1 integrin in T cells and melanoma cells. We confirmed that ligation of CD47 can activate α4β1 integrin function but unexpectedly found the mechanism of this activity to be CD47 ligand-dependent. We further show that CD47 ligation differentially activates and inactivates αvβ3 and α4β1in melanoma cells and α4β1 and α5β1 in Jurkat cells. Unexpectedly, but consistent with a recent report demonstrating CD47-independent induction of platelet aggregation by a CD47-binding peptide from TSP1 (22Tulasne D. Judd B.A. Johansen M. Asazuma N. Best D. Brown E.J. Kahn M. Koretzky G.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 3346-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we found that effects of the CD47-binding peptide derived from TSP1 on α4β1-dependent T cell adhesion are CD47-independent.DISCUSSIONWe have identified two additional integrins that are functionally regulated by CD47, α4β1 and α5β1. Two CD47 ligands, VVM-containing peptides and the anti-CD47 antibody B6H12, stimulated cell attachment or spreading mediated by these integrins. Although activity of the CD47 antibody is clearly dependent on CD47 and we show that CD47 physically associates with α4β1 integrin, at least part of the activities of the VVM-containing peptides to stimulate α4β1-dependent adhesion are independent of CD47. The stimulatory activity of B6H12 for β1 integrin responses contrasts with the inhibitory activities of B6H12 for αvβ3 (6Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and αIIbβ3 integrin functions (9Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Ligation of CD47 by B6H12, therefore, can selectively enhance and inhibit the function of different integrins. This differential effect on integrin activities may be important for understanding the biological functions of CD47.Although ligation of CD47 is now known to stimulate functions of three β1 integrins, this response is not universal in that α3β1 integrin function was not stimulated by a CD47-binding peptide (39Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As previously demonstrated for β3 integrins and α2β1, CD47 is physically associated with α4β1 in cells, where it regulates function of this β1 integrin. Both CD47 (40Rebres R.A. Green J.M.

Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and α4β1 integrin (42Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) associate with lipid rafts in Jurkat cells, suggesting that their interaction may involve these membrane microdomains. Notably, αvβ3 activity is increased when CD47 translocates out of raft domains (43Maile L.A. Imai Y. Clarke J.B. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1800-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Function of the αvβ3 integrin is modulated by CD47, and this integrin can in turn regulate α4β1 integrin (36Imhof B.A. Weerasinghe D. Brown E.J. Lindberg F.P. Hammel P. Piali L. Dessing M. Gisler R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3242-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, however, we show that regulation of α4β1 integrin by CD47 is independent of αvβ3 integrin expression. Instead CD47 may modulate α4β1integrin function by physically associating with the integrin. Association of integrins with other extracellular proteins has been generally mapped to the extracellular domains of both the integrin and the associating membrane protein (44Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R.

Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, regulation of α4β1-dependent adhesion by CD47 required the presence of only the extracellular domain and a single transmembrane domain (2Ticchioni M. Raimondi V. Lamy L. Wijdenes J. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. Bernard A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Although some activities of the CD47-binding peptide from TSP1 are clearly mediated by CD47, the peptides must also interact with a different receptor. Activity of these TSP1 peptides in CD47-deficient platelets was partially dependent on FcR γ expression (22Tulasne D. Judd B.A. Johansen M. Asazuma N. Best D. Brown E.J. Kahn M. Koretzky G.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 3346-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but Jurkat cells do not express this receptor (47Green J.M. Schreiber A.D. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and do not show the same sensitivity to Src inhibition as was reported in platelets (22Tulasne D. Judd B.A. Johansen M. Asazuma N. Best D. Brown E.J. Kahn M. Koretzky G.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 3346-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of CD47 in response to the TSP1 peptide is further complicated by our observation that the CD47-independent pathway shares the sensitivity to pertussis toxin that characterizes CD47 signaling. Until the second receptor for the TSP1 peptides is identified and its ability to recognize intact TSP1 is assessed, activities of these peptides should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, recognizing that the CD47-binding peptides from TSP1 can, in at least two cell types, act independent of CD47 may necessitate a reexamination of the conclusion that CD47 “function-blocking” antibodies block a CD47-signaling pathway. In almost all such cases, the reported blocking of CD47 responses represents antagonism of TSP1 peptide responses (6Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Gao A.-G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). An equally plausible hypothesis is that the CD47 antibody indirectly antagonizes signaling stimulated by binding of the TSP1 peptides to a receptor other than CD47. In this case, the observed antagonism could be a negative cross-talk between two agonist pathways.With a few exceptions (4Ticchioni M. Deckert M. Mary F. Bernard G. Brown E.J. Bernard A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar), the CD47 antibody B6H12 has been generally found to block responses mediated by other CD47 ligands (7Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. J.

Our data confirm that B6H12 reverses the activation of αvβ3 integrin function stimulated by a CD47-binding peptide from TSP1, but we also show that the antibody has a direct stimulating function for at least two β1integrins in the same cells. This stimulating function was confirmed in both melanoma cells and T cells. Therefore, it may be proper to reclassify B6H12 as a function-modifying antibody for CD47. A function blocking antibody recognizing β1 integrins was similarly shown to allosterically modulate ligand binding (48Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because B6H12 has opposing effects on β1 and β3 integrin function in melanoma cells, both the positive and negative effects of B6H12 on integrin function may result from direct or allosteric regulation of CD47 association with or signaling to integrins rather than direct inhibition of ligand binding to CD47.In T cells, peptide FIRVVMYEGKK and a β1integrin-activating antibody had additive effects on adhesion to TSP1 and collagen. However, the peptide had minimal activity in the absence of the β1 integrin-activating antibody, suggesting that TSP1 signaling through CD47 is insufficient to activate α2β1 integrin in these cells. The additivity also suggests that the effect of this signal is to increase integrin avidity rather than affinity. Likewise, the maximal dose of the TSP1 peptide only stimulated ∼50% of T cells to attach on an α5β1 integrin ligand, whereas the addition of the β1-activating antibody further stimulated α5β1-dependent adhesion at saturating doses of the TSP1 peptide. This differs from the strong stimulation of α4β1-mediated adhesion by the CD47-binding peptide. Thus, the TSP1 peptide differentially affects three β1 integrins in the T cells. The mechanisms for differential cross-talk between this signal and each integrin remain to be defined.B6H12 was previously reported to delay neutrophil transmigration toward formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (49Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). B6H12 also inhibited chemotaxis of endothelial cells stimulated by TSP1 and its CD47-binding peptide (32Gao A.-G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We found that B6H12 inhibited T cell chemotaxis to TSP1, NoC1, and NoC2 (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because NoC1 and NoC2 do not contain the CD47 binding sites, we concluded that CD47 ligation must indirectly inhibit migration (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This inhibition was interpreted as indicating a positive requirement for CD47 in α4β1-mediated chemotaxis, consistent with the absence of motility in CD47-deficient cells (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but the same results could also be obtained if B6H12 binding to CD47 increased the avidity of α4β1. Inhibition of cell motility has been previously observed as a result of activation as well as inhibition of integrins (50Palecek S.P. Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). B6H12 may, therefore, inhibit migration by activating integrins.CD47 and α4β1 integrin are two signaling receptors that sense the extracellular environment. Because TSP1 is a ligand for both receptors, we examined the roles of each in mediating responses of T cells to TSP1 (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For mediating adhesion on TSP1, α4β1 was necessary and sufficient (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the present results show that ligation of CD47 can modulate this response by activating α4β1. For stimulating chemotaxis to TSP1, the integrin and CD47 are both necessary, but direct interaction of TSP1 with the integrin is sufficient to stimulate chemotaxis. The same mechanism applies to regulation of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression; CD47 and α4β1 are both necessary, but the role of CD47 is indirect. Conversely, for inhibiting T cell receptor signaling or T cell proliferation, CD47 is necessary, but α4β1 integrin is not. Therefore, we concluded that CD47 and α4β1 integrin are each functional signaling receptors for TSP1 in T cells that elicit distinct signaling pathways (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In some cases, these pathways engage in cross-talk. In addition to potential cross-talk between their downstream effectors, the present data demonstrate that CD47 may modulate α4β1 integrin function through lateral interactions in the plasma membrane. We found that ligation of CD47 can increase α4β1 integrin activity to mediate cell adhesion, but these lateral interactions may also modulate outside-in signaling through α4β1 integrin. The mechanism of this regulation and the possible requirement for other membrane proteins to mediate CD47-α4β1cross-talk remains to be defined. CD47 (integrin-associated protein) is an integral membrane protein that is required for granulocyte and T cell recruitment to sites of infection (1Lindberg F.P. Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and its absence on red blood cells leads to their rapid macrophage-mediated clearance (3Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). CD47 may also function as a costimulator to regulate T cell activation, survival, and Th1versus Th2 differentiation (4Ticchioni M. Deckert M. Mary F. Bernard G. Brown E.J. Bernard A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar, 5Avice M.N. Rubio M. Sergerie M. Delespesse G. Sarfati M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4624-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Endogenous ligands for the extracellular domain of CD47 include the secreted protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)1 and potentially other members of the thrombospondin family, several integrins (6Gao A.G.

Engagement of CD47 by soluble ligands or signal-regulatory protein counter receptors modulates several cell signaling pathways, including activation of a heterotrimeric G protein (14Frazier W.A.

Although some signal transduction through CD47 is integrin-independent (4Ticchioni M. Deckert M. Mary F. Bernard G. Brown E.J. Bernard A. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to its known functional and physical interactions with αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and α2β1 integrins, several publications have suggested an association of CD47 with α4β1 integrin. CD47 and α4β1 were colocalized on microvilli of K562 erythroleukemia cells (18Abitorabi M.A. Pachynski R.K. Ferrando R.E. Tidswell M. Erle D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and CD47-dependent arrest of T cells on inflammatory endothelium could be blocked by antibodies that prevent α4β1 integrin binding to VCAM-1 (2Ticchioni M. Raimondi V. Lamy L. Wijdenes J. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. Bernard A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the latter study, ligation of CD47 by TSP1 or signal-regulatory protein 1α was inferred to activate α4β1integrin on T cells, although this was not demonstrated either functionally or biochemically. We recently found that CD47 expression is required for stimulation of T cell motility and expression of MMP-2 stimulated by α4β1 integrin ligands (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). An antibody to CD47 also blocked the motility response to an α4β1 integrin ligand (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, at least a functional interaction occurs between CD47 and α4β1 integrin. We identified a binding site for α4β1integrin in the N-terminal domains of TSP1 and TSP2 (19Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas two binding sites for CD47 have been localized to the C-terminal domain of TSP1 (for review, see Ref. 20Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Thus, TSP1 could potentially regulate its own interaction with α4β1 integrin through simultaneous interactions with CD47 and α4β1 integrin on a T cell, analogous to the ability of soluble TSP1 to stimulate αvβ3integrin-depen"

A recent study using GAS6knock-out mice showed that Gas6 acts as a platelet-response amplifier in thrombosis by an unknown mechanism (4Angelillo-Scherrer A. Garcia de Frutos P. Aparicio C. Melis E.

An important biological activity of Gas6 is its binding to and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) Axl (Ark, Ufo, Tyro7), Sky (Rse, Tyro3, Dtk, Etk, Brt, Tif), and Mer (Eyk, Nyk, Tyro12) (5Varnum B.C.

Gas6 is the only known bona fide ligand of the Axl RTK family, but PS can also activate these receptors under non-physiological conditions (10Godowski P.J. Mark M.R. Chen J. Sadick M.D. Raab H.

Gene knock-out studies in mice indicate a high level of redundancy as only mice lacking all three receptors manifest an overt phenotype, namely infertility due to abnormal spermatogenesis (21Lu Q. Gore M. Zhang Q. Camenisch T. Boast S. Casagranda F. Lai C. Skinner M.K. Klein R. Matsushima G.K. Earp H.S. Goff S.P. Lemke G.

Science. 2001; 293: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The fact that these defects are distinct from the phenotype of theGAS6 knock-out mice could indicate the presence of additional components in the Gas6-Axl system regulating cellular homeostasis. Experiments with Gas6/PS chimeras demonstrated that the LG domains of Gas6 fully contain the RTK-binding site (8Mark M.R. Chen J. Hammond R.G. Sadick M. Godowski P.J. J. Biol.

Axl family RTKs have ectodomains reminiscent of cell adhesion molecules consisting of two immunoglobulin-like domains followed by two fibronectin type III domains (25Janssen J.W.G. Schulz A.S.

The Gas6-binding site has not been localized to any RTK domain nor is the mechanism of activation known. Because LG domains are not related to any of the established families of RTK ligands, the available receptor-ligand complex structures (27Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 28Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L.

LG domains consist of 180–200 residues and are found in a functionally diverse set of proteins, including extracellular matrix proteins, cell surface receptors, and hormone-binding proteins (31Rudenko G.

Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) revealed a β-sandwich structure consisting of 12–14 β-strands. A homology model of the LG domain pair of PS, based on the structures available at the time, did not offer any clues about the location of ligand-binding sites in PS or Gas6 (36Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Borgel D. Gandrille S. Muller Y.A. Proteins. 2001; 43: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of the LG domain pair of human Gas6 (Gas6-LG), which reveals significant differences to the LG pair from the laminin α2 chain, including a conspicuous patch of surface-exposed hydrophobic residues. Mutagenesis of some of these residues is shown to have a marked effect on Axl binding and activation, thus identifying a component of the RTK-binding site. A full-length cDNA coding for human Gas6 was prepared using mRNA from normal breast epithelium cell line MCF-10a as a template (kindly provided by Tatjana Knyazeva). This cDNA and a human expressed sequence tag clone (AI 129327) were used to obtain expression vectors for the LG modules in the pCEP-Pu plasmid following previous protocols (37Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification were: G6-1, 5′-GTCAGCTAGCCCACTGTGACGGGCGTGGGGG; G6-2, 5′-GTCAGGATCCCTAGGCTGCGGCGGGCTCC; G6-3, 5′-GTCAGGATCCCTATCTCTCCGTCACCGAGAAG; G6-4, 5′-GTCAGCTAGCAGGCTCTTTCTACCCCGGGAG. These primers introduced anNheI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end to allow insertion into the pCEP-Pu vector after the BM-40 signal peptide. The combinations G6-1/G6-2 were used for the Gas6-LG vector (residues 261–678), G6-1/G6-3 for the Gas6-LG1 vector (residues 261–476), and G6-4/G6-2 for the Gas6-LG2 vector (residues 477–678). Point mutations were introduced by fusion PCR. The correct sequence (wild type, GenBank™ accession code L13720) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The episomal expression vectors were used for the transfection of human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (37Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Conditioned serum-free medium (1 liter) was passed over DEAE-cellulose equilibrated in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and the recombinant proteins were eluted with a linear 0–0.5 mNaCl gradient (800 ml). Gas6-LG eluted at 0.08–0.15 mNaCl, and LG2 eluted at 0.15–0.20 m NaCl. Final purification was achieved on a Superose 12 column equilibrated in 0.02m ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Both Gas6-LG (molecular mass, 51 kDa) and Gas6-LG2 (20 kDa) eluted at positions expected for monomers. Disulfide bridges in Gas6-LG were reduced in 6 mguanidinium hydrochloride as described previously (38Paulsson M. Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Digestions with endoproteinase Glu-C were performed in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 24 h at 37 °C at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 and examined by SDS-PAGE. An expression vector for the extracellular domain of human Axl (Axl-ex) was produced by inserting the cDNA coding for residues 1–410 into the pcDNA3-GST vector (Invitrogen). The Axl-ex-GST fusion protein was purified from the conditioned medium of stably transfected 293 cells on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and showed a single band of 100 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The generation of rabbit antisera against Gas6-LG and Axl-ex-GST as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titrations followed previous protocols (37Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The antiserum to Axl-ex-GST was cross-absorbed on GST-Sepharose resin prior to use. Solid-phase binding assays with Gas6 proteins followed previous protocols (37Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Microtiter wells (50 μl) were coated with 5 μg/ml Axl-ex-GST. Binding was detected by a rabbit antiserum against Gas6-LG. No binding was observed in control wells coated with bovine serum albumin. Surface plasmon resonance assays were performed with a BIAcore 100 instrument (BIAcore AB) following previous protocols (39Göhring W. Sasaki T. Heldin C.-H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The Axl-ex-GST fusion protein was coupled to CM5 sensor chips with carbodiimide. Kinetic constants were calculated by non-linear fitting of association and dissociation curves according to a 1:1 model (BIA evaluation software 3.0). All binding curves could be fitted with χ2 < 2. Human U-118 glioblastoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) expressing the Axl receptor were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were passaged twice a week to keep them in a proliferating state. One day prior to testing, the medium was replaced to reduce Axl phosphorylation by endogenous Gas6. The cells were incubated with the various recombinant Gas6 fragments and mutants for 15 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and 1 ml of lysate was incubated with Axl-ex antiserum (200 μg/ml antibody) and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer, dissolved in reducing Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5–12.5% gradient gels. Following transfer to Protran membranes, blots were performed with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:104 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The reaction was visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Control incubations included non-stimulated cells and cells stimulated with Gas6-LG but with the Axl-ex antiserum replaced by preimmune serum. Both controls consistently gave negative results. For crystallization experiments, the Gas6-LG buffer was exchanged to 0.1 mNa-HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and the protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a Centricon-30 ultrafiltration device. Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals were obtained by the hanging drop method using 0.1 mNa-HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.4–1.5 mLi2SO4 as precipitant. The space group of the crystals is I4122 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 111.31 Å, c = 217.72 Å. There is one molecule of Gas6-LG in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of 65%. For data collection, the crystals were briefly soaked in 0.1m Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.6 mLi2SO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen to 100 K. Diffraction data were collected on station 9.6 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) Daresbury using a Quantum4 CCD detector (λ = 0.87 Å). The data were processed with MOSFLM (40Leslie A.G.W. MOSFLM Users Guide. The Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK1994Google Scholar) and reduced with programs of the CCP4 suite (41CCP4-Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Two non-isomorphous native data sets (NAT1 and NAT2) and a data set collected from a crystal soaked in 10 mmNaAu(CN)2 for 30 h (AUCN) were used in the structure determination (Table I). The AUCN data were scaled to NAT1, and two heavy atom sites were found using the CCP4 program RSPS. Phases to 3.0-Å resolution were calculated with MLPHARE including the anomalous scattering of the gold atoms (mean figure of merit = 0.347). The resulting electron density was dramatically improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching with the CCP4 program DM at 3.0-Å resolution. A partial model was built with O (42Jones T.A. Zhou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) using the laminin α2LG4–5 structure (33Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. This model was refined with CNS (43Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Further refinement was carried out against the NAT2 data at 2.2-Å resolution and converged atR free = 0.259 (Table II). The first and last residue defined by the electron density are His261 and Ala678, respectively. There is no convincing density for a number of loop regions (300–304, 452–460, 495–502, and 544–548). A total of 86.4% of all residues are in the core regions of the Ramachandran plot (44Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and only two residues (Gln315and Arg414) have disallowed main chain torsion angles. The coordinates of the final model have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry code 1h30).Table IData collection and phasing statisticsData setNAT1NAT2AUCNResolution range (Å)20–2.720–2.220–3.0Unique reflections19,14735,01813,975Average multiplicity6.45.0 (5.0)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution shell (2.32–2.20 Å).4.9Completeness (%)99.799.8 (100)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution shell (2.32–2.20 Å).99.5R mergebR merge = ΣhΣi‖I i(h) − 〈I(h)〉‖/ΣhΣi I i(h), where I i(h) is the ith measurement of reflection h, and 〈I(h)〉 is the weighted mean of all measurements of h.0.0640.082 (0.297)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution shell (2.32–2.20 Å).0.042R derivcR deriv = Σh‖ ‖F PH‖ − ‖F P‖ ‖/Σh ‖F P‖, where F P andF PH are the native and derivative structure factors, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The Gas6-LG fragment (amino acid residues 261–678 of human Gas6) was expressed in 293-EBNA cells using the episomal vector pCEP-Pu, which contains the BM-40 secretion signal sequence (37Kohfeldt E. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition to domains LG1 and LG2, the Gas6-LG fragment contains the last disulfide-bonded loop of the EG tandem (residues 261–277). We also prepared episomal vectors for the individual LG1 (residues 261–476) and LG2 (residues 477–678) domains but could observe expression only of LG2. We determined the crystal structure at 2.2-Å resolution of Gas6-LG. Initial phases were obtained from a single gold derivative with anomalous scattering and greatly improved by density modification (Tables I and II). The Gas6-LG model refined against the high resolution NAT2 data encompasses residues 261–678. Residues 300–304, 452–460, 495–502, and 544–548 are not defined by the electron density and are presumed to be disordered. Refinement against the NAT1 data did not reveal any electron density for the missing regions. The Gas6-LG fragment has approximate overall dimensions of 80 × 40 × 35 Å3. The two domains, LG1 and LG2, are related by a rotation of ∼100° about an axis passing near the domain termini and interact through an interface that buries 900 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface (Fig.1). A calcium ion is an integral part of the domain interface (see below). The C-terminal 16 residues of EG4 pack loosely against LG2 but make no specific contacts with LG2. The extended segment linking EG4 to LG1 contains Cys283, which forms a disulfide bridge with Cys570 located in LG2. LG1 and LG2 adopt the typical β-sandwich fold of all LG domains (31Rudenko G. Hohenester E. Muller Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 363-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). LG1 contains 12 β-strands arranged in two sheets (ALCHIJ and BKDEFG). The long K-L loop fills the concave depression created by the BKDEFG sheet. LG2 contains 11 β-strands arranged in the same topological order but with strand J missing. The detailed structure of LG2 is significantly different from all other LG domains solved to date due to the presence of a 25-Å-long α-helix (α1) situated at the upper edge of the β-sandwich (in the view of Fig. 1 A). The β-sandwich is splayed open to allow α1 to participate in the hydrophobic core of the domain. Like almost all members of the LG superfamily, both LG1 and LG2 contain a disulfide bridge near the C terminus of the domain. The calcium-binding site located in the interface between LG1 and LG2 is shown in Fig. 2. Both LG domains contribute metal ion ligands. The calcium ion is coordinated by the side chains of Asp329 (LG1) and Asp656 (LG2), the carbonyl oxygens of residues 331 and 440 (both in LG1), and two water molecules. The interaction with Asp329 is bidentate, resulting in a favorable pentagonal bipyramidal coordination of the calcium ion. The calcium-ligand distances range from 2.45 to 2.72 Å (average, 2.59 Å). In the second shell, the side chain of Asp654 (LG2) forms a hydrogen bond with one of the calcium-bound water molecules, and His668 (LG2) interacts with both Asp654 and Asp656. In addition to the calcium-binding site, there is an intricate network of hydrogen bonds and well ordered water molecules connecting LG1 and LG2. Notably there are no prominent hydrophobic interface contacts in the LG1-LG2 interface proper, although Phe471 in the LG1-LG2 linker region packs against Pro671 near the C terminus. The extended segment preceding LG1 makes one very conspicuous interaction with LG2 by inserting the side chain of Phe286into a hydrophobic pocket created by LG2 residues Phe479, Ala516, and Pro671. The overall impression of the Gas6-LG structure is that of a relatively rigid domain tandem. The prototype of an LG tandem structure is the C-terminal LG4-LG5 domain pair from the laminin α2 chain (33Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which shares ≈20% sequence identity with Gas6-LG. While the two structures are rather similar, as expected, there is a significant difference in the relative arrangement of the two LG domains. Compared with the laminin structure, the LG domains in Gas6-LG are twisted by 20° about an axis roughly parallel to the long dimension of the domain pair and passing near the LG1-LG2 linker (not shown). As a result, many interface contacts in the two structures do not involve equivalent residues. For instance, the Cα-Cα distance of the two calcium ligands in Gas6-LG, Asp329 and Asp656, is 9.7 Å, whereas the equivalent residues in the laminin α2 chain (Ala2793 and Ala3102, respectively) are 13.1 Å apart. Domain LG1 of Gas6 is most similar to the N-terminal LG domain of SHBG (35Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and 120 Cα atoms can be superimposed with a root mean square (r.m.s.) difference of only 0.82 Å (Fig.3 A). The structure of full-length SHBG is not known but is likely to contain an interdomain calcium site equivalent to the one in Gas6-LG, given that the calcium ligands are conserved in the two proteins and a calcium ion was observed in the N-terminal LG domain of SHBG (35Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Domain LG2 of Gas6 can be superimposed onto LG5 of the laminin α2 chain (32Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) with an r.m.s. difference of 1.8 Å (116 Cα atoms) (Fig. 3 B). Helix α1 in Gas6 LG2 replaces the extended J-K segment in laminin LG5, which is involved in binding a functionally important calcium ion (32Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). From sequence analysis, a similar helix is likely to be present in the C-terminal LG domain of PS but not of SHBG. We examined the molecular surface of the Gas6-LG structure for potential receptor-binding regions and noticed a patch of solvent-exposed aromatic and aliphatic residues in the LG2 domain consisting of Phe485, Phe487, Trp526, Leu620, and Tyr660 (Fig.4). Using a 1.4-Å probe, we calculated that 16–33% of the side chain surface area of th"

Activation of RalA and RalB by growth hormone did not require the activity of JAK2 per se. Ras was also activated by GH and was required for the GH-stimulated formation of GTP-bound RalA and RalB. Activation of RalA by GH subsequently resulted in increased phospholipase D activity and the formation of its metabolite, phosphatidic acid. GH-stimulated RalA-phospholipase D-dependent formation of phosphatidic acid was required for activation of p44/42 MAPK and subsequent Elk-1-mediated transcription stimulated by GH.

Due to lack of intrinsic kinase activity, members of the cytokine receptor superfamily, including the growth hormone (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; PLD, phospholipase D; hGH, human GH; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GEFs, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; PA, phosphatidic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphatidylinositol kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; AA, arachidonic acid; BFA, brefeldin A; PLA2, phospholipase A2; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EGF, epidermal growth factor. receptor, recruit and activate non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the JAK family to relay their cellular signals (1Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Google Scholar). JAK2 has been reported to be the predominant JAK required for the initiation of GH signal transduction upon ligand binding to the GH receptor (2Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Google Scholar, 3Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Google Scholar, 4Kopchick J.J. Andry J.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 71: 293-314Google Scholar). To date, all identified downstream signaling pathways utilized by GH apparently require JAK2 activity (2Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Google Scholar, 3Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Google Scholar, 4Kopchick J.J. Andry J.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 71: 293-314Google Scholar). The only reported JAK2-independent effect of GH is Ca2+ entry via L-type calcium channels (5Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P. Allevato G. Ilondo M. Nielsen J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2725-2729Google Scholar), although this has been disputed (6Fresno Vara J.A. Carretero M.V. Geronimo H. Ballmer-Hofer K. Martin-Perez J. Biochem.

However, it is likely that other, as yet uncharacterized, signal transduction pathways stimulated by GH are activated independent of JAK2 activity. The major groups of signaling molecules thus far identified to be activated by GH include the following: 1) other receptor (EGF receptor) (8Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Sekine N. Wada M. Honjo M. Takahashi M. Takahashi T. Hirai H. Tushima T. Akanuma Y. Fujita T. Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Nature. 1997; 390: 91-96Google Scholar) and non-receptor (c-Src, c-Fyn (9Zhu T. Goh E.L. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Google Scholar), and FAK (10Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10682-10689Google Scholar)) kinases, although as in the case of the EGF receptor it may be used simply as an adapter protein; 2) members of the MAP kinase family including p44/42 MAP kinase (11Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Google Scholar, 12Campbell G.S. Pang L. Miyasaka T. Saltiel A.R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

Goh E.L. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Google Scholar) and the respective downstream pathways; 3) members of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) group including IRS-1, -2, and -3 which may act as docking proteins for further activation of signaling molecules including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (14Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W. Myers Jr., M.G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14685-14692Google Scholar); 4) small Ras-like GTPases (15Vanderkuur J.A. Butch E.R. Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Guan K.L. Carter-Su C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4301-4307Google Scholar); and 5) STAT family members including STATs 1, 3, 5a, and 5b (16Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Pircher T.J. Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Gustafsson J.A. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9448-9453Google Scholar, 17Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Google Scholar), which constitute one major mechanism for transcriptional regulation by GH. Ras is a member of the Ras-like GTPase family (18Matozaki T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 515-524Google Scholar, 19Sears R.C. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11617-11620Google Scholar). This family is characterized by similarities in the effector domain which Ras utilizes to interact with downstream target molecules. The Ras-like GTPases play a critical role in multiple signaling pathways leading from various cell-surface receptors. The activation and inactivation of the Ras-like GTPases are controlled by conformational change because of a GTP-GDP binding cycle that is controlled by the following three different regulatory proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. In its GTP-bound state, Ras in turn interacts with distinct downstream effectors and initiates multiple signaling pathways, which include at least three downstream signaling cascades mediated by the Raf protein kinase (i.e. A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1), RalGEF (i.e. RalGDS, Rlf, and Rgl), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinases (18Matozaki T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 515-524Google Scholar, 19Sears R.C. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11617-11620Google Scholar, 20Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Google Scholar). Recent reports (20Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Google Scholar, 21Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Google Scholar) suggest that two other members of the Ras-like small GTPase family, namely RalA and RalB, possess pivotal roles in the control of cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, vesicular transport, and receptor endocytosis. Ral is also the member of the Ras-like GTPases family, and its activity is regulated by cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states controlled through the direct binding of active Ras to Ral-specific GEFs. However, additional Ras-independent mechanisms also exist to stimulate the formation of GTP-bound Ral. For example (22Suzuki J. Yamazaki Y. Li G. Kaziro Y. Koide H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4658-4665Google Scholar,23Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Google Scholar), RalA can be activated independently of Ras activation via its direct binding to Ca2+ alone (24Park J.B. Exp. Mol. Med. 2001; 33: 54-58Google Scholar) or to Ca2+-bound calmodulin in response to the elevated level of intracellular calcium (23Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Google Scholar). Moreover, PI 3-kinase (25M'Rabet L. Coffer P.J. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21847-21852Google Scholar) and Src-like kinases (25M'Rabet L. Coffer P.J. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21847-21852Google Scholar, 26de Ruiter N.D. Wolthuis R.M. van Dam H. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8480-8488Google Scholar) have also been implicated in Ral activation. Once activated, Ral further interacts with several other proteins that may function as its downstream effectors. RalA has been demonstrated to associate directly with phospholipase D1 (PLD1) via its N-terminal sequence and operates synergistically with another PLD1-interacting small GTPase, Arf, to activate PLD1 activity (27Luo J.Q. Liu X. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Ramos M. Flom J. Jiang H. Feig L.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A. Foster D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3632-3637Google Scholar). Phospholipase D (PLD, including PLD1 and PLD2) is a widely expressed phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine, a major phospholipid in the cell membrane, to form phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. PA can be further converted to diacylglycerol (DAG) and lyso-PA, both of which are the well known intracellular mediators and extracellular messengers of multiple biological activities (28Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Google Scholar, 29Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Google Scholar). Two other proteins have also been reported that are to known to interact with the GTP-bound form of RalA, leading to RalA-dependent cellular effects. The first is Ral-binding protein 1 or RalBP1 (also called RLIP76) (30Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Google Scholar), which is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (30Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Google Scholar, 31Kariya K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Oshiro T. Morinaka K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18399-183406Google Scholar). RalBP1 is also a GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42, a Rho family member involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and filopodia formation in fibroblasts (30Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Google Scholar). The second is filamin, which serves as a downstream intermediate in Cdc42-mediated filopod production by its association with RalA (32Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that GH stimulates the formation of the active GTP-bound form of both RalA and RalB in NIH-3T3 cells. Activation of RalA and RalB by growth hormone did not require the activity of JAK2 per se. However, full activation of RalA and RalB by GH required the combined activity of both c-Src and JAK2, both kinases activated by GH independent of the other. Activation of RalA by GH subsequently resulted in the activation of PLD and the formation of phosphatidic acid that was required for activation of p44/42 MAP kinase by GH. Thus we report the identification of a JAK2-independent pathway regulating GH-stimulated p44/42 MAP kinase activity.

The dominant negative Ras plasmid was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All plasmids were prepared with the plasmid megaprep kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). NIH-3T3 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Prior to treatment, cells were deprived of serum for 12–16 h in serum-free medium. Unless otherwise indicated, the final concentration of the PP1 was 50 μm; PP2 was 20 μm; PP3 was 50 μm; AG490 was 100 μm; and hGH was 50 nm. This concentration of GH is within the physiological range for circulating rodent GH. NIH-3T3 cells were grown to sub-confluence, incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium, washed once in serum-free medium, and incubated with 50 nm hGH for the indicated times. After stimulation with hGH and lysis with 1× Ral buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmleupeptin, 10 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor per ml, and 0.1 μm aprotinin), samples were put on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been precoupled to recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-RalBP1-RBD or GST-Raf1-RBD were prepared as described (33Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Google Scholar, 34de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Google Scholar). After preclearance of the lysates with glutathione-agarose, 15 μg of GST-RalBP1-RBD or GST-Raf-1-RBD-agarose precoupled to glutathione beads was added to 500 μg of cell lysate per assay with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 45 min. Samples were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide), immunoblotted, and probed with the respective antibodies. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min with regular vortices. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined. 800 μg of protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating lysates with 20 μl of gel slurry of anti-JAK2/protein A-agarose. The reaction mixture was gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitations were washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard electroblotting procedures. After preincubation with inhibitors for the indicated times and/or incubation with the indicated concentration of hGH for the appropriate duration, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in an appropriate amount of lysis buffer. Cell lysates were dissolved and denatured in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separation was achieved on 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at 22 °C. The blots were then treated with the primary antibody in PBST containing 1% non-fat dry milk at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBST, immunolabeling was detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reblotting, membranes were stripped by incubation for 30 min at 50 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 30 min with several changes of PBST at room temperature. Efficacy of stripping was determined by re-exposure of the membranes to ECL. Thereafter, blots were reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. Src kinase assays were performed as described according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). In brief, supernatant containing 150 μg of protein per sample derived from cells stimulated with hGH was incubated with 1 μg of Src polyclonal antibody at 4 °C for 2–4 h in a final volume of 500 μl. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer. 10 μl (150 μm final concentration) of the substrate peptide, 10 μl of Src reaction buffer, and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP stock were added to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with agitation. 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid was then added to precipitate peptides, and a 25-μl aliquot was transferred onto the center of a numbered P81 paper square. The assay squares were washed 5 times for 5 min each with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. The assay squares were transferred to a scintillation vial, and 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added, and the level of radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. The sample that contains no enzyme serves as the background control. p44/42 MAP kinase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing 200 μg of protein per sample was incubated overnight at least 4 h with an immobilized phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody (1:300 dilution) in a final volume of 500 μl in 1× lysis buffer. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmglycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein and 200 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Elk-1 phosphorylation was selectively detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescence detection system and a specific phospho-Elk-1 (Ser383) antibody (1:1000 dilution). Subconfluent cells were serum-starved and labeled overnight with [3H]palmitic acid (5 μCi/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After cells were stimulated with 50 nm hGH for the indicated time, the samples were placed on ice, rinsed with cold PBS, and the lipids extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The dried samples were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and developed by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (90:10:10, v/v/v) as the solvent with the unlabeled PA and phosphatidylethanol as lipid standards (Avanti Polar Lipids). For PLD activity assays, cells were stimulated with hGH in the presence of 1% ethanol to determine the total activity of PLD by the standard transphosphatidylation assay. The plates were air-dried, treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to a Kodak X-Omat AR film. The appropriate lipid spots were marked and scraped from the TLC plates and counted via liquid scintillation. Levels of PA or phosphatidylbutanol were normalized to total fatty acid label incorporated into lipid. PLD activity assays were also performed by use of the amplex red phospholipase kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). In brief, cells were lysed in the 1× reaction buffer with 1% Triton X-100 by several quick freeze-thaw cycles at −80 °C (10–15 min each). 100 μl of diluted samples containing 20 μg of total whole lysate was used to perform the assay. The fluorescence in a fluorescent microplate reader was measured using excitation detection at 540 nm and emission detection at 595 nm. Each point was triplicated, and the reading was corrected by subtracting the values derived from the non-PLD controls. NIH-3T3 cells were cultured to 60–80% confluence for transfection experiments in 6-well plates (16Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Pircher T.J. Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Gustafsson J.A. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9448-9453Google Scholar). 0.2 μg of pCMVβ and 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid pFR-Luc were transfected together with 4 ng of the respective fusion trans-activator plasmid (pFA-Elk-1 or pFC2-dbd). For each well, 10–20 μl of Effectene for each μg of DNA was used as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA-lipid complex was diluted to a final volume of 2 ml (for triplicate samples) with 2% fetal bovine serum medium and cells allowed to grow for 12–16 h. 50 nmhGH was added for an additional 24 h. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed with 200 μl of 1× lysis buffer (25 mmTris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) by a freeze-thaw cycle, and lysate was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was used for the assay of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of protein content as well as on the β-galactosidase activity of pCMVβ vector. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 20 μl of precleared cell lysate according to a standard protocol (13Zhu T. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2103-2114Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least 3 times. Numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailedt test or analysis of variance. We employed the GST-linked probe RLIP76-RBD (33Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Google Scholar), which recognizes only the active GTP-bound form of RalA and RalB and not the inactive GDP-bound form of these molecules, to determine the level of RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP in lysates of NIH-3T3 cells stimulated by GH. hGH stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells resulted in the rapid formation of GTP-bound RalA and RalB which could be observed within 30 s of cellular stimulation with hGH (Fig. 1,A and C). The hGH-stimulated formation of both RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP was biphasic, with the first peak of activity observed at 1–2 min after stimulation with hGH, followed by a decline to 15 min, and a second peak of GTP-bound RalA and RalB observed at 30 min, again followed by a decline to 60 min. hGH stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells did not alter RalA or RalB protein levels over the examined period of stimulation (Fig. 1, B and D). The hGH-stimulated formation of both RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP was also dose-dependent with stimulation of the GTP-bound forms of RalA and RalB first observed at 0.005 nm hGH and maximal stimulation from 5 to 50 nm hGH (Fig. 1, E andG). Thus RalA and RalB are two signaling molecules utilized by hGH to exert its effect on cellular function. We next wished to determine the upstream kinases responsible for the hGH-stimulated conversion of RalA and RalB to the GTP-bound form. It was necessary, however, to first examine the potential interdependence between two GH activated kinases, namely JAK2 and c-Src (9Zhu T. Goh E.L. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Google Scholar, 36Berlanga J.J. Fresno Vara J.A. Martin-Perez J. Garcia-Ruiz J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1461-1467Google Scholar), after cellular stimulation with hGH. Neither the generic Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, nor the more specific Src kinase inhibitor PP2, nor the structurally related non-inhibitory PP3 affected JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by hGH (Fig.2 A). Similarly, forced expression of either wild type c-Src or a kinase-deficient c-Src by transient transfection of the respective cDNAs into NIH-3T3 cells did not alter the level of hGH-stimulated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C). Such a result was obtained despite marked overexpression of the respective c-Src molecules (Fig. 2 E). Both PP1 and PP2 inhibited hGH-stimulated c-Src kinase activity (Fig.2 F) under the conditions in which it failed to affect tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. As expected, PP3 did not affect c-Src kinase activity. Forced expression of the kinase-deficient c-Src in NIH-3T3 cells also inhibited c-Src kinase activity (Fig.2 G). Therefore, hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 in NIH-3T3 cells is independent of the activity of c-Src. We next examined whether the activity of JAK2 was required for hGH-stimulated activation of c-Src. We therefore first utilized the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490. AG490, even when utilized at a high concentration more than sufficient to that reported to inhibit JAK2 activity (100 μm was utilized even though 20 μm is sufficient to inhibit hGH-stimulated activation of JAK2), failed to inhibit hGH-stimulated c-Src kinase activity. To demonstrate the efficacy of AG490, we also examined the effect of the same concentration of AG490 on the ability of hGH to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. Pretreatment of NIH-3T3 cells with AG490 before hGH stimulation completely prevented hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 (Fig. 2 H). Similarly, forced expression of a kinase-deficient JAK2 (K882E) (37Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Google Scholar) also failed to inhibit c-Src kinase activity (Fig. 2 F), despite the ability of this kinase-deficient JAK2 to abrogate hGH-stimulated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation under the same conditions. Thus, hGH-stimulated activations of JAK2 and c-Src kinases are two independent and parallel events. We proceeded to determine which of the two independently activated kinases described above were responsible for hGH-stimulated conversion of RalA and RalB to the GTP-bound form. We therefore first examined the effect of the JAK2 kinase inhibitor AG490 on hGH-stimulated conversion of RalA and RalB to the GTP-bound form. AG490 treatment of NIH-3T3 cells decreased the basal level of both RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP without alteration in the total cellular level of either RalA or RalB (Fig. 3, A–D). Treatment of NIH-3T3 cells with AG490 slightly diminished, but did not prevent, RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP formation stimulated by hGH. In contrast, AG490 completely prevented hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK2 substrate STAT5 (data not shown). Similarly forced expression of a kinase-deficient JAK2 slightly diminished, but did not prevent, RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP formation stimulated by hGH. Thus JAK2 is not required for hGH-stimulated conversion of RalA and RalB to the GTP-bound form. We next examined the effect of the generic Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, the more specific Src kinase inhibitor PP2, and the structurally related non-inhibitory PP3 on RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP formation stimulated by hGH. Both PP1 and PP2 abrogated, but did not completely prevent, RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP formation stimulated by hGH (Fig. 3 E). PP3 did not affect hGH-stimulated RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP formation.

Their parents, who are all carriers of one mutant allele, are unaffected, although heterozygous mutations in collagen VI caused Bethlem myopathy. Here we investigated the consequences of threeCOL6A2mutations in fibroblasts from patients and their parents in two Ullrich families. All three mutations lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. However, very low levels of undegraded mutant mRNA remained in patient B with compound heterozygous mutations at the distal part of the triple-helical domain, resulting in deposition of abnormal microfibrils that cannot form extensive networks. This observation suggests that the C-terminal globular domain is not essential for triple-helix formation but is critical for microfibrillar assembly. In all parents, theCOL6A2 mRNA levels are reduced to 57–73% of the control, but long term collagen VI matrix depositions are comparable with that of the control. The almost complete absence of abnormal protein and near-normal accumulation of microfibrils in the parents may account for their lack of myopathic symptoms.

Congenital atonic-sclerotic muscular dystrophy (MIM 254090), first described by Ullrich in 1930 (1Ullrich O. Monatsschr. Kinderheilkd. 1930; 47: 502-510Google Scholar) and later referred to as Ullrich syndrome, delineates a distinct subtype of congenital muscular dystrophy, characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia starting at birth or in early infancy (2Voit T. Brain Dev. 1998; 20: 65-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The salient clinical features of Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) 1The abbreviations used are: UCMD, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy; PTC, premature termination codon; vWF-A, von Willebrand factor A domain; RT, reverse transcriptase; DTT, dithiothreitol are multiple joint contractures associated with distal hyperextensibility. Patients frequently display additional skeletal deformities, including scoliosis and kyphosis, and suffer from respiratory difficulties early in life. The mode of inheritance is consistent with an autosomal recessive pattern (3Nonaka I. Une Y. Ishihara T. Miyoshino S. Nakashima T. Sugita H. Neuropediatrics. 1981; 3: 197-208Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We and others (4Higuchi I. Suehara M. Iwaki H. Nakagawa M. Arimura K. Osame M. Ann.

Subsequently, three homozygous mutations in another collagen VI gene, COL6A3, have been shown to cause severe and mild forms of UCMD with complete or partial deficiency in collagen VI (7Demir E. Sabatelli P. Allamand V. Ferreiro A. Moghadaszadeh B. Makrelouf M. Topaloglu H. Echenne B. Merlini L. Guicheney P. Am. J. Hum.

Several distinctive clinical features of UCMD are also observed in Bethlem myopathy, a mild, dominantly inherited congenital disorder characterized by muscle wasting and multiple joint contractures (8Bethlem J. Wijngaarden G.K. Brain. 1976; 99: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Missense and splicing mutations in all three collagen VI genes have been reported in patients with Bethlem myopathy (9Jöbsis G.J. Keizers H. Vreijling J.P. de Visser M. Speer M.C. Wolterman R.A.

In addition, functional haploinsufficiency of the COL6A1 gene has been demonstrated in three Bethlem myopathy patients (13Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Hutchison W. McKinlay G.R. Bower S.P. Byrne E. Dahl H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Lamande S.R. Shields K.A. Kornberg A.J. Shield L.K. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

Abbate R. Chu M.-L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All the known mutations show a high penetrance. Recently, in three families the dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy has also been shown to be caused by missense mutations in the COL6A1 andCOL6A2 genes (16Scacheri P.C. Gillanders E.M. Subramony S.H. Vedanarayanan V. Crowe C.A. Thakore N. Bingler M. Hoffman E.P. Neurology. 2002; 58: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, abnormalities in collagen VI can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Collagen VI is a ubiquitous extracellular matrix protein comprising three constituent chains encoded by the COL6A1 andCOL6A2 genes on chromosome 21q22.3 and the COL6A3gene on chromosome 2q37 (17Weil D. Mattei M.G. Passage E. N′Guyen V.C. Pribula-Conway D. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1988; 42: 435-445PubMed Google Scholar). The α1(VI) and α2(VI) collagen chains are similar in size (140 kDa), each of which contains a triple-helical domain flanked by N- and C-terminal globular domains, composed of two von Willebrand factor type A (vWF-A) motifs of ∼200 amino acids (reviewed in Ref. 18Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, the α3(VI) collagen chain is much larger (250–300 kDa) with extended N- and C-terminal globular domains. The three constituent chains, however, have similarly sized central triple-helical domains of 335–336 amino acids, which fold together into a triple-helical collagen VI monomer. Prior to secretion, the monomers associate in an antiparallel fashion into dimers, which assemble laterally into tetramers (18Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar). In the extracellular space, the tetramers associate end-to-end forming microfibrils with a periodicity of two beads every 105 nm. The first four mutations identified in UCMD are all COL6A2mutations, which result in frameshifts and subsequent premature stop codons (PTC) at different positions along the mRNA (5Camacho Vanegas O. Bertini E. Zhang R.Z. Petrini S. Minosse C. Sabatelli P. Giusti B. Chu M.-L. Pepe G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7516-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 6Higuchi I.

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the gene mutations. We have shown previously (5Camacho Vanegas O. Bertini E. Zhang R.Z. Petrini S. Minosse C. Sabatelli P. Giusti B. Chu M.-L. Pepe G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7516-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) that the COL6A2mRNA is almost absent in one of the patients. Given that haploinsufficiency in the COL6A1 gene causes Bethlem myopathy, it is unclear why the parents of the UCMD patients, who carry heterozygous mutations, are unaffected. In this study, we have performed molecular, biochemical, and ultrastructural analyses of collagen VI mRNA and protein with fibroblasts from the patients and their parents in the two Italian families that we reported previously (5Camacho Vanegas O. Bertini E. Zhang R.Z. Petrini S. Minosse C. Sabatelli P. Giusti B. Chu M.-L. Pepe G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7516-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The patient in family A has a homozygous mutation in the proximal part of the triple-helical domain, whereas the patient in family B has compound heterozygous mutations in the distal part. A complete absence of COL6A2 mRNA and protein is observed in patient A, whereas very low levels of mutant COL6A2mRNA and protein remain in patient B. The resultant mutant α2(VI) collagen chains, which lack the normal C-terminal globular domain, can form triple-helical monomers and assemble into abnormal microfibrils, albeit inefficiently. Fibroblasts from all of the parents contain reduced amounts of the COL6A2 mRNA. However, the amounts of collagen VI protein deposited by the long term fibroblast cultures from the parents are not apparently reduced compared with the normal control. The clinical data of the patients and their parents in family A and B have been described previously (5Camacho Vanegas O. Bertini E. Zhang R.Z. Petrini S. Minosse C. Sabatelli P. Giusti B. Chu M.-L. Pepe G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7516-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Skin biopsies were collected from the patients and their parents after obtaining appropriate informed consent. Primary fibroblasts were established from the biopsies as described (11Pepe G. Bertini E. Giusti B. Brunelli T. Comeglio P. Saitta B. Merlini L. Chu M.-L. Federici G. Abbate R. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1999; 9: 264-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Dermal fibroblasts from normal adult individuals and two patients with Bethlem myopathy were used in this study. One of the Bethlem myopathy patients carries a heterozygous in-frame deletion in theCOL6A1 mRNA (12Camacho Vanegas O. Zhang R.Z. Sabatelli P. Lattanzi G. Bencivenga P. Giusti B. Columbaro M. Chu M.-L. Merlini L. Pepe G. Muscle & Nerve. 2002; 25: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The molecular defect of the other Bethlem myopathy patient has not been defined. Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For protein analysis, confluent cells were incubated overnight in the same medium with 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid phosphate (Wako, Richmond, VA). Northern blot analysis of collagen VI mRNA has been described previously (5Camacho Vanegas O. Bertini E. Zhang R.Z. Petrini S. Minosse C. Sabatelli P. Giusti B. Chu M.-L. Pepe G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7516-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from confluent fibroblasts with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The probes for Northern blots were a mixture of [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA clones (F157, F225, and FO19) encoding the three collagen VI chains (19Chu M.-L. Pan T.-C. Conway D. Kuo H.J. Glanville R.W.

Deutzmann R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were detected with a PhosphorImager and quantified with the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II and oligo(dT) primer at 42 °C for 1 h (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of the cDNA samples were PCR-amplified with AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using primers flanking the deletion in allele 2 of patient B (forward primer, 5′-AGAAAGGAGAGCCTGCGGAT; reverse primer, 5′-CGCCCGCAAGTTGAGGTCAT). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min and 20 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence of fibroblasts with collagen VI antibodies have been described previously (5Camacho Vanegas O. Bertini E. Zhang R.Z. Petrini S. Minosse C. Sabatelli P. Giusti B. Chu M.-L. Pepe G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7516-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of cells was performed with [35S]cysteine (ICN) in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbate phosphate. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 1014 polyclonal antibody specific for the α3(VI) collagen chain (21Specks U. Mayer U. Nischt R. Spissinger T. Mann K. Timpl R. Engel J. Chu M.-L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reduced conditions (25 mm DTT) or on composite 0.5% agarose, 2.4% polyacrylamide gels without reduction. Reduced (230 and 400 kDa) and unreduced (900 kDa) forms of laminin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) served as the molecular weight standard on the composite gel (13Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Hutchison W. McKinlay G.R. Bower S.P. Byrne E. Dahl H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence analysis, fibroblasts were grown to confluence on coverslips, treated with 0.25 mm ascorbic acid for 5 and 15 days, and then incubated with 3C4 anti-collagen VI monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, monoclonal antibody 1944). Fibroblast cultures were incubated with the 3C4 monoclonal antibody (22Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) diluted 1:50 in culture medium at 37 °C overnight. After several washes with culture medium, slides were incubated with an anti-mouse IgG 10-nm gold-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:50 in the culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Negative controls were performed in the absence of primary antibody. The samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and with 1% OsO4 in veronal buffer, and then they were dehydrated in ethanol and critical point dried. Thereafter, the slides were rotary-shadowed with platinum at 45° and coated with carbon at 90° in a Balzers BAF 400D Freeze Fracture apparatus, and finally floated on 10% hydrofluoric acid to detach the replicas. After digestion with commercial bleach, the replicas were washed with distilled water, collected on copper grids, and examined in a Philips EM 400 electron microscope at 100 kV. As reported previously (5Camacho Vanegas O. Bertini E. Zhang R.Z. Petrini S. Minosse C. Sabatelli P. Giusti B. Chu M.-L. Pepe G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7516-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the affected son in family A has a homozygous C insertion in exon 13, causing a frameshift at codon 386 (130 amino acids from the beginning of the triple-helical domain) and a subsequent PTC 64 amino acids downstream (Fig. 1). Both parents are heterozygous for this mutation. In family B, two affected sons have compound heterozygous mutations. The first is a point mutation at the splice acceptor site in intron 17, leading to the activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 18 and a resultant 28-bp deletion (allele 1). The mutation causes a frameshift at codon 487 (231 amino acids from the beginning of the triple-helical domain) and a subsequent PTC at 48 amino acids downstream. This mutation is inherited from their mother. The second mutation (allele 2), also present in their father, leads to skipping of the entire 46-bp exon 24, which encodes a short, cysteine-rich region connecting the triple-helical domain and the C-terminal globular domain. The predicted mutant protein contains a complete triple-helical domain of 335 amino acids, but a translational frameshift occurs immediately thereafter, resulting in a PTC 148 amino acids downstream (Fig. 2). Because the mutant protein from allele 2 has a complete triple-helical domain, it can theoretically form a triple helix with the other two chains, but the mutant C-terminal globular domain is much shorter than its normal counterpart of 449 amino acids, which comprises two vWF-A motifs, C1 and C2 (Figs. 1 and 2). The mutant C terminal globular domain is highly basic (pI = 12.4) compared with the normal counterpart (pI = 5.03) and shares no homology with other known protein motifs in the data base.Figure 2Amino acid sequences of the C-terminal globular domains from the normal (upper lines) and mutant (lower lines, allele 2 of family B) α2(VI) collagen chains. Sequence alignment begins at the last 10 amino acids in the triple-helical domain. Note that the mutant C-globular domain (148 amino acids) lacks the cysteine-rich connecting peptide immediately after the triple-helical domain, and the sequence shares no homology with the normal C-globular domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of these three COL6A2 gene mutations on the steady state mRNA levels were examined by Northern blot analysis of fibroblasts from the patients and their parents. A representative Northern blot hybridization is shown in Fig.3 A. Fibroblasts from the patients in both families expressed little COL6A2 mRNA, whereas the levels of the COL6A1 mRNA were similar to those of the normal control (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 5). The hybridization signals for the COL6A3 mRNA were rather low in all samples, because the COL6A3 mRNA is large (9–10 kb) and thus was not efficiently transferred to the nylon membrane. Also, there were some differences in the relative abundance of the alternative spliced COL6A3 transcripts among samples. This is probably not related to the COL6A2 mutations, as we have shown previously (23Stokes D.G. Saitta B. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8626-8633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the alternative splicing pattern of theCOL6A3 gene varies in tissues and cells. TheCOL6A2 gene also transcribes an alternative 6.0-kb mRNA, which retains an intron between two alternatively spliced exons at the 3′-end of the gene (24Saitta B. Stokes B.G. Vissing H. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6473-6480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Northern results showed that fibroblasts from both patients contained little 6.0-kb alternativeCOL6A2 mRNA, consistent with the absence of theCOL6A2 mRNA. After a prolonged exposure with the PhosphorImager, a low level of the COL6A2 mRNA could be detected in patient B but not in patient A. Collectively, the data suggested that all three mutations caused nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and the mutation in patient A resulted in almost complete degradation of the mRNA. The parents of both families who carried a mutant allele also expressed reduced amounts of the COL6A2 mRNA, as indicated by quantification of the ratios of the COL6A2 andCOL6A1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B). For each fibroblast strains, at least two Northern blots were performed and quantified. When the COL6A2/COL6A1 mRNA ratio of fibroblasts from the normal individual was normalized to 1.0, theCOL6A2/COL6A1 mRNA ratios for the father and mother of family A and the father and mother of family B were 0.62, 0.73, 0.65, and 0.57, respectively. The analyses also showed that theCOL6A2/COL6A1 mRNA ratios of fibroblasts from two Bethlem myopathy patients (0.97 and 1.07) were similar to the control. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to examine the levels of two different mutant COL6A2 mRNAs in family B. With PCR primers flanking the distal mRNA deletion in allele 2, a 581-bp product would be amplified from the normal allele and the mutant allele 1, whereas a shorter 535-bp product would be amplified from the mutant allele 2. The experiment showed that the amount of mutant mRNA from allele 2 was less than that from allele 1 in patient B and that a very small amount of mutant mRNA from allele 2 compared with the normal mRNA was present in the father (Fig. 3 C). In addition, the results agreed with the Northern analysis in that the amounts of normal COL6A2 mRNA in both parents were less than that in the normal individual. Similarly, primers flanking the deletion of allele 1 detected a minute amount of mutant transcript in the mother in addition to the normal COL6A2 mRNA (data not shown). The synthesis and secretion of collagen VI protein in fibroblasts of the patients were examined by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling. The antibody used was specific for the N-terminal globular domain of the α3(VI) collagen chain and therefore would immunoprecipitate α3(VI) chains and also co-immunoprecipitate α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains (migrating at the same position), which are presumably all folded together as triple-helical monomers. A complete absence of α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains was found in the culture medium from fibroblasts of patient A, whereas very low levels of α1(VI) + α2(VI) chains were observed in the medium of fibroblasts from patient B, suggesting that patient B secreted a small amount of mutant collagen VI protein (Fig.4 A). There were some α3(VI) chains in the media of both patients, indicating that free α3(VI) chains not associated with α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains could be secreted. Immunoprecipitation was also performed using media of fibroblasts from the parents (Fig. 4 B). The amounts of α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains in the media of all parents appeared to be reduced compared with the control (ranging from 58 to 70% of the control by quantification of two separate experiments). The amounts of collagen VI protein present within the cells of patients A and B were not drastically reduced compared with their fathers and the normal control (Fig. 5 A), unlike the results of collagen VI protein secreted into the medium (Fig. 4 A). However, a doublet was seen at the position of the α1(VI)/α2(VI) chains in the control and the fathers of both patients, whereas only the lower band of the doublet was observed in both patients. The upper band of the doublet most likely was the α2(VI) chain as both patients had littleCOL6A2 mRNA. Because the immunoprecipitations were performed with the antibody against the α3(VI) chain, the results suggested that the α1(VI) chain was able to associate with the α3(VI) chain even in the absence the α2(VI) chain. However, the associated α1(VI) and α3(VI) chains were not secreted as evident from the lack of extracellular α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains in patient A (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). It is known that secretion of collagen VI occurs after intracellular assembly of the constituent chains into triple-helical monomers, dimers, and tetramers (18Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar). As some α1(VI)/α2(VI) collagen chains were found in the medium of patient B but not of patient A (Fig.4 A), the truncated α2(VI) chains of patient B most likely could fold with the other two chains into triple-helical monomers and then assemble into oligomers. This was indeed the case when the intracellular assembly of collagen VI oligomers in patient B was examined by analyzing immunoprecipitated collagen VI within cells under non-reduced conditions on a composite agarose-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.5 B). Most of the collagen VI chains in patient B were accumulated as triple-helical monomers, but only low levels of dimers and tetramers were observed. In contrast, almost all of the collagen VI chains were assembled into dimers and tetramers in the normal control. The results suggested that the mutant α2(VI) chains in patient B were capable of forming monomers; however, further assembly into dimers and tetramers was severely impaired. Deposition of collagen VI microfibrils in the extracellular matrix was examined by immunofluorescence labeling of fibroblasts with anti-collagen VI antibody. When cultured for 5 days, fibroblasts from the parents of both families revealed a reduction in the amount of microfibrils compared with normal fibroblasts (data not shown), consistent with the biosynthetic results (Fig. 5). However, at day 15 of culture the labeling pattern of the fibroblasts from the parents acquired a normal appearance compared with the control fibroblasts (Fig.6). Fibroblasts from patient A showed only intracellular staining with a total absence of assembled collagen VI microfibrils in the extracellular matrix, whereas fibroblast cultures from patient B showed some fluorescent spots extracellularly, but there was no extensive microfibrillar network. The nature of collagen VI deposited in the extracellular matrix was examined by immunoelectron microscopy. Analysis of cultured fibroblasts from the parents of both families (rotary-shadowed replicas) at day 15 revealed that the architecture of the collagen VI filaments appeared unaltered (Fig.7), in accordance with the immunofluorescence data. In addition, the formation of fibrils and webs appeared normal. Analysis of cultured fibroblasts from patient B revealed altered, coarser microfilaments, with an irregular presence of gold labelings, which correspond to the globular domains (Fig. 7). The microfilaments showed a tendency to form circular arrays, perhaps corresponding to the fluorescent spots seen by fluorescence microscopy, whereas parallel-running fibrils, often present in normal cultures, were absent in the patient. Cultured fibroblasts from patient A showed complete absence of collagen VI assemblies in the extracellular matrix (data not shown). In this study, we have delineated the consequences of three different COL6A2 mutations that we have previously identified in two Italian UCMD families in molecular, biochemical, and ultrastructural detail. Our studies show that all threeCOL6A2 mutations lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, an RNA surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades mRNAs with PTCs, which encode nonfunctional or deleterious proteins (25Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 307-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 26Frischmeyer P.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 27Mendell J.T. Dietz H.C. Cell. 2001; 107: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The PTC in family A is located 5′ of the two PTCs in family B in theCOL6A2 transcript. It is known that nonsense codons located early in the transcript exert a greater effect on mRNA decay (28Cheng J. Fogel-Petrovic M. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5215-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,29Peltz S.W. Brown A.H. Jacobson A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1737-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our Northern blot results are consistent with this contention and show almost complete absence of the COL6A2 mRNA in patient A, in contrast to a low level of the COL6A2 mRNA in patient B (Fig. 3). However, this is not the case for the two different COL6A2 mutations in patient B, as semi-quantitative PCR analysis of the COL6A2 mRNA from the two mutant alleles suggests that there is more COL6A2mRNA from allele 1 than allele 2, even though the PTC in allele 1 is located more 5′ than it is in allele 2 (Fig. 3 C). Transcripts from the mutant alleles in the parents are also subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay as all four parents have lowerCOL6A2/COL6A1 mRNA ratios compared with the normal control and patients with Bethlem myopathy (Fig. 3 B). This conclusion is also supported by PCR analysis of the parents in family B, showing a very low level of the mutant mRNA compared with transcripts from the normal allele (Fig. 3 C). The finding that the COL6A2/COL6A1 mRNA ratios in the parents of both families are greater than 50% suggests that transcription from the normal COL6A2 allele may be up-regulated. Approximately 50% reduction in the COL6A1mRNA was reported for the Bethlem myopathy patient, who carries a frameshift mutation in the COL6A1 gene resulting in haploinsufficiency (13Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Hutchison W. McKinlay G.R. Bower S.P. Byrne E. Dahl H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The COL6A2 gene contains two promoters, whereas only one promoter has been found in theCOL6A1 and COL6A3 genes (30Saitta B. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6188-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Saitta B. Chu M.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Whether the alternative COL6A2 promoter plays a role in up-regulating transcription from the normal allele remains to be determined. An increase in mRNA stability is another possibility. It should be noted that the parents of UCMD patients with a homozygous nonsense mutation in the triple-helical domain of the COL6A3 gene also do not exhibit clinical symptoms. The COL6A3 mRNA levels in this family have not been reported (7Demir E. Sabatelli P. Allamand V. Ferreiro A. Moghadaszadeh B. Makrelouf M. Topaloglu H. Echenne B. Merlini L. Guicheney P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 1446-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The reduction of the COL6A2 mRNA in the parents is reflected at the protein level, because the amounts of extracellular α1(VI)/α2(VI) collagen chains in the parents appear somewhat reduced (Fig. 4 B), as is the case for the short term matrix deposition observed by indirect immunofluorescence of 5-day fibroblast cultures (data not shown). However, the long term accumulation of collagen VI microfibrils in 15-day cultures does not seem significantly different between fibroblasts from the parents and the control (Fig.6). Although the data from in vitro cell culture studies may not necessarily reflect the in vivo situation, it is possible that amounts of collagen VI microfibrils accumulated in tissue over time may reach a level similar to normal individuals. Moreover, our results indicated that the mutant transcripts in the parents are mostly degraded. Thus even if a minute amount of truncated protein was produced, it would not be sufficient to exert a dominant negative effect. That collagen VI microfibrils deposited by the parents are structurally normal is also supported by immunoelectron microscopic examination (Fig. 7). We suggest that the apparently normal matrix deposition together with the lack of a significant amount of the mutant protein may explain the absence of clinical symptoms in the parents. It is of interest that a similar heterozygous mutation in theCOL6A1 gene, leading to nonsense-mediated COL6A1mRNA decay, causes Bethlem myopathy (13Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Hutchison W. McKinlay G.R. Bower S.P. Byrne E. Dahl H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this case, reduced deposition of collagen VI microfibrils was observed in fibroblasts from the patient (13Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Hutchison W. McKinlay G.R. Bower S.P. Byrne E. Dahl H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whether the presence or absence of the clinical symptoms correlates with possible differences in transcriptional or translational regulation of the COL6A1 and COL6A2genes remains to be determined. On the other hand, the phenotypic variation of similar mutations may also arise from modifying genes yet to be identified. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies indicate that fibroblasts from patient B synthesize, secrete, and deposit a minute amount of abnormal collagen VI. The mutant protein sheds new light on the biosynthesis and assembly of collagen VI microfibrils. The abnormal collagen VI deposited extracellularly most likely is the product of allele 2, as the predicted protein product of allele 1 is truncated, containing only two-thirds of the triple-helical domain, and therefore unlikely to form a full-length triple-helix with the normal α1(VI) and α3(VI) chains. The predicted product of allele 2 contains the complete triple-helical domain but an entirely different and shorter C-terminal globular domain than the normal counterpart (Fig. 1). It is known that formation of a collagen triple-helix requires proper chain association/selection, followed by triple-helix nucleation, registration, and propagation (32Bachinger H.P. Fessler L.I. Timpl R. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13193-13199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Doege K.J. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8924-8935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal globular domains of the fibrillar collagens are important for the chain selection and association, as is the case for the C-terminal NC1 domains of collagens VIII and X (34Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Marks D.S. Gregory C.A. Wallis G.A. Brass A. Kadler K.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22091-22095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The protein domain important for chain selection and association in collagen VI is not known. Studies to date indicate that assembly of the collagen VI microfibrillar network requires the presence of all three chains (18Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar). A recent study employing an in vitro transcription/translation assay supplemented with semi-permeabilized cells suggests that truncated α2(VI) chains with only the C1 domain can associate into monomers made up of three identical chains; however, the C2 domain is required for further assembly into dimers and tetramers (37Ball S.G. Baldock C. Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7422-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our finding that the mutant α2(VI) chain without the normal C-globular domain can form triple-helical monomers suggests that the C1 and C2 subdomains of the α2(VI) chain are not essential for the chain selection and association. This implies that chain selection and association of collagen VI may begin in the triple-helical domain or the N-globular domain, although it is possible that in the absence of the normal C-terminal globular domain, an alternative recognition site elsewhere is utilized. Also, the possibility that the mutant C-terminal globular domain may contain recognition sequences for chain association cannot be excluded. In this regard, it should be noted that although the C-propeptide of the fibrillar collagen is necessary and sufficient for chain association, it can be replaced with a very short transmembrane domain without affecting triple-helix folding (34Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our results show that triple-helical monomers containing the mutant C-terminal globular domain can assemble into dimers and tetramers, although with very low efficiency (Fig. 5 B). In addition, the mutant tetramers are capable of forming larger assemblies, albeit abnormal (Fig. 7). The data are consistent with a previously proposed structural model for collagen VI assembly, which predicts that dimers are formed by interaction of the C-terminal globular domain and the triple-helical domain of two antiparallel monomers and that the association of dimers is stabilized by disulfide bridges (38Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Fig.8). It is conceivable that the mutant monomers in patient B, which lack the C-terminal globular domain of the α2(VI) chain and particularly the short cysteine-rich connecting peptide, would not be able to form dimers efficiently. The model also predicts that end-to-end association of tetramers into microfibrils is primarily mediated through the N-terminal globular domain. In this regard, the mutant tetramers, having normal N-terminal globular domains, would be expected to be able to associate end-to-end into larger assemblies. Our finding by immunoelectron microscopy that these assemblies do not have the expected double-beaded appearance and cannot form extensive networks (Fig. 7) indicates that the C-terminal globular domain is critical for the proper alignment of tetramers and for heterotypic interactions with other matrix molecules. Although the precise protein interactions important for the assembly of collagen VI microfibrils are not known, our results suggest that the C1 and C2 domains of the α2(VI) chain contribute to such interactions. It is noteworthy that similar vWF-A motifs in matrilin have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions involved in the assembly of oligomers and microfilaments (39Chen Q. Zhang Y. Johnson D.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2149-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of cell layers from the patients indicate that association of the α1(VI) and α3(VI) chains can occur without the α2(VI) chains (Fig. 5 A). It is not clear whether these two chains are merely associated together through disulfide bridges or whether the two chains can form a triple-helical monomer of a different chain composition. Secretion of these abnormally associated chains outside cells is apparently prevented, likely by some quality control mechanism. In conclusion, our studies show that the severe deficiency of collagen VI protein in the two UCMD patients is primarily caused by the near total absence of COL6A2 mRNA due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The parents of the UCMD patients have reduced amounts of the COL6A2 mRNA due to degradation of mRNA derived from the mutant allele, but the long term deposition of collagen VI microfibrils is comparable with the normal control. The absence of dominant negative effect from the mutant protein together with the near normal deposition of collagen VI microfibrils may explain the lack of clinical symptoms in the parents. The minute amount of abnormal collagen VI deposited in the extracellular matrix suggests that the C-terminal globular domain is not essential for triple-helix formation but is important for further assembly into higher ordered structures. We thank members of families A and B for participation in this study and Dr. Rupert Timpl for providing polyclonal antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2012442799,"Studies of GTPase function often employ expression of dominant negative or constitutively active mutants. Dominant negative mutants cannot bind GTP and thus cannot be activated. Constitutively active mutants cannot hydrolyze GTP and therefore accumulate a large pool of GTP-bound GTPase. These mutations block the normal cycle of GTP binding, hydrolysis, and release. Therefore, although the GTPase-deficient mutants are in the active conformation, they do not fully imitate all the actions of the GTPase. This is particularly true for the ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), GTPases that regulate vesicular trafficking events. In Ras and Rho GTPases replacement of phenylalanine 28 with a leucine residue produces a “fast cycling” mutant that can undergo spontaneous GTP-GDP exchange and retains the ability to hydrolyze GTP. Unfortunately this phenylalanine residue is not conserved in the ARF family of GTPases. Here we report the design and characterization of a novel activated mutant of ARF6, ARF6 T157A. In vitro studies show that ARF6 T157A can spontaneously bind and release GTP more quickly than the wild-type protein suggesting that it is a fast cycling mutant.

Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases function as switches to regulate a wide variety of processes within cells. When bound to GTP these proteins bind to and activate a variety of downstream effector proteins. Hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP returns the GTPase to an inactive state. The interconversion of these two states depends upon the action of several accessory proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ARNO, ARF nucleotide-binding site opener. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ARNO, ARF nucleotide-binding site opener. catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, thereby activating the G-protein, whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate the hydrolysis of the bound GTP.The ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), a family of small GTPases, have been well characterized as regulators of vesicular trafficking. This family consists of six isoforms that can be divided into three classes. Class 1 ARFs (ARFs 1–3) regulate trafficking in the secretory pathway and in endosomes, whereas little is known about the functions of the class II ARFs (ARFs 4 and 5). ARF6, the sole class III ARF, is located at the plasma membrane and regulates some aspects of the endosomal and recycling pathways (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Google Scholar). Additionally, the ARFs, particularly ARF6, have been shown to modulate cortical actin assembly (2D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Google Scholar, 3Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Google Scholar, 4Radhakrishna H., Al- Awar O. Khachikian Z.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3685-3694Google Scholar).GTPase functions are most often studied using expression of dominant negative or constitutively active mutants. Dominant negative mutants cannot bind GTP and therefore cannot be activated. Constitutively active mutants, on the other hand, cannot hydrolyze the bound GTP leading the cell to accumulate a large pool of activated GTPase. Both of these mutations block the normal cycle of GTP binding followed by hydrolysis. Therefore, constitutively active mutants cannot necessarily recapitulate all of the actions of the normal GTPase.This is particularly true of ARF-regulated trafficking events, such as budding of COPI-coated vesicles from the Golgi. Assembly of the COPI coat and vesicle budding requires activation of ARF1 (7Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Google Scholar, 8Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Google Scholar), whereas uncoating requires GTP hydrolysis (9Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of constitutively active ARF1 Q71L induces the accumulation of COPI-coated vesicles that cannot fuse with target membranes (10Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Google Scholar, 11Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Google Scholar). Similarly, ARF6 Q67L induces the accumulation of endosomally derived vacuolar clusters and blocks the endocytosis and recycling of certain proteins (12D'Souza-Schorey C., Li, G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Google Scholar, 13Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 14Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Google Scholar). Additionally, ARF6 Q67L alters cell morphology and has toxic effects with extended expression (13Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 15D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Google Scholar).For the Rho family of GTPase these types of problems can be avoided with the use of fast cycling mutants (17Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Google Scholar, 18Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Google Scholar). These mutants have reduced affinity for nucleotides and spontaneously release GDP and bind GTP, thereby increasing levels of active GTPase within the cell (17Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Google Scholar,19Schlichting I. John J. Frech M. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Zimmermann H. Rosch P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 504-511Google Scholar). Importantly this pool of active GTPase can still hydrolyze GTP and go through the entire normal GTPase cycle (17Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Google Scholar, 20Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Google Scholar).Although most members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases share a similar structure and nucleotide-binding pocket, ARFs have some divergent characteristics. For example, most Ras family members are C-terminally lipid-modified, whereas the ARFs are myristoylated at their N terminus. ARFs also contain alterations in the nucleotide-binding pocket with respect to other Ras family proteins (21Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D.

For example, the canonical activating mutation in Ras is an alteration of glycine 12 to valine; however, this glycine residue is not conserved in the ARFs. Mutation of the ARF residue located in the equivalent position (Asp-28) produces an inactive protein rather than an activated mutant (23Kahn R.A. Clark J. Rulka C. Stearns T. Zhang C.J. Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Cavenagh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Google Scholar).The known Ras and Rho fast cycling mutants are mutations of a phenylalanine in the nucleotide-binding site to leucine (Phe-28 in Ras, Rac1, Cdc42 and Phe-30 in RhoA) (18Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Google Scholar, 20Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Google Scholar). Although phenylalanine 28 is widely conserved among members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, it is not conserved in the ARF family. X-ray crystal structure analysis of Ras determined that phenylalanine 28 sits at the base of the nucleotide-binding pocket, forming van der Waals contacts with the surface of the guanine ring (24Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ARF1 demonstrated that this portion of the ARF nucleotide-binding pocket was not formed by a phenylalanine near the N terminus of the protein but rather consisted of a threonine residue located at the ARF C terminus (21Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Google Scholar, 22Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M. Cockcroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Google Scholar). This threonine (Thr-161 in ARF1, Thr-157 in ARF6) sits in a position analogous to Ras Phe-28 (21Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Google Scholar, 22Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M. Cockcroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Google Scholar). Therefore ARF6 with a threonine 157 to alanine substitution was investigated as a possible fast cycling mutant.The experiments presented here demonstrate that ARF6 T157A does indeed have the properties of a fast cycling GTPase. It is more active than the wild-type protein in vivo while still able to undergo normal GAP-mediated hydrolysis and has an enhanced rate of GTP binding and release. Expression of this mutant induces phenotypes that have previously been attributed to ARF6 activation without the toxic effects of the constitutively active Q67L mutant. Therefore, we conclude that ARF6 T157A is a fast cycling mutant and should prove useful in future studies to elucidate specific ARF6 function.RESULTSThe fast cycling Ras mutation, F28L, reduces the size of the side chain at this position, which removes contacts between this residue and the guanine ring and weakens the affinity of the protein for guanine nucleotides (19Schlichting I. John J. Frech M. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Zimmermann H. Rosch P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 504-511Google Scholar). This reduced affinity allows the GTPase to spontaneously release GDP and bind GTP, even in the absence of a GEF. The functionally equivalent residue in ARF6 is Thr-157. In an attempt to generate a fast cycling ARF6 mutant, Thr-157 was mutated to alanine, which should eliminate the van der Waals interactions between this side chain and the guanine ring.If ARF6 T157A truly is a fast cycling mutant, it should have enhanced rates of GTP binding and release when compared with the wild-type protein. The loading of ARF6 T157A with GTP was investigated in vitro to determine whether this mutation enhances the spontaneous rate of GTP binding. Recombinant, myristoylated wild type and T157A ARF6 were purified from E. coli as previously described (27Santy L.C. Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1173-1176Google Scholar). These proteins were incubated with [35S]GTPγS, and at various times after the initiation of this loading reaction, samples were removed, and the protein was isolated on nitrocellulose filters. The bound nucleotide was then quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. As is shown in Fig.1 A, ARF6 T157A binds GTPγS at a significantly enhanced rate compared with wild-type ARF6 (2.4–6.9-fold, n = 3 experiments). The release of nucleotide by these proteins was assayed by continuing this loading reaction for an extended period and then diluting the loaded GTPase into a solution containing an excess of unlabeled GTP. After various times of incubation samples were removed, and the amount of [35S]GTPγS remaining bound to the protein was determined as described above. The ARF6 T157A mutant also increased the rate of GTP release compared with the wild-type protein (Fig.1 B) (rate increase, 1.9–3.0-fold; n = 4 experiments). These results suggest that ARF6 T157A could act as a fast cycling mutant.To determine whether ARF6 T167A acts as a fast cycling mutant in vivo the activation state of this mutant was compared with that of the wild-type ARF6, dominant negative ARF6 T27N, and constitutively active ARF6 Q67L using a previously described ARF pulldown assay (26Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Google Scholar). GTP-bound ARF was isolated by specific binding to the ARF effector GGA3. Fig. 2 A shows that ARF6 T157A is significantly more active than WT ARF6 (1.6–18-fold more active, n = 8, p < 0.05 (pairedt test)). As is expected for a fast cycling mutant ARF6 T157A is less active than ARF6 Q67L, which cannot hydrolyze GTP. Moreover, this assay demonstrates that ARF6 T157A retains the capacity to bind a known ARF effector, suggesting that the overall structure of this protein is not grossly altered by this mutation.Figure 2ARF6 T157A is more active than wild-type ARF6 and is still subject to normal regulation. A, MDCK cells were infected with adenovirus encoding HA-tagged WT, dominant negative (T27N), constitutively active (Q67L), or T157A ARF6 for 4 h. Cells were lysed and GTP-ARF6 isolated by incubation with glutathione S-transferase-GGA3 as previously described (26Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Google Scholar). ARF6 levels were quantitated by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-HA antibody. B, MDCK cells were transfected with plasmids encoding ARF6 T157A either alone or in combination with the GEF ARNO or the GAP ACAP1. ARF6-GTP was isolated and quantitated as described above. Gels are representative of at least 4 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A true fast cycling mutant remains subject to the normal mechanisms of regulation; therefore, it can be activated by GEFs and inactivated by GAPs. The ARF6 T157A mutant was co-expressed either with the ARF GEF ARNO (29Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Google Scholar) or the ARF GAP ACAP1 (30Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z. Miura K. Foroni L. Sun J. Hsu V.W. Donaldson J.G. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 627-638Google Scholar), and the ARF pulldown assay was then used to measure GTP-ARF6 T157A levels. Fig. 2 Bshows that co-expression with ARNO leads to enhanced activation of ARF6 T157A (2.1–6.0-fold increase, n = 6, p< 0.05 (paired t test)), whereas co-expression with ACAP1 reduces levels of GTP-bound ARF6 T157A (1.8–4.9-fold decrease,n = 4, p < 0.01 (paired ttest)). Importantly this experiment demonstrates that ARF6 T157A can still interact with both GAPs and GEFs and clearly cycles. These properties are characteristic of a fast cycling mutant.A fast cycling GTPase mutant should reproduce the phenotype of activating the wild-type protein. In HeLa cells activation of ARF6 either by expression of a GEF or by the addition of aluminum fluoride induces the formation of actin-rich surface protrusions or ruffles (3Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Google Scholar,31Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Google Scholar, 32Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing either wild-type ARF6, ARF6 T157A, or ARF6 Q67L were stained for the exogenous ARF6 protein and for polymerized actin (Fig. 3). Cells expressing wild-type ARF6 have smooth edges and few surface ruffles. In contrast cells expressing ARF6 T157A exhibit numerous actin-rich ruffles, suggesting that this protein is indeed behaving similarly to activation of the wild-type protein. Cells expressing the constitutively active ARF6 Q67L, on the other hand, are largely rounded up. At later times these cells actually detach from the substrate. This phenotype, which is commonly seen in cells expressing ARF6 Q67L, does not resemble that produced by activation of the wild-type protein. Therefore, the full GTPase cycle including both GTP loading and hydrolysis is necessary to reproduce the functions of ARF6. Furthermore this rounded phenotype demonstrates one of the persistent problems of using this constitutively active mutant to study ARF6 function; it often has toxic effects when expressed for extended periods of time. The inability of this protein to hydrolyze GTP likely prevents the completion of the membrane trafficking and down-regulation of signal transduction pathways that are regulated by ARF6. For this reason ARF6 T157A should prove to be a more accurate and useful tool in the study of ARF6 functions.Figure 3HeLa cells expressing ARF6 T157A display actin-rich ruffles and protrusions. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmid encoding wild-type (A,B), T157A (C, D), or Q67L (E, F) ARF6 for 18 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (A, C, E) and phalloidin to mark F-actin (B, D, F).

Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Google Scholar). Expression of ARF6 T157A also increases the migration of MDCK cells by ∼3-fold in a transwell migration assay, whereas expression of wild-type ARF6 does not alter cell motility (Fig. 4). Expression of ARF6 Q67L similarly increases the percentage of cells migrating through the filter in the transwell assay; however, the number of cells surviving to the end of the experiment is substantially reduced by expression of this mutant (data not shown).Figure 4Expression of ARF6 T157A enhances MDCK cell migration. MDCK cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding wild type or T157A ARF6 under the control of the tetracycline-regulated transactivator for 6 h. Control cells were infected with wild-type ARF6 virus in the presence of doxycycline to prevent transgene expression. Cells were then replated on transwell filters coated on the underside with fibronectin and incubated for 18 h. Cells migrating through the filter were quantitated by crystal violet staining. Data shown are mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate samples and are representative of 5 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe experiments presented here demonstrate that ARF6 T157A is a fast cycling ARF6 mutant. ARF6 T157A is spontaneously more active than the wild-type protein; it binds and releases GTP more quickly and induces phenotypes characteristic of ARF6 activation. Previously the only known activating ARF6 mutation was the constitutively active Q67L, and T157A offers significant advantages over this mutant for studies of ARF6 function.The constitutively active mutants ARF6 Q67L and ARF1 Q71L both block the vesicular transport processes regulated by these GTPases (10Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Google Scholar, 11Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Google Scholar, 12D'Souza-Schorey C., Li, G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Google Scholar, 13Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 14Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that inactivation of a GTPase, as well as activation, can be a critical part of GTPase function. T157A can undergo the complete cycle of GTP binding, hydrolysis, and release and, therefore, maintains all of the GTPase actions.Interestingly, although Ras and ARF have significant differences in the structure of their nucleotide-binding pockets, the known Ras F28L fast cycling mutant was able to guide the design of a fast cycling ARF6 mutant. Both Ras Phe-28 and ARF6 Thr-157 form the base of the nucleotide-binding pocket and form van der Waals contacts with the face of the guanine ring. A mutation reducing the side chain size of either of these residues results in a fast cycling mutant by weakening the binding of nucleotide by the protein.ARF6 T157A seems to more faithfully recapitulate the effects of ARF6 activation than does ARF6 Q67L. These observations and the frequent toxicity of Q67L suggest that GTP hydrolysis is an important component of ARF function. However, this may not be the case for all GTPases. The Ras constitutively active mutations were first isolated as oncogenes and have been successfully used to study Ras function and to reproduce Ras-mediated phenotypes (33Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Google Scholar). Therefore, hydrolysis may not be a necessary component of any known Ras functions. The constitutively active Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42) mutants induce the formation of characteristic F-actin-rich structures and have been successfully used to study many Rho family functions. However, many Rho GEFs are proto-oncogenes whereas the constitutively active Rho family mutants are only weakly transforming and can be toxic in certain circumstances (18Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Google Scholar). Rho family fast cycling mutants, on the other hand, are oncogenic and more similar to GEF overexpression (18Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Google Scholar). These data suggest that cycling is important for at least some of the oncogenic activities of the Rho family proteins.Why is cycling seemingly more important for the ARF and Rho GTPases than for Ras? It is interesting to speculate that the critical difference may be that Ras primarily regulates signal transduction cascades, whereas in addition to signaling cascades the ARF and Rho proteins regulate the assembly of large structural protein complexes, namely vesicle coats and F-actin networks. For ARF1 it has been shown that GTP hydrolysis is necessary for the disassembly of the induced protein coat. Continuous assembly without simultaneous disassembly of previously formed complexes may deplete the cells of the protein components that compose these structures. This depletion could send the cells into a rigor-like state. Therefore, GTP hydrolysis by ARF and Rho proteins may be critically important for maintaining some ARF and Rho functions, whereas Ras-activated signals can be maintained in the absence of GTP hydrolysis.The ARF6 T157A mutant characterized here is an activated mutant that retains the ability to hydrolyze GTP. This will allow future studies of ARF function to avoid the complications arising from interruption of the normal ARF GTPase cycle. This should prove advantageous in elucidating ARF function and the specific roles of the various ARF proteins. Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases function as switches to regulate a wide variety of processes within cells. When bound to GTP these proteins bind to and activate a variety of downstream effector proteins. Hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP returns the GTPase to an inactive state. The interconversion of these two states depends upon the action of several accessory proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ARNO, ARF nucleotide-binding site opener. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; WT, wild type; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ARNO, ARF nucleotide-binding site opener. catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, thereby activating the G-protein, whereas GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate the hydrolysis of the bound GTP. The ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), a family of small GTPases, have been well characterized as regulators of vesicular trafficking. This family consists of six isoforms that can be divided into three classes. Class 1 ARFs (ARFs 1–3) regulate trafficking in the secretory pathway and in endosomes, whereas little is known about the functions of the class II ARFs (ARFs 4 and 5). ARF6, the sole class III ARF, is located at the plasma membrane and regulates some aspects of the endosomal and recycling pathways (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Google Scholar). Additionally, the ARFs, particularly ARF6, have been shown to modulate cortical actin assembly (2D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Google Scholar, 3Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Google Scholar, 4Radhakrishna H., Al- Awar O. Khachikian Z.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3685-3694Google Scholar). GTPase functions are most often studied using expression of dominant negative or constitutively active mutants. Dominant negative mutants cannot bind GTP and therefore cannot be activated. Constitutively active mutants, on the other hand, cannot hydrolyze the bound GTP leading the cell to accumulate a large pool of activated GTPase. Both of these mutations block the normal cycle of GTP binding followed by hydrolysis. Therefore, constitutively active mutants cannot necessarily recapitulate all of the actions of the normal GTPase. This is particularly true of ARF-regulated trafficking events, such as budding of COPI-coated vesicles from the Golgi. Assembly of the COPI coat and vesicle budding requires activation of ARF1 (7Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Google Scholar, 8Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Google Scholar), whereas uncoating requires GTP hydrolysis (9Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of constitutively active ARF1 Q71L induces the accumulation of COPI-coated vesicles that cannot fuse with target membranes (10Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Google Scholar, 11Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Google Scholar). Similarly, ARF6 Q67L induces the accumulation of endosomally derived vacuolar clusters and blocks the endocytosis and recycling of certain proteins (12D'Souza-Schorey C., Li, G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Google Scholar, 13Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 14Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Google Scholar). Additionally, ARF6 Q67L alters cell morphology and has toxic effects with extended expression (13Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 15D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J.

For the Rho family of GTPase these types of problems can be avoided with the use of fast cycling mutants (17Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Google Scholar, 18Lin R.

Sequence analysis reveals six potential N-glycosylation sites, one of which is located in the prodomain and five in the mature (active) molecule. However, no information is available on the structure and function of the glycosylation sites.

Furthermore, high variability exists in the functions of N-glycan chains of proteins, which makes it difficult to predict with any confidence the functions of oligosaccharides on proteins (reviewed by Ref. 25Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5000) Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed FLAG-tagged BMP-1 in two different mammalian systems (HT1080 and 293-EBNA cells) and identified the type of glycosylation on BMP-1. By site-directed mutagenesis, we also established the role of the N-glycosylation in folding, secretion, and C-proteinase activity of BMP-1. PCR products were purified with Qiaquick kits (Qiagen). Plasmids were extracted with Qiaprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Prestained protein molecular weight standards (broad range) were from Bio-Rad. Full-length BMP-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number P13497) was cloned from a human placental cDNA library. The cDNA was inserted at theKpnI/XhoI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), thereby placing it under the transcriptional control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. A FLAG tag amino acid sequence (DYKDDDDK) recognized by a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was introduced into the BMP-1 sequence (BMP-1F) immediately 5′ of the stop codon. The cDNA encoding FLAG-tagged BMP-1 was subcloned into the episomal expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3, for heterologous protein expression studies in cultured cells. Previous studies have shown that the FLAG peptide at the C terminus of BMP-1 does not affect the procollagen C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 (2Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G.

Plasmids coding for the mutant BMP-1 proteins were produced by replacing wild-type fragments with the same fragments containing the desired mutations. These were generated by strand overlap PCR as described (26Horton R.M. White B.A. PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. 15. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar) using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a forward primer upstream and a reverse primer downstream, of unique restriction sites, respectively, and oligonucleotides containing the desired modification in both orientations (in bold, see below). For each mutation, the restriction sites used and their positions on the nucleotide sequence are indicated. Briefly, a DNA fragment was amplified using a forward primer and the antisense mutant primer and an overlapping fragment was amplified using the sense mutant primer and a downstream reverse primer. Both fragments were gel-purified (Qiagen), mixed, and re-amplified with the Pwo enzyme with the forward and reverse primers. The product was digested by the appropriate enzymes, gel-purified, and introduced in place of the corresponding wild-type fragment in BMP-1F. Mutagenic primers (mutation in bold) and restriction sites used to insert the mutant fragment into the wild-type sequence were as follows: N142Q, 5′-CATTGGGGGACAGTTCACTGGTA-3′, XcmI (position 383)/BlpI (position 913); N332Q, 5′-CAGCACAGGCCAGTTCTCCT-3′, BlpI (position 913)/PmlI (position 1416); N363Q, 5′-GATCATCCTGCAATTCACGTCCCT-3′, BlpI (position 913)/PmlI (position 1416); N599Q, 5′-CCTCACCAAGCTCCAAGGCTCCATCA-3′, BamHI (position 1391)/XhoI (multicloning site of pcDNA3). For N91Q (5′-AAAAGCTGCAGTTCCAGGACAGACTTCTAC-3′) and N726Q (5′-CCCCCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTGGGGGGTCCGTTGTCTTTTCTGCACT-3′), the mutagenic primers, which also contained a restriction site (underlined, N91Q), PstI (position 290), N726Q,XhoI (multicloning site of pcDNA3), and the FLAG tag (N726Q, italicized), were used in a single PCR reaction with reverse and forward primers, respectively. The two mutated PCR products were digested by PstI (position 251) and ApaI (position 586) (N91Q) or BamHI (position 1391) andXhoI (N726Q). Pwo DNA polymerase was used to minimize base misincorporation during the polymerase chain reactions. DNA sequencing (ABI) was used to verify the mutations, and to ensure that the cDNA clones were error-free. Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (ATCC CCL-121) and human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells (ECACC 85120602) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) (complete DMEM) and for the 293 cells, with 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The recombinant wild-type and mutant BMP-1F proteins were expressed in stably transfected HT1080 cells. Transfections were made with Lipofectin reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 4 μg of plasmid/T-25 flask. Cells were grown to ∼50% confluency by overnight incubation in complete DMEM. After 2 rinses with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), cells were transfected in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and returned to the incubator. Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium was replaced by DMEM with 10% serum for a further 24 h. The cells were then trypsinized (Invitrogen) and diluted 1:15 for selection in 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). 293-EBNA cells were transfected with the FLAG-tagged BMP-1 cloned into pCEP4 expression plasmid, following the procedure described above. Selection was applied by adding 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Stably transfected HT1080 or 293-EBNA cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and grown to confluency. Cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 (HT1080) or 48 h (293-EBNA cells), unless otherwise stated. The tissue culture media were collected, cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 10 min, and in the case of HT1080-transfected cells, concentrated to 100 μl using Centriprep-30 and Microcon-10 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). The samples were used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Recombinant BMP-1 was assayed for procollagen C-proteinase activity using humanl-U-14C-type I procollagen substrate (0.4 μg). 14C-Labeled type I procollagen was obtained and purified from the medium of human skin fibroblasts (27Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the cleavage products on SDS gels (7% separating, 3.5% stacking) was performed as described (3Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol.

The cleavage products were visualized by exposing dried gels to a phosphorimaging plate (Fuji, type BAS III) for phosphorimaging (Fujix BAS 2000). Bands corresponding to the pro-α1(I) and pN-α2(I) chains of type I procollagen and type I pN-collagen, respectively, were quantified using AIDA 2.0 software. The percentage of cleavage was calculated by multiplying the intensity of the pN-α2(I), corrected for molecular mass, by the initial concentration of procollagen (3Hojima Y. van der Rest M.

Cells were rinsed once with PBS, and incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional shaking with 500 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris pH 7.6) containing 10 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells in RIPA buffer were scraped on ice and sonicated. Lysates were subjected to a 5-min centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were retained and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. The supernatants or cell lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) SDS-Prosieve gel (Biowhittaker Molecular Applications) under reducing conditions and subjected to Western immunoblotting using the mouse monoclonal M2 antibody (Sigma) directed against the FLAG tag. Secondary antibody (anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Sigma)) was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (SuperSignal West Dura extended duration, Pierce). The levels of BMP-1F were quantified by laser densitometry of enhanced chemiluminescence fluorograms exposed to pre-flashed films. Endopeptidase F/N-glycosidase F (endoF/N), endoglycosidase H (endoH), and neuraminidase were from New England Biolabs, and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycosidase) was from Calbiochem. Culture medium (80 μl) (unconcentrated in the case of transfected 293-EBNA cells) from transfected HT1080 were incubated with the different glycosidases, in the buffer, detergents, and conditions recommended by the manufacturers. EndoF/N (500 units), endoH (500 units), neuraminidase (50 units), or O-glycosidase (1 milliunit) were used per reaction, which were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Digestion byO-glycosidase was preceded by digestion with neuraminidase. Stably transfected HT1080 or 293-EBNA cells expressing BMP-1F were grown to confluency on 100-mm dishes. Cells were preincubated in complete DMEM in the presence of 100 μg/ml castanospermine (Calbiochem), or 5 μg/ml swainsonine (Calbiochem) for 18 h. For tunicamycin (Sigma), cells were preincubated in the presence of 2 μg/ml of the inhibitor, for 5 h. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS, and reincubated in the presence of the inhibitors for 24 h in serum-free DMEM, and for only 18 h in the case of tunicamycin. Medium was collected and treated as described above. pcDNA3, BMP-1F, and N4Q-transfected HT1080 were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were preincubated with or without 10 mm lactacystin (Calbiochem) for 1 h. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and further incubated with or without lactacystin at the same concentration in serum-free medium for 4 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol (−20 °C) for 5 min. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with anti-FLAG mouse antibody or with anti-calreticulin rabbit antibody (Stressgen) in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) or with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) and observed with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 laser confocal microscope. We transfected cultured HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and 293-EBNA human embryonic kidney cells with cDNAs encoding C-terminal flagged BMP-1 (BMP-1F). We chose to express BMP-1 in two different cell types to minimize the risk of cell type-specific post-translational modification. BMP-1F was stably expressed in HT1080 and 293-EBNA cells and the secreted protein was incubated with endoF/N, which cleaves all N-linked structures, regardless of their complexity, by hydrolyzing the asparagine-oligosaccharide bond, or endoH, which cleaves specifically high mannose-type structures. The proteins were also digested with neuraminidase, which removes sialic acids, and O-glycosidase, which specifically cleavesO-linked glycans. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Fig.1 shows that BMP-1F is correctly processed and secreted in both HT1080 and 293-EBNA cells (lanes 2 and 9). No immunoreactive bands were found in medium from HT1080 cells transfected with pcDNA3 empty vector (lane 1). Complete deglycosylation of BMP-1F by endoF/N produced a decrease in the molecular mass of the BMP-1F molecule from ∼75 to ∼60 kDa (lane 3), strongly suggesting that most, or all, of the 5 potential N-glycosylation sites present in the active form had been stripped of oligosaccharides. Digestion of BMP-1F with endoH did not produce a shift in mobility, suggesting that BMP-1F secreted by HT1080 cells (and 293-EBNA cells, data not shown) did not contain high mannose-type oligosaccharides (lane 4). Neuraminidase treatment (lanes 6 and 10) decreased the molecular mass of BMP-1F by ∼5 kDa, showing that the BMP-1 contained sialylated sugars. However, further treatment withO-glycosidase had no effect (lane 8), suggesting that the BMP-1 lacked O-linked oligosaccharides. To determine the contribution of the complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides to secretion and enzymic activity of BMP-1F, two inhibitors of glycoprotein processing were used: castanospermine, which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glucosidases I and II, thereby preventing the removal of the glucose residues of the Glc3Man7–9(GlcNac)2-N-linked glycoprotein (29Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and swainsonine, which inhibits Golgi mannosidase II, therefore producing hybrid-type glycosylation (29Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To do these experiments, stably transfected HT1080 cells were incubated in the presence and absence of castanospermine or swainsonine, and the secreted BMP-1F was digested with endoF/N and endoH. The digested proteins were examined by Western blotting, using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2). BMP-1F from cells cultured with castanospermine (lane 5) had the same electrophoretic mobility as BMP-1F from untreated cells (lane 2), whereas BMP-1F secreted in the presence of swainsonine (lane 8) had a faster mobility (∼70 kDa). The levels of secretion of BMP-1F were not affected by the presence of the inhibitors, compared with the control. To characterize the oligosaccharides on BMP-1F secreted in the presence of the inhibitors, the proteins were incubated with endoF/N and endoH enzymes and the products were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Whereas BMP-1F secreted in the absence of inhibitors was resistant to endoH (lane 4), BMP-1F secreted in the presence of either inhibitor was sensitive to this enzyme, indicating that the inhibitors had changed the nature of the oligosaccharides. By comparing the electrophoretic mobility of the bands obtained after endoH and endoF/N digestions, it could be observed that BMP-1F secreted in the presence of castanospermine contained only high-mannose structures, because the two digestion products had the same electrophoretic mobility (lanes 6 and 7). In the case of BMP-1F secreted in the presence of swainsonine, the digestion product by endoH (lane 10) migrated slower than the one obtained with endoF/N (lane 9), denoting the presence of both complex-type and high mannose-type structures. To investigate the effects of high mannose- and hybrid-type oligosaccharides on PCP activity of BMP-1, we assayed the enzymes using type I procollagen as substrate. No significant difference of PCP activity was observed between BMP-1F control, BMP-1F containing high-mannose structures (synthesized in the presence of castanospermine), and BMP-1F with hybrid-type glycosylation (synthesized in the presence of swainsonine). Similar results were obtained with the 293-EBNA cells stably transfected with BMP-1F (data not shown). The results showed that complex-type oligosaccharide chains are not required for secretion and PCP activity of BMP-1. To determine the role of N-linked sugars on folding and secretion of BMP-1, stably transfected 293-EBNA cells were incubated in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, which blocks transfer of N-acetylglucosamine onto the lipid carrier dolichol phosphate (30Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each medium and cell lysate were collected, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3). Whereas BMP-1F was secreted from untreated cells (lane 1), BMP-1F could not be detected in the medium of tunicamycin-treated cells (lane 2). Latent BMP-1F was present in the cell lysates of treated and untreated cells. However, latent BMP-1F in the tunicamycin-treated cells was ∼70 kDa, and therefore smaller than in control samples. The smaller molecular mass confirmed the presence ofN-linked oligosaccharides on BMP-1. Furthermore, the ease of detection of the latent BMP-1F molecule in treated cells indicated that nonglycosylated BMP-1 accumulated within the cells. Although the tunicamycin experiments confirmed the importance of N-glycosylation for BMP-1 secretion, the contribution of individual sites within the molecule could not be assessed. BMP-1 contains 6 potentialN-glycosylation sites (see Fig.4): Asn91 (prodomain), Asn142 (catalytic domain), Asn332 and Asn363 (CUB1 domain), Asn599 (CUB3 domain), and Asn726 (BMP-1 specific domain). To test the function of each site, we generated mutations in the BMP-1 sequence in which each of the asparagine residues was mutated, by site-directed mutagenesis, to glutamine. In addition to the 6 single mutants, we generated the double CUB1 mutant (N332Q and N363Q), as well as a molecule with Asn to Gln mutations of all 3 CUB sites and the C-terminal-specific site (N4Q), and a molecule in which all 6 potential sites were mutated (N6Q). Wild type and mutant constructs were stably transfected into HT1080 cells. Serum-free conditioned medium was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.5). All the single mutants (panel A, lanes 3–6, 8, and 9) and the double CUB1 mutant (panel B, lane 2) were secreted. The N4Q and N6Q mutants were not secreted (see lanes 10 and 11). The fact that the fully unglycosylated N6Q mutant was not secreted is in agreement with the result obtained with the cells treated with tunicamycin (Fig. 3). Noteworthy, the N4Q and N6Q mutants were not detected in cell lysates (data not shown).Figure 5Expression of wild-type and mutant BMP-1F in HT1080 cells. Vectors containing cDNA-encoding wild-type and mutant BMP-1F were stably expressed in HT1080 cells. When confluent, cells were rinsed and conditioned in serum-free medium for 24 h. Culture supernatants (A and B) and cell lysates (C) were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) in reducing conditions and detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. A and B, the proteins were secreted as mature BMP-1. The N4Q and N6Q (lanes 10 and11) were not detected.

In contrast, the N726Q mutant (lane 9) was indistinguishable from BMP-1F, suggesting that this site is not glycosylated in BMP-1. The prodomain mutant, N91Q, was secreted as the mature protein, which migrated with the same electrophoretic mobility as BMP-1F. This was in agreement with the fact that BMP-1F is secreted in its active form, and the absence of prodomain glycosylation did not block the cleavage of the prodomain or change the electrophoretic mobility of the mature enzyme. By analyzing the corresponding cell lysates (where BMP-1F exists in the latent form,panel C, lanes 2 and 3), the N91Q mutant was shown to migrate faster than BMP-1F, indicating that the Asn91 site is glycosylated in latent BMP-1. Whereas the N91Q, N142Q, and N363Q mutants were well secreted, the N332Q, N332Q/N363Q, and N599Q mutants were less well secreted, 72 ± 20, 60 ± 15, 86 ± 15% (n = 3) of BMP-1F, respectively. The results showed that theN-glycosylation site at Asn332 and Asn599 are required for efficient secretion of the molecule. All the single mutants exhibited PCP activity, in that they cleaved 14C type I procollagen to completion in 18 h (Fig. 6). In contrast, the double mutant N332Q/N363Q was a weak C-proteinase. Minor differences between the mutants were detected when type I procollagen was incubated with the mutants for 4 h (Fig. 7). No difference was observed between BMP-1F and prodomain N91Q mutant. The single CUB mutants cleaved procollagen slower than BMP-1F. Furthermore, as shown above, the CUB1 double mutant (N332Q/N363Q) was much slower at cle"

Catecholamines stimulate adipocyte lipolysis through reversible phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, and simultaneously inhibit LPL activity. However, LPL regulation is complex and previous studies have described translational regulation of LPL in response to catecholamines because of an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the 3′-untranslated region of LPL mRNA. In this study, we identified several protein components of an LPL RNA binding complex. Using an LPL RNA affinity column, we identified two of the RNA-binding proteins as the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 121/149, one of the PKA anchoring proteins, which has known RNA binding activity. To determine whether the C subunit was involved in LPL translation inhibition, the C subunit was depleted from the cytoplasmic extract of epinephrine-stimulated adipocytes by immunoprecipitation. This resulted in the loss of LPL translation inhibition activity of the extract, along with decreased RNA binding activity in a gel shift assay. To demonstrate the importance of the AKAPs, inhibition of PKA-AKAP binding with a peptide competitor (HT31) prevented epinephrine-mediated inhibition of LPL translation. C subunit kinase activity was necessary for LPL RNA binding and translation inhibition, suggesting that the phosphorylation of AKAP121/149 or other proteins was an important part of RNA binding complex formation. The hormonal activation of PKA results in the reversible phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, which is the primary mediator of adipocyte lipolysis. These studies demonstrate a dual role for PKA to simultaneously inhibit LPL-mediated lipogenesis through inhibition of LPL translation.

These studies demonstrate a dual role for PKA to simultaneously inhibit LPL-mediated lipogenesis through inhibition of LPL translation. lipoprotein lipase protein kinase A hormone-sensitive lipase untranslated region A kinase anchoring protein adrenocorticotropic hormone Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)1 is a central enzyme in lipid metabolism and hydrolyzes the core of triglyceride-rich plasma lipoproteins into nonesterified fatty acids and monoacylglycerol (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In adipose tissue and muscle, LPL is localized to the capillary endothelium, and contributes to the rapid removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Catecholamines are of considerable physiologic importance in the mobilization of adipose tissue lipid in response to fasting and exercise. Hormones that cause elevated cAMP (β-adrenergic agonists, ACTH, and glucagon) result in the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which then activates hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (2Stralfors P. Bjorgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Holm C. Langin D. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HSL is the primary mediator of adipocyte lipolysis (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and the release of nonesterified fatty acids from adipocytes play a central role in obesity and insulin resistance (5Kelley D.E. Simoneau J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2349-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 6Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, LPL hydrolyzes lipoproteins at the capillary endothelium generating nonesterified fatty acids for triglyceride storage. LPL and HSL serve opposing functions in adipose tissue, and they respond in an opposite fashion in response to hormonal regulation. In adipocytes, insulin and the fed state result in an increase in LPL activity along with a decrease in HSL activity, whereas hormones that are elevated during the fasting state, such as epinephrine and glucagon, inhibit LPL activity and stimulate HSL-mediated lipolysis (7Eckel R.H. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener, Chicago1987: 79-132Google Scholar, 8Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

North Am. 1996; 25: 847-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the decrease in LPL activity by catecholamines has been described previously (7Eckel R.H. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener, Chicago1987: 79-132Google Scholar), the cellular mechanisms controlling LPL inhibition are complex. In rat adipocytes, we found that the LPL synthetic rate was inhibited more than 5-fold within 30 min of addition of epinephrine to the medium, with no change in LPL mRNA levels (10Ong J.M. Saffari B. Simsolo R.B. Kern P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Studies of 3T3 adipocytes demonstrated that the inhibition of LPL translation by epinephrine involved an RNA-binding protein that interacted with the proximal 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the LPL mRNA (11Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies found the first 24 nucleotides of the LPL 3′-UTR essential for translational regulation, and a 30-kDa RNA-binding protein was identified by cross-linking as an important component of LPL translational regulation (12Ranganathan G., Vu, D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This study was intended to identify the components involved in the translational regulation of LPL following cAMP elevation. As described below, we have identified the catalytic (C) subunit of PKA as the important 30-kDa protein involved in LPL translational regulation. However, the C subunit of PKA is likely part of an RNA binding complex, which also involves A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 121/149, which is involved in binding the PKA holoenzyme, and which contains a known RNA binding domain (13Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 T-75 flasks of 3T3-F442A adipocytes, representing ∼109cells, were induced to differentiate with insulin, and after 8 days of differentiation they were treated with epinephrine (10−5m). LPL translation was inhibited in these cells, and a cytoplasmic extract was prepared as described previously (11Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, adipocytes were scraped from the plate and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10× the pellet volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 35 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and homogenized with 10 strokes of a glass homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear extract was used to prepare a high speed supernatant fraction (S-100) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the cytosolic fraction to 60% saturation and precipitated for ½ h on ice. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g for 10 min at 0 °C, redissolved and dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The sample was then diluted to 25 ml and passed through a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After washing the column with the same buffer, proteins were eluted with 5 ml of buffer containing 400 mm KCl. The DEAE fraction that passed unbound through the column demonstrated LPL RNA binding properties, as demonstrated by a gel shift experiment, whereas the 400 mmKCl eluted fraction had no RNA binding activity. Therefore, the flow-through was dialyzed against the initial column buffer, and fractionated on a LPL 3′ UTR-oligo(dT)-Sepharose column. To prepare the RNA binding column, poly(A) RNA transcripts were generated containing the C-terminal 50 nucleotides of coding sequence, and the first 100 nucleotides of the LPL 3′-UTR (nucleotides 1512 to 1635). A tracer amount of [32P]UTP was also added during transcription, to follow the binding and quality of the RNA. The poly(A) RNA was incubated with presoaked poly(T)-Sepharose beads for 60 min, and packed into a column. The column was washed with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl) to remove the unbound excess RNA. For the initial binding reaction, the epinephrine-treated 3T3-F442A adipocyte extracts were added in low salt (20 mm KCl) buffer containing heparin and yeast tRNA to prevent degradation and inhibit nonspecific binding. After washing extensively, bound proteins were eluted with a salt gradient varying from 0.1 to 0.5 mKCl in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Fractions were dialyzed against 40 mm KCl buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with colloidal blue staining (Novex), as described under “Results.” To obtain sequence information, pooled column fractions from the LPL 3′-UTR column were run on a preparatory 10% polyacrylamide gel. Parallel lanes were stained for identification, and a discrete band at 30 kDa was cut from a wet gel and sent to the Harvard Microchemistry facility (Cambridge, MA) for sequencing. The sequence analysis was performed on tryptic fragments by microcapillary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. In vitro translation of RNA transcripts was performed as described previously (11Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were made from an LPL cDNA construct (LPL 35 of Wion et al. (14Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar)). Equal quantities of RNA transcripts (0.1 μg) were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The intensity of the images was quantitated with the Eagle SightTM 3.0 image capture and analysis software (Stratagene 2, La Jolla, CA). We previously demonstrated that cell extracts from epinephrine-treated cells inhibited LPL translation in vitro (11Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Ranganathan G., Vu, D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cell extracts (S-100 fractions) from control and epinephrine-treated adipocytes were prepared as described above followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis against buffer A. Protein concentration in the cell extract was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal quantities of the cell extract (0.1 μg) were used in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate reaction and the reaction was carried out for 60 min. To assess the role of PKA C subunit, a specific antibody to the Cα subunit (polyclonal antibody to the C terminus, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the cell extract 30 min prior to addition to the in vitro translation reaction. As a control, extracts were treated with antibodies to β-actin (Calbiochem). To assess the binding of the epinephrine cell extract to LPL RNA sequences, a [32P]RNA sequence corresponding to the proximal 3′-UTR of LPL (nucleotides 1512 to 1635) was synthesized. This 32P-labeled transcript (50,000 cpm) was incubated for 20 min in buffer A containing 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 10 units/ml heparin sulfate, along with 5 μg of cytoplasmic extract from control or epinephrine-treated 3T3-F442A adipocytes, and the products were analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. In some experiments, PKA C subunit was removed from the cell extract prior to incubation with the [32P]RNA. To eliminate PKA Cα from the extracts, 0.1 μg of anti-Cα antibody was incubated with the cell extract followed by 5 μl of 1:1 diluted protein A-agarose beads. The extract was centrifuged at 1500 ×g, and the Cα-depleted supernatant was then added to the32P-transcript and gel shift analysis was performed as described above. The effect of the anti-Cα antibodies was compared with irrelevant antibodies (β-actin). In additional experiments, PKA Cα subunit (0.5 Units, Calbiochem) was added back after immunoprecipitation of Cα. To inhibit PKA activity, cells were pretreated for 15 min with H89 (10 mm, Sigma), which is a specific inhibitor of the Cα ATP binding site (15Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by epinephrine treatment as described above. The gel shift was then performed as described above. RNA was extracted from adipocytes (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63130) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of total RNA were resolved by electrophoresis in 2.2 m formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels. Northern blots were probed using [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes to AKAP149 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which have been reported previously (17Furusawa M. Ohnishi T. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36647-36651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). Antibodies to AKAP149 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were directed against the C-terminal region of the molecule, which is homologous with AKAP121, but not with other AKAPs (13Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 19Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Antiphosphoserine antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA. Western blotting was performed as described previously (20Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Samples containing 15 μg of total protein were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were treated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were antispecies-specific peroxidase-labeled IgG (Sigma). Ligand blotting with [32P]PKA RII subunit was performed as described previously (21Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. Clegg R.A. Protein Targeting Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 47-64Google Scholar). To determine whether the PKA C subunit was associated with AKAP149/121, co-precipitation experiments were performed as described previously (22Xie G. Raufman J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1051-G1058Google Scholar). Epinephrine-treated cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors and immunoprecipitated with either anti-PKA Cα antibodies or anti-AKAP149/121 antibodies. These immunoprecipitated products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, followed by ligand blotting with the [32P]PKA RII subunit, as described above. The LPL synthetic rate was measured in cultured 3T3-F442A cells as described previously (23Ong J.M. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 2 h prior to the addition of 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 30 min. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-LPL antibodies (24Goers J.F. Petersen M.E. Kern P.A. Ong J. Schotz M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), followed by analysis of the samples on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, followed by autoradiography. Within each experiment, an aliquot of cell lysate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and counted, and the amount of lysate taken for immunoprecipitation was adjusted to give equal trichloroacetic acid counts. To study the effects of AKAP-PKA disruption (25Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 10 μg of myristylated HT31 (Promega) was added to the cells for 15 min prior to epinephrine treatment. When adipocytes were treated with epinephrine, LPL translation was inhibited (12Ranganathan G., Vu, D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the epinephrine-treated cell extract caused a gel shift when added to a [32P]RNA fragment corresponding to LPL mRNA nucleotides 1512 to 1635 (Fig.1 A). To purify the RNA-binding protein, our methodology was designed to take advantage of the affinity of the RNA-binding protein for the 3′-UTR of LPL. When the epinephrine-treated cell extract was applied to a DEAE column, as described under “Materials and Methods,” the RNA binding properties of the extract were predominantly found in the unbound fraction from the column. This material was then dialyzed against a low salt buffer (see “Materials and Methods”), and applied to a poly(U)-Sepharose column containing the relevant binding region of the 3′-UTR of the LPL mRNA. After washing the column extensively with the initial column buffer, increasing salt concentrations were applied, and the gradual elution of proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE and colloidal blue staining. Fig. 1 shows the stained gel of the column elution fractions from the 3′-UTR column. With progressive salt elution, we observed the appearance of a predominant protein that migrated at 30–35 kDa. Other less prominent bands were also apparent, mostly at higher molecular weights. A cytoplasmic extract from control cells, which had been through the same column procedures, demonstrated essentially no proteins eluting from the RNA binding column except for a faint 30–35-kDa band (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8). In addition, no proteins were eluted when an epinephrine-treated cell extract was passed through a column containing irrelevant RNA (data not shown). Because of our previous identification of a cross-linked band at about 30–35 kDa (12Ranganathan G., Vu, D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the prominent 35-kDa band was cut from the wet gels, and subjected to sequence analysis of proteolytic peptides from this band. The results demonstrated the presence of several proteolytic fragments belonging to the C subunit of PKA. Peptides to aldolase and cyclophilin were also identified inconsistently. Because these are abundant cellular proteins and do not fit a known mechanism for LPL regulation, further studies were not pursued. There were no unassigned peptides. As a result of the elution of PKA C subunit from the LPL RNA affinity column, we sought additional evidence that this subunit was involved in the inhibition of LPL translation. To further characterize this interaction, and to obtain direct evidence for PKA C binding to the LPL mRNA, we performed a gel shift assay. A 32P-labeled transcript corresponding to nucleotides 1512 to 1635 of the LPL mRNA was incubated with the control and epinephrine-treated cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 2, the cell extract from epinephrine-treated cells resulted in a gel shift (lane 2) when compared with the control extract (lane 1). To confirm the role of PKA C subunit, we added anti-PKA Cα antibody to the epinephrine-treated cell extract, followed by protein A-agarose, to immunoprecipitate the PKA Cα subunit. This PKA Cα-depleted extract was then added to the [32P]RNA transcript in a gel shift reaction. As shown in Fig. 2 (lane 3), there was a greatly reduced intensity of the shifted band, and the addition of less anti-PKA Cα antibody resulted in a greater intensity of the gel-shifted band (lane 4). The addition of irrelevant antibodies did not reduce the intensity of the shifted band (data not shown). To determine whether we could then restore RNA binding, we added active PKA Cα (0.5 units) back to the PKA Cα-depleted cell extract. Addition of Cα subunit after the immunoprecipitation restored and augmented the mobility gel shift (Fig. 2, lane 5). However, the addition of the active PKA Cα protein to the [32P]RNA, in the absence of cell extract, did not cause a gel shift (lane 6), suggesting that the PKA Cα subunit is part of a binding complex that involves other proteins. The above experiments demonstrate the involvement of PKA Cα in RNA binding, but do not necessarily imply inhibition of translation. As described previously, the cell extract from control adipocytes inhibited LPL translation in vitro when compared with the addition of no extract, and epinephrine-treated cell extract yielded a much greater inhibition of LPL translation (11Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Ranganathan G., Vu, D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PKA Cα subunit is involved in translation inhibition, antibodies to PKA Cα were added to the in vitrotranslation reaction containing the LPL mRNA and cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 3, the cytoplasmic extract from epinephrine-treated cells inhibited LPL translation in vitro (lane 2). However, when the PKA Cα subunit was immunoprecipitated from the epinephrine-treated cell extract, the inhibition of LPL translation was abolished (lane 4). Indeed, the in vitro translation of LPL was increased in both the control and epinephrine-treated cell extracts after depletion of PKA Cα, which likely reflected the constitutive presence of the PKA Cα subunit. Addition of irrelevant antibody had no effect on the proportional change in LPL translation because of control and epinephrine extracts, although there was a small nonspecific decrease in translation in both lanes 5 and 6 (Fig. 3). Thus, these data suggested that PKA Cα subunit was involved in LPL translation inhibition. These data indicated that the Cα subunit was not by itself sufficient to cause a gel shift or inhibit translation, and suggested the presence of other proteins as part of a complex. PKA regulatory subunit was not detected by Western blotting of the column eluate from the epinephrine-treated cell extract (data not shown). Indeed, the R subunit was tightly bound to the DEAE column, and was not present in either the flow-through or the high salt wash. However, one class of proteins that is known to anchor PKA through the regulatory subunit is the AKAPs. To determine whether AKAPs were involved in the RNA binding complex, we used the32P-labeled PKA regulatory subunit to perform ligand blotting of the elute from the LPL RNA affinity column described in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 4 B(lane 1), a ligand blot of the proteins eluted off the column at 500 mm KCl demonstrated two bands: the expected band at 30 kDa, which represented the C subunit, and a band that migrated with a molecular mass between the markers at 116 and 205 kDa. AKAP121/149 is a member of the AKAP family of PKA-binding proteins that are notable for a consensus KH domain (26Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is found in many known RNA-binding proteins (28Ashley C.T.J. Wilkinson K.D. Reines D. Warren S.T. Science. 1996; 262: 563-566Crossref Scopus (616) Google Scholar). To determine whether the slower migrating band from the ligand blot was AKAP121/149, we performed Western blotting with specific antibodies to AKAP121/149. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the anti-AKAP121/149 antibodies identified the same protein that was identified in the ligand blot. In addition, the anti-AKAP antibodies did not detect any AKAP121/149 in the 3′-UTR column eluate from the control cell extract fraction, or from the lower salt eluate from the epinephrine-treated cells. A negative result was obtained when the blot was probed with antibodies to AKAP150, which has no C-terminal homology to AKAP121/149, but which has a similar migration (data not shown). Hence, AKAP121/149 and the PKA Cα subunit co-eluted from the 3′-UTR LPL mRNA column. The PKA kinase activity has numerous targets, and we performed Western blots with antiphosphoserine antibodies to determine whether any proteins from the 3′-UTR LPL mRNA column were phosphorylated. As shown in Fig.4 B, the same band identified as AKAP121/149 was also identified by the antiphosphoserine antibodies, suggesting that AKAP121/149 is phosphorylated. Antiphosphoserine antibodies identified no other proteins from the 3′-UTR column, and identified no proteins from the control cell extract column (data not shown). The Cα subunit was present, as described above, but was not detected with antiphosphoserine antibodies, suggesting that it became dephosphorylated during the purification. To determine whether AKAP is functionally involved with the inhibition of LPL translation, we used HT31 to inhibit cellular AKAP-PKA binding. HT31 is derived from the consensus peptide motif on AKAPs that bind to the R subunit of PKA (25Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with myristylated HT31 with and without the presence of epinephrine, and labeled with [35S]methionine. As shown in Fig.5, epinephrine inhibited LPL synthesis, and this inhibition was disrupted by HT31. Indeed, the translation of LPL was up-regulated in both control and epinephrine-treated cells, suggesting that AKAPs are involved in a constitutive inhibition of LPL even in control cells. Hence, this experiment demonstrated a functional role of the AKAPs in LPL translation inhibition by epinephrine. To determine whether PKA Cα and AKAP149/121 were associated with each other as a complex, co-precipitation experiments were performed. Cell lysates from epinephrine-treated adipocytes were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Cα antibodies or anti-AKAP149/121 antibodies, followed by either Western blotting with the other antibody or ligand blotting with 32P-regulatory subunit. No association between AKAP121/149 and C subunit was detected using this method (data not shown). Thus, both PKA Cα and AKAP149/121 appeared to be binding to the LPL 3′-UTR, but were not associated with each other. The kinase activity of the PKA C subunit may be important in mediating LPL mRNA binding. To determine whether PKA Cα kinase activity was important, we treated cells with H89 (10 μm), which is a specific inhibitor of the Cα ATP binding site (15Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment woul"
https://openalex.org/W2083548734,"Among the enzymes of the carbohydrate sulfotransferase family, human corneal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST, also known as human GlcNAc6ST-5/GST4β) and human intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hIGn6ST or human GlcNAc6ST-3/GST4α) are highly homologous. In the mouse, intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (mIGn6ST or mouse GlcNAc6ST-3/GST4) is the only orthologue of hCGn6ST and hIGn6ST. In the previous study, we found that hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST, but not hIGn6ST, have sulfotransferase activity to produce keratan sulfate (Akama, T. O., Nakayama, J., Nishida, K., Hiraoka, N., Suzuki, M., McAuliffe, J., Hindsgaul, O., Fukuda, M., and Fukuda, M. N. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 16271–16278). In this study, we analyzed the substrate specificities of these sulfotransferasesin vitro using synthetic carbohydrate substrates. We found that all three sulfotransferases can transfer sulfate to the nonreducing terminal GlcNAc of short carbohydrate substrates. Both hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST, but not hIGn6ST, transfer sulfate to longer carbohydrate substrates that have poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures, suggesting the involvement of hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST in production of keratan sulfate. To clarify further the involvement of hCGn6ST in biosynthesis of keratan sulfate, we reconstituted the biosynthetic pathway in vitro by sequential enzymatic treatment of a synthetic carbohydrate substrate. Using four enzymes, β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I, β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-2, hCGn6ST, and keratan sulfate Gal 6-O-sulfotransferase, we were able to synthesize in vitro a product that conformed to the basic structural unit of keratan sulfate. Based on these results, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for N-linked keratan sulfate on corneal proteoglycans. Among the enzymes of the carbohydrate sulfotransferase family, human corneal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST, also known as human GlcNAc6ST-5/GST4β) and human intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hIGn6ST or human GlcNAc6ST-3/GST4α) are highly homologous. In the mouse, intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (mIGn6ST or mouse GlcNAc6ST-3/GST4) is the only orthologue of hCGn6ST and hIGn6ST. In the previous study, we found that hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST, but not hIGn6ST, have sulfotransferase activity to produce keratan sulfate (Akama, T. O., Nakayama, J., Nishida, K., Hiraoka, N., Suzuki, M., McAuliffe, J., Hindsgaul, O., Fukuda, M., and Fukuda, M. N. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 16271–16278). In this study, we analyzed the substrate specificities of these sulfotransferasesin vitro using synthetic carbohydrate substrates. We found that all three sulfotransferases can transfer sulfate to the nonreducing terminal GlcNAc of short carbohydrate substrates. Both hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST, but not hIGn6ST, transfer sulfate to longer carbohydrate substrates that have poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures, suggesting the involvement of hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST in production of keratan sulfate. To clarify further the involvement of hCGn6ST in biosynthesis of keratan sulfate, we reconstituted the biosynthetic pathway in vitro by sequential enzymatic treatment of a synthetic carbohydrate substrate. Using four enzymes, β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I, β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-2, hCGn6ST, and keratan sulfate Gal 6-O-sulfotransferase, we were able to synthesize in vitro a product that conformed to the basic structural unit of keratan sulfate. Based on these results, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for N-linked keratan sulfate on corneal proteoglycans. glycosaminoglycan human corneal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase macular corneal dystrophy human intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-2 keratan sulfate Gal 6-O-sulfotransferase core-2N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 high pressure liquid chromatography Chinese hamster ovary Keratan sulfate proteoglycan is a major component of the corneal stroma. Keratan sulfate proteoglycan is thought to play an important role in maintaining corneal transparency by organizing and providing proper hydration of the extracellular matrix of the corneal stroma. Lumican, keratocan, and minecan have been identified as carriers of keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)1 in anN-linked manner (1Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Brown S.J. Vergnes J.P.

Studies of the lumican gene knockout mouse revealed the importance of this proteoglycan in organizing regular spacing and fibrillogenesis of collagen in the corneal stroma (8Chakravarti S.

Sci. 2001; 42: 1750-1756PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical and electron microscopic analyses indicated that the protein moiety of lumican interacts with collagen, whereas keratan sulfate GAGs attached to lumican provide the water retention capability necessary for interfibrillar spacing (11Scott J.E. J. Anat. 1992; 180: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rada J.A. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate GAG is composed of repeating disaccharide units of (-3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-), which is called poly-N-acetyllactosamine, with sulfate residues at the 6-O-position of GlcNAc and Gal (13Greiling H. Jolles P. Proteoglycans. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 101-122Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Funderburgh J.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate GAG chain is also modified with fucose and sialic acid at GlcNAc and at the nonreducing terminus, respectively (15Toda N. Seno N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 208: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Dickenson J.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Besides the cornea, keratan sulfate carbohydrate is also found in other tissues such as cartilage. Corneal keratan sulfates are highly sulfated long carbohydrates, which link to their core proteins viaN-linkages. More than half of the total sulfated disaccharide units of keratan sulfate GAG are monosulfated disaccharide (-3Galβ1–4(SO 3−-)GlcNAcβ1-), and a majority of others are disulfated disaccharide units (-3(SO 3−-)Galβ1–4(SO 3−-)GlcNAcβ1-) (18Plaas A.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Distribution of sulfate residues in a corneal keratan sulfate chain is not uniform. On the basis of analysis of keratanase digestion products, it was postulated (20Oeben M. Keller R. Stuhlsatz H.W. Greiling H. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that chains are composed of a region of nonsulfated disaccharides near the linkage to protein, a central region of monosulfated disaccharides, and a stretch of disulfated disaccharides near the nonreducing terminus. Variety of the capping structure at the nonreducing terminus of corneal keratan sulfate is also reported (17Tai G.H. Nieduszynski I.A. Fullwood N.J. Huckerby T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28227-28231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Tai G.H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By contrast, cartilage keratan sulfates have a shorter carbohydrate backbone than corneal keratan sulfate (13Greiling H. Jolles P. Proteoglycans. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 101-122Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Funderburgh J.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cartilage keratan sulfates link to their core protein viaO-linkages at serine or threonine residues. Fucosylation and sialylation ratios are higher in cartilage keratan sulfate than in corneal keratan sulfate (18Plaas A.H. West L.A. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because sulfation of carbohydrate greatly contributes to its hydrophilicity, the degree of sulfation of corneal GAGs is likely to affect corneal transparency by changing the water retention capacity of the corneal stroma. Indeed, several studies have reported the relationship between sulfation of keratan sulfate and the acquisition of corneal transparency during development (6Dunlevy J.R. Beales M.P. Berryhill B.L. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Suzuki S. Wada K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Four enzymes are responsible for production of keratan sulfate carbohydrate: β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, β1,4-galactosyltransferase, GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase and Gal 6-O-sulfotransferase. Two glycosyltransferases, both of which transfer GlcNAc or Gal to a nonreducing terminus of a carbohydrate core structure connected to carrier proteins such as lumican, are involved in elongation of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone of keratan sulfate. The other two enzymes, which transfer sulfate to the 6-O-position of GlcNAc or Gal, are involved in the modification of poly-N-acetyllactosamine required to form keratan sulfate composed of both mono- and disulfated disaccharides. Previous reports have proposed a putative biosynthetic pathway of keratan sulfate carbohydrate (14Funderburgh J.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20Oeben M. Keller R. Stuhlsatz H.W. Greiling H. Biochem.

Chem. 1983; 364: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar); however, no studies have firmly established such a pathway. Previously, we reported that human corneal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST, also known as GlcNAc6ST-5 and GST4β), which is encoded by CHST6, is involved in production of corneal keratan sulfate and that lack of hCGn6ST activity in corneal cells results in a hereditary eye disease, macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) (27Akama T.O. Nishida K. Nakayama J. Watanabe H. Ozaki K. Nakamura T. Dota A. Kawasaki S. Inoue Y. Maeda N. Yamamoto S. Fujiwara T. Thonar E.J. Shimomura Y. Kinoshita S. Tanigami A. Fukuda M.N. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16271-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In human, there is a second homologous sulfotransferase called human intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (hIGn6ST or human GlcNAc6ST-3/GST4α), which is encoded by CHST5 (29Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CHST5 is highly homologous to CHST6 in both coding and noncoding regions and is located next to CHST6 on human chromosome 16q22 (27Akama T.O. Nishida K. Nakayama J. Watanabe H. Ozaki K. Nakamura T. Dota A. Kawasaki S. Inoue Y. Maeda N. Yamamoto S. Fujiwara T. Thonar E.J. Shimomura Y. Kinoshita S. Tanigami A. Fukuda M.N. Nat.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Due to their homology, these two genes are probably the result of gene duplication during evolution. Unlike CHST5 andCHST6 in humans, the mouse genome only has one sulfotransferase gene, designated Chst5, which encodes mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (mIGn6ST or mouse GlcNAc6ST-3/GST4) and is an orthologue of human CHST5 andCHST6 (30Hemmerich S. Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Bistrup A. Ruddle N.R. Rosen S.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fact that all three enzymes, hCGn6ST, hIGn6ST, and mIGn6ST, are highly homologous to each other suggests that they have similar biological function (30Hemmerich S. Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Bistrup A. Ruddle N.R. Rosen S.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in previous studies, we expressed each of these sulfotransferases in mammalian cells and found that cells expressing hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST, but not hIGn6ST, produce a carbohydrate structure that is recognized by an anti-keratan sulfate antibody (28Akama T.O. Nakayama J. Nishida K. Hiraoka N. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16271-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that despite of the apparent structural homology of these sulfotransferases, hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST exhibit activities functionally distinct from that of hIGn6ST. In this study, we analyzed the substrate specificity of hCGn6ST, hIGn6ST, and mIGn6ST in vitro using synthetic oligosaccharide substrates and found that hCGn6ST and mIGn6ST can transfer sulfate to longer oligosaccharide substrates with a poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone. We also found that the keratan sulfate disulfate disaccharide unit can be synthesized by sequential enzymatic reactions of β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I (β4Gal-TI), β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-2 (β3Gn-T2), hCGn6ST, and keratan sulfate Gal 6-O-sulfotransferase (KSG6ST) in vitro. These results establish a biosynthetic pathway for the mono- and disulfated disaccharide sequences in corneal keratan sulfate. Mammalian expression vectors each encoding a full-length hCGn6ST, hIGn6ST, and mIGn6ST have been described previously (28Akama T.O. Nakayama J. Nishida K. Hiraoka N. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J.

The digested fragment was purified and inserted into the NcoI-blunted XhoI site of pET28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). An expression vector encoding each full-length sulfotransferase was co-transfected with pcDM8-CD34-IgG and with or without pcDNAI-C2GnTI into CHO cells using the LipofectAmine PLUS reagent (BD Biosciences CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After culturing the cells for 24 h in α-minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) with 10% fetal calf serum, the medium was replaced withS-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) including 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]sodium sulfate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following incubation for 24 h, secreted CD34-IgG chimeric protein was isolated from the medium by Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The amount of isolated CD34-IgG from each transfectant was determined by Western blot analysis using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. Equal amounts of [35S]sulfate-labeled CD34-IgG, which were produced by transfected cells, were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. To remove N-linked glycans from isolated CD34-IgG, the protein was precipitated once with acetone and dissolved in 1× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1.4 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 7% sucrose). After adjusting the concentration of CD34-IgG, 1.25 μl of the solution was treated with 1 unit of N-glycosidase-F (Roche Diagnostics) in 25-μl reactions including 50 mmNaPO4, pH 7.5, and 0.75% Triton X-100. Following incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Concentrated cultured medium from transfected HeLa cells was used as an enzyme source of sulfotransferases and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. An expression vector for soluble enzyme was transfected into HeLa cells as described above. After culturing transfected cells for 48 h in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum, the medium was replaced with OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was recovered and concentrated by Microcon YM-30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After the addition of an equal volume of glycerol, the concentrated medium was stored at −20 °C. To measure the quantity of soluble polyhistidine-tagged sulfotransferase in the concentrated medium, polyhistidine-tagged hCGn6ST was prepared in a large quantity from a bacterial culture, purified, and used as a standard. Briefly, competent BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen) were transformed with the expression vector, pET28a-hCGn6ST, and the resulting transformants were cultured in Luria broth medium, as recommended by the manufacturer. Polyhistidine-tagged hCGn6ST was purified from an inclusion body fraction of the bacterial lysate by a nickel column (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining indicated that 75.2% of protein components in the bound fraction were hCGn6ST, which was used as a standard. For calculation of the amount of sulfotransferase in the enzyme fraction expressed by HeLa cells, an aliquot of each enzyme source and several aliquots of the hCGn6ST standard were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-HisG antibody (Invitrogen), bands of polyhistidine-tagged sulfotransferase protein were visualized, and the amount of sulfotransferase in the enzyme source was determined by comparing the intensity of the sulfotransferase band with that of the standards. Synthetic carbohydrate substrates were described previously (37Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

After adding 1 ml of water to stop the reaction, the product was purified by a reverse phase C18 column (High Load C18 column, Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL), and incorporation of [35S]sulfate by the substrate was determined by scintillation counting. A synthetic carbohydrate substrate GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ1-octyl was labeled with [35S]sulfate by incubating 11.25 nmol of the substrate in a 75-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm 5′-AMP, 20 mm NaF, 1.76 μCi of [35S]PAPS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 5 μl of the enzyme fraction of hCGn6ST at 37 °C overnight.

The reaction product was purified by a C18 column, lyophilized, and subjected to HPLC analysis as described. To determine the carbohydrate structure, reaction products (products IV and V in Fig. 4) were treated with keratanase, which recognizes (SO 3−-)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc structure and digests Galβ1–4GlcNAc linkages (41Nakazawa K.

The second step in this pathway, the conversion of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA)1 into 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA), is catalyzed by DAPA synthase, an aminotransferase that requires PLP as a cofactor (6Stoner G.L. Eisenberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4019-4036Google Scholar, 7Stoner G.L. Eisenberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4037-4043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DAPA synthase from Escherichia coli is a homodimer with a molecular mass of 94 kDa (6Stoner G.L. Eisenberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4019-4036Google Scholar, 13Käck H. Gibson K.J. Gatenby A.A.

Uchida K. Cook C. Ruppert J. Matsuzaki J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19577-19585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is unique among aminotransferases in that it usesS-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as an amino group donor. The reaction catalyzed by DAPA synthase is typical of that of an aminotransferase and follows the general mechanism seen in other PLP-dependent enzymes (15Hayashi H. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of DAPA synthase (16Käck H. Sandmark J. Gibson K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 857-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) shows that DAPA synthase belongs to the fold type I family of PLP- dependent enzymes (17Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 18Schneider G. Käck H. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 2000; 8: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The monomer of DAPA synthase consists of two domains, a small domain comprising the N- and C-terminal part of the polypeptide chain (residues 1–49 and 330–429) and a large domain formed by the intervening residues containing the cofactor-binding site. In the crystal, the two subunits of the homodimer of DAPA synthase are related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic axis (16Käck H. Sandmark J. Gibson K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 857-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The PLP-binding site is located between the two domains of the monomer at the interface of the two subunits. In the enzyme-PLP complex, the cofactor is covalently linked to the ε-amino group of Lys-274, a residue functionally invariant in the whole family of fold-type I PLP-dependent enzymes. Because biotin synthesis is unique to plants and microorganisms, enzymes of this pathway are potential targets for the development of antimicrobial drugs and herbicides (19Rendina A.R. Taylor W.S. Gibson K. Lorimer G. Rayner D. Locket B. Kranis K. Wexler B. Marcovici-Mizrahi D. Nudelman A. Nudelman A. Marsilii E. Hongji C. Wawrzak Z. Calabrese J. Huang W. Jia J. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y.

Inhibitors of each of these enzymes have been characterized as either synthetic mechanism-based inhibitors (19Rendina A.R. Taylor W.S. Gibson K. Lorimer G. Rayner D. Locket B. Kranis K. Wexler B.

Several antimicrobial compounds have been isolated from Streptomyces species that specifically inhibit DAPA synthase. The most well studied of these compounds, amiclenomycin (ACM), is particularly active against mycobacteria (21Okami Y. Kitahara T. Hamada M. Naganawa H. Kondo S. Maeda K. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. 1974; 27: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Kern A. Kabatek U. Jung G. Werner R.G. Poetsch M. Zähner H. Liebigs Ann.

This amino acid has been isolated as the free acid and as a part of di- and tripeptides, respectively, and all these compounds show antibiotic activities. There is evidence, however, that ACM acts as an enzyme inhibitor in the form of the free amino acid and that the di- and tripeptides are hydrolyzed by bacterial peptidases, which release ACM (23Poetsch M. Zähner H. Werner R.G. Kern A. Jung G. J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Amiclenomycin exists as the cis andtrans isomers (Scheme FS2). Atrans geometry had been tentatively proposed on the basis of the 5J coupling constant between the two allylic hydrogens (21Okami Y. Kitahara T. Hamada M. Naganawa H. Kondo S. Maeda K. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. 1974; 27: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The second isomer, however, was not available from natural sources. Recently, both isomers were synthesized, and it was concluded on the basis of their NMR spectra that the natural product hadcis rather than trans geometry (24Mann S. Carillon S. Breyne O. Maequet A. Chem. Eur. J. 2002; 8: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies of DAPA synthase by ACM indicated that the inhibitor binds to the KAPA/DAPA-binding site of the enzyme (25Hotta K. Kitahara T. Okami Y. J. Antibiot. 1975; 28: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to reveal the structural basis of inhibition of DAPA synthase by ACM. Toward this end, we have determined the crystal structures of the complexes formed between the holoenzyme andcis and trans ACM to 1.8 and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. The structure analysis reveals that the inhibitor forms a covalent adduct with the cofactor PLP, which mimics the external aldimine. Formation of the covalent adduct is accompanied by aromatization of the cyclohexadiene ring of ACM. Inhibition studies, absorption spectra, and the crystallographic analysis provide evidence that only the cis isomer is a potent inhibitor of DAPA synthase. The expression plasmid pET24(+) harboring the bioA gene from E. coli was used to produce the enzyme. Expression of the bioA gene in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purification of DAPA synthase followed procedures outlined in Ref.13Käck H. Gibson K.J. Gatenby A.A. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 1397-1398Google Scholar. Synthesis of the cis and trans isomers of ACM was carried out as previously described (24Mann S. Carillon S. Breyne O. Maequet A. Chem. Eur. J. 2002; 8: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Amiclenomycin was added to a solution of DAPA synthase (33 μl, 13 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, at 4 °C, containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In the case of the cis isomer, 1 μl of a 50-μmsolution of ACM was added, corresponding to 5-fold molar excess over DAPA synthase. Inactivation by the trans isomer was carried out with twenty-fold molar excess of inhibitor (1 μl of a stock solution of 200 μm was added). The inactivation studies were carried out at 37 °C. After addition of the inhibitor, the residual activity of the enzyme was measured at regular time intervals by a coupled assay where DAPA produced by DAPA synthase was converted by DTB synthetase into DTB, which was then quantified. An aliquot of the above preincubation assay (3.5 μl) was added to the reaction mixture (final volume of 100 μl). The 30-fold dilution of the inhibitor at this step stops the inactivation reaction. Control experiments verified that DAPA synthase is not inhibited at this low concentration of ACM. The reaction mixture consisted of a phosphate-buffered solution (pH 8.0, 100 mm) containing racemic KAPA (40 μm), PLP (100 μm), SAM (1 mm), DTB synthetase (200 μg/ml), ATP (10 mm), NaHCO3 (50 mm), and MgCl2 (10 mm). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 50 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 15% trichloroacetic acid solution (25 μl). DTB was determined quantitatively by a microbiological assay (26Izumi Y. Sato K. Tani Ogata K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1973; 37: 2683-2684Google Scholar). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were transferred to a minimal medium plate (2% agar) containing E. coli strain C268, which is deficient in biotin biosynthesis due to a lack of DAPA synthase. This strain proved to be more sensitive to DTB than to DAPA, which prompted us to use the coupled assay. Absorption spectra of DAPA synthase were recorded using a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer. DAPA synthase was crystallized as described (13Käck H. Gibson K.J. Gatenby A.A. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 1397-1398Google Scholar). Crystals were incubated at room temperature with a solution of 15 mm cisACM for three hours or 5 mm trans ACM for 13 h before data collection. X-ray data from single crystals were collected to 1.8 and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively, on a marCCD detector at a temperature of 100 K at the synchrotron beam line I711 (MAX Laboratory, Lund University, Lund, Sweden). The x-ray data sets were processed with MOSFLM (27Leslie A. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled using the CCP4 suite of programs (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19668) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structures of the complexes were solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; A50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) with the dimer of wild type enzyme (space group P21) as search model. Refinement was performed using Refmac5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; D53: 240-258Crossref Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) and 5% of the reflections were excluded to monitorR free. Manual rebuilding of the model was carried out with the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) based on ςA-weighted 2Fo−Fc and Fo−Fcelectron density maps. In both complexes, positive difference electron density was found in the active sites of the enzyme, which allowed modeling of the bound inhibitor. Water molecules were added to the model and inspected manually during refinement. Statistics of the refinement and the resulting model are given in TableI. Two stretches of disordered residues are observed for the subunits in both models (158–167 and 180–189, respectively). These residues are situated in two loop regions at the surface of the protein and are also poorly defined in the wild type structure. The refined models consists of residues 1–182 and 184–428 for each of the two subunits, two molecules of the covalent PLP-ACM adduct (one in thetrans ACM-derived complex), two sodium ions, and 537 (324trans ACM) water molecules. The stereochemistry of the models was analyzed using PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, accession numbers 1mly (cis ACM) and 1mlz(trans ACM). Structural comparisons were carried out using the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) with default parameters. Figures were made with MOLSCRIPT (33Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (34Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graphics Modelling. 1997; 15: 133-138Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar), and RASTER3D (35Merrit E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar). Addition of a 5-fold excess of cis ACM to holo-DAPA synthase results in complete inactivation of the enzyme in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.1). The trans isomer, although given in 20-fold excess over DAPA synthase, only inhibits the enzyme to about 50% (Fig. 1). The weaker inhibition by the transisomer could reflect an inherent difference in chemical reactivity between the two isomers and/or weaker binding of the transisomer to the enzyme. The near UV-visible absorption spectrum of the holoenzyme exhibits two absorption maxima at wavelengths 335 and 425 nm, respectively, the latter being characteristic of a protonated aldimine (36Metzler C.M. Visvanath R. Metzler D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9374-9381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition ofcis ACM results in an increase of the absorption at 335 nm and the disappearance of the longer wavelength band at 425 nm (Fig.2), indicating that the aldimine structure in the active site is lost in the enzyme-PLP-ACM complex. The time frame of these spectroscopic changes is of the same order of magnitude as the appearance of strong inhibition of the enzyme bycis ACM. Incubation of DAPA synthase with thetrans isomer results in similar but far less pronounced spectroscopic changes (Fig. 2). While exhibiting the same trend, increase of the absorption maximum at 335 nm and decrease at 425 nm, these changes occur at a lower rate and are smaller than those observed with cis ACM. The structures of the complexes were solved using molecular replacement and refined. The resulting electron density maps were of good quality, and the refinement statistics are given in Table I. TheR-factors and the stereochemistry are as expected for models at the given resolution. The overall structure of the polypeptide chain in the complexes is very similar to the structure of holo-DAPA synthase. Superposition of 427 Cα atoms of the DAPA synthase subunit results in root mean square deviations of 0.26 Å for both complexes, which indicates that no large-scale conformational transitions occur upon binding of the inhibitor. One significant feature in the initial 2Fo−Fcand Fo−Fc difference electron density maps for the ACM complexes was a negative difference electron density between the ε-amino nitrogen atom of Lys-274 and the C4′ atom of PLP (Fig.3 A), revealing that the covalent bond between these atoms observed in the holoenzyme was broken. Furthermore, strong positive electron density extended from the C4′ carbon atom of PLP into the substrate-binding cleft, indicating a covalent adduct involving this carbon atom. A model of ACM fits well into this difference electron density, and the maps clearly show a covalent linkage of the 4-amino group of the inhibitor with the C4′ carbon atom of the cofactor (Fig. 3 B). After refinement, the B-factors for the atoms of the ACM moiety (31.6 Å2) in the enzyme-PLP-cis ACM complex are similar to the overall B-factor for all protein atoms (25.8 Å2), indicating high occupancies for ACM in the active sites. The electron density for the bound inhibitor is not consistent with a cyclohexadiene ring but fits best to a structure where the carbon atoms of the ring and the substituents at the C1 and C4 carbon position are lying in one plane. A change in hybridization fromsp3 to sp2 for the C1 and C4 carbon atoms must have occurred, resulting in the formation of an aromatic ring system. The difference electron densities for the bound inhibitor in the active sites of the enzyme-PLP-trans ACM complex were in general weaker than for the cis isomer. Although the electron density maps did allow fitting of the inhibitor in subunit A (Fig.3 C), the electron density for the B-subunit was too weak to reliably model bound amiclenomycin. Increase of the concentration oftrans ACM during soaking did not improve the electron density maps. The lower occupancy of the active site with thetrans compound is also indicated by the B-factor (51.7 Å2) for the ACM moiety in the A-subunit. The mean B-factor for all protein atoms is significantly lower (36.0 Å2). The binding of trans ACM to the A-subunit of DAPA synthase is, within the error limits of the electron density maps at the present resolution, identical to the binding of the cis isomer. Superposition of the cis and trans ACM complexes shows that the bound covalent adducts fall on top of each other and that the same side chain rearrangements occur in the two active sites. In the following, we describe the binding of amiclenomycin as observed in the enzyme-PLP-cis ACM complex due to the higher resolution and occupancy. The inhibitor binds in the substrate-binding cleft of the enzyme with a number of interactions to groups on the enzyme and to PLP (Fig.4 A). The 4-amino nitrogen of ACM, in addition to being covalently linked to the C4′ carbon atom of PLP, also forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of the catalytic residue Lys-274. The C-terminal end of the ACM moiety extends toward the entrance of the active site cleft, and the carboxyl group forms a salt linkage to Arg-391 and a hydrogen bond to the nitrogen atom of the side chain of Trp-52. Arg-391 is invariant in DAPA synthases (16Käck H. Sandmark J. Gibson K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 857-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and Trp52 is a highly conserved residue. The α-amino group of ACM points toward the bulk solution and only interacts with surrounding water molecules. The hydrophobic part of ACM is bound in the substrate channel, which is lined by predominantly hydrophobic residues, Tyr-17, Trp-52, Trp-53, Tyr-144, Ala-217, and Phe-393. The aromatic ring of the covalent adduct packs against the aromatic side chains of Trp-52, Trp-53, and Tyr-144, but at angles that prevent favorable π-π stacking interactions (the latter would require parallel or perpendicular ring stacking). The interactions of the PLP cofactor with the enzyme are the same as observed in the 3D structure of the holoenzyme, with the exception of the aldimine linkage to the catalytic lysine residue and a 17° rotation of the pyridine ring of PLP relative to its position in the holoenzyme. In the cis ACM complex, the inhibitor binds somewhat differently in the two active sites. In the A-subunit a few minor conformational changes are seen, which involve movements of side chains in response to the binding of the inhibitor. For example, the side chain of Arg-391 moves a few Å toward the carboxyl group of the inhibitor. The largest movement is a 90° rotation of the indole side chain of Trp-53 that packs against the hydrophobic part of the ACM moiety. The situation in this subunit is similar to that of the enzyme-PLP-KAPA complex (16Käck H. Sandmark J. Gibson K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 857-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) where the same local conformational changes have been found upon binding of the substrate KAPA. In the B-subunit, the binding of the hydrophobic part of the inhibitor to the enzyme is slightly different (Fig. 4 B). While the covalent linkage with PLP is formed and the interactions of the hydrophilic tail with the conserved Arg-391 are retained, the benzene ring of the adduct is shifted from its position in the A-subunit toward residue Trp-53. The side chain of this residue has not changed its position from that in the holoenzyme, which might be the reason why the benzene ring of the inhibitor can approach this residue more closely than in the A-subunit. The ACM moiety binds in a similar fashion to the binding of the substrate KAPA to the enzyme. A superposition of the substrate complex with the inhibitor complex (Fig. 5) shows that the interactions of the terminal carboxyl group are preserved and that the reactive ends of the molecules, the 7-keto group of KAPA and the 4-amino group of ACM, point toward or are engaged in a covalent interaction with the C4′ carbon atom of PLP, respectively. The position of the aliphatic carbon chain of KAPA and the hydrophobic carbon skeleton of the ACM moiety superpose well in the two complexes, and the same hydrophobic interactions with enzyme side chains are made. These studies provide evidence that the cis isomer of ACM is a potent inhibitor of DAPA synthase. The crystal structure analysis shows that the inhibitor binds in the substrate-binding site of the enzyme and forms a covalent adduct with the cofactor. Formation of the covalent adduct is accompanied by the aromatization of the cyclohexadiene ring of ACM. This adduct mimics the external aldimine (albeit in its reduced form) formed with the substrate. The crystallographic findings are consistent with the absorption spectra, which showed that the characteristic absorption at 425 nm is lost, indicating breakage of the internal aldimine linkage between the cofactor and the catalytic lysine residue. The proposed mechanism of formation of the aromatic adduct of ACM with PLP involves as the first step the transimination of the internal aldimine between PLP and Lys-274. Aromatization of the cyclohexadiene ring of the external aldimine is then initiated by proton abstraction at the C4 carbon, most likely by Lys-274, the only base in close proximity of this atom (Fig.6). The same residue would then be able to transfer a proton to the C4′ atom of PLP. In these proton transfer steps Lys-274 acts in the same manner as in the classical mechanism for aminotransferases (37Gehring H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6335-6340Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Julin D.A. Wiesinger H. Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3815-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To complete the aromatization of the cyclohexadiene ring, the proton at the C1 carbon of the ring has to be removed. In the structures of the covalent complex of holoenzyme with ACM there is no base close enough to participate in proton abstraction. On the other hand, it may not be necessary to invoke acid/base chemistry for this step, and the reaction might proceed at significant rates after proton removal at the C4 position. In the vicinity of the aromatic ring of the covalent adduct, there are several water molecules, which provide a proton relay system to bulk solvent. The significant gain in free energy upon aromatization certainly favors the overall reaction, i.e. formation of the aromatic product. It is obvious from Fig. 1 that the trans isomer of ACM is not a very efficient inhibitor compared with the cis isomer. This is also supported by crystallographic data, which demonstrated partial occupancy of the active sites when preparing the enzyme-PLP-ACM complex with the trans isomer. Nevertheless, crystallography and mass-spectrometry 2S. Mann and A. Marquet, manuscript in preparation. indicate that both compounds form the same aromatic adduct with PLP. Although the trans isomer in principle can react with DAPA synthase, there is a large difference in the kinetics and extent of formation of the covalent adduct. This certainly reflects a difference in reactivity between the two stereoisomers within the active site and possibly a weaker affinity of the trans isomer for the enzyme. The structures of the enzyme-PLP-ACM complexes suggest a structural explanation for the difference in reactivity of the two isomers. The crystal structures described here are of the covalent adduct formed between ACM and holoenzyme, which is identical for both isomers of ACM. To determine factors that might influence reactivity/binding of the inhibitor, we have manually modeled binding of the two ACM isomers into the active site of the enzyme before the reaction takes place. Thecis isomer can be modeled in an orientation suitable for formation of the covalent adduct without any sterical hindrance with active site residues. The trans isomer can be modeled in two different binding modes into the active site of the enzyme. However, none of the two binding modes is ideal for formation of the covalent adduct. In one model, the 4-amino group binds in an orientation such that the proton to be abstracted points toward the catalytic base Lys-274. This, on the other hand, has as a consequence that the carboxylic acid tail of the inhibitor will point in a different direction compared with the cis isomer. Although there is sufficient space in the substrate-binding cleft for the aliphatic part of the carboxylic acid tail of the latter, in thetrans configuration it will be too close to the side chain of Trp-52. This results in a few unfavorable interactions, mainly for the carbon atoms in α and β position to the benzene ring of the adduct. If, on the other hand, the trans isomer binds with its carboxyl tail avoiding too close contacts (i.e. similar to the cis isomer), the 4-amino group can still be positioned favorably for transamination. However, in this case the proton, which has to be abstracted to initiate aromatization, is located on the “wrong” side of the ring and not accessible for Lys-274. Thus both models for binding oftrans ACM result in scenarios that counteract the formation of the covalent adduct. Either binding occurs in a manner suitable for reaction, but at the expense of binding energy or unfavorable interactions during binding are avoided, and then the necessary chemistry can not occur. Sterical hindrance thus appears to be the underlying determinant of the stereospecificity of inhibition of DAPA synthase by ACM. The mode of inhibition through formation of a covalent linkage with PLP and subsequent aromatization as observed for ACM is reminiscent to that observed for gabaculine (5-amino-1,3-cyclohexadienyl carboxylic acid) (39Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4604-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 40Fu M. Silverman R.B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 8: 1581-1590Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This inhibitor targets a number of vitamin B6-dependent enzymes of fold type I, and the structures of several of these complexes are known (41Shah S.A. Shen B.W. Brünger A.T.

The overall features of the gabaculine-enzyme interactions are preserved in these enzymes and are also seen in the DAPA synthase-PLP-ACM complex. These include the covalent linkage with PLP and aromatization of the ring system, hydrophobic interactions of the aromatic ring with enzymic groups in the substrate-binding cleft, and a salt bridge of the carboxyl group of the inhibitor with an arginine side chain.

Galactose mutarotase plays a key role in the Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of β-d-galactose to α-d-galactose (1Bouffard G.G. Rudd K.E. Adhya S.L. J. Mol.

Additionally, genes encoding enzymes with mutarotase activities have now been identified in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10Gatz C. Altschmied J. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 31-39Google Scholar),Streptococcus thermophilus (11Poolman B. Royer T.J. Mainzer S.E. Schmidt B.F. J.

Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1445-1452Google Scholar), among others. A possible catalytic mechanism for galactose mutarotase, first suggested by Hucho and Wallenfels (15Hucho F. Wallenfels K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 489-496Google Scholar) and outlined in SchemeFS1, involves the abstraction of a proton from the C-1 hydroxyl group of the sugar by an enzymatic base and donation of a proton to the C-5 oxygen by a side chain acidic group thus resulting in ring cleavage. Subsequent rotation about the C-1/C-2 bond, followed by abstraction of the proton on the C-5 oxygen and donation of a proton back to the C-1 oxygen leads to product formation. The crystal structure of the enzyme from L. lactis has recently been solved to high resolution, both in the unbound state and complexed with galactose (16Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Google Scholar). A ribbon representation of one subunit of this dimeric enzyme is displayed in Fig.1 a. The overall fold of the monomer is dominated by extensive layers of β-sheet and, despite no amino acid sequence homology, is topologically similar to the 18-stranded, anti-parallel β-motif observed for domain 5 of β-galactosidase (17Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Google Scholar). This three-dimensional architecture has also been observed in copper amine oxidase (18Parsons M.R. Convery M.A. Wilmot C.M. Yadav K.D. Blakeley V. Corner A.S. Phillips S.E. McPherson M.J. Knowles P.F. Structure. 1995; 3: 1171-1184Google Scholar), hyaluronate lyase (19Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E.

Biol. 1999; 288: 635-647Google Scholar), and maltose phosphorylase (21Egloff M.-P. Uppenberg J. Haalck L. van Tilbeurgh H. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 689-697Google Scholar). As demonstrated by this first x-ray crystallographic analysis of a galactose mutarotase, there are few structural changes that accompany sugar binding. Indeed, the sugar substrate is accommodated within the active site via movement of solvent molecules rather than major perturbations of side chain conformations except for that of Phe-279. The aromatic group of Phe-279 shifts somewhat to accommodate the C-1 hydroxyl group of galactose in its α-anomeric configuration. The electron density corresponding to the galactose ligand indicated the presence of both anomers in the active site. A close-up view of the mutarotase active site with bound α,β-d-galactose is presented in Fig. 1 b. Both His-96 and His-170, which are strictly conserved among mutarotase amino acid sequences, are located within 3 Å of the C-5 oxygen of the sugar. Additionally, Glu-304 is situated at ∼2.7 Å from the C-1 hydroxyl group of galactose. From this initial investigation, it was postulated that Glu-304 functions to initiate the reaction. Since both His-96 and His-170 lie within hydrogen bonding distance to the C-5 oxygen, either is positioned to serve as the active site acid required to protonate the C-5 oxygen, and it was not apparent from this first structure which one serves in such capacity. In addition to catalyzing the physiologically relevant conversion of β-d-galactose to α-d-galactose, mammalian mutarotases have been shown to act upon d-glucose, d-xylose, andl-arabinose as well (5Keston A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 102: 306-312Google Scholar, 9Bailey J.M. Fishman P.H. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 781-788Google Scholar, 22Keston A.S. Science. 1954; 120: 355-356Google Scholar). The structures of these sugars are depicted in Scheme FS2. Here we present both kinetic and x-ray crystallographic data on the binding of various sugars to galactose mutarotase from L. lactis. The first structure to be solved in this investigation was that of the mutarotase complexed with glucose. Surprisingly, the glucose ligand bound in a quite unexpected manner with its C-6 hydroxyl group located near His-96 and His-170 and its C-1 hydroxyl group lying within hydrogen bonding distance of Arg-71, Glu-203, and Asp-243. This alternate binding mode, as compared with that of galactose, inspired the additional series of structural and kinetic analyses presented here. Specifically, the structures of the enzyme complexed withd-fucose, d-quinovose,l-arabinose, or d-xylose have now been determined to 1.9-Å resolution or better, and the kinetic constants for sugar binding have been measured. As can be seen from Scheme FS2, both d-fucose and d-quinovose represent C-6 deoxy sugar mimics of galactose and glucose, respectively. Likewise,l-arabinose and d-xylose serve as five-carbon analogs of galactose and glucose, respectively. Taken together, these investigations demonstrate that sugar binding within the active site cleft of galactose mutarotase is varied and that the different binding modes can, in part, be correlated with the observed kinetic parameters and with the spatial orientations of the C-4 hydroxyl groups. The necessary protein required for these studies was expressed in E. coliand purified as described previously (16Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20854-20861Google Scholar). Large single crystals of the unliganded form of the enzyme were routinely grown by vapor diffusion against precipitant solutions containing 15–19% poly(ethylene glycol) 5000 methyl ether and 100 mmMES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.0). Enzyme concentrations were typically 17.5 mg/ml. The crystals achieved maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm in ∼1–2 weeks and belonged to the space group P212121with typical unit cell dimensions of a = 44.8 Å,b = 76.3 Å, and c = 211.1 Å. The asymmetric unit contained one dimer. Crystals of the unbound form of galactose mutarotase were harvested from hanging drop experiments and equilibrated in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 5000 methyl ether, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), and a 100 mmconcentration of the appropriate sugar. After equilibration for 24 h at 4 °C, x-ray data sets were collected to high resolution at 4 °C with a Bruker HISTAR area detector system equipped with Göbel focusing optics. The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA.

Open table in a new tab The enzymatic activity of wild-type mutarotase was measured with a DIP-360 digital polarimeter (Jasco) at 25 °C. The change in a specific rotation of each substrate was measured as the α-anomer was converted to the equilibrium mixture of isomers, except for l-arabinose where the starting substrate was the β-anomer. All substrates were rapidly dissolved in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6) and 50 mm KCl immediately before addition of the enzyme. The rate of the non-enzymatic turnover was subtracted from the initial rate of the enzymatic reaction.

Indeed, the α-anomeric configuration cannot be accommodated in this binding mode due to a steric clash with the aromatic side chain of Phe-279. A superposition of the mutarotase active sites with either bound glucose or galactose is displayed in Fig.3. The α-carbons for the two protein-sugar complexes correspond with a root mean square deviation of 0.32 Å. As can be seen there are virtually no structural differences between the proteins with either glucose or galactose situated in their respective active sites. Strikingly and unexpectedly, however, the sugar ligands bind in completely different manners. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 3, C-4 of galactose nearly superimposes onto the C-5 ring oxygen of glucose. The C-1 hydroxyl group of glucose is no longer situated within hydrogen bonding distance of His-96, His-170, and Glu-304. Rather, it lies within 2.9 Å of Arg-71, 2.9 Å of Glu-203, 2.6 Å of Asp-243, and 2.9 Å of a solvent molecule. Due to this change in orientation, the C-6 hydroxyl group of glucose is now positioned within 2.8 Å of His-96, 2.8 Å of His-170, and 2.8 Å of a solvent molecule. Schematics of the hydrogen bonding patterns exhibited between the mutarotase and either galactose or glucose are shown in Fig.4, a and b, respectively. In the case of galactose, five amino acid residues play critical roles in ligand binding: Arg-71 and Asp-243 on the left side of the pocket and His-96, His-170, and Glu-304 on the right side. Additionally four ordered water molecules lie within hydrogen bonding distance to galactose, one of which serves to bridge the C-2 and C-1 hydroxyl (β-anomer) groups. Approximately 28% of the surface area of galactose is buried by the protein as calculated according to the algorithm of Lee and Richards (25Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Google Scholar). When glucose binds within the mutarotase active site, five amino acid residues are again critical for binding, four of which are the same as for galactose (Arg-71, Asp-243, His-96, and His-170). With respect to glucose binding, eight ordered water molecules are located within hydrogen bonding distance of the sugar. The alternate binding mode exhibited by glucose results in the sugar being directed out toward the solvent with an approximate 5% reduction in its buried surface area. Importantly, when galactose binds in the mutarotase active site, the C-4 hydroxyl moiety is positioned within hydrogen bonding distance of Arg-71. In contrast, when glucose is bound to the enzyme, the C-4 hydroxyl group is surrounded only by two water molecules located within 2.5 and 2.8 Å. The unexpected manner in which glucose bound in the active site of galactose mutarotase emphasizes the need for caution in interpreting x-ray data in the absence of accompanying biochemical and kinetic data. Clearly the use of substrate analogs has had a profound impact on our present day understanding of enzyme structure and function. Nevertheless, the results must be approached with caution, since the compounds employed in such studies are not true substrates or intermediates and may not fit into the active site in a manner that mimics true substrate binding. In the present work this is illustrated by glucose, a known but perhaps not physiologically relevant substrate. Indeed, based on the mode of glucose binding to the enzyme and in the absence of the previous x-ray crystallographic investigation on the mutarotase-galactose complex, it might have been speculated that Asp-243, Glu-203, and Arg-71 rather than His-96, His-170, and Glu-304 play key catalytic roles. Based on preliminary unpublished kinetic data for various site-directed mutant proteins examined in our laboratories, however, it appears that Glu-304 and His-170 are critically important for catalysis with all sugar substrates, whereas Asp-243 is not important and His-96 is somewhere in between. As indicated in Table III, thek cat and K m values with α-d-galactose as a substrate were 3700 ± 240 s−1 and 20 ± 3 mm, respectively. For α-d-glucose as the substrate, thek cat and K m values were 430 ± 32 s−1 and 34 ± 6 mm, respectively. Most likely the reduction in k catwith glucose as the substrate is a function of its non-productive binding as demonstrated in this x-ray crystallographic analysis. The question arises as to why this alternate binding mode occurs for glucose and not for galactose. In the complex of the enzyme with bound galactose, the C-4 hydroxyl sugar is in the proper orientation to form a hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg-71 (3.2 Å). When glucose binds to the enzyme in the same manner as galactose, and presumably this occurs, since galactose mutarotase is active against glucose, the interaction with Arg-71 is absent due to the different spatial orientation of the C-4 hydroxyl group (Scheme FS2). It can thus be speculated that the guanidinium group of Arg-71, through its interactions with the C-4 hydroxyl group of galactose, plays a key role in the reaction mechanism by directing the sugar into the proper orientation for efficient catalysis. Without this interaction, alternate binding modes occur as shown here for the mutarotase-glucose complex. The different binding modes for glucose versusgalactose clearly emphasize the importance of even a single hydrogen bond in protein-carbohydrate interactions. If, as suggested, Arg-71 plays a critical role for properly positioning the sugar ligand in the active site for efficient catalysis, then it can be predicted that those sugars, which mimic the hydroxyl configuration of glucose about C-4, will bind like glucose in the crystalline enzyme. Correspondingly, those sugars that mimic galactose will maintain the hydrogen bond with Arg-71 and thus bind like galactose. Furthermore, it might be expected that the catalytic rates for those sugars mimicking galactose will be higher than those mimicking glucose. To test this hypothesis, the next set of sugars studied in this investigation were α-d-fucose and α-d-quinovose, which represent C-6 deoxy sugar analogs of galactose and glucose, respectively (Scheme FS2). Shown in Fig. 5 a is the electron density corresponding to d-fucose when bound to galactose mutarotase. The α-carbons for the proteins with bound galactose versus fucose superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.13 Å. As can be seen, the electron density map shows that both the α- and β-anomers of the sugar are present in the active site. Also, as predicted, the sugar binds in the active site pocket in the same orientation as galactose with its C-1 hydroxyl group located within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu-304 and the guanidinium group of Arg-71 situated within hydrogen bonding distance to its C-4 hydroxyl group (Fig. 5 b). Indeed, the overall hydrogen bonding pattern observed between the protein and fucose as shown in Fig. 5 b is virtually identical to that between the protein and galactose as outlined in Fig. 4 a. Clearly the loss of the C-6 hydroxyl group in fucose has little effect on the binding of the ligand to the crystalline enzyme as would be expected, since, in galactose, the C-6 hydroxyl group does not make specific interactions with the protein but rather is surrounded by water molecules. Thek cat and K m values with α-d-fucose as the substrate were 1700 ± 120 s−1 and 25 ± 4 mm, respectively. The electron density corresponding to quinovose when bound to the enzyme is depicted in Fig. 6 a. Only the β-anomer of the sugar is observed in the active site, presumably due to the steric hindrance imposed by the aromatic side chain of Phe-279. The α-carbons for the enzyme-quinovoseversus enzyme-galactose complexes superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.13 Å. In sharp contrast to the other sugars, there are only five potential electrostatic interactions between the protein and quinovose, as depicted in Fig. 6 b. Like that observed with bound glucose in the active site, the C-1 hydroxyl group of quinovose lies within 3.1 Å of Arg-71, 2.9 Å of Glu-203, and 2.8 Å of Asp-243 (Figs. 4 b and 6 b). In sharp contrast, however, the C-4 hydroxyl of quinovose is anchored to the protein via the imidazole nitrogens of His-96 and His-170. In glucose, these same protein side chains serve to anchor the C-6 hydroxyl group, which is missing in quinovose. As a result, the binding mode for quinovose lies somewhere between that observed for glucose and for galactose. The k cat for quinovose is considerably reduced at 490 ± 30 s−1. As the next step in this investigation, the molecular structures of galactose mutarotase complexed with either l-arabinose ord-xylose were determined. These sugars represent the five-carbon analogs of galactose and glucose, respectively. The electron density corresponding to l-arabinose bound in the active site of Subunit II is displayed in Fig.7 a. Note that, as opposed to Subunit II, the sugar adopts both anomeric forms in Subunit I (not shown). Possible electrostatic interactions between the sugar and the protein are highlighted in Fig. 7 b. Not surprisingly, these interactions are similar to those observed for galactose (Fig.4 a). The distance between the C-4 hydroxyl group ofl-arabinose and Nη2 of Arg is ∼3.5 Å and, within experimental error, is similar to that observed for galactose (3.2 Å). The α-carbons for the enzyme complexed with galactoseversus l-arabinose correspond with a root mean square deviation of 0.13 Å. As judged by the kinetic constants presented in Table III, l-arabinose is as good a substrate for galactose mutarotase as galactose, thus highlighting the importance of the hydroxyl configuration about C-4 for proper sugar positioning in the active site region. The mode of binding of d-xylose to galactose mutarotase is shown in Fig. 8, a andb. The kinetic constants with d-xylose as the substrate are similar to those of glucose and quinovose. The C-4 hydroxyl group of xylose lies within hydrogen bonding distance of His-96 and His-170, which is similar to that observed with quinovose (Fig. 6 b). However, the xylose moiety is “flipped” with respect to quinovose in the active site such that its C-1 hydroxyl group now lies within hydrogen bonding distance of Arg-71, and its C-2 and C-3 hydroxyl groups are anchored to the protein via the carboxylate group of Asp-243. This alternate mode of binding is reflected in the kinetic constants listed in Table III. From the five enzyme-sugar complexes described here, it is apparent that the orientation of the C-4 hydroxyl group dictates the manner in which the ligand is trapped in the crystalline enzyme. Accordingly, when the C-4 hydroxyl group of the sugar is in the “galactose” orientation, the C-1 hydroxyl group orients toward His-96, His-170, and Glu-304, and these sugars of the “galactose family” are the best substrates for the enzyme. Apparently, the hydrogen bond between Arg-71 and the C-4 hydroxyl groups of d-galactose,d-fucose, or l-arabinose serves to steer the sugar into the orientation required for catalysis. In sharp contrast, when the C-4 hydroxyl groups of the sugars are in the “glucose” configuration, the molecules bind in alternate orientations, at least in the crystalline enzyme, and these “non-productive” modes are reflected in the measured kinetic parameters as listed in TableIII.

Armstrong P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12715-12719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αMs are glycoproteins containing ∼1450 residues, and they circulate as 180-kDa monomers, 360-kDa disulfide-bridged dimers, or 720-kDa tetramers non-covalently assembled from two disulfide-bridged dimers (2Sottrup-Jensen L.

Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 191-291Google Scholar). Proteinase binding is initiated by one or more cleavages in an ∼30–60-residue stretch near the middle of the subunit (the bait region) (4Harpel P.C. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 138: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 5Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). This elicits a conformational change that leads to entrapment of the proteinase (5Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The bound proteinase is poorly accessible to high molecular weight substrates and inhibitors, and through rapid clearance of the αM-proteinase complex the αMs play a role in controlling the level of proteolytic activity in the blood and tissues (2Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In many vertebrate species, e.g. man, rat, mouse, and pig, two or three related αMs have been found (3Sottrup-Jensen L. Putnam F.W. 2nd Ed. The Plasma Proteins. 5. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 191-291Google Scholar). Because their sequences differ greatly in their bait regions, each αM probably controls a particular set of proteinases, although information on this is fragmentary (2Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol.

In the set of peptides generated to initiate cDNA cloning (11Sottrup-Jensen L. Borth W. Hall M. Quigley J.P. Armstrong P.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Sci. 1994; 737: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it was observed that residues in several positions were at variance with those predicted from the cDNA (10Iwaki D. Kawabata S.-I. Miura Y. Kato A. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Nielsen K.L. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Limulus α2M used, which was purified from pooled hemolymph, was a mixture of two or more forms. Like most other known αMs, Limulusα2M contains internal thiol esters (13Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When activated during proteinase complex formation, the αM thiol esters rapidly react with nucleophilic groups on the attacking proteinase and other available nucleophiles (14Sottrup-Jensen L. Hansen H.F. Pedersen H.S. Kristensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17727-17737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process results in efficient cross-linking of the proteinase to αMs (15Sottrup-Jensen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, inLimulus α2M covalent proteinase binding is insignificant as the bound proteinase can be released by denaturation (7Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Salvesen G. Fey G.H. Figler N.L. Gonias S.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19426-19431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of trypsin an unusual self-cross-linking reaction within the Limulus α2M dimer contributes to the tight binding of trypsin (17Dolmer K. Husted L.B. Armstrong P.B. Sottrup-Jensen L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Human α2M is the only αM for which complete information on the arrangement of its intrachain and interchain disulfide bridges and positions of Asn-based carbohydrate groups is available (18Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Kristensen T. Wierzbicki D.M. Jones C.M. Lønblad P.B. Magnusson S. Petersen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8318-8327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jensen P.E.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15863-15869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the Cys residue being part of the thiol ester site, the human α2M subunit contains 24 Cys residues of which 22 engage in 11 intrachain bridges and 2 engage in interchain disulfide bridges thereby aligning the two subunits of the α2M dimer in an antiparallel fashion. For vertebrate αMs of known sequence most positions of disulfide bridges can readily be predicted from the data on human α2M. In addition to the Cys residue engaging in thiol ester formation, the Limulusα2M subunit contains 23 Cys residues of which 18 would be expected to form nine disulfide bridges equivalent with those found in human α2M. However, for Limulusα2M the pattern of disulfide bridges is ambiguous with regard to five positions (10Iwaki D. Kawabata S.-I. Miura Y. Kato A. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Nielsen K.L. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Cys residues that have no counterpart in human α2M are located at positions 360, 381, 719, 1370, and 1434. Because no free −SH groups can be detected in native Limulus α2M, they are all likely to be paired, and importantly, the two subunits of theLimulus α2M dimer must be connected by an uneven number of interchain bridges in contrast to the human dimer. From the carbohydrate composition given earlier (10Iwaki D. Kawabata S.-I. Miura Y. Kato A. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Nielsen K.L. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) Limulusα2M contains both glucosamine and galactosamine (19.4 and 2.9 residues/mol subunit, respectively). As galactosamine is not present in human α2M and probably other mammalian αMs, it was also of interest to locate the carbohydrate groups inLimulus α2M. Limulusα2M contains seven candidate Asn residues for attachment of glucosamine-based glycan groups (Asn80, Asn275, Asn307, Asn866, Asn896, Asn1089, and Asn1145 (10Iwaki D. Kawabata S.-I. Miura Y. Kato A. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Nielsen K.L. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). In contrast, carbohydrate groups containing galactosamine are frequently bound to Ser and Thr residues which, however, cannot readily be predicted. Here we report the determination of the complete disulfide bridge pattern of Limulus α2M consisting of 11 intrachain bridges and one interchain bridge. Curiously, the single interchain bridge engages a Cys residue located in the bait region. We also report the localization of six Asn residues carrying glucosamine-based carbohydrate groups, and one Asn residue carrying a carbohydrate group containing both glucosamine and galactosamine. We further provide evidence from sequencing of a number of peptides for a second Limulus α2M, the sequence of which differs from that reported earlier (10Iwaki D. Kawabata S.-I. Miura Y. Kato A.

The two forms (Limulus α2M-1 and -2) are most likely present in each animal and can be partially separated by ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q at pH 7.4. Limulusα2M was prepared as reported previously (20Swarnakar S. Asokan R. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 347: 679-685Crossref Google Scholar). Tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, thermolysin, angiotensin II, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, fragment 18–39, were from Sigma. Staphylococcus aureus proteinase was from Miles. Column materials were from Amersham Biosciences, Machery-Nagel, Shandon, The Separations Group, and LC packings.14C-Labeled iodoacetamide (IAA) was from AmershamBiosciences, and standard chemicals were from Sigma, Merck, and Rathburn. Amino acid analysis was performed by cation exchange using established procedures (21Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 789-794PubMed Google Scholar). Automated peptide sequencing and PTH-derivative analysis were carried out as reported (22Sottrup-Jensen L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 187-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed in 10–20 and 20% slab gels using the standard Tris glycine system. Mass spectra were acquired with a Bruker BIFLEX matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight instrument equipped with a 1-m flight tube, a reflector, a 337-nm nitrogen laser, and a 1-GHz digitizer. Thin film matrix surfaces were prepared using the fast evaporation technique from α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in acetone/water (99:1) to 30 μg/μl. A 0.5-μl volume of analyte (0.1–10 pmol/μl) was deposited on the matrix surface and allowed to dry onto the crystals. Spectra were obtained by averaging 20–50 single-shot spectra and calibrated externally by using the calibration constants of angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropic hormone, fragment 18–39. Theoretical protonated masses (MH+) were calculated using the GPMAW program (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). Approximately 30 mg of Limulusα2M was used as starting material for the main digest. SDS-PAGE revealed that almost complete bait region cleavage had occurred during preparation and/or storage, and the material was therefore treated at pH 8.5 with 20 mm IAA to block the thiol group appearing upon thiol ester cleavage. After removal of excess reagent by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25 in 10% formic acid, the material was freeze-dried, redissolved in 70% formic acid, and treated with 50 mg of CNBr for 20 h. After freeze-drying the degraded Limulus α2M was redissolved in 300 μl of formic acid, and 10 volumes of water was added. Addition of aliquots of 5 m NaOH was used to raise the pH of the solution, and at pH 4–5 the solution turned turbid. Precipitation appeared to be complete at pH 7–8. In analytical experiments trypsin or thermolysin was added at pH 4, and digestion was attempted after raising the pH to 7–8. HPLC experiments showed only extensive degradation with thermolysin. Therefore, to a solution of ∼18 mg of CNBr-degraded Limulusα2M 1:50 (w/w) thermolysin was added at pH 4 and the pH subsequently raised to 7 by addition of Tris. After incubation for 90 min at 55 °C with stirring, the suspension had nearly cleared. To separate the larger carbohydrate-containing and disulfide peptides from the small peptides, the digest was fractionated on a Superdex peptide column using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 25% acetonitrile as eluent. The column effluent was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and by determining the amount of cysteic acid and amino sugars in each fraction after performic acid oxidation and amino acid analysis (not shown). Two pools, one containing all carbohydrate peptides and the larger disulfide peptides and one containing the small disulfide peptides, were made. Half of each pool was separated by RP-HPLC on an 8 × 250-mm column packed with Nucleosil C18 using elution with gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Fig.1, A and B). Cys- and carbohydrate-containing peptides were located as above by performic acid oxidation and amino acid analysis of aliquots from each fraction combined in pairs. Pools of interest were subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a 4 × 250-mm LC-SCX column using gradient elution with NaCl in 5 mm phosphoric acid, 25% acetonitrile (23Crimmins D.L. Thoma R.S. McCourt D.W. Schwartz B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Usually 4–10 components appeared (not shown), and Cys- and carbohydrate-containing peptides were located as above. In a number of cases ion exchange pools required a further RP-HPLC step on a 4 × 125 mm column packed with Hypersil C18 before unambiguous identification of the content could be made by amino acid and sequence analysis. Evidence for two disulfide bridges and the localization of carbohydrate at two potential positions were lacking from the main digest. A preparation of Limulusα2M (containing intact subunits) was treated with methylamine and IAA and dialyzed into 10 mm phosphoric acid. From inspection of the sequences around the positions where peptide evidence was missing, trypsin was chosen to possibly generate a set of fairly large peptides that might relatively easily be separated from the bulk of smaller peptides. When aliquots of 1 mTris were added to raise the pH, the solution turned turbid at pH 4–5 as seen before, followed by extensive precipitation above pH 7. However, SDS-PAGE consistently showed the generation of a set of species between ∼15 and 28 kDa when 1:50 (w/w) trypsin was added at pH 4 and digestion allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 24 h at pH 6.5 (not shown). Upon electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride and sequence analysis, the relevant peptides were found to be present in the 15–28-kDa species of the digest. On a preparative scale 4-mg portions of Limulusα2M digested with trypsin as above were subjected to gel chromatography on Superdex 75. In one experiment the separation was done using 10 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.5 (Fig. 2 A). Although a major part of the larger species of the unfractionated digest was lost by adsorption to the column matrix and could only be recovered by subsequent elution with 6 m guanidinium chloride, the soluble material upon subsequent digestion of the materials in pools 1 and 2 with S. aureus proteinase and RP-HPLC separation (not shown) provided peptides giving evidence for the position of the two remaining carbohydrate groups. The material eluted with guanidinium chloride as described above was desalted and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Upon electroblotting and sequence analysis a major 26–28-kDa doublet species containing two N termini was found to cover the stretches where the missing two disulfide bridges must be located. However, in subsequent manipulations the material was lost. An additional preparative tryptic digest as above was then subjected to gel chromatography on Superdex 75 using 50% formic as solvent (Fig. 2 B). The relevant material eluted in the void volume (horizontal bar in Fig. 2 B), together with other fragments, and was digested with 1:20 (w/w)S. aureus proteinase at pH 7 for 2 h. RP-HPLC separation showed fair digestion (Fig.3 A). Upon subsequent digestion of one particular fragment set (horizontal bar in Fig.3 A) with chymotrypsin and RP-HPLC separation (Fig.3 B), unambiguous assignment of the two disulfide bridges present could be made from peptides present in the section of the chromatogram labeled with a horizontal bar. In most cases the evidence for assigning the disulfide bridges was based on the amino acid composition of performic acid-oxidized relatively short pure peptides and sequence analysis of intact peptides. No peptides contained an internal disulfide bridge, and two sequences in near equimolar yield were seen, occasionally on a background of several minor irrelevant components. In cases where Cys2 was released after less than 5–8 cycles of Edman degradation, bis-PTH-Cys2 was normally seen in the RP-HPLC analysis of the PTH-derivatives eluting as a low yield peak near PTH-Tyr (24Bendixen E. Halkier T. Magnusson S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Kristensen T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3611-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); after more than 8 cycles no signal was observed. When performed, mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the assignment based on sequence analysis. However, in two cases MS provided the full evidence for assignment. The evidence for locating carbohydrate groups to particular positions was based on the presence of glucosamine (and in one case also galactosamine) in hydrolysates coupled with the lack of a PTH-derivative when encountering Asn residues located in the sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr (Xaa not Pro). Prior to this experiment Limulus α2M was treated with methylamine and IAA. By using 8 mm mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESA) at pH 8.0 for 20 min, the interchain disulfide bridge(s) in the Limulus α2M dimer could be reduced to an extent of >90% as evaluated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (not shown). Methylamine-reacted Limulus α2M (30 mg, 4 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) reduced with MESA was freed of MESA by gel chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated and eluted with degassed 20 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.5. The pH of the Limulusα2M solution was then raised to 9.0 by addition of Tris, and 50 μCi of 14C-labeled IAA was added. After reacting for 30 min the solution was made 20 mm in unlabeled IAA and allowed to react for a further 30 min. Then the excess reagents were separated from Limulus α2M by a second round of gel chromatography using 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, as eluent, and the protein was subsequently freeze-dried. The labeled protein was redissolved in 2 ml of 6 mguanidinium chloride; the pH was adjusted to 9.0 by addition of Tris, and dithioerythritol was added to 10 mm to fully reduceLimulus α2M. After reduction for 30 min IAA was added to 30 mm, and after 30 min of reaction the reduced and carboxamidomethylated protein was recovered by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-25 using 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 as eluent. The preparation was digested with 1:50 (w/w) trypsin for 3 h at 37 °C, and after acidification with trifluoroacetic acid the digest was separated by RP-HPLC on an 8 × 250-mm column packed with Nucleosil C18 using gradient elution with acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Fig.4). Then the fractions containing radioactivity was located by scintillation counting, and the major peptides were further purified by RP-HPLC on a column of Hypersil C18 or by cation exchange chromatography as above (not shown). One mg of Limulusα2M was treated with ∼2 mg of CNBr in 70% formic acid for 20 h at room temperature. After drying the degraded material was redissolved in 500 μl of 6 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and reduced for 30 min with 10 mm dithiothreitol. The peptide solution was then acidified with trifluoroacetic acid and loaded on a 4.6 × 250-mm Vydac C4 column equilibrated with 4.5% 2-propanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted with a gradient of 2-propanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Fig. 5), and the bait region peptides of ∼13 and 18 kDa corresponding to each form ofLimulus α2M were identified by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing of samples blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. From these experiments a 32-residue stretch containing the bait region of Limulus α2M-2 was determined. Hemolymph (80- and 100-ml samples) was separately drawn from two animals and processed as described earlier (20Swarnakar S. Asokan R. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 347: 679-685Crossref Google Scholar). Five mg of material depleted in hemocyanin and pentraxin was subjected to gel chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. TheLimulus α2M containing fractions near the void volume of the column were pooled and loaded on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with the above Tris buffer and eluted with a shallow gradient of NaCl. Two partially separated peaks appeared at [NaCl] = 190 and 220 mm, representing Limulusα2M-2 and -1, respectively (Fig.6). When determining the sequence of Limulusα2M by a combination of peptide sequencing and cDNA cloning (10Iwaki D. Kawabata S.-I. Miura Y. Kato A. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Nielsen K.L. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found a number of positions in which residues deviating from those determined from the cDNA sequence were present. As detailed below additional partial peptide sequence information has been obtained that does not conform with the sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence. In fact, the preparation ofLimulus α2M used for analysis is a mixture of two closely related forms, α2M-1 representing the published sequence (10Iwaki D. Kawabata S.-I. Miura Y. Kato A. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Nielsen K.L. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and α2M-2 representing the set of deviating partial sequences. In order to localize the glycosylation sites and disulfide bridges inLimulus α2M, a digest of Limulusα2M termed the main digest was made. FirstLimulus α2M, which had been treated with IAA, was degraded with CNBr with the aim of generating a limited number of relatively large peptide clusters which could then be further enzymatically digested. However, in contrast to human α2M (25Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Jones C.M. Lønblad P.B. Kristensen T. Wierzbicki D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8293-8303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most of the material appeared in one large cluster. Subsequent digestion of the material with trypsin was unsuccessful due to limited solubility at pH 7–8, but treatment with thermolysin brought most of the material into solution. Upon gel chromatography on a Superdex peptide column, the effluent was divided into two pools, one consisting of the large peptides including those containing carbohydrate (pool A) and one consisting of the small peptides (pool B) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The material in each pool was subjected to RP-HPLC (Fig. 1, A and B). In a few cases the material in the fractions obtained after RP-HPLC was of sufficient purity to allow assignment of the disulfide bridges and to locate the sites of carbohydrate attachment by compositional and sequence analysis. In general, the RP-HPLC pools made on the basis of their content of half-cystine and amino sugars were further separated by cation exchange chromatography (not shown). Because no peptide material could be isolated from the main digest in sufficient purity to assign two particular disulfide bridges, and because evidence for localizing two carbohydrate groups was ambiguous, an ancillary digest was investigated. By using carefully controlled conditions, tryptic digestion of Limulusα2M produced material which upon separation (Fig. 2,A and B) and further digestion provided the relevant peptides to complete the carbohydrate localization and bridge assignment. The evidence for the location of carbohydrate groups to Asn residues is summarized in Table I. As seen in Fig.1 A glucosamine was present in many fractions in the elution profile, whereas galactosamine was only present in fractions 163–180. The major component in these fractions was a peptide with the N-terminal sequence LYANGS (77–82) apparently containing both glucosamine and galactosamine. In subjecting the material in these fractions to lectin affinity chromatography on concanavalin A and Jacalin-Sepharose to possibly separate the glucosamine- and galactosamine-containing peptides, the material was lost. However, from subdigestion of material from the ancillary digest (pool 2in Fig. 2 A) the peptide LYANGSYSSPSSNDFFFE containing both amino sugars was isolated. Upon chymotryptic digestion of this peptide, it was established by amino acid analysis that the peptide LYANGSY contained both amino sugars, whereas the peptide SSPSSNDF contained none. Sequence analysis of the former peptide revealed that no PTH-Asn was present in cycle 4 and that PTH-Ser was present in normal amounts in step 6. Hence, it can be concluded that Asn80 carries a glycan containing both glucosamine and galactosamine.Table ISummary of evidence for location of carbohydrate groups to Asn residuesPosition of glycosylated Asn-residuePeptide/peptide setPresent in poolVariants80LYANGSYSSPSSNDFFFEaThe peptides were obtained by digestion with S. aureus proteinase of the large fragments present in pool 1 and 2 in the separation shown in Fig.2 A.LYANGSY … (A162–180)275VTVNSA100VTVNSSA … (A109–120)307NATDSA26–28IKMNATDS (A46–49)866GEKVPII … (833–853) bound to MQN"

Van Obberghen E. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the case of integrins, the cytoskeletal proteins talin and α-actinin have been proposed to be responsible for their anchoring to microvilli (14Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This anchoring accounts for the poor internalization of such receptors in the absence of their ligand (12Foti M. Phelouzat M.A. Holm A. Rasmusson B.J. Carpentier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On reaching the nonvillous domain of the cell surface, HIR segregates into clathrin-coated pits via two types of motifs present within the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic tail. The first type are the tyrosine-based motifs, NPEY and GPLY, which are exposed after ligand binding and receptor activation (19Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. Cahill D.A. Ullrich A. White M.F. J. Biol.

The second motif is a dileucine sequence (LL986–987), which does not require activation of the receptor to enable association with clathrin-coated pits and may also associate with AP2 molecules (23Haft C.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated pits pinch off from the cell surface, resulting in endocytosis of the associated receptors (26McPherson P.S. Kay B.K. Hussain N.K. Traffic. 2001; 2: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whereas the processes of association with clathrin-coated pits and endocytosis of HIR are now well understood at the molecular level, little is known about the interactions maintaining the unoccupied receptor on microvilli and the mechanism for its release upon receptor activation. We and others have previously provided evidence that the dileucine motif (LL986–987), in addition to being involved in binding to clathrin-coated pits, is required, although not sufficient, for anchoring to microvilli and that other sequences located downstream of position 1000 are also necessary (24Hamer I. Haft C.R. Paccaud J.P. Maeder C. Taylor S. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21685-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to characterize the exact motif(s) required for anchoring of HIR to microvilli. On the basis of experiments involving the use of chimeric and truncated HIR, we conclude that exon 17 of the molecule (encoding amino acids 966 to 1047) contains all the sequences necessary for anchoring HIR to microvilli. Moreover, in addition to the dileucine motif LL986–987 described previously, the amino acid sequence extending between position 1000 and 1012 plays a key role in this anchoring, and a diisoleucine motif (II1006–1007) present within these 12 amino acids is of particular importance. These two dileucine-like motifs (LL986–987 and II1006–1007), which in the three-dimensional structure of HIR are in close vicinity, may participate in or form together a domain involved in the binding of HIR to cytoskeletal elements. Chimeric receptors were constructed in two steps. First, cDNAs encoding the whole cytoplasmic domain or fragments corresponding to exon 16 or 17 of the HIR were amplified by PCR usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the HIR cDNA as template, and oligonucleotide primers to incorporateAflII and BglII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The resulting PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases and cloned into pCR1-wt, a plasmid described previously (27Paccaud J.P. Reith W. Johansson B. Magnusson K.E. Mach B. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23191-23196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hamer I. Paccaud J.P. Belin D. Maeder C. Carpentier J.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), so as to introduce the HIR fragments in-frame with the sequence coding for the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CR1. To introduce the alanine substitution of the dileucine at position 986–987 in the HIR cDNA (AA1), the plasmid pBPV-HIR AA1 (23Haft C.R. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template in the above-mentioned procedures. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HIR truncation mutants were created by PCR amplification using a forward primer (HIR-AvrII, 5′-CCGAGGACCCTAGGCCATCTCG-3′) to incorporate the unique AvrII restriction enzyme site and reverse primers to incorporate a stop codon and SalI restriction enzyme site immediately 3′ to the last codon of each truncation to be made. After restriction enzyme digestion, each fragment was used to replace the full-length HIRAvrII-SalI fragment in pSP64 (Promega). The entire cDNA was then excised and cloned into the expression vector pCIneo (Promega). HIR-AA2, -AA3, and -AA4 mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis involving two steps of PCR. Two PCR fragments were produced, overlapping at the site of the mutation. The first product was amplified using HIR-AvrII, described above, and a reverse primer to introduce the mutation (AA2, 5′-GCAATGCCAGGGACGCCGCCAAGGGTGAGGCA-3′; AA3, 5′-GGACACCACTCCCGCGGCGCGCACCACGTG-3′; AA4, 5′-CTGGCCCTTGGACGCCGCTCCCAGGAGGCG-3′; mutated bases are in bold). The second product was amplified using a forward primer that was the reverse of the mutant primers described above and a reverse primer to incorporate a BstXI site (HIR-BstXI, 5′-AGGATTATTCTCAGCCTCTCC-3′). The two products were combined, and a second PCR was performed upon them using the outer primers HIR-AvrII and HIR-BstXI. The resulting product was digested with AvrII and BstXI and used to replace the wild-type sequence of pSP64 containing theEcoRI-SalI fragment of HIR. ThisEcoRI-SalI fragment was then excised and cloned into pCIneo-HIR. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were seeded onto 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with either a mixture of 1 μg of pRSV-Neo and 5 μg of pCR1-HIR chimeric constructs or 10 μg of pCI-HIR constructs. After selection for resistance to the antibiotic G418 (Invitrogen), stable transfectants were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, as described previously (24Hamer I. Haft C.R. Paccaud J.P. Maeder C. Taylor S. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21685-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression was verified by measuring the binding of a monoclonal antibody (3D9) against CR1 (29Madi N. Paccaud J.P. Steiger G. Schifferli J.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 84: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) labeled with [125I]iodine (AmershamBiosciences) using IODO-GEN (Pierce). To study the internalization of chimeric receptors in CHO cells, we used the whole IgG or Fab fragments of 3D9 labeled with [125I]iodine. Fab fragments were produced by papain digestion and purified on an immobilized protein A column (Pierce). Confluent CHO cells, grown in 35-mm Petri dishes, were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in 1 ml of CHO buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm glucose, and 1% bovine serum albumin) containing a tracer amount of 125I-labeled antibody (IgG or Fab fragments). Cells were then warmed at 37 °C for various periods of time. At each time point studied, the incubation medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then subjected to three 5-min washes with 3 ml of the same buffer (but at pH 1.5) to remove the ligands present at the cell surface. Finally, cells were lysed with 1 ml of 1 N NaOH for 15 min. Acid washes and solubilized cells were counted in a gamma counter. Results were expressed as the percentage of radioactivity remaining associated with the cells at the end of the acid washes versus total radioactivity (radioactivity recovered in the acid washes and in solubilized cells). Values obtained after 2 h at 4 °C were subtracted from values calculated at all times points at 37 °C. Cell monolayers were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of 1 ml of CHO buffer containing a tracer amount of 125I-labeled 3D9 mAb (IgG). Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, fixed, dehydrated, processed for electron microscope (EM) autoradiography, and quantified as described previously (30Carpentier J.L. Gorden P. Amherdt M. Van Obberghen E. Kahn C.R. Orci L. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1056-1070Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For each clone studied, two separate experiments were performed, three Epon blocks were prepared, and three sections were cut from each block. For each condition, 2000 grains within a distance of 250 nm from the plasma membrane were analyzed. Grains were considered to be associated with microvilli if their center was <250 nm from these surface domains (18Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.L. Gorden P. Van Obberghen E. Blackett N.M. Grunfeld C. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7788-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that, in addition to the dileucine motif at position 986–987, (LL986–987), sequences C-terminal to amino acid 1000 are required for maintaining the unoccupied HIR on microvilli (24Hamer I. Haft C.R. Paccaud J.P. Maeder C. Taylor S. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21685-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To delimit the cytoplasmic domain involved in this anchoring to a specific exon and evaluate the role of this potential domain in the absence of other HIR domains, we produced chimeric receptors (Fig.1) by fusing individual exons encoding the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain of HIR to the exoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CR1, a receptor previously shown to lack any preferential association with specific domains of the cell surface (31Paccaud J.P. Siddle K. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13101-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These chimeric receptors were then stably expressed into CHO cells. Anchoring to microvilli prevents the HIR from gaining access to endocytic gates that form only on planar membranes. Internalization of the HIR via clathrin-coated pits is thus directly correlated with the propensity of the receptor to leave microvilli (32Carpentier J.L. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We measured the ability of the chimera to internalize by an acid wash procedure after tagging of cell surface-expressed chimeric molecules with125I-labeled anti-CR1 antibody (3D9). When exon 16 (which includes the two tyrosine-based internalization motifs) was present as cytoplasmic domain (CR1-HIRex16), a rapid and sustained internalization of the chimeric molecule was observed, reaching maximal values of 32%. By contrast, in the presence of exon 17 alone (CR1-HIRex17), internalization of the chimeric molecule was significantly reduced (Fig. 2 A), despite presence of the dileucine motif LL986–987 that plays a key role in association with clathrin-coated pits (23Haft C.R. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hamer I. Haft C.R. Paccaud J.P. Maeder C. Taylor S. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21685-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using either the whole anti-CR1 antibody or its Fab fragments (Fig. 2, A and B); therefore, all further experiments were carried out using only the whole antibody. To determine whether the internalization defect of CR1-HIRex17 is related to a reduced access to the internalization gates due to the fact that this chimeric receptor is maintained on microvilli, we analyzed the ability of the chimeric molecules to associate with microvilli. Quantitative EM autoradiographic analysis revealed no preferential association of 125I-labeled anti-CR1 with microvilli in cells expressing CR1-HIRex16 (Fig.3). In contrast, in cells expressing CR1-HIRex17, more than 70% of the autoradiographic grains were associated with microvilli. Because ∼50% of the cell surface is occupied by microvilli, these observations indicate that CR1-HIRex17 exhibits preferential association with microvilli and suggest that the sequence motif(s) required for association of HIR with microvilli is (are) located within exon 17. Because exon 17 includes a dileucine motif (LL986–987) that plays a role at different stages of HIR internalization, the role of this dileucine motif was further investigated in the present experimental system. The substitution of these two leucines for alanines in a chimeric receptor carrying exon 17 of HIR as cytoplasmic domain (CR1-HIRex17-AA1) resulted in only a slight increase in the rate of internalization of the receptor when compared with the internalization of receptors carrying the wild-type exon 17 sequence (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, this mutation caused a drastic reduction in the level of association of the receptor with microvilli (Fig. 4 B), confirming the requirement for LL986–987 in the association of HIR with microvilli. The small increase in the level of internalization of CR1-HIRex17-AA1 highlights once more the importance of LL986–987 for the segregation of the receptor into clathrin-coated pits. To further delineate the sequence motif contained within exon 17 that is required for the anchoring of HIR to microvilli and to test the physiological relevance of the experiments carried out with chimeric molecules, three truncations mutants of the wild-type HIR molecule were produced terminating at positions 1000 (HIR-Δ1000), 1012 (HIR-Δ1012), and 1047 (HIR-Δ1047), respectively (Fig. 1). These constructs were stably expressed in CHO cells. The level of internalization of these truncated receptors was measured in the absence of insulin using 125I-labeled anti-HIR antibody 83-14 as a tag. This antibody has been shown not to activate HIR (31Paccaud J.P. Siddle K. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13101-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously, the constitutive internalization of HIR-Δ1000 was rapid and of similar magnitude to the internalization recorded for the wild-type receptor in the presence of insulin (Ref. 24Hamer I. Haft C.R. Paccaud J.P. Maeder C. Taylor S. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21685-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar; Fig. 5). In contrast to HIR-Δ1000, HIR-Δ1012 and HIR-Δ1047 exhibited a low level of internalization, almost reduced to those observed for the constitutive internalization of wild-type HIRs (Fig. 5). In terms of association with microvilli, an inverse correlation with the internalization data was observed: receptors with a high degree of internalization (HIR-Δ1000) displayed a poor association with microvilli, whereas those with a low degree of internalization (HIR-Δ1012 and HIR-Δ1047) exhibited a preferential association with microvilli (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the sequence(s) required for anchoring of HIR to microvilli is (are) located between amino acids 1000 and 1012. The 12-amino acid stretch extending between positions 1000 and 1012 contains a diisoleucine motif at position 1006–1007. Analogous motifs have been shown to be involved in various steps of receptor trafficking, including association with microvilli and segregation into clathrin-coated pits, and in intracellular sorting (23Haft C.R. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hamer I. Haft C.R. Paccaud J.P. Maeder C. Taylor S. Carpentier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21685-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33–49). To determine whether the diisoleucine motif plays a role in anchoring to microvilli, alanine substitution of the two isoleucines (HIR-AA2) was performed. As shown in Fig. 7, the constitutive internalization of this mutated receptor was significantly increased. Similar results were obtained when the receptor was tagged with125I-insulin (Fig. 7). The association of HIR-AA2 with microvilli in the absence of insulin was measured after a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with125I-labeled anti-HIR antibody 83-14. The level of association was significantly lower than that observed for wild-type HIR and similar to values obtained for HIR truncated at position 1000 (37–38%) (Figs. 6 and 8), indicating that in addition to dileucine LL986–987, II1006–1007 is required for binding of HIR to microvilli. As a control, other dileucine-type motifs present downstream of position 1007 were analyzed for their ability to participate in anchoring to microvilli. As illustrated in Fig. 8, neither the two leucines at position 1050–1051 (HIR-AA3) nor the two valines at position 1053–1054 (HIR-AA4) had any influence on the anchoring of HIR in its unoccupied form with microvilli. In the present study, we provide evidence demonstrating that specific amino acid sequences within the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain of HIR mediate association of the inactivated receptors with plasma membrane protrusions called microvilli. Observation of the trafficking and surface distribution of a panel of chimeric and truncated HIR molecules allowed us to determine that exon 17 of HIR (amino acids 966 to 1047) contains all the determinants mediating anchoring to microvilli. Generation of chimeric and truncated HIR mutants established that in addition to a previously characterized dileucine motif, LL986–987, the integrity of another dileucine-like motif (II1006–1007) located 20 amino acids downstream of LL986–987 is crucial for association of HIR with villous structures. The two motifs are necessary for HIR anchoring to microvilli, but each one is not sufficient by itself to fulfill the function. The two motifs have no additive function and, due to their close proximity, may participate in or form an anchoring site. An increasing amount of data is accumulating to indicate that villous protrusions of the plasma membrane concentrate transmembrane proteins involved in processes such as adhesion and signaling (7Carpentier J.L.

However, the functional relevance of this localization and the mechanisms mediating the sorting of proteins to these plasma membrane domains are still unclear. In the case of HIR, such localization may favor the binding of soluble circulating ligands and therefore might represent a particular cell surface domain involved in receptor signaling. Recent data support this hypothesis because mutated HIR with a defect in ligand-induced internalization (where the receptors remain on microvilli and do not redistribute in response to insulin binding) transduces most insulin metabolic signals"
