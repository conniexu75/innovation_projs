https://openalex.org/W1975859486,"Deposition of the major histone H3 (H3.1) is coupled to DNA synthesis during DNA replication and possibly DNA repair, whereas histone variant H3.3 serves as the replacement variant for the DNA-synthesis-independent deposition pathway. To address how histones H3.1 and H3.3 are deposited into chromatin through distinct pathways, we have purified deposition machineries for these histones. The H3.1 and H3.3 complexes contain distinct histone chaperones, CAF-1 and HIRA, that we show are necessary to mediate DNA-synthesis-dependent and -independent nucleosome assembly, respectively. Notably, these complexes possess one molecule each of H3.1/H3.3 and H4, suggesting that histones H3 and H4 exist as dimeric units that are important intermediates in nucleosome formation. This finding provides new insights into possible mechanisms for maintenance of epigenetic information after chromatin duplication."

This precludes single cell or real time studies of changes in redox poise that result from metabolic processes or environmental influences. By substitution of surface-exposed residues on the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) with cysteines in appropriate positions to form disulfide bonds, reduction-oxidation-sensitive GFPs (roGFPs) have been created. roGFPs have two fluorescence excitation maxima at about 400 and 490 nm and display rapid and reversible ratiometric changes in fluorescence in response to changes in ambient redox potential in vitro and in vivo. Crystal structure analyses of reduced and oxidized crystals of roGFP2 at 2.0- and 1.9-Å resolution, respectively, reveal in the oxidized state a highly strained disulfide and localized main chain structural changes that presumably account for the state-dependent spectral changes. roGFP1 has been targeted to the mitochondria in HeLa cells. Fluorometric measurements on these cells using a fluorescence microscope or in cell suspension using a fluorometer reveal that the roGFP1 probe is in dynamic equilibrium with the mitochondrial redox status and responds to membrane-permeable reductants and oxidants. The roGFP1 probe reports that the matrix space in HeLa cell mitochondria is highly reducing, with a midpoint potential near -360 mV (assuming mitochondrial pH ∼8.0 at 37 °C). In other work (C. T. Dooley, T. M. Dore, G. Hanson, W. C. Jackson, S. J. Remington, and R. Y. Tsien, submitted for publication), it is shown that the cytosol of HeLa cells is also unusually reducing but somewhat less so than the mitochondrial matrix.

Most metabolic reactions in cells take place in reducing compartments such as the mitochondria or cytoplasm. This is presumably because critical thiol groups and other key catalytic elements of enzyme active sites must be protected against oxidation. Protein disulfide bonds are rarely found in such environments. On the other hand, normal cell function requires that some compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes, be oxidizing. This is essential for the proper folding and function of proteins destined for export, which frequently contain disulfide bridges.Much has recently been learned regarding the mechanisms responsible for homeostasis of redox status in certain subcellular compartments. In yeast, the formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum utilizes conserved Ero1p (2Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol.

In addition, the disulfide exchange component protein-disulfide isomerase ensures formation of the correct disulfides (6Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) (for reviews, see Refs. 7Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, a thioredoxin-like family of enzymes catalyzes the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds in proteins via highly specific disulfide exchange reactions (9Debarbieux L. Beckwith J. Cell. 1999; 99: 117-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In all cells, small molecules capable of thiol-disulfide exchange like GSH are abundant and were previously thought to act as redox buffers, but this hypothesis has been disproved. For example, in the protein export pathway, GSH actually competes with protein thiols for oxidizing equivalents (8Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary role of small thiols may be one of defense against oxidants and other deleterious compounds (for reviews, see Refs. 2Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 11Dickinson D.A. Forman H.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Microbiol. 2001; 2001: 21-48Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar).Where required, the general mechanisms responsible for redox homeostasis may also be co-opted for other diverse processes such as apoptosis, disease, oxidative defense mechanisms, allosteric control of enzyme activity, and a variety of signal transduction pathways. For example, oxidative events have been implicated in activating the mitochondrial permeability transition, leading to cytochrome c release and cell death (13Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Chernyak B.V. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Hall A.G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 29: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Changes of the cellular oxidation potential have been suggested to be a final step in the apoptotic process leading to degradation of apoptotic bodies (16Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1999; 31: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Soluble, short lived, and reactive species such as peroxides (17Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kwon J.

Cell Biochem. 2002; 234: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) are now recognized to be second messengers that can directly modulate the activity of target proteins as well as indirectly couple cellular responses to external events. These processes can result in the nitrosylation or oxidation of specific cysteine residues on a target protein to one of several possible states, directly modulating the activity of target. Signal transduction mechanisms involving such oxidative modifications are now recognized to rival protein phosphorylation in significance.Given the importance of and general interest in cellular redox processes, a noninvasive method for reporting redox changes within living cells is highly desirable. Until now, no general approach for nondestructive readout of redox status has been available. Whereas several methods of determining in vivo redox status have been proposed, all have serious limitations. Most techniques require cells to be harvested before their contents can be analyzed. For example, several attempts have been made to directly measure the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione, which is with few exceptions the most abundant nonprotein thiol in eukaryotic cells (20Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). This ratio has been found to range from 1:1 to 3:1 in the secretory pathway, and in total cellular material it has been found to range from 100:1 to 300:1. Whereas these results point to dramatic differences in redox poise within compartments, with such an approach it is of course impossible to monitor redox changes within the same cell over a period of time. Keese et al. (21Keese M.A. Saffrich R. Dandekar T. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) proposed an alternative procedure in which crystals of the enzyme glutathione reductase are microinjected into the cytosol of human fibroblasts. By detection of color changes in the crystals, they were able to determine the redox potential of the cytosol to be more reducing than -0.270 V. Whereas this method may allow redox status determination within single living cells, it is cumbersome.Indicators that give visual response to changes in dynamic redox status can be constructed from the green fluorescent protein (GFP), 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; roGFP, redox-sensitive GFP; DTT, dithiothreitol; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; roGFP, redox-sensitive GFP; DTT, dithiothreitol; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. which has become a popular tool for molecular labeling in vivo (for reviews, see Refs. 22Tsien R.Y.

Rev. 2002; 102: 759-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). GFP is most often used as a passive indicator of gene expression and protein localization, but variants have been constructed that act as indicators of intracellular concentrations of H+, Ca2+, and halide ions (25Kneen M.

The key properties of GFP are efficient fluorescence, protease resistance, and stability throughout a wide range of pH and solvent conditions. Moreover, GFP can be targeted to specific organelles within the host cell, permitting conditions at localized areas to be monitored in a single cell over a period of time.An indicator for redox status can be constructed from GFP by introduction of redox-reactive groups into the protein, at locations where a change in the oxidation state of the introduced group(s) would modify the fluorescent properties. Ostergaard et al. (33Ostergaard H. Henriksen A. Hansen F.G. Winther J.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) introduced pairs of cysteines onto the surface of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (34Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) in appropriate locations to form disulfide bridges in an oxidizing environment. The indicators, designated rxYFPNM (where N and M indicate the locations of introduced cysteines) were successfully expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and were shown to respond, by changes in fluorescence intensity, to membrane-permeable redox agents 4,4′-dithiodipyridine and dithiothreitol (DTT). The indicators also responded to mutational disruption of the trxB gene, which codes for the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase and is partially responsible for the reducing state of the cytoplasm. Although the results of these efforts are promising, rxYFPNM redox probes suffer from several limitations. Because only the intensity of fluorescence is affected by disulfide bond formation, the probes are not ratiometric and would be difficult to calibrate (32Hanson G.T. McAnaney T.B. Park E.S. Rendell M. Yarbrough D.K. Chu S. Xi L. Boxer S.G. Montrose M.H. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15477-15488Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 35Grynkiewicz G. Martin P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A further complication arises from the fact that YFP fluorescence is quenched by a low concentration of halides and other small anions (36Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R628-R629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D. Kallio K. Remington S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Here, we describe the independent development and preliminary application of several GFP-based indicators of redox status. The indicators are ratiometric by excitation, which reduces or eliminates measurement errors resulting from changes of indicator concentration, photobleaching, and variable cell thickness. Directed substitution of cysteine residues at selected surface sites in the vicinity of the GFP chromophore but upon different GFP backgrounds resulted in indicators with apparent midpoint potentials in the range -0.27 to -0.29 V. We term these probes redox-sensitive GFPs (roGFPs).Analysis of the oxidized and reduced crystal structures of roGFP2 verified reversible formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge and revealed an oxidation-dependent strain in the polypeptide backbone that may account for the observed spectral changes. Using cultured mammalian cells expressing roGFP1 in the mitochondria, we show that the probe reversibly reports redox changes in response to application of membrane-permeable oxidizing and reducing agents. Measurements were conducted on single cells using a fluorescence microscope and with cell suspensions in an ordinary fluorometer with comparable results. After correcting for the estimated pH (∼8.0) of the mitochondria, the in vivo results suggest that the redox potential of resting mitochondria in HeLa cells is near -360 mV.MATERIALS AND METHODSStructure-based Design of Redox-sensitive GFP Variants—roGFP indicators were designed with the concept that cross-links between pairs of surface-exposed cysteine residues may induce structural strain in the protein. For locations close to the chromophore, modifications of the chromophore environment can be expected to result in changes in the fluorescence excitation or emission properties. To prevent undesirable cross-link formation, we attempted to replace the two cysteines present in wild-type GFP at positions 48 and 70 (38Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 11: 229-233Crossref Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) by serine and alanine, respectively. The substitution of Cys70 proved to be deleterious to obtaining soluble, fluorescent protein, so the C48S construct was used as the background in most cases. Candidate sites for introduction of potential disulfide pairs were selected by visual inspection of the atomic model for S65T GFP (34Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1EMA) for surface locations with approximately the required separation and orientation for formation of a disulfide linkage (39Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N.B.S. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 40Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Levitt M. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The two sets of sites reported in this work included Ser147 and Gln204 (roGFP1 and -2; see Table I) and Asn149 and Ser202 (roGFP3 and -4), each flanking His148. The single-cysteine variants were created on either pseudo-wild type background (C48S/Q80R) or (C48S/Q80R/S65T), and their properties were investigated before construction of the double cysteine substitutions. Finally, the double disulfide variant was constructed (roGFP5 and -6) with and without the S65T mutation.Table ISpectroscopic excitation ratios and redox equilibrium properties of roGFPsVariantaVariants in this column also contain the two phenotypically neutral substitutions C48S and Q80R.IDKeqbEquilibrium constant (Keq) values are given for the reaction roGFPred + DTTox roGFPox + DTTred (see exception below for lipoic acid in Footnote f).E0'cE0' values are for pH 7 and 30°C.δdThe dynamic range value (δ) is the maximum observed δ-fold change in excitation peak ratio.VS147C/Q204CroGFP10.070−0.2886.1eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.S147C/Q204CfValues estimated by titration against lipoic acid (assumed midpoint potential, −290 mV), average of two experiments.roGFP10.83fValues estimated by titration against lipoic acid (assumed midpoint potential, −290 mV), average of two experiments.−0.2874.5eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.S147C/Q204C/S65TroGFP20.021−0.2725.8gMeasured at 490 and 400 nm.N149C/S202CroGFP30.151−0.2994.3eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.N149C/S202C/S65TroGFP40.056−0.2862.6gMeasured at 490 and 400 nm.S147C/Q204C/N149C/S202CroGFP50.134−0.2967.8eMeasured at 475 and 400 nm.S147C/Q204C/N149C/S202C/S65TroGFP60.039−0.2805.4gMeasured at 490 and 400 nm.a Variants in this column also contain the two phenotypically neutral substitutions C48S and Q80R.b Equilibrium constant (Keq) values are given for the reaction roGFPred + DTTox roGFPox + DTTred (see exception below for lipoic acid in Footnote f).c E0' values are for pH 7 and 30°C.d The dynamic range value (δ) is the maximum observed δ-fold change in excitation peak ratio.e Measured at 475 and 400 nm.f Values estimated by titration against lipoic acid (assumed midpoint potential, −290 mV), average of two experiments.g Measured at 490 and 400 nm. Open table in a new tab Gene Construction and Protein Expression—Mutations were introduced via the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequencing of the entire GFP coding sequence verified all mutations. Mutations were initially introduced into a His-tagged version of wild-type (Q80R) GFP in the plasmid pRSETB. For expression in mammalian cells, the mutations C48S/T65S/S147C/Q204C (which contains S65T) and C48S/S147C/Q204C (roGFP1 and -2) were introduced into the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) containing in addition the leader sequence of the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase for mitochondrial targeting (a gift of R. M. Brown and G. K. Brown, University of Oxford). The resulting plasmid also contained the so-called “folding mutation” F64L, which seems to improve the efficiency of proper folding and chromophore formation in vivo (41Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). To verify that F64L did not significantly alter the properties of roGFPs, the mutation was introduced into the original pRSETB plasmid. In side-by-side experiments, roGFP2 and roGFP2/F64L had indistinguishable spectral and redox properties (data not shown).Mutant protein was expressed in E. coli strain JM109(DE3) by use of the pRSETB expression system with an N-terminal His6 tag. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and sonicated for 7 min. Cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The N-terminal histidine tag was removed by incubation with 1:50 (w/w) γ-chymotrypsin for 20 h at 22 °C. Samples were concentrated by filtration (Centricon 10; Amicon) and buffer-exchanged with PD-10 Sephadex columns (Amersham Biosciences) into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9.Spectroscopy and Redox Titrations—Fluorescence excitation spectra were collected on Hitachi F4500 and PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 fluorescence spectrophotometers at 30 °C. Samples consisted of 1 μm GFP in 75 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm total DTT (mixture of oxidized and reduced forms). To reduce air oxidation, the solutions were degassed and subsequently flushed with nitrogen. Where possible, most solutions were prepared and allowed to equilibrate in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere.In general, equilibrium was obtained within 1 h at pH 7.0. However, the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 4 h to ensure equilibration of the GFP-DTT system. Because the equilibrium constant for the reaction roGFPred + DTTox ↔ roGFPox + DTTred is much less than 1 (see “Results”), the results were checked by performing an alternative titration against reduced and oxidized lipoic acid (10 mm in the above buffer) for roGFP1, as described elsewhere. 2C. T. Dooley, T. M. Dore, G. Hanson, W. C. Jackson, S. J. Remington, and R. Y. Tsien, submitted for publication. The equilibrated reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, which showed no evidence for species corresponding to disulfide-linked dimers (data not shown). Therefore, any disulfides that are formed are intramolecular (see below for crystallographic evidence).Determination of Midpoint Potentials—Apparent redox midpoint potential values for roGFPs were found by exploiting the fact that the fluorescence excitation spectrum of roGFPs is strongly and reversibly dependent upon the redox state of the introduced cysteines. When equilibrated against redox buffers consisting of reduced and oxidized dithiothreitol (DTTred, DTTox) or lipoic acid, fluorescence spectra of roGFPs revealed amplitude changes in the two excitation maxima with a well defined isosbestic point. The redox reaction of the roGFPs with reduced and oxidized DTT could thus be analyzed using a two-state model. The equilibrium for the oxidation of reduced roGFP by DTTox and the corresponding equilibrium constant (Keq) are given by Reaction 1 and Equation 1. roGFPred+DTTox↔roGFPox+DTTredReaction 1 Keq=[roGFPox][DTTred]/[roGFPred][DTTox](Eq. 1) When roGFPs were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of DTTred and DTTox (total DTTred + DTTox = 1 mm), the fractional amount of reduced roGFP at equilibrium (R) could be measured over the whole range from the oxidized to the reduced protein using the chromophore fluorescence. Since SDS-PAGE and crystallography revealed that roGFPs form only intramolecular disulfide bonds, R can be related to Keq by Equation 2 (42Hawkins H.C. De Nardi M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). R=([DTTred]/[DTTox])/(Keq+[DTTred]/[DTTox])(Eq. 2) For experimental determination of the equilibrium constants of the roGFP-dithiothreitol system, the equilibrium concentrations of DTTred and DTTox were calculated according to Equations 3-5. In these expressions, [DTTred o] and [DTTox o] are the initial concentrations of DTTred and DTTox, respectively, R is the fractional amount of reduced roGFP at equilibrium, [roGFPo] is the initial concentration of oxidized roGFP, F is a fluorescence intensity ratio of excitation at 490 nm versus the isosbestic point (425 nm), and Fox and Fred are the 490/425 nm ratios of the completely oxidized and reduced protein, respectively, although any two wavelengths can be chosen. [DTTred]=[DTTred0]-R[roGFP0](Eq. 3) [DTTox]=[DTTox0]-R[roGFP0](Eq. 4) R=(F-Fox)/(Fred-Fox)(Eq. 5) By plotting R against the [DTTred]/[DTTox] ratio and fitting the data to a titration curve according to Equation 2, the Keq for the roGFP/dithiothreitol system could be found. The redox potential of roGFPs at pH 7 and 30 °C ( E0(roGFP)') could then be calculated from the Nernst equation (6Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), where E0' is the biochemist's standard potential of the DTTred/DTTox couple ( E0(DTT)'=-0.323 V, at pH 7 and 30 °C (43Sajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2015Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar)), R is the gas constant (8.315 J K-1 mol-1), T is the absolute temperature (303.15 K), n is the number of transferred electrons (2Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and F is the Faraday constant (9.649 × 104 C mol-1). E0(roGFP)'=E0(DTT)'=(RT/nF)×lnKeq(Eq. 6) Plots and curve fits were made with KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software). For the case of titration against reduced/oxidized lipoate, E0(Lip)'=-0.290 V (44Lees W.J. Whitesides G.M. J. Org.

The pH dependence of the midpoint potential can be seen from the half-reaction of roGFP reduction as follows. roGFPox+2H++2e-↔roGFPredReaction 2 In equilibrium at the midpoint, [roGFPox] = [roGFPred] and Keq = [H+]2. Theoretically, the redox potential of roGFP at 30 °C can thus be calculated from the Nernst equation and E0' at any pH using Equation 7. E0'pH=E0'-60.1mV×(pH-7)(Eq. 7) Ratiometric Measurements—The roGFP probes display two fluorescence excitation maxima whose relative amplitudes depend on the specific mutations but also depend on the state of oxidation. This can be used to make ratiometric measurements (35Grynkiewicz G. Martin P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Tsien R.Y.

Sci. 1986; 11: 450-455Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (355) Google Scholar), which reduce or eliminate dependence on protein concentration, sample path length, photobleaching, and variable source intensity. The in vitro ratios of the excitation maxima were determined in the fluorometer directly from the excitation spectrum at typically 400 and 475 nm (2.5-nm slit width) for roGFP1 or 400 and 490 nm for roGFP2. The dynamic range parameter δ is defined as the ratio of the maximum to minimum values of the excitation ratios, and is useful as a measure of the maximum attainable signal/noise ratio.Crystal Structure Determination—roGFP2/F64L (C48S/F64L/S65T/Q80R/S147C/Q204C) was concentrated to ∼20 mg ml-1 in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) and 0.2-μm-filtered. Flat plate-like crystals grew at room temperature in 1-2 days by hanging drop vapor diffusion against 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 0.07-0.1 m LiSO4, 17-22% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.5 μm CuCl2 (which catalyzes disulfide formation) or 5 mm DTT for the oxidized and reduced crystals, respectively. Drops contained 4 μl of protein solution and 4 μl of well solution. For low temperature diffraction data collection, crystals were exchanged into a solution of 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 0.07-0.1 m LiSO4, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 20% ethylene glycol, and either 0.5 μm CuCl2 or 5 mm DTT.X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single frozen crystal for each redox state at beamline 7-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Data sets were indexed and reduced with MOSFLM (46Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing. 5.

Many drugs currently in use were discovered without knowledge of their underlying molecular mechanisms. Understanding their biological targets and modes of action will be essential to design improved second-generation compounds. Here, we describe the use of a genome-wide pool of tagged heterozygotes to assess the cellular effects of 78 compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically, lanosterol synthase in the sterol biosynthetic pathway was identified as a target of the antianginal drug molsidomine, which may explain its cholesterol-lowering effects. Further, the rRNA processing exosome was identified as a potential target of the cell growth inhibitor 5-fluorouracil. This genome-wide screen validated previously characterized targets or helped identify potentially new modes of action for over half of the compounds tested, providing proof of this principle for analyzing the modes of action of clinically relevant compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2058255168,"The Arabidopsis zygote divides asymmetrically into an embryonic apical cell and a basal cell with mostly extra-embryonic fate. This fundamental asymmetry sets the stage for further embryonic development, but the events mediating it are poorly understood. We have identified a MAPKK kinase gene, named YODA, that promotes extra-embryonic cell fates in the basal lineage. In loss-of-function mutants, the zygote does not elongate properly, and the cells of the basal lineage are eventually incorporated into the embryo instead of differentiating the extra-embryonic suspensor. Gain-of-function alleles cause exaggerated growth of the suspensor and can suppress embryonic development to a degree where no recognizable proembryo is formed. Our results imply that a MAP kinase cascade acts as a molecular switch promoting extra-embryonic fate."
https://openalex.org/W2151683280,"Gene expression is a coordinated multistep process that begins with transcription and RNA processing in the nucleus followed by mRNA export to the cytoplasm for translation. Here we report the identification of a protein, Sus1, which functions in both transcription and mRNA export. Sus1 is a nuclear protein with a concentration at the nuclear pores. Biochemical analyses show that Sus1 interacts with SAGA, a large intranuclear histone acetylase complex involved in transcription initiation, and with the Sac3-Thp1 complex, which functions in mRNA export with specific nuclear pore proteins at the nuclear basket. DNA macroarray analysis revealed that Sus1 is required for transcription regulation. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Sus1 is associated with the promoter of a SAGA-dependent gene during transcription activation. Finally, mRNA export is impaired in sus1 mutants. These data provide an unexpected connection between the SAGA histone acetylase complex and the mRNA export machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2078906823,"The molecular mechanism underlying the retention of intron-containing mRNAs in the nucleus is not understood. Here, we show that retention of intron-containing mRNAs in yeast is mediated by perinuclearly located Mlp1. Deletion of MLP1 impairs retention while having no effect on mRNA splicing. The Mlp1-dependent leakage of intron-containing RNAs is increased in presence of ts-prp18 delta, a splicing mutant. When overall pre-mRNA levels are increased by deletion of RRP6, a nuclear exosome component, MLP1 deletion augments leakage of only the intron-containing portion of mRNAs. Our data suggest, moreover, that Mlp1-dependent retention is mediated via the 5' splice site. Intriguingly, we found Mlp-proteins to be present only on sections of the NE adjacent to chromatin. We propose that at this confined site the perinuclear Mlp1 implements a quality control step prior to export, physically retaining faulty pre-mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2161069579,"Recruitment of protein kinase clients to the Hsp90 chaperone involves the cochaperone p50(cdc37) acting as a scaffold, binding protein kinases via its N-terminal domain and Hsp90 via its C-terminal region. p50(cdc37) also has a regulatory activity, arresting Hsp90's ATPase cycle during client-protein loading. We have localized the binding site for p50(cdc37) to the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain of Hsp90 and determined the crystal structure of the Hsp90-p50(cdc37) core complex. Dimeric p50(cdc37) binds to surfaces of the Hsp90 N-domain implicated in ATP-dependent N-terminal dimerization and association with the middle segment of the chaperone. This interaction fixes the lid segment in an open conformation, inserts an arginine side chain into the ATP binding pocket to disable catalysis, and prevents trans-activating interaction of the N domains."
https://openalex.org/W2000708353,"Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels is essential for T-cell activation and proliferation. Recently, it has been shown that 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP) derivatives are specific inhibitors of Ca2+-dependent transcriptional activity in T-cells (Trevillyan, J. M., Chiou, X. G., Chen, Y. W., Ballaron, S. J., Sheets, M. P., Smith, M. L., Wiedeman, P. E., Warrior, U., Wilkins, J., Gubbins, E. J., Gagne, G. D., Fagerland, J., Carter, G. W., Luly, J. R., Mollison, K. W., and Djuric, S. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48118-48126). Whereas inhibition of Ca2+ signals was reported for BTP2 (Ishikawa, J., Ohga, K., Yoshino, T., Takezawa, R., Ichikawa, A., Kubota, H., and Yamada, T. (2003) J. Immunol. 170, 4441-4449), it was not found for BTP3 (Chen, Y., Smith, M. L., Chiou, G. X., Ballaron, S., Sheets, M. P., Gubbins, E., Warrior, U., Wilkins, J., Surowy, C., Nakane, M., Carter, G. W., Trevillyan, J. M., Mollison, K., and Djuric, S. W. (2002) Cell. Immunol. 220, 134-142). We show that BTP2 specifically inhibits CRAC channels in T-cells with an IC(50) of approximately 10 nm. It does not interfere with other mechanisms important for Ca2+ signals in T-cells, including Ca2+ pumps, mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, and K+ channels. BTP2 inhibits Ca2+ signals in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (in particular in CD4+ T-cells) and in human Jurkat T-cells. Inhibition of Ca2+ signals is independent of the stimulation method as Ca2+ entry was blocked following stimulation with anti-CD3, which activates the T-cell receptor, and also following stimulation with thapsigargin or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. BTP2 also inhibited Ca2+-dependent gene expression (interleukins 2 and 5 and interferon gamma) and proliferation of T-lymphocytes with similar IC(50) values. BTP2 is the first potent and specific inhibitor of CRAC channels in primary T-lymphocytes. The inhibition of CRAC channels as well as Ca2+-dependent signal transduction with similar IC(50) values in T-lymphocytes emphasizes the importance of CRAC channel activity during T-cell activation. Furthermore, BTP2 could prove to be a tool to finally unmask the molecular identity of CRAC channels."
https://openalex.org/W2025513294,"Although cell culture studies have implicated the presence of vesicle proteins in mediating the release of glutamate from astrocytes, definitive proof requires the identification of the glutamate release mechanism and the localization of this mechanism in astrocytes at synaptic locales. In cultured murine astrocytes we show an array of vesicle proteins, including SNARE proteins, and vesicular glutamate transporters that are required to fill vesicles with glutamate. Using immunocytochemistry and single-cell multiplex reverse transcription-PCR we demonstrate the presence of these proteins and their transcripts within astrocytes freshly isolated from the hippocampus. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy demonstrates the presence of VGLUT1 in processes of astrocytes of the hippocampus. To determine whether calcium-dependent glutamate release is mediated by exocytosis, we expressed the SNARE motif of synaptobrevin II to prevent the formation of SNARE complexes, which reduces glutamate release from astrocytes. To further determine whether vesicular exocytosis mediates calcium-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, we performed whole cell capacitance measurements from individual astrocytes and demonstrate an increase in whole cell capacitance, coincident with glutamate release.

During the past decade there has been increasing evidence for both integrative and dynamic roles for astrocytes in the central nervous system. Following activation of G protein-coupled receptors, astrocytes exhibit calcium oscillations, leading to the release of the chemical transmitters glutamate and ATP (1Haydon P.G. Nat. Rev.

Neurosci. 1999; 22: 208-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar); neuronal activity causes elevations of synaptically associated calcium in astrocytes, which in turn leads to the release of chemical transmitters from these glial cells to locally modulate synaptic transmission (2Araque A.

The mechanisms mediating the release of these transmitters from astrocytes are, however, ill-defined and are still the subject of intense debate. At least three distinct release pathways have been proposed as mediating the calcium-dependent release of glutamate from astrocytes: the reversal of plasma membrane glutamate transporters, anion transporter mediate release mechanisms, and calcium-dependent exocytosis (8Attwell D. Nature. 1994; 369: 707-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Nedergaard M. Takano T. Hansen A.J. Nat. Rev.

Nature. 1994; 369: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Because the release of glutamate is stimulated by calcium elevations and is not affected by glutamate transport inhibitors and because changes in cell volume have not been detected coincident with release, it has been proposed that this transmitter is released through a vesicle-mediated exocytotic pathway. Several observations made using cultured astrocytes support such a vesicle-mediated exocytotic mechanism of glutamate release, including the calcium dependence of glutamate release (10Parpura V.

Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Although significant evidence supports release through such a pathway, a recent report has questioned the validity of a vesicular mechanism of glutamate storage and release (9Nedergaard M. Takano T. Hansen A.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and proposes instead that release is mediated by a channel through which transmitter is released from the cytosol. Additionally, P2X7 receptor activation has been shown to be capable of mediating the release of cytosolic glutamate through the pore of the channel (19Duan S. Anderson C.M. Keung E.C. Chen Y. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the release of glutamate is mediated by an exocytotic mechanism, then astrocytes should express the vesicular glutamate transporters required for the filling of vesicles with glutamate, perturbation of protein complexes known to be essential for exocytosis should block calcium-dependent glutamate release and membrane cycling, and, finally, biophysical approaches that can monitor fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane should detect an increase in membrane surface area coincident with the release of glutamate. In this study we have tested each of these possibilities. Because there is significant concern about whether cultured astrocytes accurately represent their in situ counterparts, we also asked whether proteins known to be essential for exocytosis are present in situ as well as in cell culture. We have determined which vesicle and vesicle-associated proteins are expressed in astrocytes in culture, in astrocytes freshly isolated from the nervous system, and in astrocytes in situ. After demonstrating the presence of SNARE proteins and vesicular glutamate transporters in freshly isolated astrocytes and, in the case of VGLUT1, also in situ, we then demonstrated the importance of these proteins for glutamate release by perturbing the formation of SNARE protein complexes. Finally, we applied biophysical approaches capable of detecting the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane and showed that, coincident with vesicle insertion into the plasma membrane, astrocytes do release the chemical transmitter glutamate. Together, these studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that calcium-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes is mediated by exocytosis. Cell Culture—All chemicals used in our experiments were obtained from Sigma, and all cell culture solutions were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) or Sigma unless otherwise stated. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania. Cultures of purified murine astrocytes and mixed cultures of astrocytes and neurons were generated as described previously (2Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2129-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). DF-1 cells, a spontaneously immortalized chicken cell line (ATCC cat # CRL-12203) were propagated as a continuous line in MMEM. Freshly Isolated Cells—Cells were freshly isolated from mouse hippocampus using methods modified from those delineated in a previous publication (20Zhou M. Kimelberg H.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7901-7908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One-week-old pGFAP-GFP mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. The hippocampi were quickly dissected out and cut into small pieces, treated with Earle's balanced salt solution (5%CO2/95%O2) containing 1 mg/ml protease IV (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Then they were rinsed with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mm: NaCl, 120; KCl, 3.1; NaH2PO4·H2O, 1.25; CaCl2·2H2O, 2; MgSO4·7H2O, 1; NaHCO3, 25; d-glucose, 10) and after 15 min of recovery were sequentially passed through glass Pasteur pipettes, dissociated, and immediately deposited onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Cells were either fixed directly for immunocytochemistry or transferred to a chamber for visualization. Pipettes prepared from borosilicate capillaries (OD: 1.5 mm, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) were used to aspirate individual identified astrocytes and neurons for RT-PCR. 10 μl of RNase-free solution, containing 1–2 units/μl RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.002 unit/μl RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega), and 1 mm dithiothreitol, was introduced into the pipettes. The pipettes were mounted on an Eppendorf 5171 Micromanipulator (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). After a cell was identified based both on GFP fluorescence and morphology, a pipette was slowly positioned close to the cell and suction applied manually. The pipette was immediately transferred to a 0.2-ml Eppendorf tube, and its tip was broken to allow the contents to enter the tube. The tube was immediately put into an ethyl alcohol/dry ice bath to be frozen. For blank control, a small volume of saline adjacent to cells was collected in the same manner. To control for DNA contamination, 1–2 units/μl RNasin was replaced by 0.1–0.2 unit/μl RNase ONE (Promega). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from brains of 1-week-old Swiss Webster mice (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) or 7- to 10-day-old pure astrocyte cultures using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each experiment, 100 pg of total RNA was used. For single cell RT-PCR, aspirated cells were first incubated at 94 °C for 10 min, and reagents were then added. The primers used in RT-PCR or PCR are listed in the supplemental Table SI. Superscript One-step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for the first step RT-PCR and Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen) for the second step PCR. All reactions were performed in a Gene-Amp PCR System 2400 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All RT-PCR and PCR products were examined using conventional DNA electrophoresis, and images were obtained using a custom imaging system. PCR products were found to have the predicted size based on the target sequence. Products were sequenced to confirm identity. Western Detection—Total proteins were extracted from brains of 1-week-old Swiss Webster mice or 7- to 10-day-old pure astrocyte cultures. Tissue or cells were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris base, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% protease inhibitor mixture, and pH 8.0) and the solution was passed through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. The preparation was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C after total protein concentration was determined by an OD meter. 2 μg of protein was loaded into each lane from both astrocyte cultures and whole brain. Western detection was performed as described previously (13Parpura V. Fang Y. Basarsky T. Jahn R. Haydon P.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (17Araque A. Li N. Doyle R.T. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 666-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies and the dilutions used in these studies can be found in supplemental Table SII. Confocal images were obtained using a three-channel confocal microscope (Prairie Technologies, Middleton, WI). The lack of bleedthrough between different channels was confirmed by performing single-labeled control samples at the same laser intensity and photomultiplier tube settings as used for triple-labeled samples. Stacks of images were processed and reconstructed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Anti-GFAP was purchased from Sigma, Anti-Munc18, SNAP-23, synaptobrevin II, VGLUT1, complexin I/II, and synaptophysin purchased from Synaptic Systems (Goettingen, Germany), and ant-VGLUT2 was a gift from Dr. Robert Edwards (University of California at San Francisco). In all experiments controls were performed in which primary antibodies were omitted to test for nonspecific reaction of secondary antibodies. Western blots confirmed that each antibody reacted with a single band of the expected molecular weight. Virus Preparation and Application—To get efficient and persistent gene expression selectively in astrocytes a strain of transgenic mouse, Gtv-a, was used along with a retrovirus vector, pRV9, for astrocyte-specific gene transfer (21Holland E.C. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These transgenic mice express TVA, a cell surface receptor for avian leukosis virus subgroup A (ALV-A), under the control of the astrocyte-specific promoter pGFAP. Because TVA is necessary for ALV-A to enter cells, astrocyte-specific expression of TVA renders glial cells susceptible to infection only with ALV-A vectors, such as pRV9. After DF-1 cells reached 70–80% confluence, they were transfected with pRV9 constructs by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection and kept in flasks for 4–6 days for sufficient infection of ALV-As. DF-1 cells were then enzymatically dissociated and stored in liquid N2 in MMEM containing 12% Me2SO. Frozen DF-1 cells were replated in flasks and cultured to confluence, then 5 ml of fresh medium (MMEM for purified cortical astrocyte cultures, mito-MEM for primary astrocyte-neuron co-culture) was added into the flasks for 24 h to be infected with virus particles. The medium was subsequently centrifuged at 3,400 × g to sediment the cell debris. The virus-containing medium was stored at 4 °C prior to being used within 1 week. Application of ALV-As was performed as described (21Holland E.C. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, virus-containing medium was applied 12 h after the dissociated cells from 0-day Gtv-a mice were plated on the coverslips or flasks. Constructs—To make the pRV9/synaptobrevin II (SNARE)-IRES-EGFP construct, DNA for synaptobrevin II residues Met1-Met96 was amplified from pCDM8/synaptobrevin II by 5′-end primer (5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAC-3′) and 3′-end primer (5′-GGAATTCTACATCATCTTGAGGTTTTTCC-3′). Meanwhile, EGFP mRNA was amplified from pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by 5′-end primer (5′-TCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACC-3′) and 3′-end primer (5′-TGGAATTCTAGAGTCGACGGCCGCTTTACT-3′). In an adapter vector, pBSFI/IRES, EGFP fragment was inserted into 3′-end of IRES (between BamHI and SalI sites), and synaptobrevin II (SNARE) fragment was inserted into 5′-end of IRES (at EcoRI site). The fragment of synaptobrevin II (SNARE)-IRES-EGFP was then subcloned into pRV9 by SfiI. Electrophysiology—In neuron-astrocyte co-cultures, mechanical stimulation of astrocytes leads to a glutamate-dependent slow inward current (SIC) in adjacent neurons (2Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2129-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This current was used as one monitor of glutamate release from astrocytes after the expression of EGFP and the synaptobrevin II SNARE domain. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained as described previously (2Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2129-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The morphological identification of neurons was confirmed electrophysiologically by their ability to generate tetrodoxin-sensitive Na+-mediated action potentials and by the presence of fast synaptic currents. Astrocytes were stimulated mechanically using glass micropipettes filled with external control solution. Pipettes were slowly manipulated onto the surface of an astrocyte using a motorized MP285 micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments, Novata, CA) until a change in internal calcium was stimulated as monitored by a calcium indicator. During the application of a stimulus the user monitored the calcium signal to provide feedback concerning the timing of contact with the cell surface. On observation of an evoked calcium response the pipette was retracted. The use of this approach prevents damage to astrocytes, which we independently confirmed by the absence of dye leakage from stimulated cells. For each neuron, up to four different astrocytes were stimulated at intervals of >1 min. Unless otherwise stated, at least eight astrocytes were stimulated in each parallel control and test condition, and data were obtained from at least three different cultures. The incidence of astrocyte-induced responses was defined as the proportion of responses relative to the total number of astrocytes stimulated in each experiment. Therefore, for these variables, n corresponds to the number of preparations, whereas for the other variables, such as the amplitude of the SIC, n represents the number of cells examined. Statistical differences were established using the Student's t test, unless otherwise stated. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). Glutamate Measurement—An enzymatic assay for extracellular glutamate was used to visualize glutamate release from cultured astrocytes (22Innocenti B. Parpura V. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of glutamate released from astrocytes, l-glutamic dehydrogenase (GDH) reduces β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH, a product that fluoresces when excited by UV light. Coverslips containing purified astrocytes were mounted in a perfusion chamber and bathed in GDH saline, which consisted of saline supplemented with GDH (∼56 units/ml) and NAD+ (1 mm). NADH fluorescence was excited by a xenon arc lamp (100 watts) using a D360/10X (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) exciter filter, 510DRLP dichroic mirror (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and 515EFLP emission filter (Omega Optical). Background subtraction of the fluorescent signals was performed by subtracting values recorded from the cells bathed in the solution lacking GDH and NAD+. Data were expressed as ΔF/Fo (%), where Fo represents the fluorescence level of the optical field before stimulation and ΔF represents the change in fluorescence. When using this approach Fo represents the sum of fluorescence emitted from GDH plus NAD+ plus basal NADH (either as a contaminant or because of enzymatic activity). For each different experimental condition, data were collected from at least three different cultures. Statistical significance was established using the analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. It should be noted that in comparison to a previous study (22Innocenti B. Parpura V. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which we used this glutamate assay, we detected smaller changes in NADH fluorescence. This reduction in signal occurred because in the current study we used perfusion in our chamber, whereas in the former we used a static bath. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement—The elevation of [Ca2+]i in astrocytes was monitored using the Ca2+ indicator X-rhod-1. Cultures were loaded with X-rhod-1, AM (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. All changes in fluorescence are reported as background-subtracted ΔF/F0. Immunoelectron Microscopy—All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN; 200–250 g) were used for the immunoelectron microscopy study. Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially through the ascending aorta with 50 ml of 3.8% acrolein (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) and 200 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). Immediately following perfusion fixation the brains were removed, cut into 1- to 3-mm coronal slices, and placed in the same fixative for an additional 30 min. 40-μm-thick sections were cut with a vibratome through the hippocampal formation, placed for 30 min in 1% sodium borohydride in 0.1 m PB to remove reactive aldehydes, and rinsed extensively in 0.1 m PB before the primary antibody incubation. Methods for dual immunocytochemical labeling have been described previously (23Chan J. Aoki C. Pickel V.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1990; 33: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Tissue sections containing the hippocampus were incubated at room temperature for 15–18 h in a mixture containing a rabbit polyclonal anti-VGLUT1 antibody (1:400; Synaptic Systems) and a mouse monoclonal anti-S-100β (1:400; Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.6). Sections were rinsed three times in 0.1 m TBS and incubated in the secondary antiserum at room temperature. Visualization of VGLUT1 and S100β was conducted using two labeling techniques. In one series, S-100β was visualized using immunoperoxidase detection while VGLUT1 was detected using immunogold-silver labeling. For this combination, sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation in avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories). Subsequently sections were placed in a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 1-nm gold particles (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 h at room temperature followed by silver enhancement of the gold particles. In another series, VGLUT1 was detected using immunoperoxidase labeling where the secondary antibody was a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Vector Laboratories). Following a 30-min incubation in the secondary antibody and a 30-min incubation in avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories), VGLUT1 was visualized using a 4-min reaction in 22 mg of 3–3′-diaminobenzidine and 10 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide in 100 ml of 0.1 m TBS. For S-100β immunogold-silver labeling, sections were subsequently rinsed in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in a solution of 0.01 m PBS containing 0.1% gelatin and 0.8% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Sections were then incubated in a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 1-nm gold particles (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at room temperature. These were rinsed in 0.01 m PBS containing the same concentrations of gelatin and bovine serum albumin as described above and subsequently rinsed with 0.01 m PBS alone. Sections were then incubated in 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.01 m PBS for 10 min followed by a wash in 0.01 m PBS and then in 0.2 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.4). Silver intensification of gold particles was achieved using a silver enhancement kit (Amersham Biosciences). The optimal silver enhancement times were determined empirically for each experiment and averaged 12–13 min. For electron microscopy, sections were rinsed in 0.1 m PBS and incubated in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m PB for 1 h, washed in 0.1 m PB, dehydrated, and flat-embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections of ∼80–100 nm were cut from the outer surface of the tissue with a diamond knife (Diatome) using a Leica ultramicrotome. These were collected on grids and counterstained with uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate. Captured images of selected sections were compared with captured light microscopic images of the block face prior to sectioning. Sections processed in the absence of primary antibodies did not exhibit immunoreactivity. To evaluate possible cross-reactivity of labeling of the primary antiserum by secondary antisera, some sections were processed for dual labeling with omission of one of the primary antisera. Tissue sections from animals with good preservation of ultrastructural morphology and with both markers clearly apparent were used for the analysis. At least 10 grids containing 5–10 thin sections each were collected from at least two plastic-embedded sections from each animal. A profile containing a small number of gold particles (e.g. two gold particles) that was unlabeled in adjacent thin sections was designated as lacking detectable immunoreactivity. As observed in low magnification electron micrographs, background labeling in the neuropil, deemed spurious, was not common; therefore, cellular compartments containing at least three gold particles were considered to be immunoreactive. The frequency of VGLUT1 immunoreactivity in S100 β-labeled profiles was determined by random sampling of portions of the hippocampal neuropil that contained both immunolabels. This was done to ensure that labeling differences did not result from uneven penetration of antibodies in thick tissue sections. Counting the same profile in adjacent ultrathin sections was avoided by analyzing sections that were non-overlapping and separated by at least 400 nm. Due to known differences in the sensitivity and resolution of immunogold and immunoperoxidase markers, sections were processed with reversal of the labels for VGLUT1 and S100 β. Because semi-quantitative data obtained were independent of the labeling technique used, data were pooled. The number of VGLUT1-labeled profiles was tallied with respect to localization in axons or axon terminals or glial cells. Data are represented as percentage of total labeled profiles analyzed. Membrane Capacitance Measurements—Compensated membrane capacitance (Cm) measurements were made using a SWAM IIB patch clamp/lock-in amplifier (Celica, Ljubljana, Slovenia) operating at 800-Hz lock-in frequency (24Zorec R. Sikdar S.K. Mason W.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 473-497Crossref Pu"
https://openalex.org/W2165085430,"Glucocorticoids mediate their therapeutic actions mostly by genomic effects via cytosolic receptors, but some effects are too rapid to be mediated by changes at the genomic level. The detailed mechanisms of these nongenomic actions are still unclear. Membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors (mGCR) have been suggested to be involved, although their physiological existence in humans so far is hypothetical. For the first time we demonstrate the existence of mGCR on monocytes and B cells obtained from healthy blood donors using high-sensitivity immunofluorescent staining. Immunostimulation with lipopolysaccharide increases the percentage of mGCR-positive monocytes, which can be prevented by inhibiting the secretory pathway. Overexpression of the human glucocorticoid receptor alpha alone is not sufficient to enhance mGCR expression. These in vitro findings are consistent with our clinical observation that in patients with rheumatoid arthritis the frequency of mGCR positive monocytes is increased and positively correlated with disease activity. We conclude that mGCR are 1) indeed physiologically present in healthy blood donors, but remained unidentified by conventional techniques due to their small number per cell and 2) actively up-regulated and transported through the cell after immunostimulation. These receptors may reflect a feedback mechanism of the organism upon immunostimulation and/or play a role in pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008929289,"Accumulation of RNA CUG repeats in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients leads to the induction of a CUG-binding protein, CUGBP1, which increases translation of several proteins that are required for myogenesis. In this paper, we examine the role of overexpression of CUGBP1 in DM1 muscle pathology using transgenic mice that overexpress CUGBP1 in skeletal muscle. Our data demonstrate that the elevation of CUGBP1 in skeletal muscle causes overexpression of MEF2A and p21 to levels that are significantly higher than those in skeletal muscle of wild type animals. A similar induction of these proteins is observed in skeletal muscle of DM1 patients with increased levels of CUGBP1. Immunohistological analysis showed that the skeletal muscle from mice overexpressing CUGBP1 is characterized by a developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, and myofiber-type switch: increase of slow/oxidative fibers and the reduction of fast fibers. Examination of molecular mechanisms by which CUGBP1 up-regulates MEF2A shows that CUGBP1 increases translation of MEF2A via direct interaction with GCN repeats located within MEF2A mRNA.

DM1 1The abbreviations used are: DM1, myotonic dystrophy type 1; sORF, short out of frame open reading frame; C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β; RBD, RNA-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; H/E, hematoxylin/eosin; IF, immunofluorescence; IP, immunoprecipitation. is a multisystem disease mainly characterized by defects in skeletal muscle with the involvement of many tissues and systems such as cardiac muscle, brain, eye, and endocrine system (1Harper P.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 4227-4251Google Scholar). DM1 is caused by an expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats within the 3′-untranslated region of the myotonin protein kinase gene (2Aslanidis C. Jansen G. Amemiya C. Shutler G. Mahadevan M. Tsilfidis C. Clen C. Alleman J. Wormskamp N.G. Vooijs M Buxton J. Johnson K. Sweets H.J.M. Lennon G.G. Carrano A.V. Korneluk R.G. Wieringa B. deJong P.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In DM1 patients, the size of DNA CTG expansion correlates with the severity of the disease. Patients with CTG expansion containing 50-80 CTG repeats are almost asymptomatic. Individuals bearing the myotonin protein kinase gene with 100-500 CTG repeats develop a disease in adult life (classical adult form of DM1) that is characterized by a progressive muscle wasting with myotonia. The most severe form of DM1, congenital disease, affects patients before or after birth and is associated with long CTG expansions (up to 2,000 repeats). This form of disease is characterized by a delay or arrest of skeletal muscle development (3Sahgal V. Bernes S. Sahgal S. Lischwey C. Subramani V. J. Neurolog. Sci. 1983; 59: 47-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although there is an overlap in range of repeats between different forms of DM1, there is a clear correlation of repeat number with severity of phenotype and reduction of age of onset. Investigations of molecular alterations in DM1 suggest that the expansion of CTG repeats causes the DM1 pathology through different mechanisms, mediated at both DNA and RNA levels. It has been shown that CTG repeats reduce expression of myotonin protein kinase in cis (4Fu Y.-H. Friedman D.L. Richards S. Pearlman J.A. Gibbs R.A. Pizzuti A. Ashizawa T. Perryman M.B. Scarlato G.

Miller C. Gehrmann J. Housman D. Mendelsohn M.E. Reddy S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CTG repeats also affect transcription of genes adjacent to myotonin protein kinase (6Thornton C.A. Wymer J.P. Simmons Z. McClain C. Moxley R.T. Nat.

Two families of RNA CUG-binding proteins have been identified: CUGBP (RNA-binding protein, binding to RNA CUG repeats) (15Lu X. Timchenko N.A. Timchenko L.T. Hum. Mol.

One of the members of the CUGBP family, CUGBP1, contributes to at least three symptoms of DM1: the delay of skeletal muscle differentiation (12Timchenko N.A. Iakova P. Cai Z-J. Smith J.R. Timchenko L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6927-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), myotonia (19Charlet-B N. Savcur R.S. Singh G. Philips A.V. Grice E.A. Cooper T.A. Mol.

Previous studies showed that the expansion of CUG repeats in DM1 leads to a 3-5-fold elevation of CUGBP1 binding activity and protein levels (13Savkur R.S. Philips A.V. Cooper T.A. Nat.

CUGBP1 possesses two major biological functions: regulation of splicing and translation (12Timchenko N.A. Iakova P. Cai Z-J. Smith J.R. Timchenko L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6927-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Philips A.V. Timchenko L.T. Cooper T.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Translational function of CUGBP1 was investigated mainly in cultured cells. These studies showed that CUGBP1 increases translation of p21 (12Timchenko N.A. Iakova P. Cai Z-J. Smith J.R. Timchenko L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6927-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and translation of a dominant negative isoform of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, LIP (22Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. T L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been shown that, in tissue culture models, CUGBP1-mediated induction of p21 is required for proper differentiation of myocytes (12Timchenko N.A. Iakova P. Cai Z-J. Smith J.R. Timchenko L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6927-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the role of translational function of CUGBP1 in vivo has not been addressed. To examine the role of translational activity of CUGBP1 in development of skeletal muscle deficiency in DM1 patients, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress CUGBP1 mainly in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in the heart. We found that elevation of CUGBP1 causes overexpression of its translational targets p21 and MEF2A (transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2A) in skeletal muscle. These alterations cause a muscular dystrophy, an increase of slow fibers, and delay of muscle development. UV Cross-linking—RNA transcripts encoding 123 CUG repeats, the full-length wild type, and mutant MEF2A mRNAs lacking the CUGBP1 binding site were synthesized in an in vitro transcription assay (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with 10-20 μg of purified proteins as described (12Timchenko N.A. Iakova P. Cai Z-J. Smith J.R. Timchenko L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6927-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After UV cross-linking, the samples were treated with RNase A (2 units/10 μl) and separated by PAGE with 0.1% SDS. Where indicated, MEF2A riboprobe containing the (GCA)9 repeat (CUGBP1 binding site within MEF2A mRNA) or sORF riboprobe specific for C/EBPβ was used. Generation of CUGBP1 Transgenic Mice—The experiments related to transgenic mice complied with federal guidelines and institutional policies. The full-length human CUGBP1 cDNA was amplified from a parental plasmid (17Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) with CUGBP1-specific primers. The sequence of the forward primer is as follows: 5′-TCA AAG AAA ATG AAC GGC ACC CTG-3′. The sequence of the reverse primer fused in frame with a short sequence coding for 6 histidines is as follows: 5′-ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG ATG GTA GGG CTT GCT GTC ATT CTT CGA-3′. The CUGBP1 cDNA fused with the track of histidines on its C terminus was cloned into BS vector containing chicken β-actin promoter connected with cytomegalovirus enhancer (a gift from Dr. Schneider, Baylor College of Medicine). Transgenic construct was injected into mouse FVB inbred eggs at DNX Transgenic Sciences Co. (Princeton, NJ). Genotyping of Transgenic Mice—Progenies were genotyped by PCR with CUGBP1-specific primers. The sequence of forward primer is 5′-GCT GCA TTA GAA GCT CAG AAT GCT-3′. The reverse primer has a sequence 5′-AGG TTT CAT CTG TAT AGG GTG ATG-3′. Two PCR products of different size from both wild type (540 bp) and mutant alleles (78 bp) were synthesized simultaneously. The size of PCR product from mutant allele is smaller because the transgene lacks introns. Tissue Culture—Mouse C2C12 myoblasts and human primary myoblast cultures were grown in 10-cm dishes in myoblast growth medium at 60% of density. Differentiation was induced by a switch of growth medium to fusion medium as described (12Timchenko N.A. Iakova P. Cai Z-J. Smith J.R. Timchenko L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6927-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Differentiating myoblasts were maintained for 5 days with medium changes occurring every day. Northern Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes at different time points of differentiation. RNA was hybridized with CUGBP1 probe as described (15Lu X. Timchenko N.A. Timchenko L.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Levels of CUGBP1 mRNA (7 + 9 kb) were calculated as a ratio to 18 S rRNA control. Immunostaining of Mouse Tissues—Paraffin and frozen sections were prepared from vastus or plantaris muscles from wild type and mutant mice with different numbers of CUGBP1 copies of the matching age and gender. Muscle sections were stained with H/E at the Baylor College of Medicine Histology Core. For immunoanalysis, sections were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and incubated for 1 h with antibodies against MEF2 (C-21; 1:1,000), myoglobin (sc-8081; 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), fast myosin (MY-32; 1:100), and slow myosin heavy chain (NOQ7.54D; 1:50) (Sigma). Rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used as secondary antibodies with dilution 1:200. Images were analyzed in Microscopic Core Facilities of Aging Center and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine. Isolation of Proteins and Western Blotting Analysis—Whole protein extracts from mouse tissues were prepared with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Cytoplasmic, nuclear, and whole cell extracts from cultured cells were isolated as described (12Timchenko N.A. Iakova P. Cai Z-J. Smith J.R. Timchenko L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6927-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-CUGBP1, MEF2 (C-21), myoglobin (sc-8081), and MyoD (myogenic transcription factor) (C-20) and mouse p21 (H164), myogenin (CF5D), fast (MY-32) and slow myosin (NOQ7.54D), and α-tubulin (TU-02). Detection was performed using the ECL kit (Pierce). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with control antibodies (α-tubulin or actin), and results were quantified by densitometer analysis. The Effect of CUGBP1 on MEF2A Levels in Cultured Cells—C2C12 cells were transfected with empty pcDNA vector and with recombinant plasmid containing CUGBP1 in pcDNA vector using FuGene 6 protocol. Protein extracts were isolated in 48 h after transfection and subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against His tag, CUGBP1, and MEF2A. CUGBP1 and MEF2A protein levels were calculated as a ratio to β-actin. To visualize the effects of CUGBP1 on MEF2A levels, C2C12 cells grown in slides were transfected with GFP as control and with CUGBP1 cloned into GFP vector. Cells were fixed and subjected to IF with antibodies against MEF2A using secondary antibodies labeled with rhodamine. CUGBP1 (green signal) and MEF2A (red signal) were analyzed at ×40 magnification. Examination of MEF2A Translation in Tissue Culture—One set of plates with C2C12 cells was co-transfected with MEF2A and CUGBP1, and another set was co-transfected with MEF2A and empty vector. One day after transfection, the growth medium was replaced with Met-free medium. In 24 h, Met-deficient medium was complemented with [35S]Met, and whole cell protein extracts were prepared in 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after the addition of [35S]Met. Protein extracts were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and incubated with antibodies against MEF2A (1:100) for 4 h at 4 °C, following incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min, washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in the loading buffer, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Inhibition of CUGBP1 by siRNA—Two RNA CUGBP1 primers were synthesized in Qiagen to target the following CUGBP1 sequence: 5′-AAT TTG GCT GCA CTA GCT GCT-3′. The sequence of the first primer is r(UUUGGCUGCACUAGCUGCU)d(TT). The sequence of the second primer is r(AGCAGCUAGUGCAGCCAAA)d(TT). These primers were annealed to make double-stranded siRNA-CUGBP1. Transfection of siRNA CUGBP1 was performed according to the Qiagen protocol. C2C12 cells were grown at 70% density. Enhancer R was mixed with siRNA oligonucleotide and transfection reagent in a ratio of 2:1:2.5. Protein extracts were prepared from proliferating and differentiating myoblasts transfected with siRNA. In control plates, no siRNA was added. Translation in an in Vitro Cell-free System—MEF2A plasmid was identified by screening of a human cardiac cDNA library with a GCA triplet repeat probe. GCA deletion mutant was generated by using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of forward mutagenic primer is 5′-TGG CGG CGG CTG GAA GCC CGA TGG GGT CAT-3′. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was programmed with wild type and mutant MEF2A mRNAs, and increased amounts of purified CUGBP1 were added to the incubation mixture. Translational products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Interaction of CUGBP1 and MEF2A mRNA in Vivo—C2C12 myoblasts were grown in the myoblast medium until 80% density and then subjected to differentiation in the fusion medium during 5 days. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were collected from C2C12 differentiating myoblasts in cytoplasmic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2) containing RNase inhibitors. CUGBP1 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies 3B1. RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform and reverse-transcribed with AML using oligo(dT) primer. PCR was performed with primers specific to mouse MEF2A mRNA. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-GATGTTGAGCACTACAGACCTCA-3′, and the sequence of the reverse primer was 5′-CTCCCCTGTGGACAGTCTGAGCA-3′. The size of the PCR product with MEF2A primers was 743 bp. Myogenic Conversion of Fibroblasts into Myoblasts—Mouse fibroblasts 10T1/2 were grown onto four-chamber slides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells grown at 60% of density were transfected with plasmids expressing MyoD, wild type and deletion mutant MEF2A, and the full-length or truncated CUGBP1. The amount of plasmid DNA was 0.2 μg per chamber and remained constant in all experiments. When one plasmid was used instead of two or three, the amount of DNA was adjusted with pcDNA vector. Transfection was performed with FuGene. In 2 days after transfection, fibroblast growth medium was replaced with myoblast fusion medium. Cells were grown for 5 days with medium changed every day. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min with two changes of fresh formaldehyde. Slides were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing goat serum (dilution 1:50) for 2 h. After blocking, slides were incubated with mouse antibodies against fast myosin (Sigma; dilution 1:50) and rabbit antibodies against MyoD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:50). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies labeled with rhodamine or anti-mouse antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at a dilution of 1:200. Generation of CUGBP1 Transgenic Mice—The full-length CUGBP1 coding region was placed under a modified β-actin promoter, which is mainly active in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in the heart (23Araki K. Araki M. Miyazaki J. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and fused on the C terminus to an oligonucleotide coding for 6 His amino acids. The resulting transgenic construct was injected into inbred eggs of FVB mice, and pups were genotyped by PCR with CUGBP1-specific primers. The expression of transgenic protein (His-CUGBP1) was verified by Western blotting with antibodies to His tag (Fig. 1, A and B). We first examined expression of His-CUGBP1 in different tissues of CUGBP1 transgenic mice. In agreement with previous publications (23Araki K. Araki M. Miyazaki J. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), β-actin promoter fused with cytomegalovirus enhancer directs the expression of His-CUGBP1 primarily in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in cardiac muscle (Fig. 1A). Within the sensitivity of Western blot analysis, we did not detect His-CUGBP1 in brain, spleen, and kidney (Fig. 1A). We have generated five lines of CUGBP1 transgenic animals (Table I). The analysis of His-CUGBP1 in skeletal muscle of these animals showed that the expression of His-CUGBP1 is increased to different levels (Fig. 1B). In addition, we found that the expression of His-CUGBP1 leads to a 2-3-fold elevation of the endogenous CUGBP1 levels (Fig. 1C). This estimate was done using protein extracts from vastus muscles of 3-5 mice of each line and 17 wild type mice. The mechanisms by which the transgenic His-CUGBP1 protein induces protein levels of endogenous CUGBP1 are unknown. Our data also showed that CUGBP1 immunoreactive proteins migrate as several bands, perhaps because of different levels in phosphorylation (24Roberts R. Timchenko N.A. Miller J.W. Reddy S. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Timchenko L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13221-13226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To examine whether these immunoreactive bands are isoforms of His-CUGBP1, we immunoprecipitated His-CUGBP1 with polyclonal antibodies to His and performed a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to CUGBP1. Fig. 1D shows that His-CUGBP1 migrates as several spots located between pH 6.0 and 8.0. Acidic isoforms of His-CUGBP1 represent phosphorylated forms of CUGBP1, since a treatment of His-IPs with CIP shifts these isoforms to the alkali region of the strip. Given the elevation of both His-CUGBP1 and endogenous CUGBP1, as well as phosphorylated isoforms of CUGBP1, CUGBP1 levels were calculated as a ratio of all of these isoforms in transgenic animals to endo-CUGBP1 in wild type animals. These calculations showed that an increase of total levels of CUGBP1 correlates with the number of transgenic copies (see Table I). All analyzed animals showed a relatively narrow rate of CUGBP1 overexpression (from 2- to 10-fold), perhaps due to negative effect of CUGBP1 elevation on mouse development (Fig. 2).Table 1The loss of body weight correlates with the levels of CUGBP1 inductionMouse lineTransgene copiesInduction of CUGBP1 proteinaThe induction of CUGBP1 levels in skeletal muscle was calculated as a ratio of (His-CUGBP1 + endogenous CUGBP1) in transgenic mice to endogenous CUGBP1 in wild type littermates.Body weight, percentage of wild type, newborns%CUGBP1-20bThree litters (21 mice) were weighted, p < 0.001.55-673-77CUGBP1-29cFour litters (28 mice) were weighted, p < 0.001.22-382-88CUGBP1-32dThree litters (26 mice) were weighted, p < 0.002.1395-100CUGBP1-36eFour litters (32 mice) were weighted, p < 0.001.88-1055-60CUGBP1-49fFour litters (30 mice) were weighted, p < 0.002.64-672-74a The induction of CUGBP1 levels in skeletal muscle was calculated as a ratio of (His-CUGBP1 + endogenous CUGBP1) in transgenic mice to endogenous CUGBP1 in wild type littermates.b Three litters (21 mice) were weighted, p < 0.001.c Four litters (28 mice) were weighted, p < 0.001.d Three litters (26 mice) were weighted, p < 0.002.e Four litters (32 mice) were weighted, p < 0.001.f Four litters (30 mice) were weighted, p < 0.002. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2CUGBP1 transgenic mice. A, effect of CUGBP1 transgene on mouse weight. A picture of wild type and two transgenic mice at the age of 5 days is shown. Heterozygous transgenic animals with 5-6-fold induction of CUGBP1 (TR1) survive but are underweight. A hemizygous transgenic animal (TR2) with an 8-fold increase of CUGBP1 died at 7 days of age. A bar graph shows a summary of body weight for four litters of line 20 (p < 0.001) and three litters of wild type mice (p < 0.002) with a mean of 10 animals/litter weighted at 10 and 20 days of age. B, CUGBP1 transgenic mice with high copies of CUGBP1 transgene die in utero. The picture of wild type and CUGBP1 transgenic mouse (at 20 days of embryonic development) with 10-fold elevation of CUGBP1 (line 36) is shown. C, skeletal muscles of CUGBP1 transgenic mice are severely damaged. Cross-sections through hind limbs of wild type and mutant littermates (line 36) are shown. Note that the size of femur is unchanged, but the layer of muscles is significantly reduced. D, His-CUGBP1 from skeletal muscle of CUGBP1 transgenic mice interacts with CUG repeats. Total skeletal muscle protein extracts were incubated with the CUG123 probe and analyzed by UV cross-link assay. After UV cross-link, the membrane was stained with Coomassie (below). Positions of His-CUGBP1 (line 32) and endogenous CUGBP1 are shown. The bottom (His-IP) shows UV cross-link with His immunoprecipitates from WT and CUGBP1 transgenic mice. E, His-CUGBP1 increases translation of p21 and LIP in a cell-free translation system. His-CUGBP1 was precipitated from skeletal muscle with His tag Abs and added into reticulocyte lysate programmed with p21 mRNA (top) or with C/EBPβ mRNA. After translation, p21 or C/EBPβ was immunoprecipitated and examined by gel electrophoresis. A diagram shows the structure of C/EBPβ mRNA and the position of the CUGBP1 binding site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A Severity of Developmental Delay Correlates with Levels of CUGBP1 Elevation—It has been previously shown that transgenic mice overexpressing the human DM1 region with greater than 300 CTG repeats developed myotonia and are growth-retarded (10Seznec H. Agbulut O. Sergeant N. Savouret C. Ghestem A. Tabti N. Willer J.C. Ourth L. Duros E Brisson E. Fouquet C. Butler-Browne G. Delacourte A. Junien C. Gourdon G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Given the accumulation of CUGBP1 in these mice, we performed gross analysis of CUGBP1 transgenic mice from different lines. This analysis showed that mutant mice, in which CUGBP1 is elevated to 2-3-fold (lines 29 and 32), have slight reduction of weight at birth but survive and develop normally. However, transgenic mice, in which CUGBP1 is 4-6-fold elevated, were growth-retarded and significantly underweight (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of three or four litters from different lines confirmed that weight of newborn CUGBP1 transgenic mice is ∼5-30% less than their wild type littermates (Table I) and that the reduction of weight depends on the levels of CUGBP1 protein. Animals with 8-10-fold elevation of CUGBP1 die in utero and are severely underdeveloped (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the overexpression of CUGBP1 in vivo might have severe impact on mouse development. Given the strongest expression of CUGBP1 transgene in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1C), we performed cross-sections through hind limb and femur of newborn wild type and mutant (line 36) littermates and found that whereas the size of femur in mutant mice is unchanged, the hind limb muscles look significantly reduced (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we further focused our studies on the histological analysis of skeletal muscle of CUGBP1 transgenic mice and on molecular pathways by which overexpression of CUGBP1 causes the disorder in skeletal muscle. His-CUGBP1 Precipitated from Skeletal Muscle of CUGBP1 Transgenic Mice Is Able to Regulate Translation of mRNAs—In vitro studies have demonstrated that CUGBP1 is a key regulator of translation of p21 and C/EBPβ mRNAs (12Timchenko N.A.

https://openalex.org/W1995154619,"The Tim8 and Tim13 proteins in yeast are known to exist in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and to form a hetero-oligomeric complex involved in the import of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Tim23, the central component of the TIM23 translocase. Here, we have isolated tim8 and tim13 mutants in Neurospora crassa and have shown that mitochondria lacking the Tim8-Tim13 complex were deficient in the import of the outer membrane β-barrel proteins Tom40 and porin. Cross-linking studies showed that the Tom40 precursor contacts the Tim8-Tim13 complex. The complex is involved at an early point in the Tom40 assembly pathway because cross-links can only be detected during the initial stages of Tom40 import. In mitochondria lacking the Tim8-Tim13 complex, the Tom40 precursor appears in a previously characterized early intermediate of Tom40 assembly more slowly than in wild type mitochondria. Thus, our data suggest a model in which one of the first steps in Tom40 assembly may be interaction with the Tim8-Tim13 complex. As in yeast, the N. crassa Tim23 precursor was imported inefficiently into mitochondria lacking the Tim8-Tim13 complex when the membrane potential was reduced. Tim23 import intermediates could also be cross-linked to the complex, suggesting a dual role for the Tim8-Tim13 intermembrane space complex in the import of proteins found in both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2165836272,"Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein found at the inner surface of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers. We hypothesize that deficiency of dystrophin increases muscle compliance and causes an aberrant mechanotransduction in muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we measured the length-tension relationships and determined intracellular signaling leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in diaphragm muscle fibers from dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. Compared with controls, length-tension curves of the mdx mice were shifted to the right. A higher level of activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 or p38 MAP kinase was observed in the mdx muscle compared with the normal muscle in response to mechanical stretch. Removal of Ca2+ from the medium inhibited stretch-induced ERK1/2 activation only in mdx muscle fibers but not in the normal fibers. Conversely, pretreatment with TMB-8 (an antagonist of intracellular Ca2+ blocked the mechanical stretch-induced ERK1/2 activation in normal but not in mdx muscle fibers. Pretreatment of muscle with nifedipine (L-type calcium channel antagonist) marginally decreased the activation of ERK1/2 in normal or mdx muscle whereas pretreatment with gadolinium (III) chloride (an inhibitor of stretch-activated channels) only blocked the activation of ERK1/2 in mdx muscle, with no significant effect on normal muscle. A higher basal level of activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor was observed in dystrophin-deficient diaphragm, which was further augmented by mechanical stretch. Mechanical stretch-induced activation of AP-1 was decreased by pretreatment of muscle fibers with PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) and removal of Ca2+ ions from incubation medium. Our results show that dystrophin is a load-bearing element and its deficiency leads to loss of muscle stiffness and aberrant mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle fibers."

This process requires correct folding and ongoing sorting from resident proteins of the compartments through which they move. The first such separation occurs during transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The molecular nature of this sorting event has been extensively studied and led to two models that may coexist and each apply for a distinct subset of cargo proteins (1Warren G. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 98: 125-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to the bulk-flow model, ER-exit occurs by default and requires no transport signals. Retention signals would be required for keeping ER resident proteins in the ER and retrieval signals would salvage those few that inadvertently escape. Conversely, the receptor-mediated model positions the targeting information on the cargo proteins themselves that would carry positive sorting signals for ER exit. These signals are recognized by membrane spanning transport receptors that couple the cargo proteins to the cytosolic vesicle budding machinery and cycle between the ER and post-ER compartments. Several transport receptors have been identified in the past few years, including ERGIC-53 (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), Emp24p (3Muniz M. Nuoffer C. Hauri H.P. Riezman H. J.

Science. 2001; 294: 1528-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), each acting as an ER export receptor for a subset of cargo proteins. The type I transmembrane protein ERGIC-53 is ubiquitously expressed and constitutively cycles between ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (5Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the ERGIC the protein segregates from anterograde-directed protein traffic and returns to the ER largely bypassing the Golgi apparatus (6Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar). ERGIC-53 is a lectin. In its luminal part it carries a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) with a β-sandwich-fold (7Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that shares significant sequence similarity and many structural details with the carbohydrate binding sites of plant L-type lectins (8Loris R.

It preferentially binds to d-mannose (11Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and recognizes protein-linked high mannose-type oligosaccharides in vivo (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The lack of functional ERGIC-53 leads to inefficient secretion of the glycoproteins pro-cathepsin C (12Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and blood coagulation factors V and VIII (13Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H.

Cross-linking studies have established a cathepsin Z-related protein (catZr) as a model glycoprotein cargo for ERGIC-53 and documented that cargo capture starts in the ER and cargo release occurs in the ERGIC (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although such a differential binding of the transport receptor to its cargo is fundamental, the molecular nature of this process has remained elusive. Based on the finding that lectin activity of ERGIC-53 strictly depends on Ca2+ (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we have speculated earlier that a drop of calcium levels along the ER to ERGIC pathway may trigger glycoprotein dissociation (5Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, an imaging approach that measures total Ca2+ in ultrathin cryosections revealed positive signals for both ER and Golgi, but ERGIC elements remained below detection levels (14Pezzati R. Bossi M. Podini P. Meldolesi J. Grohovaz F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, calcium deprivation as the sole determinant for cargo release appears unlikely, as the concentration gradient of free Ca2+ from ER to ERGIC may be subtle. Apart from that, a pH-driven sorting mechanism, in analogy to the endosomal system, has been suggested based on in vitro studies (15Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Organellar pH is determined by the presence of active H+ v-ATPase pumps, a 106-kDa complex consisting of 13 polypeptides, and of opposed H+ leak rates (17Wu M.M. Grabe M. Adams S. Tsien R.Y. Moore H.P. Machen T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33027-33035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Whereas the progressive acidification from the ER (pH 7.1-7.4) to the trans-Golgi network (pH 5.9-6.3) has been established, it is still largely questioned, however, if significant proton pumping and organelle acidification occurs already in the early secretory pathway, i.e. the ERGIC/cis-Golgi region (for review see Ref. 18Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The evidence is rather sketchy and includes the observations that the v-ATPase proteolipid subunit co-fractionates with ERGIC membranes, the v-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 produces a cell-type specific Golgi to ER retrograde transport defect, and there is minor overlap of DAMP staining with ERGIC-53 (19Ying M. Flatmark T. Saraste J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3623-3638PubMed Google Scholar, 20Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The notion of pre-Golgi acidification is far from being established and requires further evidence to be proven. By studying the lectin properties of ERGIC-53 in more detail, we report here that low pH modulates the activity of ERGIC-53 in vitro and in vivo. The data suggest a molecular scenario underlying reversible lectin inactivation that involves protonation of a conserved histidine sensor residue and loss of Ca2+. In conjunction with our previous studies, the results establish the ERGIC as the earliest acid compartment of the secretory pathway.

Cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (23Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) (10 μg of DNA/10-cm dish). CHO-KI cells and Lec1-derived stable clones (GM or GMAA (24Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol.

Chloroquine (100 μm) was added 1 h before metabolic labeling and was present throughout the pulse-chase period. For pH-clamp experiments, cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES (pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0), 60 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1.5 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm methionine, and 10 μm each of nigericin and monensin (adapted from Ref. 25Wu M.M.

AlF4- was used at the following final concentrations: 30 mm NaF and 50 μm AlCl3. In situ cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) (Pierce) was performed on intact cells (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Mannose Binding Assay—myc/His6-ERGIC-53 was purified from transiently transfected COS-1 cells solubilized in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100. Cleared lysate (100,000 × g, 1 h) from 10 10-cm dishes was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under constant agitation. The beads were washed in the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 m imidazole, 0.04% Triton X-100 and dialyzed against the same buffer lacking imidazole. Purified ERGIC-53 was shock frozen and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Mannose binding was performed for 4 h at 4 °Cin10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES (pH 7.4) (or as indicated; pH was set at 4 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (or as indicated), 0.04% Triton X-100 in a volume of 100 μl using 50 ng of protein and 20 μl (dry volume) of d-mannose beads. After removing the supernatant, beads were washed twice with binding buffer and bound protein was eluted in 100 μl of Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.04% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C. B- and s-fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-myc and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with a ChemImager™ device and AlphaEase™ software (Alpha Inotech Corporation). Pulse-Chase Experiments, Immunoprecipitation, and Endoglycosidase Digest—Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, chased in α-minimal essential medium containing 10 mm unlabeled methionine, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (26Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using mAb G1/93 or polyclonal antibody against fibronectin and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation of intracellular catZr was performed after antigen denaturation at 95 °C in 30 mm triethanoamine/HCl (pH 8.1), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 1.6% SDS followed by addition of an excess of Triton X-100 (2% final concentration) in the same buffer. Secreted catZr was methanol-chloroform precipitated (27Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar) and then subjected to the same procedure. Where indicated, cells were treated with DSP prior to solubilization, or immunoprecipitates were digested with endo D or endo H as previously described (24Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Gels were analyzed and quantified on a STORM 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) or by fluorography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—GM-Lec1 cells were cultured in 8-well multichamber Permanox slides (Milian, Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% saponin, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using mAb G1/93 and GAM IgG(H+L)-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). Confocal laser scanning images were acquired on a Leica microscope (TCS NT) with a 63× objective (NA 1.32). Lectin Activity of ERGIC-53 Is Modulated by pH and Ca2+—To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of the ERGIC-53/cargo interaction, we designed an in vitro lectin assay. Full-length oligomeric ERGIC-53 carrying a NH2-terminal myc epitope and a His6 tag at the C terminus (myc/His6 (11Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) was purified from COS-1 cells (Fig. 1A) and incubated with immobilized d-mannose in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2. Bound and unbound protein was visualized by immunoblotting using anti-myc. Binding of 50 ng of protein was complete, required Ca2+, and could be competed with 0.2 m free d-mannose (Fig. 1B), indicating specificity. This assay was used to further study the lectin properties of ERGIC-53. First, we tested the possibility that mannose binding was sensitive to acid. To this end, binding experiments were performed in buffers of pH 7.4, corresponding to the pH of the ER (18Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), down to pH 6.0. Fig. 1C shows that the fraction of active ERGIC-53 was gradually reduced to 13 ± 6% at pH 6.0. Inactivation by pH 6.0 treatment could be readily reversed by neutralization (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the sensitivity of the lectin to low pH was linked to Ca2+ as it was completely suppressed if [Ca2+] was raised to 5 mm (Fig. 2A). In a next set of experiments the binding of ERGIC-53 was assayed at constant pH over a range of [Ca2+] (Fig. 2B). Half-maximal binding was observed in the presence of 150 μm Ca2+ at pH 7.4, 230 μm Ca2+ at pH 6.5, and 800 μm Ca2+ at pH 6.0. We conclude that pH sensitivity of ERGIC-53 is at least in part because of pH-induced changes in Ca2+ affinity raising the possibility that pH sensing and Ca2+ complexation may be mediated by the same amino acid(s). Histidine 178 Has the Hallmarks of a Molecular pH Sensor—In search of the molecular mechanism underlying acid sensitivity we scanned the CRD of ERGIC-53 for potentially titratable residues. Histidine is the only basic amino acid that can be considerably protonated in moderately acidic solutions as used above. His-178 is both conserved in ERGIC-53 orthologs and positioned in a characteristic α-helix in the active site of ERGIC-53 (Fig. 3, A and B (7Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). To mimic and freeze the unprotonated state, His-178 was mutated to glutamine and the mutant lectin purified. According to our expectations, H178Q would abrogate or at least reduce pH sensitivity of mannose binding. However, we found ERGIC-53(H178Q) to be inactive (Fig. 3C). In contrast, mutating the non-conserved His-175 only minimally affected the binding. Taken together with the central position in the CRD, the fact that a neutral mutation of His-178 inactivates lectin function indicates that this residue may be directly involved in mannose binding or, more likely, Ca2+ complexation (see Fig. 2B). To further support this idea, we probed the mannose binding of a Ca2+-binding mutant (D152S) that was designed on the basis of the close homology of ERGIC-53 and plant lectins (8Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 28Nufer O. Mitrovic S. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15886-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As expected, D152S abrogated lectin activity comparable with H178Q (Fig. 3C), consistent with a role of His-178 in Ca2+ binding. These findings support the notion that His-178 serves as a molecular pH sensor of ERGIC-53. We call the α-helical loop comprising His-178 the histidine ion sensor (HIS)-loop. ERGIC-53/Glycoprotein Association Is Sensitive to Acidic pH—Does the binding of ERGIC-53 to a known glycoprotein ligand also depend on neutral pH? We studied intracellular binding of catZr to ERGIC-53 by in situ cross-linking (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) in cells that had been subjected to a pH-clamp procedure. pH clamping adapts all cellular compartments to the pH of the applied buffer, irrespective of organelle-specific ion concentrations and permeabilities (25Wu M.M. Llopis J. Adams S.R. McCaffery J.M. Teter K. Kulomaa M.S. Machen T.E. Moore H.P. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 546-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because this procedure perturbs transport along the biosynthetic pathway (18Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), 2C. Appenzeller-Herzog and H.-P. Hauri, unpublished observations. we made use of GMAA cells that stably express a transport-impaired ERGIC-53 mutant that is restricted to the ER (24Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), but still efficiently cross-links to catZr by DSP (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This cross-linker covalently links the two proteins and after reductive cleavage slightly increases their apparent molecular mass. We chose to assess the effect of pH 6.5 and 6.0 treatment in relation to neutral pH taking into account pKa(His) of ∼6.5. Because chemical coupling of amino groups by DSP works poorly below pH 7, the cells were cross-linked at pH 7.4 after metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and pH clamping. ERGIC-53 immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Cross-linking efficiency, as determined by quantification of the DSP-induced gel-mobility shift of GMAA-ERGIC-53 (Fig. 4, compare lane 1 to other lanes), only minimally changed upon acid treatment indicating that incubation at neutral pH after the pH clamp allowed the cells to re-establish neutral ER pH (Fig. 4, lanes 2-4, GMAA-ERGIC-53). To confirm this, neutralization during cross-linking was imposed by inclusion of the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine that is known to raise intraorganellar pH within seconds (18Weisz O.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 226: 259-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4 (DSP control/chloroquine), the variations in cross-linking efficiency with or without addition of chloroquine remained statistically insignificant. The amount of the catZr-doublet (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) cross-linked to GMAA-ERGIC-53 on the other hand was significantly reduced with decreasing pH (Fig. 4, lanes 2-4, catZr). During the cross-linking procedure at neutral pH some reassociation may occur, but this process seems to be slow at 4 °C in the viscous environment of the ER lumen. Consistent with this, binding of catZr to ERGIC-53 after acidic pH clamping was only partially restored if cross-linking was performed in the presence of chloroquine (Fig. 4, lanes 5-7, catZr). Because pH-induced misfolding of catZr, a predicted lysosomal enzyme, is unlikely, we conclude that an artificially applied acidic pH in the lumen of the ER drives dissociation of catZr from ERGIC-53. Neutralization of the ERGIC Inhibits Cargo Release—We wondered if pH-driven glycoprotein dissociation from ERGIC-53 also occurs in living cells without acidic manipulation. Our previous studies have localized the site of catZr cargo release from ERGIC-53 to the ERGIC (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). If indeed an endogenous acidification mechanism of the ERGIC is the driving force for the dissociation, we expect that neutralization of the intra-organellar pH would delay this process. We chose to use the dibasic compound chloroquine that elevates the pH within acidic organelles by a weak base mechanism at micromolar concentrations (minimizing osmotic swelling) and by the lack of primary amino groups does not interfere with DSP cross-linking (see above). To verify that such organelle neutralization does not generally affect membrane traffic in the early secretory pathway, which would lead to misinterpretations, we assayed the recycling of ERGIC-53 by two different methods. First, pulse-chase experiments were performed in the presence or absence of 100 μm chloroquine using CHO-KI-derived GM-Lec1 cells (24Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitated ERGIC-53 was probed for sensitivity to endo D. Lec1 cells lack the Golgi enzyme N-acetylglucosamine transferase I, and as a consequence N-glycosylated proteins, upon passage through the cis-Golgi, become and remain endo D-sensitive by the action of Golgi mannosidase I. As the major recycling route of ERGIC-53 largely bypasses the cis-Golgi (6Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar), the acquisition of endo D sensitivity is a slow process (24Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and an exact measure of ERGIC-53 trafficking. Fig. 5A shows that chloroquine treatment does not slow down the recycling of glycosylated ERGIC-53. As a second read-out for recycling, we studied the localization of ERGIC-53 by immunofluorescence microscopy in GM-Lec1 cells that had been treated with AlF4-. This drug accumulates recycling proteins in the ERGIC in a reversible manner (24Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Very much like in control cells, in cells pretreated with chloroquine, ERGIC-53 was concentrated in a juxtanuclear area and the reticular ER fluorescence diminished after AlF4- treatment (Fig. 5, C and F). After AlF4- wash-out, these effects were reversed in both neutralized and control cells (Fig. 5, D and G). These results suggest that recycling kinetics of ERGIC-53 as well as morphology of the ER-Golgi interface remain undisturbed in the presence of chloroquine. Therefore, we used chloroquine to study the role of luminal pH in the kinetics of catZr release from ERGIC-53. It has been shown that cargo binding by ERGIC-53 persists as far as to the ERGIC, where dissociation takes place (2Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To measure the rate of catZr dissociation, GM-Lec1 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased for the indicated times with or without addition of chloroquine. After cross-linking the amount of catZr co-immunoprecipitated with anti-ERGIC-53 was analyzed. Chloroquine indeed delayed the release of catZr (Fig. 6A). We reasoned that this observation could reflect: (i) enhanced cross-linking in the presence of chloroquine; (ii) an unspecific block in secretion that would slow down transport of catZr at the level of ER exit, possibly followed by its degradation; or (iii) impaired dissociation from ERGIC-53 in the ERGIC. An effect of chloroquine on the efficiency of DSP treatment can be excluded (Fig. 4 and 30 min chase in Fig. 6A). To test the second possibility we performed a pulse-chase analysis in GM-Lec1 cells with an antiserum that specifically recognizes catZr. 2C. Appenzeller-Herzog and H.-P. Hauri, unpublished observations. As shown in Fig. 6B, in untreated cells, catZr gradually converted from the proform to the mature enzyme indicating its targeting to the lysosomal pathway. In contrast, upon treatment with chloroquine, catZr remained unprocessed and the proform persisted slightly longer, which is consistent with its slower transit through the early secretory pathway. Furthermore, we analyzed the appearance of the metabolically labeled, unprocessed catZr-proenzyme in the culture medium from chloroquine-treated or control cells. Regardless of neutralization the cells secreted catZr (Fig. 6C). In chloroquine-treated cells the inhibition of intracellular maturation (Fig. 6B), which may arise from the impaired function of acid hydrolases and/or from transport defects, caused hypersecretion of catZr, a phenomenon known for lysosomal proteins. This renders it impossible to quantitatively compare the rate of secretion with or without neutralization and most likely accounts for the seeming paradox of retention in the ERGIC versus enhanced secretion of catZr. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that chloroquine neither initiates the degradation nor blocks the secretion of catZr, but causes some setback in its early transport through the secretory pathway. To discriminate whether under these conditions secretory transport is generally affected or if this delay is specific for catZr, we sought to measure the transport of an independent secretory marker.

For example, an E. coli IscS deletion mutant showed a significant decrease in the production of nicotinic acid and branched chain amino acids (18Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Serial deletions of the E. coli iscS gene region revealed that IscS is involved in amino acid metabolism (19Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, IscS contributes to thiamine biogenesis by catalyzing the transfer of sulfur in the pathway involved in the formation of thiazole rings (18Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Skovran E. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3896-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Further evidence of the sulfur-transferring activity of IscS is seen in the thio-modification of nucleotides in tRNA. E. coli IscS transfers a sulfur atom from the substrate cysteine to produce a 4-thiouridine at position 8 of tRNA in vivo (21Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10727-10730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and in vitro (22Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This reaction is partly shared with the thiamine biosynthesis pathway described above by cooperating with ThiI (18Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33588-33595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). E. coli IscS is also involved in 2-thiouridine formation in tRNA in vitro (24Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this case, IscS works together with MnmA (24Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the resulting 2-thiouridine is hypermodified to 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine via the joint action of two other proteins (MnmE and MnmC) (25Hagervall T.G. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in E. coli and S. enterica, the IscS protein is involved in the biosynthesis of at least five different thio-modified nucleotides in vivo, suggesting that IscS plays a critical role in thio-modification in bacterial cells (26Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Nilsson K. Lundgren H.K. Hagervall T.G. Björk G.R. J.

RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Although thio-modification has been found in eukaryotic tRNAs, the participation of Nfs1 (or Nfs1p) has yet to be proven. In eukaryotic cells, thio-modified tRNA molecules are found in both mitochondria and the cytoplasm (29Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Ishii N. Ueda T. Ohta S. Watanabe K.

Therefore, the question remains as to whether Nfs1 is involved in sulfur donation during mitochondrial (mt) and/or cytoplasmic (cy) tRNA thio-modification. In this study, we used a yeast conditional mutant strain (in which the expression of Nfs1p was repressed) to investigate the participation of Nfs1p in the thio-modification of both cy- and mt-tRNAs. Yeast Strains and Cell Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae W303-1B (MATa, ade2-1, his3-11,15, ura3-1, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, can1-100) was used as the wild-type strain, along with its derivative YN101, in which the Nfs1p gene (NFS1) is expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter (14Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C in galactose medium (2% d-galactose, 0.5% casamino acids, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, plus adequate supplements for selection; BD Biosciences), lactate medium (2% lactate, 0.1% d-glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, plus adequate supplements for selection), or glucose medium (2% d-glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids). For sulfate-limited growth, cells cultivated in normal medium were further incubated with medium prepared with yeast nitrogen base lacking ammonium sulfate (BD Biosciences). Pulse Labeling of Yeast Cells with l-[35S]Cysteine—Yeast cells incubated with the sulfur-lacking medium described above were harvested and further incubated with l-[35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 107 cells/ml/1000 μCi for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were then harvested and used to prepare the total tRNA. Total tRNA Preparation, Followed by Electrophoresis for Detection of the Radiolabeled tRNA Fraction—Total tRNA from yeast cells was extracted with phenol, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and washed once with 70% ethanol. tRNAs were applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. Following electrophoresis, the gel was wrapped entirely and exposed to a Fuji Film imaging plate for >30 h. The exposed imaging plate was then subjected to analysis by a Fuji Film BAS-2500 image analyzer to detect radioactivity in the tRNA fractions. Detection of Thiomodified Uridine in tRNAs by [(N-Acryloylamino)-phenyl]mercuric Chloride (APM) Gel Electrophoresis, Followed by Northern Hybridization (APM/Northern)—The presence of thiouridine in the prepared tRNA was verified by the retardation of electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels containing 0.05 mg/ml APM (kindly provided by Naoki Shigi, University of Tokyo) (37Shigi N. Suzuki T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39128-39135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in a procedure originally developed by Igloi (38Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Total RNA (0.05 A260 units) was separated by PAGE as described above and blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Each tRNA fraction was detected with a specific 32P-5′-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-TGGTGAGAATAGCTGGAGTTGAAC-3′ for mt-tRNAUUULys, 5′-TGGTTGAATCGG TTTGATTCGAAC-3′ for mt-tRNAUUGGln, 5′-TGGCTCCTCATAGGGGGCTCGAAC-3′ for cy-tRNAUUULys2, and 5′-TGGCTCCGATACGGGGAGTCGAAC-3′ for cy-tRNAUUCGlu3. Following hybridization, membranes were washed, dried, and then exposed to the imaging plate for 1 h to detect cy-tRNAs and for at least 24 h to detect mt-tRNAs. Radioactivity was detected with the BAS-2500 image analyzer. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of RNA Modification in Yeast tRNAs— Total tRNAs (1.5 A260 units in each case) were digested with 10 μg/ml ribonuclease P1 (Seikagaku Kougyo) and 9 units/ml bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo) at 37 °C for 3 h. The nucleosides were subjected to liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis using an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system equipped with a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Duo ion-trap mass spectrometer as described previously (39Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunochemical Detection of Yeast Nfs1p—Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation, and total proteins were extracted by an alkali-SDS method (14Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. A total of 2 μg of cellular proteins were analyzed immunochemically with anti-Nfs1p antibody to examine the expression levels of Nfs1p (14Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thio-modification of tRNA Is Dependent on the Expression of Yeast Nfs1p—Considering that bacterial IscS proteins participate in the thio-modification of tRNA (18Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6830-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it is probable that homologous eukaryotic Nfs1 proteins are also involved in the similar post-transcriptional thio-modification of tRNA. To examine this possibility, we first investigated whether the expression of Nfs1p is necessary for the transfer of a sulfur atom from l-cysteine to tRNA in yeast cells. YN101 cells, in which the Nfs1p gene (NFS1) is expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter, grew normally in galactose medium (designated as YN-G cells), but their growth was inhibited in glucose medium (designated as YN-D cells) (14Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), in which the expression of NFS1 was repressed (Fig. 1, A and B). YN-G and YN-D cells, together with wild-type cells grown under similar conditions (designated as WT-G and WT-D cells, respectively) and used as controls, were then separately subjected to in vivo pulse labeling experiments with l-[35S]cysteine to see if its radioactive sulfur transfers to tRNAs. As shown in Fig. 1B, total tRNAs from both WT-G and WT-D cells efficiently incorporated the radioactive sulfur of l-[35S]cysteine. In contrast, total tRNAs from YN-D cells were not radiolabeled with sulfur. As predicted, radiolabeling could be induced by the expression of NFS1 following growth in galactose medium (YN-G cells) (Fig. 1B). These results clearly demonstrate that the efficient thio-modification of tRNAs in vivo depends on the presence of NFS1. Nfs1p Depletion Results in a Lack of Thio-modification of Uridine in mt-tRNAs—As yeast Nfs1p is localized mainly in mitochondria (6Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether depletion of Nfs1p can affect the thio-modification of mt-tRNAs. The wobble modification in both mt-tRNAUUULys and mt-tRNAUUGGln has recently been found to possess 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine-modified uridine. 2N. Umeda, T. Suzuki, and K. Watanabe, manuscript in preparation. We employed APM-PAGE/Northern analysis using a specific probe, to detect 2-thiouridine modification in each of these two tRNAs (see “Experimental Procedures”) (37Shigi N. Suzuki T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39128-39135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both mt-tRNAs from WT-G and WT-D cells showed a remarkably retarded migration on the APM gel (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels) compared with the migration on a gel without APM (left panels). However, mt-tRNAs from glucose-grown YN101 cells (YN-D) were not retarded on the APM gel, whereas mt-tRNAs from cells cultured in galactose medium (YN-G) were retarded because of the induction of the 2-thio modifications (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels). We also analyzed a 3-fold excess amount of tRNA prepared from YN-D cells (Fig. 2, A and B, YN-Dx3) to examine whether residual amounts of mt-tRNAs remained to be thio-modified. However, no thiouridine could be detected in both mt-tRNAs. Moreover, we carried out the experiment with YN101 cells under a different Nfs1p-depleted growth condition in which 2% lactate and 0.1% glucose were included instead of 2% glucose (designated as WT-L and YN-L cells) (Fig. 2). Under this non-fermentative growth condition, yeast mitochondria are known to develop well because of the lack of metabolic repression. However, as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), both mt-tRNAs from YN-L cells displayed a similar absence of thiouridine compared with those from YN-D cells. These results indicate that the thio-modification of uridine in both mt-tRNAUUULys and mt-tRNAUUGGln requires the presence of Nfs1p. Because both mt-tRNAs are encoded by mitochondrial DNA, the thio-modification of uridine in these mt-tRNAs is most likely an intramitochondrial event that is facilitated by mitochondrial Nfs1p. Deficiency in Thio-modification of Uridine in cy-tRNAs Is Caused by Nfs1p Depletion—We further investigated whether Nfs1p is involved in the 2-thio modification of uridine in cy-tRNAs. The 2-thio modification of cy-tRNAUUCGlu3 and cy-tRNAUUULys2 at the wobble positions has been reported previously (40Hani J. Feldmann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By APM-PAGE/Northern analysis, we found two yeast cy-tRNAs ( cy-tRNAUUCGlu3 and cy-tRNAUUULys2) from wild-type cells that displayed retarded migration on the APM gel (Fig. 3, right panels), indicating the presence of thiouridine. This was the case regardless of the culture medium. However, in Nfs1p-depleted YN101 cells (YN-L and YN-D), the retarded bands with 2-thiouridine were less intense, and samples also displayed non-retarded bands (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that Nfs1p depletion affects the 2-thio modification of uridine in these cy-tRNAs in vivo without completely abolishing it. The most remarkable finding of the results shown in Fig. 3 is that significant fractions of these cy-tRNAs were still thio-modified despite the cells being cultured for 48 h in a medium that results in Nfs1p depletion. This is compared with the complete absence of 2-thiouridine formation in both mt-tRNAUUULys and mt-tRNAUUGGln in the corresponding cells (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the remaining thio-modified cy-tRNA molecules were more abundant in the respiratory-grown cells (YN-L) compared with those in the glucose-utilizing cells grown under fermentative conditions (YN-D), in which mitochondrial development was repressed. Because NFS1 expression seemed to be similarly repressed under both growth conditions, our findings suggest that mitochondrial activity directly contributes to the 2-thio modification of cy-tRNAs. Thio-modification Deficiency in mt-tRNAs Precedes That in cy-tRNAs following Depletion of Nfs1p—According to the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3, impairment of the 2-thio modification of uridine in mt-tRNAs seemed to precede that in cy-tRNAs following depletion of Nfs1p. We further analyzed the levels of 2-thiouridine formation at 30 and 48 h after Nfs1p depletion (Fig. 4). YN101 cells could survive and grow slowly for some time in glucose medium, in which NFS1 gene expression was repressed (Fig. 1A), and indeed, viable cells were still obtained after >30 h of growth under Nfs1p-depleted conditions, although Nfs1p levels were already markedly reduced (data not shown). We performed APM-PAGE/Northern analysis for both cy- and mt-tRNAs prepared from YN-D cells after 30 and 48 h of growth under Nfs1p-depleted conditions. Both mt-tRNAs were shown to lack 2-thio modification at uridine by the 30-h time point (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, more than half of the total cy-tRNAUUULys2 and cy-tRNAUUCGlu3 displayed 2-thiouridine modification at 30 h, and even after 48 h, a small but significant fraction of cy-tRNA was still found to be thio-modified (Fig. 4B). To examine whether cy-tRNAs can be thio-modified by an alternative Nfs1p-independent pathway utilizing inorganic sulfur as a source, YN101 cells were grown in medium with or without excess ammonium sulfate (0.5%). We observed no difference in the level of thio-modified cy-tRNA from the cells harvested 48 h after Nfs1p depletion, regardless of the presence or absence of excess ammonium sulfate (Fig. 5), indicating that excess inorganic sulfurs in the culture medium were not responsible for the delayed impairment of the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs.Fig. 5Cultivation under sulfate-limiting conditions does not affect the delayed impairment of the thio-modification of cy-tRNAUUULys2. YN101 cells were cultured either in galactose medium (G)or glucose medium (D) in the presence of ammonium sulfate for 24 h and then harvested. These harvested cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in fresh galactose or glucose medium under sulfate-containing (+ Sulfate in culture) or sulfate-limiting (- Sulfate in culture) conditions. Note that, for both growth conditions, sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine were included in the medium. Cells were then analyzed by APM-PAGE/Northern analysis using the probe for cy-tRNAUUULys2 as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nfs1p Depletion Causes an Accumulation of 5-Methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) and a Concomitant Decrease in 5-Methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U) in cy-tRNAs—We employed liquid chromatography/ion-trap mass spectrometry to analyze total nucleosides from both WT-D and YN-D cells. Because cy-tRNAs comprise a larger percentage of the total tRNA fraction compared with mt-tRNAs, practically all nucleosides detected in this analysis were regarded as being derived from cy-tRNAs. In wild-type cells, mcm5s2U was found to be a major constituent of 2-thiouridine-derived nucleosides, along with a smaller quantity of mcm5U, a precursor form of mcm5s2U (Fig. 6A). In Nfs1p-depleted YN101 cells (YN-D), we saw a reduced amount of mcm5s2U and an increased amount of mcm5U (Fig. 6B). The relative abundance of each nucleoside was determined by comparison with the amount of N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine, which was used as an internal standard (Fig. 6, A and B, lower panels). These results clearly indicate that Nfs1p depletion affects the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs at the level of sulfur incorporation into position 2 of mcm5U to form mcm5s2U. In prokaryotes, IscS-mediated sulfur mobilization is utilized in various processes, including the biosynthesis of ISC, thiamine, and thionucleosides in tRNAs (18Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Skovran E. Downs D.M. J.

A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). From our results here, we conclude that the yeast IscS homolog, Nfs1p, is also required for the post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs, suggesting that, in addition to the well known essential contribution to ISC formation, eukaryotic Nfs1 also participates in multiple physiologically important reactions as a sulfur donor. The main fraction of Nfs1p, together with other proteins required for ISC biogenesis, is located in mitochondria, with only a trace amount of Nfs1p being localized in nuclei (14Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Nfs1p is thought to donate a sulfur atom to Isu1p, the IscU homolog, on which a transient ISC is assembled (16Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 43Mühlenhoff U. Gerber J. Richhardt N. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We have shown in this study that Nfs1p depletion caused an immediate decrease in the levels of thio-modified tRNAUUULys and tRNAUUGGln in mitochondria. In E. coli, MnmA has been shown to be involved in 2-thiouridine formation of 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (24Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). YDL033 is a yeast homolog of MnmA and has been predicted to be located in mitochondria (Saccharomyces Genome Database). 3Available at www.yeastgenome.org. Therefore, in mitochondria, it seems likely that Nfs1p cooperates with YDL033 to modify mt-tRNAs by incorporating a sulfur atom derived from l-cysteine. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, in addition to the thio-modification of mt-tRNAs, Nfs1p is also involved in the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs. This phenomenon is quite intriguing, as Nfs1p has never been detected in the cytosolic fraction in yeast, so direct involvement of mitochondrial Nfs1p in the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs seems unlikely. From this point of view, it should be noted that impairment of the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs following depletion of Nfs1p seemed to be somehow delayed compared with the immediate defect in the thio-modification of mt-tRNAs. One possible explanation is that, compared with the thio-modified mt-tRNAs, thio-modified cy-tRNAs are more stable, and their turnover is quite slow in vivo, despite the fact that we could observe de novo synthesis of thio-modified tRNAs (mostly cy-tRNAs) as early as 30 min after addition of l-[35S]cysteine. We previously showed that a trace amount of the nuclear version of Nfs1p is needed for an as yet unknown essential function besides ISC formation (14Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that nuclear Nfs1p might be involved in the thio-modification of cy-tRNA during the process of tRNA maturation in the nucleus. On the other hand, another pathway that incorporates inorganic sulfur compounds such as ammonium sulfate is unlikely, as the presence of excess sulfate in glucose medium did not influence the impairment of the thio-modification of cy-tRNAUUULys2 under the Nfs1p-limiting condition (Fig. 5). Alternatively, if a certain ISC protein is involved in the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs, and if mitochondrial Nfs1p is responsible for ISC synthesis, Nfs1p depletion may indirectly impair the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs. This would be similar to the case in E. coli for the iron-sulfur protein MiaB, which produces an IscS-dependent methylthio-modification of 2-methylthio-N6-isopentanyladenosine at position 37 in E. coli tRNA (26Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that iscS deletion results in a defect in the methylthio-modification in E. coli (44Pierrel F. Björk G.R. Fontecave M. Atta M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is not known whether E. coli IscS is directly involved in the methylthio-modification or is just responsible for the biosynthesis of MiaB. Another possibility is that sulfur atoms found in thionucleotides of cy-tRNAs are generated by Nfs1p-mediated cysteine desulfuration in mitochondria and are then transported outside via an as yet unknown pathway. We observed that the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs seemed to be prolonged in the Nfs1p-depleted cells grown under non-fermentative conditions, where mitochondria were well developed, suggesting that mitochondrial development might further increase such accumulation of any sulfur-containing metabolite. In the case of cytoplasmic iron-sulfur protein maturation, cluster-containing sulfur atoms are delivered via mitochondrial ISC biosynthesis machinery, and mitochondrial glutathione and at least two mitochondrial proteins, Atm1p and Erv1p, have been found to be required in this pathway (7Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 45Lange H. Kispal G. Kaut A. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These mitochondrial factors, including some possible small sulfur-containing nonproteinaceous factors, might also be involved in the sulfur delivery system for cy-tRNAs. In addition, delayed impairment of the thio-modification of cy-tRNAs following Nfs1p depletion might be due to cytoplasmic accumulation of any sulfur-containing intermediate metabolite(s) for a pathway located down-stream of the reaction of mitochondrial Nfs1p. Such accumulated metabolites could be used as sulfur donors in the absence of Nfs1p. Further study will be required to test these hypotheses and to identify any additional components required for these thio-modifications. Bacterial IscS is involved in all thio-modifications of tRNAs, raising the possibility that yeast Nfs1p may also be involved in other thio-modifications of both cy- and mt-tRNAs. Future studies should investigate whether Nfs1p is indispensable in other thio-modifications. Yeast Nfs1p was first identified as a protein involved in tRNA splicing in vivo (47Kolman C. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the relationship between Nfs1p function and tRNA splicing has not yet been elucidated. We hope that the actions of Nfs1p in tRNA thio-modification demonstrated in this study may shed some light on this problem, which we will address in the future.

Here we report the use of helix-capping motifs to confer salt resistance upon helical antimicrobial peptides. The helical content of the template peptide [RLLR]5 was almost completely destroyed at salt concentrations over 200 mm NaCl, leading to a 8–32-fold decrease in antimicrobial activity. However, the introduction of helix-capping motifs at the helix termini resulted in a structurally stable peptide, which retained membrane-permeabilizing and antimicrobial activities upon exposure to salt. Furthermore, the peptide with helix-capping motifs directly inhibited the in vivo growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes localized fasciitis in mice, and prevented the necrosis of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous muscle layers. Results indicate that the adoption of helix-capping motifs into salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptides provides the necessary structural stability for the peptides to permeabilize cell membranes and cause cell death at physiological salt concentrations.

Results indicate that the adoption of helix-capping motifs into salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptides provides the necessary structural stability for the peptides to permeabilize cell membranes and cause cell death at physiological salt concentrations. The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens is a serious problem, and extensive efforts have been focused on the development of new classes of antimicrobial agents (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Google Scholar). One major class comprises amphipathic α-helical antimicrobial peptides identified in a variety of organisms ranging from plants and insects to animals (2Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immun. 1995; 13: 61-92Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides are often the first line of defense against invading pathogens and play an important role in innate immunity (3Hancock R.E.W. Scott M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8856-8861Google Scholar). These cationic peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi (4Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Google Scholar). Many antimicrobial peptides appear to act via specific but not receptor-mediated permeabilization of microbial membranes. This confers considerable potential for their development as novel therapeutic agents to overcome the resistance problem (5Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Google Scholar). Numerous studies have focused on discovering novel antimicrobial peptides, elucidating their mechanisms of action, establishing structure-activity relationships, and modulating therapeutic properties with a view to develop these peptides as therapeutic agents (5Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Google Scholar, 6Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Google Scholar, 7Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Google Scholar, 8Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 71-87Google Scholar). The salt sensitivity of antimicrobial peptides is a major obstacle in their development as novel agents. As shown by Goldman et al. (9Goldman M.J. Anderson G.M. Stolzenberg E.D. Kari U.P. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 553-560Google Scholar), defensins, which are endogenous antimicrobial peptides in the epithelial surfaces of the lung, become inactive in the presence of high salt concentrations in bronchopulmonary fluids, leading to pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Such salt sensitivity is additionally observed in various other antimicrobial peptides including indolicidins, gramicidins, bactenecins, and magainins (10Wu M. Maier E. Benz R. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7235-7242Google Scholar, 11Lee I.H. Cho Y. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2898-2903Google Scholar). Although a number of studies report on salt-resistant α-helical antimicrobial peptides (11Lee I.H. Cho Y. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2898-2903Google Scholar,12Friedrich C. Scott M.G. Karunaratne N. Yan H. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1542-1548Google Scholar), the factors that determine the salt sensitivity of these peptides remain to be elucidated. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no rationale has been proposed as yet for the systematic design of salt-resistant α-helical antimicrobial peptides without using unnatural amino acids. The structural features of α-helical antimicrobial peptides have been studied in detail including helicity, hydrophobic moment, hydrophobicity, net charge, charge distribution, and amphipathicity (5Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Google Scholar, 8Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 71-87Google Scholar). Interestingly, helix stability is not currently considered a significant parameter in the mechanism of action of these peptides. Because many antimicrobial peptides require an α-helical conformation upon interactions with cell membranes to exert activity, we hypothesize that helix stability plays an important role in the antimicrobial action of these peptides. An α-helix, by definition, is characterized by consecutive main-chain i → i+4 hydrogen bonds between each carbonyl oxygen and an amide hydrogen from the adjacent helical turn (13Pauling L. Corey R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1951; 37: 241-250Google Scholar). This pattern is discontinued at the helix termini, because no further turn of helix is present to provide the additional hydrogen bond partners. Helix-capping motifs, which have specific patterns of hydrogen bondings and hydrophobic interactions found at or near the ends of helices in both proteins and peptides (14Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Google Scholar), provide the necessary intramolecular interactions to stabilize α-helices. In this study, we determine the changes in structure, antimicrobial activity, and salt sensitivity of α-helical antimicrobial peptides following the introduction of capping motifs at the helix termini. Microorganisms—The microorganisms used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and included: Bacillus subtilis ATCC 62037; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 15752; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175; Escherichia coli ATCC 27325; Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17426; Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076; Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC 34881; Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 44774; and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Streptococcus pyogenes A77 was a gift from Dr. J. Y. Kong (Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology). Peptide Preparation—Peptides, either free or biotinylated at the N termini, were synthesized by solid phase methods using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protected amino acids on a MilliGen 9050 (Millipore) peptide synthesizer. Synthesized peptides were purified to over 98% homogeneity by preparative reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm, Delta Pak, Millipore) using a linear gradient of 25–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 40 min and assessed for purity by analytical reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-associated laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI II, Kratos Analytical Instruments). The peptide content of lyophilized samples was determined by quantitative amino acid analyses with a Pico-tag system on a Beckman 121 MB amino acid analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Antimicrobial Activity Assay—The antimicrobial activity of each peptide was determined against nine selected microorganisms using the broth microdilution assay as described by Steinberg et al. (23Steinberg D. Lehrer R.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 78: 169-186Google Scholar). The lowest concentration of peptide that completely inhibited growth was defined as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). 1The abbreviations used are: MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; GAS, group A streptococcus; CFU, colony-forming unit; CD, circular dichroism; NPN, 1-N-phenylnapthylamine; ONPG, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; NAPB, sodium phosphate buffer. MIC values were calculated as an average of independent experiments performed in triplicate. Where required, NaCl was added to each well of the 96-well plate to obtain the desired salt concentration. Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD spectra were obtained using a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). Each spectrum (190–250 nm) was an average of five scans using a quartz cell with a 1-mm path length at room temperature. The scanning speed was 100 nm/min at a step size of 0.1 nm, a 2-s response time, and 1.0-nm bandwidth. Spectra were measured either in the presence or absence of NaCl in 20 mm SDS. A blank spectrum of a sample containing all of the components with the exception of peptides was subtracted from individual spectra to account for the base line. The α-helical content was estimated as described previously by Greenfield and Fasman (24Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Google Scholar). Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Peptide localization in E. coli was detected according to the procedure of Park et al. (25Park C.B. Kim H.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 253-257Google Scholar). E. coli cells (105 colony forming units (CFU)) in mid-logarithmic phase were incubated with biotinylated peptides (at MIC) in the presence or absence of NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (NAPB) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, cells were washed with 10 mm NAPB and immobilized on a glass slide. Cells were treated briefly with 0.2% Triton X-100/NAPB. Biotin-labeled peptides were visualized using 20 μg/ml streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Applied Science) and observed with a Carl Zeiss LSM 410 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 488-nm bandpass filter. Membrane Permeabilization Assays—The outer membrane permeabilization activity of peptides was determined using the 1-N-phenylnapthylamine (NPN) uptake assay as described by Falla et al. (18Falla T.J. Karunaratne D.N. Hancock R.E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19298-19303Google Scholar). An overnight culture of E. coli was transferred to fresh LB medium and grown to A600 of 0.5–0.6. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in the same volume of buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm KCN). To 1-ml cells, 20 μl of 0.5 mm NPN was mixed and peptide samples (at MIC) were added after 30 s. The increase in fluorescence as a result of partitioning of NPN into the outer membrane was measured 2 min after the addition of peptides using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco Model 8100). The extent of cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization was determined by measurement of β-galactosidase activity in E. coli ML-35 using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG), a non-membrane-permeative chromogenic substrate (19Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 553-561Google Scholar,20Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Gennaro R. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3724-3730Google Scholar). Mid-logarithmic phase E. coli cells were washed in 10 mm NAPB, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer with 1.5 mm ONPG. The hydrolysis of ONPG to o-nitrophenol over time was monitored spectrophotometrically at 420 nm following the addition of peptide samples at MIC. Assays were additionally performed in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) Infection Model—The in vivo antimicrobial activity of the peptides was evaluated by the air pouch GAS infection model (21Kuo C. Wu J. Lin K. Tsai P. Lee S. Jun Y. Lei H. Lin Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3931-3935Google Scholar). Groups of five 4-week-old male ICR mice were anesthetized by injection, chemically depilated of the hair in the backs, and then injected subcutaneously with 1 ml of air to form an air pouch. Bacterial suspension (0.1 ml) containing 4.5 × 10 (4Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Google Scholar) CFUs of S. pyogenes A77 at mid-logarithmic growth phase (100% lethal dose) was inoculated into the air pouch. In peptide inhibition experiments, the mice were given an air pouch injection of the peptide (40 mg/kg mice) immediately following S. pyogenes injection. The animals were observed for a total of 7 days, and survival curves were determined. Two days after the inoculation, bacteria in the air pouch were collected and counted and tissues around the air pouch were excised, fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. The 5-μm-thick tissues were sliced, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and subjected to histological analysis. Peptide Design—[RLLR]5, a peptide consisting of five repeats of RLLR (15Park C.B. Yi K.S. Matsuzaki K. Kim S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8245-8250Google Scholar), was synthesized as a template peptide because it exhibited strong antimicrobial activity and α-helical structure. To determine the effect of helix stabilization on antimicrobial activity under high salt conditions, analogs were synthesized in which the helix-capping motifs, APKAM (N) and LQKKGI (C) (14Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Google Scholar), were introduced into either or both the N- and C-terminal ends of [RLLR]n (n = 2–5) (data not shown). Analogs with comparable length, charge, and activity as [RLLR]5 were selected to study the effect of helix stabilization on antimicrobial activity (Table I). Among the numerous helix-capping motifs reported, APKAM and LQKKGI were selected on the basis of short length, net-positive charge, and amphipathicity modeled on the Edmundson wheel diagram and Swiss-PDBViewer (16Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). The N-terminal capping motif, APKAM, designed according to the sequence pattern of an extended capping box, forms a “hydrophobic staple” between the side chains of alanine and methionine (14Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Google Scholar, 17Muñoz V. Blanco F.J. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Google Scholar). The C-terminal helix-capping motif, LQKKGI, which belongs to the Schellman motif family (14Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Google Scholar), contains a hydrogen bond between the amide group of leucine and the carbonyl group of isoleucine and between the amide group of glutamine backbone and carbonyl group of glycine. The associated hydrophobic interactions within this motif are between leucine and isoleucine. To determine the effects of either N- or C-terminal capping on helical stability and antimicrobial activity, N-[RLLR]3 and [RLLR]3-C were synthesized. In addition, N-[RLLR]2-C was designed to analyze the combined effect of the N- and C-terminal helix capping. A truncated analog, TN-[RLLR]2-TC, similar to N-[RLLR]2-C except that the residues Ala-1 and Ile-19 were deleted, was also synthesized to study the roles of hydrogen bondings and associated hydrophobic interactions in the helix-capping motifs. To determine the applicability of the helix capping in natural antimicrobial peptides, an N-Mag-C analog was designed where the APKAM and LQKKGI motifs were introduced at the N- and C-terminal ends of the salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptide, magainin 2, respectively (11Lee I.H. Cho Y. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2898-2903Google Scholar).Table IAmino acid sequences of helix-capping analogsPeptideAmino acid sequence[RLLR]5RLLRRLLRRLLRRLLRRLLRN-[RLLR]3APKAMRLLRRLLRRLLR[RLLR]3-CRLLRRLLRRLLRLQKKGIN-[RLLR]2-CAPKAMRLLRRLLRLQKKGITN-[RLLR]2-TCPKAMRLLRRLLRLQKKGN-Mag-CAPKAMHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMLQKKGIMagainin 2GIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS Open table in a new tab Antimicrobial Activity and Structural Stability—Under standard antimicrobial activity assay conditions, all of the peptides designed with RLLR repeats had similar MIC values against bacteria and fungi in the range of 0.5–4 μg/ml (Table II). However, in the presence of 100 or 200 mm NaCl, all of the peptides wit the exception of N-[RLLR]2-C displayed a substantial decrease in MIC. The template peptide [RLLR]5 exhibited the greatest salt sensitivity, whereby antimicrobial potency was reduced by up to 32-fold in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. The loss of antimicrobial activity of [RLLR]5 in conditions of high salt was accompanied by disruption of the α-helical structure, as revealed by the α-helical content calculated from CD analyses (Table III and Fig. 1). The α-helical content of [RLLR]5 was reduced from 72% in the absence of salt to 13% in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. The adoption of only one helix-capping motif, either at the N or C terminus, resulted in slightly less salt-sensitive peptides that displayed a 4–16-fold decrease in antimicrobial activity in salt conditions. Upon the addition of 200 mm NaCl, the antimicrobial activity and α-helical content of N-[RLLR]3 decreased by 4–8-fold and 43%, respectively, and those of [RLLR]3-C decreased by 8–16-fold and 46%, respectively (Tables II and III). In contrast to the above peptides, the salt-resistant helix-capping analog N-[RLLR]2-C displayed almost identical antimicrobial activity and <4% change in α-helical content at the salt concentrations examined. The MIC values of the above peptides were not determined at or above 300 mm NaCl because of the slow growth rate of microorganisms at these salt concentrations. However, CD analyses revealed that N-[RLLR]2-C maintained α-helical content up to 300 mm NaCl followed by a rapid decrease (data not shown). In addition, the trend of peptides without helix-capping motifs being salt-sensitive and ones with the helix-capping motifs being salt-resistant was also observed with peptides having 3–5 repeats (RLLR) (data not shown).Table IIAntimicrobial activities of helix-capping analogs Asterisk represents NaCl concentration (in mm).MicroorganismMIC[RLLR]5N-[RLLR]3[RLLR]3-CN-[RLLR]2-CTN-[RLLR]2-TCN-Mag-CMagainin 20*200020002000200020002000200μg/mlGram-positive bacteria B. subtilis23221643211464646464>128 S. aureus46421646422464646464>128 S. mutans23243246411264128128128>128Gram-negative bacteria E. coli432216232114646464128>128 P. putida26443246411264646464>128 S. enteritidis13221643211132323232>128Fungi C. neoformans1322162320.50.5264161616128 S. cerevisiae132284320.50.5132323232>128 C. albicans132182320.50.5132323232>128 Open table in a new tab Table IIIα-Helical content of helix-capping analogs Asterisk represents NaCl concentration.Peptide% α-Helix0*200mm[RLLR]57213N-[RLLR]36421[RLLR]3-C6014N-[RLLR]2-C6158TN-[RLLR]2-TC6415N-Mag-C4442Magainin 24812 Open table in a new tab Cellular Localization and Mechanism of Action—To determine the localization site of the analogs in E. coli, biotin-labeled peptides were incubated with bacteria and visualized with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. N-[RLLR]2-C localized to the cell membrane, regardless of the salt concentrations. However, [RLLR]5 was not detected in E. coli at 200 mm NaCl (Fig. 2). Peptide localization to the cell membrane suggests that these α-helical antimicrobial peptides exert antimicrobial activity by permeabilization of the cell membranes. To confirm this possibility, an NPN uptake assay was performed to measure the permeabilization of the outer membrane. NPN, a hydrophobic probe that fluoresceses weakly in aqueous environments and strongly in hydrophobic environments, partitions only into the permeabilized outer cell membrane (18Falla T.J. Karunaratne D.N. Hancock R.E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19298-19303Google Scholar). The fluorescence emitted as a result of partitioning of NPN into the outer membrane upon addition of [RLLR]5 and N-[RLLR]2-C was similar in intensity in the absence of salt (Fig. 3A). However, in the presence of 200 mm NaCl, the fluorescence level of the [RLLR]5 mixture decreased by 80%, whereas the levels of N-[RLLR]2-C mixtures decreased by only 6%. This finding implies that N-[RLLR]2-C is able to permeabilize the outer cell membrane, regardless of salt concentrations, whereas the permeabilizing activity of [RLLR]5 is severely inhibited in the presence of salt. Permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane was measured next to determine whether this is targeted by the analogs used in this study, which would result in membrane depolarization, dissolution of the electrical potential gradient, and eventual cell death. The degree of cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization was analyzed by measuring the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, ONPG, by cytoplasmic β-galactosidase in E. coli ML-35 (19Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 553-561Google Scholar, 20Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Gennaro R. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3724-3730Google Scholar). Both [RLLR]5 and N-[RLLR]2-C displayed similar cytoplasmic membrane-permeabilizing activity in the absence of salt (Fig. 3B). However, upon the addition of 200 mm NaCl, [RLLR]5 almost completely lost activity (over 91%). N-[RLLR]2-C alone displayed salt-independent cytoplasmic membrane-permeabilizing activity. Cellular localization and membrane-permeabilizing analyses of the analogs collectively revealed that in the presence of salt, sensitive peptides such as [RLLR]5 lost their ability to bind the bacterial cell membrane and were subsequently unable to permeabilize either the outer or cytoplasmic membranes. In contrast, salt-resistant peptides such as N-[RLLR]2-C bound and permeabilized both the outer and cytoplasmic membranes causing cell death even in the presence of high salt concentrations.Fig. 3Outer and cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization assay. A, a 20-ml volume of NPN (0.5 mm) was added to 1 ml of E. coli cells in buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm KCN). Peptide samples (at MIC) were added 30 s later. The increase in fluorescence as a result of NPN partitioning into the outer membrane was measured 2 min after the addition of the peptides using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. B, mid-logarithmic phase E. coli cells were washed in 10 mm NAPB, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer with 1.5 mm ONPG. The hydrolysis of ONPG to o-nitrophenol over time was monitored spectrophotometrically at 420 nm after the addition of the peptide samples (at MIC). White and gray bars represent the absence and presence of 200 mm NaCl, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Evaluation and Application of Helix-capping Motifs—To assess the helix-stabilizing property of the capping motifs, APKAM and LQKKGI, truncated analog TN-[RLLR]2-TC with deleted Ala-1 and Ile-19 residues were designed to destroy the inherent hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. As shown in Table II, the MIC values of TN-[RLLR]2-TC against the microorganisms tested ranged between 1 and 4 μg/ml in the absence of salt. However, the addition of 100 and 200 mm NaCl decreased the antimicrobial activity of TN-[RLLR]2-TC by up to 16-fold. As observed with [RLLR]5, the decrease in antimicrobial activity of TN-[RLLR]2-TC was associated with decreased α-helical content (Table III). In the presence of 200 mm NaCl, the α-helical content of TN-[RLLR]2-TC was reduced by 49%. In addition, decreased structural stability led to poor membrane binding, and the localization of TN-[RLLR]2-TC in E. coli was not detected (Fig. 2). The outer and cytoplasmic membrane-permeabilizing activities of TN-[RLLR]2-TC were drastically reduced by 85 and 90%, respectively, when 200 mm NaCl was added (Fig. 3). Helix-capping motifs were introduced into magainin 2, a salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptide isolated from Xenopus laevis (11Lee I.H. Cho Y. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2898-2903Google Scholar), to test their applicability in designing salt-resistant antimicrobial peptides. The resulting peptide, N-Mag-C, displayed salt concentration-independent antimicrobial activity and 42–44% α-helical content at the salt concentrations tested. In contrast, magainin 2 was inactive against most of the microorganisms tested and lost 36% α-helical content upon the addition of 200 mm NaCl to the assay. In Vivo Antimicrobial Activity—In the air pouch model of GAS infection (21Kuo C. Wu J. Lin K. Tsai P. Lee S. Jun Y. Lei H. Lin Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3931-3935Google Scholar), inoculation of 4.5 × 104 CFUs of S. pyogenes A77 (100% lethal dose at 96 h; LD100) caused suppuration, bleeding around the air pouch, and partial paralysis before death. The in vivo antimicrobial activity of the peptides was evaluated in GAS-induced infection by observing the survival rate of the mice after inoculation. S. pyogenes caused 60 and 100% mortality at 72 and 96 h, respectively, in the control group of mice (Fig. 4). Mice treated with [RLLR]5 after the inoculation showed similar survival rates as the control group. In contrast, mice treated with N-[RLLR]2-C showed 100% survival rate during the observance period. The bacterial count of S. pyogenes 48 h after the inoculation showed that the air pouches of mice in the control group and those treated with [RLLR]5 contained 5–5.5 × 107 CFUs, a 1000-fold increase from the initial innoculum, whereas only 1.2 × 102 CFUs remained in the air pouches of mice treated with N-[RLLR]2-C. Histological analysis of the skin around the air pouches showed that the inoculation of S. pyogenes caused the necrosis of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous muscle layers (Fig. 5B). However, the same tissues remained intact in the air pouches of mice treated with N-[RLLR]2-C (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Inhibition of GAS-induced tissue necrosis.

The motifs, APKAM and LQKKGI, were selected to maximize the net-positive charge while maintaining the amphipathicity of the analogs, both of which are important factors in antimicrobial activity. Analogs containing helix-capping motifs at either the N or C terminus, specifically N-[RLLR]3 and [RLLR]3-C, exhibited marginal improvement in structural stability and antimicrobial activity in the presence of high salt compared with [RLLR]5. Fraying of the helix termini, which results in the loss of α-helical content, occurs at both ends of the peptide molecules. Consequently, introducing a helix-capping motif at only one end would not fully prevent the peptide from structural destabilization. Indeed, N-[RLLR]2-C containing helix-capping motifs at both the N and C termini, displayed significantly stronger structural stability upon exposure to 200 mm NaCl and retained antimicrobial activity. TN-[RLLR]2-TC was examined to confirm the structural features of the helix-capping motifs that confer salt resistance upon α-helical peptides. Deletion of Ala-1 from the N-terminal motif and Ile-19 from the C-terminal motif caused a dramatic 32-fold decrease in the antimicrobial activity of peptides in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. These results indicate that the helix-stabilizing property of these motifs is responsible for structural integrity of the peptides at high salt concentrations and salt-resistant antimicrobial activity. The current exponential increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides have been extensively studied in recent years as promising candidates but present several obstacles in their development as pharmaceutical compounds. One of these major problems is salt sensitivity (9Goldman M.J. Anderson G.M. Stolzenberg E.D. Kari U.P. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 553-560Google Scholar). Efficacy is greatly reduced in the presence of high salt, which hinders the development of antimicrobials as systemic agents. Friedrich et al. (12Friedrich C. Scott M.G. Karunaratne N. Yan H. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1542-1548Google Scholar) and Lee et al. (11Lee I.H. Cho Y. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2898-2903Google Scholar) report on salt-resistant α-helical antimicrobial peptides. To date, no clear rationale has been presented for the observed salt resistance in these peptides. Salt sensitivity may be attributed to the hindering of electrostatic interactions between positively charged peptides and negatively charged membranes. However, this alone does not explain why certain peptides are salt-resistant, whereas others with a similar net charge are not. Tam et al. (22Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7159-7169Google Scholar) suggest that conformational rigidity increases antimicrobial activity under high salt concentrations. The group designed salt-resistant antimicrobial peptides by introducing rigid structural constraints into β-tile template peptides. Although there are numerous reports on the significance of structure, amphipathicity, positive charges, and hydrophobicity for the activity and mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides (5Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Google Scholar,8Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 71-87Google Scholar), the importance of structural stability of the α-helical peptides remains to be clarified. The ability of a peptide to configure into a well defined amphipathic α-helix is strongly correlated to antimicrobial activity (5Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Google Scholar). The formation of α-helical structures upon interaction with bacterial membranes and subsequent membrane permeabilization are believed to be one of the key steps in the mechanism of action of these α-helical antimicrobial peptides. We hypothesize that the decreased antimicrobial activity of peptides under high salt conditions is a result of limitation of this key step of the mechanism. It is possible that imperfect amphipathicity of peptides may cause salt sensitivity. However, our study showed that, among the peptides with the RLLR repeats, only those with helix-capping motifs at the N and C termini show salt resistance. Furthermore, the salt-resistant peptides reported in other studies (11Lee I.H. Cho Y. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2898-2903Google Scholar, 12Friedrich C. Scott M.G. Karunaratne N. Yan H. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1542-1548Google Scholar) also do not have perfect amphipathic structures. Hence, although imperfect amphipathicity may contribute to the salt sensitivity, it is not the major factor. The results in Tables II and III clearly demonstrate that salt sensitivity of antimicrobial peptides is a result of the destruction of α-helical structure and subsequent loss of membrane binding and permeabilizing activity. This observation may also explain why some peptides are reported to be salt-resistant, whereas others with a similar sequence and net charge are salt-sensitive. The applicability of the above helix-capping motifs in designing salt-resistant antimicrobial peptides was examined by introducing the motifs at both termini of magainin 2, a salt-sensitive peptide. The resulting peptide, N-Mag-C, maintained activity and structural stability at the salt concentrations tested. Thus, it is possible that with consideration, although not exclusively, to net charge and amphipathicity, salt-resistant analogs can be derived from a salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptide by the application of helix-capping motifs. Furthermore, the in vivo antimicrobial activity of N-[RLLR]2-C was demonstrated in an air pouch model, which mimics localized fasciitis (21Kuo C. Wu J. Lin K. Tsai P. Lee S. Jun Y. Lei H. Lin Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3931-3935Google Scholar). N-[RLLR]2-C inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes and prevented the necrosis of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous muscle layers and subsequent death of mice, whereas [RLLR]5 was unable to inhibit the bacterial growth. Thus, the introduction of helix-capping motifs into salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptides can alter the properties of the peptides to become salt-resistant and suitable for in vivo applications. This study was performed to elucidate the mechanism underlying salt sensitivity in antimicrobial peptides and provide a rationale for the systematic design of salt-resistant peptides. The data collectively suggest that structural instability, in addition to the electrostatic interactions, is mainly responsible for salt sensitivity. Furthermore, the implementation of helix-capping motifs into salt-sensitive antimicrobial peptides resulted in analogs efficient in binding and permeabilizing microbial cell membranes at or above physiological salt concentrations."

The aim of this work was to examine the effects of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz on adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. When induced to differentiate in the presence of efavirenz (5–50 μm), 3T3-F442A preadipocytes failed to accumulate cytoplasmic triacylglycerol droplets. This phenomenon was rapidly reversible and was also readily detectable in the 3T3-L1 preadipose cell line and in primary cultures of human preadipocytes. When applied to mature 3T3-F442A adipocytes, efavirenz induced a delayed and moderate reduction in cell triglyceride content. Measurement of [3H]deoxyglucose uptake, basal and agonist-stimulated lipolysis, and cell viability indicated that these pathways are not involved in efavirenz effects on triacylglycerol accumulation. By contrast, we found that the NNRTI induced a dramatic dose- and time-dependent decrease in gene and protein expression of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Adipose conversion was only altered at the highest efavirenz concentrations, as suggested by the mild reduction in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β remained unchanged. The inhibition of SREBP-1c expression was accompanied by a sharp reduction in the expression of SREBP-1c target genes and in the adipocyte lipogenic activity in efavirenz-treated cells. Finally, the inhibitory effect of efavirenz on cell triglyceride accumulation was prevented by directly providing free fatty acids to the cells and was reversed by overexpression of a dominant positive form of SREBP-1c, reinforcing the implication of this transcription factor in the antilipogenic effect of the drug. When considered together, these results demonstrate for the first time that the NNRTI efavirenz induces a strong inhibition of the SREBP-1c-dependent lipogenic pathway that might contribute to adipose tissue atrophy.

Squires K.E. Hughes M.D. Grimes J.M. Demeter L.M. Currier J.S. Eron Jr., J.J. Feinberg J.E. Balfour Jr., H.H. Deyton L.R. Chodakewitz J.A. Fischl M.A. N. Engl. J.

Intensive therapy of HIV infection with HAART, which combines various protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), dramatically reduces viral load and increases CD4 T cell count (1Hammer S.M. Squires K.E. Hughes M.D. Grimes J.M. Demeter L.M. Currier J.S. Eron Jr., J.J. Feinberg J.E. Balfour Jr., H.H. Deyton L.R. Chodakewitz J.A. Fischl M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Whereas a successful control of HIV infection is now possible, withdrawal of HAART leads to a prompt recovery of viremia (3Finzi D. Blankson J. Siliciano J.D. Margolick J.B. Chadwick K. Pierson T. Smith K. Lisziewicz J. Lori F. Flexner C. Quinn T.C. Chaisson R.E. Rosenberg E. Walker B. Gange S. Gallant J. Siliciano R.F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar), thus implying a prolonged and potentially life-long treatment to prevent viral replication. Currently, the recommended therapy for HIV-infected patients includes one or two PIs combined with two NRTI or two NRTI combined with one NNRTI. Blockade of the HIV protease inhibits cleavage and maturation of the viral polyprotein precursor, leading to production of noninfectious viral particles (4Flexner C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The HIV reverse transcriptase is required to copy the viral RNA genome and is targeted either by chain-terminating analogues (NRTI) or by noncompetitive inhibitors (NNRTI) (5Beach J.W. Clin. Ther. 1998; 20: 2-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, long term HAART has been associated with a unique and unexpected lipodystrophic syndrome involving altered body fat distribution and disturbances of glucose and lipid metabolism (6Miller K.D.

Most patients receiving this treatment develop metabolic abnormalities, which include dyslipidemia (elevated plasma triglycerides and cholesterol), increased visceral and dorsocervical adipose tissue, and peripheral lipoatrophy. These patients were also found to have elevated fasting insulin or C-peptide levels (9Carr A. Samaras K. Thorisdottir A. Kaufmann G.R. Chisholm D.J. Cooper D.A.

It is now recognized that patients receiving an antiretroviral therapy have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (9Carr A. Samaras K. Thorisdottir A. Kaufmann G.R. Chisholm D.J. Cooper D.A.

Which component of the antiretroviral regimen or whether the HIV infection itself is responsible for the HAART-associated metabolic syndrome is still a matter of controversy. Emergence of the syndrome has been correlated temporally with the widespread use of PIs, but similar symptoms have been observed in therapy naive HIV-infected patients (13Kotler D.P. Rosenbaum K. Wang J. Pierson R.N. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1999; 20: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and in patients receiving treatments excluding PIs (14Lo J.C. Mulligan K. Tai V.W. Algren H. Schambelan M. Lancet. 1998; 351: 867-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 15Madge S. Kinloch-de-Loes S. Mercey D.

AIDS. 1999; 13: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the onset of the syndrome may represent a complex response to independent factors, such as a specific drug or a combination of drugs, long lasting viral infection, or effective viral suppression. Studies on healthy subjects or on HIV-infected patients who have never received PIs have shown that dyslipidemia and insulin resistance can occur several months before the emergence of lipodystrophy (7Carr A. Samaras K. Burton S. Law M. Freund J. Chisholm D.J. Cooper D.A. AIDS. 1998; 12: F51-F58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar, 9Carr A. Samaras K. Thorisdottir A. Kaufmann G.R. Chisholm D.J.

Conversely, glycemic and lipidic disturbances are also observed in genetic syndromes of generalized or partial lipodystrophy (17Garg A. Am. J.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar), suggesting that an initial lack of adipogenesis or a loss in adipose tissue may be involved in insulin resistance and metabolic complications. A considerable sum of works has highlighted the molecular mechanisms of adipogenesis (21Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocyte differentiation involves a sequential and coordinated action of several transcription factors that, in turn, regulate the expression of adipocyte-specific genes and proteins. At least two classes of transcription factors serve key roles in the regulation of adipogenesis, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Following the initial and transient increase in C/EBPβ and -δ, PPARγ and C/EBPα promote the expression of a number of adipose-specific markers, allowing acquisition of an enlarged rounded shape and the progressive accumulation of cytoplasmic triacylglycerol droplets. In addition, adipocyte differentiation is enhanced by the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c/adipocyte determination and differentiation factor-1 (SREBP-1c/ADD1). SREBP-1c promotes lipogenic enzyme gene expression (22Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 23Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B.

Fruchart J.C. Briggs M. Spiegelman B.M. Auwerx J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and stimulates production of an unknown PPARγ ligand (26Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Thus, PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c act in concert to induce and maintain the adipocyte phenotype. Since the adverse effects of a single compound on a given tissue or cell type are difficult to determine in patients receiving a combination of several classes of antiretroviral drugs, in vitro models have been used to examine the exact influence of these treatments on adipocyte development or metabolism. In this regard, contradictory results have been published, few studies showing a positive effect (27Gagnon A. Angel J.B. Sorisky A.

The most common side effects encountered with NNRTI are cutaneous rash and central nervous system disturbances such as dizziness, whereas these compounds are generally well tolerated at the metabolic level. However, recent works have reported that treatment with the NNRTI efavirenz can be associated with dyslipidemia (49Hsieh S.M. Hung C.C. Lu P.L. Chen M.Y. Chang S.C. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 2000; 24: 287-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Doser N. Sudre P. Telenti A. Wietlisbach V. Nicod P. Darioli R. Mooser V. J. Acquired Immune Defic.

Treluyer J.M. Bui P. Calvez V. Peytavin G. AIDS. 2002; 16: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to examine whether efavirenz alters adipocyte development and metabolism. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that efavirenz primarily reduces cell triglyceride accumulation in several in vitro systems of adipogenesis, including a human model. This effect of efavirenz on triglyceride stores seems essentially related to a decrease in SREBP-1c expression, with a consecutive alteration in the lipogenic pathway. Subjects—Adipose tissue samples were obtained from deep (mesenteric) or abdominal subcutaneous deposits from men (age 56 ± 6 years) or women (age 69 ± 3 years) undergoing surgical intervention. Body mass index ranged from 22.9 to 32.4 kg/m2, and subjects had no metabolic or endocrine diseases. This study was approved by local ethics committee. Cell Culture and Treatment—Murine 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were grown until confluence at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) with 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin). After confluence, 3T3-F442A adipose conversion was obtained in the presence of the same culture medium supplemented with 170 nm insulin. 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation was initiated by the addition of 100 μm methyl-isobutylxanthine, 170 nm insulin, and 250 nm dexamethasone for 48 h, and then cells were refed by DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 170 nm insulin. Human preadipocytes were obtained from adipose tissue samples by collagenase digestion as previously described (53Dieudonne M.N. Pecquery R. Boumediene A. Leneveu M.C. Giudicelli Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1645-C1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The floating adipocytes were discarded, and the infranatant containing the stromal vascular fraction was successively filtered through 150- and 25-μm nylon screens. The filtrate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. After two washes, cells were plated into cell culture dishes at a density of 2–4 × 104 cells/cm2 with DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of air/CO2 (95:5, v/v). After plating, cells were extensively washed and maintained under the same conditions until confluence (3–4 days following plating). To induce human preadipocyte differentiation, cells were then shifted in a chemically defined medium consisting of DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 80 nm insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.2 nm L-T3, 100 nm hydrocortisone, and antibiotics and for the first 3 days with 200 μm methyl-isobutylxanthine and 1 μg/ml troglitazone. When mentioned, cells were cultured in the absence (Me2SO alone) or in the presence of efavirenz (dissolved in Me2SO) at concentrations and periods of time indicated under “Results.” The final concentration of Me2SO never exceeded 0.025%. During the period of efavirenz exposure, the medium was changed daily for control and drug-treated cells. The powdered form of efavirenz was a generous gift of Bristol-Myers Squibb Laboratories. Cell Extracts, Biochemical Determinations, and Enzyme Assays— Cultured preadipose or adipose cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested, and homogenized in Tris (25 mm), pH 7.5, EDTA (1 mm). A fraction of the homogenate was stored at -80 °C. The remaining fraction was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was kept at -80 °C until use. Aliquots of homogenates and supernatants were used to determine protein content by the method of Lowry (54Lowry O. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Triglyceride content was determined on homogenates with PAP150 triglyceride kit (Biomérieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity was assayed by recording the initial rate of oxidation of NADH at 340 nm at 25 °C (55Kozak L.P. Jensen J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7775-7781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed by testing lactate dehydrogenase activity in the culture medium. Media were assayed by measuring the rate of decrease in A340 in the presence of pyruvate, as described earlier (56Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Lipolysis Experiments—Lipolysis was assessed as glycerol release from adherent 3T3-F442A adipocytes in 24-well plates. Adipocyte monolayers were washed with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 12 mm Hepes (KRH) (pH 7.4), supplemented with 1% fatty acid-free BSA, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, and 1 mm ascorbate and 50 μg/ml Na2S2O5 as antioxidants. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the absence or in the presence of 10 μm (-)-isoproterenol or 10 μm forskolin. Aliquots of the incubation medium were removed and frozen at -20 °C until glycerol determination. Glycerol was measured by an enzymatic method using a commercial kit provided by Roche-Biopharm. [3H]Glucose Incorporation in Total Lipids—Measurement of [3H]glucose incorporation in total lipids was used as an index of lipogenic activity. 3T3-F442A cell cultures in 12-well plates were rinsed three times with KRH buffer and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in KRH containing 5 mm [1-3H]d-glucose ([3H]glucose) (1 μCi/well; 1 mCi/mmol; ICN Biochemicals, Orsay, France). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and pelleted by centrifugation. After discarding the supernatant, cell total lipids were extracted by the chloroform/methanol procedure of Folch et al. (57Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid-containing lower chloroform phase was finally evaporated and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Determination of 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—Uptake of glucose was determined using [1,2-3H]deoxyglucose ([3H]DOG) (ICN Biomedicals, Orsay, France), a nonmetabolizable analogue of glucose. 3T3-F442A adipocytes cultured in 12-well plates were rinsed three times with KRH and then preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of the KRH buffer containing 0.1% BSA. When mentioned, insulin was added during this preincubation period 1 h before measurement of hexose transport. Glucose uptake was initiated by the addition of [3H]DOG (0.1 mm; 1 μCi/well). After 5 min at 37 °C, the assay was stopped by aspiration, and cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were solubilized with 1% SDS, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Non-carrier-mediated glucose uptake, estimated by the addition of 10 μm cytochalasin B in parallel wells, accounted for less than 3% of total glucose transport. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 cells by the method of Cathala (58Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) and from human cells by the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (59Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For real time RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was first digested for 15 min at 37 °C with 0.1 units of RNase-free DNase I (RQ1 DNase, Promega)/μg of nucleic acid in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm CaCl2. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA (0.25–1 μg/sample) was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (200 units/μg) (Invitrog"

Homologs for the TSC1 and TSC2 genes have been identified in mouse, rat, Fugu, Drosophila, and in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we show that S. pombe lacking tsc1+ or tsc2+ have similar phenotypes including decreased arginine uptake, decreased expression of three amino acid permeases, and low intracellular levels of four members of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. Recently, the small GTPase Rheb was identified as a target of the GTPase-activating domain of tuberin in mammalian cells and in Drosophila. We show that the defect in arginine uptake in cells lacking tsc2+ is rescued by the expression of a dominant negative form of rhb1+, the Rheb homolog in S. pombe, but not by expressing wild-type rhb1+. Expression of the tsc2+ gene with a patient-derived mutation within the GAP domain did not rescue the arginine uptake defect in tsc2+ mutant yeast. Taken together, these findings support a model in which arginine uptake is regulated through tsc1+, tsc2+, and rhb1+ in S. pombe and also suggest a role for the Tsc1 and Tsc2 proteins in amino acid biosynthesis and sensing.

Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains genes with significant similarity to TSC1 and TSC2, which were named tsc1+ and tsc2+ (24Matsumoto S. Bandyopadhyay A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Maitra U. Matsumoto T. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1053-1063PubMed Google Scholar). The GAP domain of tuberin is particularly highly conserved with 39% identity. In addition to TSC1 and TSC2 homologs, S. pombe also has a Rheb homolog, rhb1+. Loss of rhb1+ in S. pombe results in growth arrest, similar to that caused by nitrogen starvation (25Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar), and loss of farnesylation of the Rhb1 protein has been postulated to regulate arginine uptake in S. pombe (26Yang W. Urano J. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, S. pombe strains lacking tsc1+ (Δtsc1) or tsc2+ (Δtsc2) were shown to have abnormal localization of the amino acid permease c359.03+, suggesting that the S. pombe Tsc1-Tsc2 protein complex regulates protein trafficking (24Matsumoto S. Bandyopadhyay A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Maitra U. Matsumoto T. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1053-1063PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report for the first time that Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 have a defect in arginine uptake, which is regulated through rhb1+ in S. pombe, providing evidence that TSC-Rheb signaling is conserved in S. pombe. A mutation in the GAP domain of tsc2+ at a site corresponding to a patient-derived missense mutation could not rescue the uptake defects, strengthening the relationship of the S. pombe model to human TSC. The transcriptional expression profile and intracellular amino acid levels associated with Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 overlapped extensively, suggesting similar roles for tsc1+ and tsc2+ in S. pombe. These findings support S. pombe as a model for TSC and indicate that the S. pombe Tsc1 and Tsc2 proteins play central roles in amino acid biosynthesis and sensing. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. CHP428 and CHP429 were constructed by Charlie Hoffman (Boston College) and were a gift from Janet Leatherwood (University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). Wild-type strain 972 (27Leupold U.

The kanamycin cassette was amplified from plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6 (a gift from J. Bähler) using primers with 75 extra bases corresponding to sequences immediately upstream of the start codon of the tsc genes and primers whose gene-specific portions correspond to sequences 75 bases downstream of the gene. For gene disruption of tsc1+, the entire open reading frame was deleted from the genome of the haploid strain CHP429 (h-, leu1–32, ura4-D18, ade6–216, his7–366) and replaced by the kanamycin cassette to create MVS5. We will refer to Δtsc1 with this genotype as F15Δtsc1. Δtsc2 was constructed using identical strategy and resulted in MVS6, which will be referred to as F15Δtsc2 in figures and text. Correct integration of the kanamycin cassette into the yeast genome was confirmed by PCR over the integration site, by Southern blotting, and by sequencing. Subsequently, F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 were crossed into the ura4-D18 strain to generate MVS3 (ura4Δtsc1) and MVS4 (ura4Δtsc2) and into wild-type 972 to generate MVS1 (972Δtsc1) and MVS2 (972Δtsc2) using random spore analysis on selective plates. Construction of Plasmids—Tsc1 and Tsc2 expression constructs were generated by a PCR-cloning approach. The tsc1+ and tsc2+ genes were amplified from the cosmids c23F3 and c630C13 (a gift from J. Bähler) using primers with SalI restriction sites and cloned into the pREP4X expression vector (ATCC). The Rhb1 expression construct was generated by PCR of full-length rhb1+ from total cDNA using primers with SalI and XmaI and cloned into pREP4X. After sequence verification, tsc1+, tsc2+, and rhb1+ were inserted in-frame into the HA-tagged pSLF173/273/373 series with different nmt (no message in thiamin) promoter strength (ATCC). The GAP (Tsc2-N1191K) and the Rhb dominant negative (Rhb-D60K) mutations were introduced into the pSLF373 constructs using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression Profiling—Yeast were grown overnight in EMM to early log phase (A595 = 0.2–0.3), and total RNA was isolated by phenol extraction and purified using RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The total RNA of three independent biological samples was pooled (10 μg of each sample), reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 42 °C. The slides were scanned with a GMS 428 scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and spot quantification was performed with the ImaGene software (BioDiscovery, Marina del Rey, CA). Each of the 4976 S. pombe genes was present in duplicate on each slide, and the experiments were repeated using opposite labels (dye-flip), resulting in a total of four measurements for each gene per sample. Genes were considered expressed when all four measurements exceeded a threshold of 3.5 times above the background. A linear regression normalization was applied to the data (30Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32 (suppl.): 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar), and fold changes were calculated. Genes were grouped and annotated on the basis of predicted function in the Proteome Knowledge Library (Incyte, Beverly, MA). Western Blot Analysis—Yeast were grown to mid-log phase (A595 = 0.4–0.6) and washed once in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed in the same buffer with 0.5 mm-glass beads in a BeadBeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). 20 μg of each sample was run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard methods. The immobilized proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used were anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and monoclonal TAT1 for S. pombe tubulin (gift from K. Gull, University of Manchester, United Kingdom). Northern Blot Analysis—10 μg of total RNA was run on a 1% form-aldehyde gel at 60 V for 4 h and transferred to nylon membrane overnight in 20× SSC. Probes for p7G5.06+, c869.10+, isp5+, and gpd3+ were PCR-amplified from cDNA, cleaned over 0.8% agarose gel, and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using standard methods. Hybridizations were performed in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Canavanine Sensitivity—Cells were grown overnight to mid-log phase (A595 = 0.4–0.6), and A595 was adjusted to 0.4 (10,000 cells/μl). 4 μl of 1×, 10×, and 100× dilutions was spotted onto EMM as a growth control or EMM containing canavanine (60 μg/ml) (Sigma) and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Arginine Uptake Assays—Arginine uptake assays were performed in triplicate as described by Urano et al. (31Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11198-11206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were grown in EMM minimal medium with no supplements to mid-log phase. 1 μCi of l-[3H]arginine (40–70 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 100 μm of non-radioactive arginine (Sigma) were added to 25,000 cells in 600 μl of EMM. 200-μl aliquots were removed at 0 and 10 min, injected into 5 ml of deionized water, and immediately subjected to vacuum manifold filtration. Cells were collected on Whatman glass microfiber filters, washed twice, and dried. [3H]Arginine was measured by scintillation counting. Measurements of Intracellular Amino Acid Pools—Protein extracts were prepared as described under Western blot analysis, quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and diluted to 1 μg/μl. Proteins were precipitated by treatment of 100 μl of sample with 100 μl of 10% 5-sulfosalicylic acid at 4 °C for 1 h. The pH value of the supernatant was adjusted to 2.2 with 3 m LiOH. 100 μl of sample was injected into the Biochrom 30 amino acid analyzer (Biochrom, Cambridge, United Kingdom) including a standard amino acid mixture of 10 nm (Sigma). F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 Have Growth Defect—As a first step toward understanding the physiological functions of tsc1+ and tsc2+, we disrupted tsc1+ and tsc2+ in the S. pombe genome by one-step gene replacement. To initiate phenotypic analysis, the F15Δtsc1 strain was mated with the CHP428 strain (h+, leu1–32, ura4-D18, ade6–210, his7–366) and spores were analyzed on yeast extract medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml leucine, uracil, adenine, and histidine (YES). Dissection of asci from heterozygous diploid cells showed that two of four colonies were smaller in size (data not shown). These smaller colonies were found by PCR to be Δtsc1. Similar results were obtained for the F15Δtsc2 strain. The slower growth phenotype on YES medium was quantified in exponential liquid-growing cultures. The generation time (time required for cell population to double) of F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 was ∼5 h compared with 3.5 h for the F15 strain (Fig. 1A). To test whether growth was further affected by temperature stress, F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 were plated on YES plates and incubated at 25 and 37 °C. No temperature-induced growth defect was observed in the F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 strains (Fig. 1B). F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 Are Conditionally Lethal—We found a more severe growth defect in the F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 strains when they were grown on EMM plates. F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 yeast could not grow on EMM supplemented with normal amounts (50 μg/ml) of uracil, histidine, adenine, and leucine, but increasing supplements to 1000 μg/ml partially restored growth (Fig. 1C). These results are in agreement with the previously reported defect in uptake of leucine, adenine, and histidine (24Matsumoto S. Bandyopadhyay A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Maitra U. Matsumoto T. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1053-1063PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that the growth defect was attributed to deletion of the tsc1+ and tsc2+ genes, Tsc1 and Tsc2, expressed from a plasmid with ura4+, were transformed into the F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 strains and were plated on EMM without uracil. Expression of Tsc1 restored growth in F15Δtsc1 yeast but failed to rescue F15Δtsc2, whereas Tsc2 expressed restored growth in F15Δtsc2 but not in F15Δtsc1 (Fig. 1D). 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2 Have a Defect in Arginine Uptake— Previously, Rhb1 was shown to regulate arginine uptake in S. pombe (26Yang W. Urano J. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), prompting us to determine whether Tsc1 and Tsc2 also regulate arginine uptake. Because F15Δtsc1 and F15Δtsc2 have a growth defect, we crossed Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 into the 972 background. This strain does not require amino acid supplements, and 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2 did not show a growth defect on EMM. We found that 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2 are resistant to 60 μg/ml canavanine, a toxic analog of arginine (Fig. 2A). This dose of canavanine was toxic to the wild-type 972 strain. To determine whether the canavanine resistance was the result of decreased uptake, the uptake of [3H]arginine was measured. After 10 min, arginine uptake was ∼3.5-fold less in the 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc1 strains compared with wild-type 972 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the canavanine resistance is the result of decreased uptake. Dominant Negative Rhb1 Can Rescue the Arginine Uptake in ura4Δtsc2—A recent screen in S. pombe identified a dominant negative Rhb1 mutation, Rhb1-D60K, that is unable to bind GTP or GDP (32Tabancay Jr., A.P. Gau C.L. Machado I.M. Uhlmann E.J. Gutmann D.H. Guo L. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39921-39930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We generated this mutation in the pSLF373-ura4+ expression vector and crossed Δtsc2 into the ura4-D18 strain to allow selection for cells expressing from the pSLF373-ura4+ plasmid. We found that the decreased arginine uptake in Δtsc2 was restored by expression of Rhb1-D60K but not by wild-type Rhb1 (Fig. 2C), suggesting that arginine uptake is regulated through Tsc1, Tsc2, and Rhb1 in S. pombe. A Missense Mutation in the GAP Domain of tsc2+ Does Not Rescue the Conditional Lethality or Arginine Uptake in Δtsc2— The Tsc2 GAP domain in S. pombe is 39% identical to the GAP domain in human tuberin, and the conserved residues include the sites of three patient-derived TSC2 missense mutations (Fig. 3A). To determine whether these residues are crucial for the function of Tsc2 in S. pombe, we constructed one of them, Tsc2-N1191K, which corresponds with N1643K in human, in the HA-tagged pSLF373-ura4+ expression vector. Western blot analysis showed protein expression for both Tsc2 and Tsc2-N1191K (Fig. 3B). The Tsc2 and Tsc2-N1191K expression constructs were transformed next into F15Δtsc2, and cells were plated on EMM plates without uracil but with 50 μg/ml leucine, adenine, and histidine. The wild-type Tsc2 expression construct restored growth, but no growth was detected when the Tsc2-N1191K mutation was expressed (Fig. 3C). We next asked whether re-introducing Tsc2-N1191K could revert the canavanine resistance in the ura4Δtsc2 strain. Wild-type Tsc2 restored the canavanine sensitivity, whereas Tsc2-N1191K did not (Fig. 3D). The decreased arginine uptake was similarly rescued by wild-type Tsc2 but not by Tsc2-N1191K (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that the function of Tsc2 in regulating arginine uptake requires the GAP domain and support the use of S. pombe as a model system for human TSC. Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 Show a Significant Overlap in Expression Profile—To elucidate the mechanism through which tsc1+ and tsc2+ regulate amino acid uptake, we compared the expression profile of 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2. Total RNA was isolated from 972, 972Δtsc1, and 972Δtsc2 yeast, labeled, and hybridized to cDNA arrays (Eurogentec, Liege, Belgium). The expression profile of 972Δtsc1 was compared with 972 on two separate arrays including a dye-flip experiment. The 972–972Δtsc2 comparison was completed using the same design. Because all four arrays showed a linear relation between Cy3 and Cy5, a linear regression normalization was applied to the data (30Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32 (suppl.): 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown in Fig. 4A, the dye-flip experiment for Δtsc1 was highly correlated. The expression data were also validated by the absence of tsc1+ expression in the Δtsc1 and absence of tsc2+ in the Δtsc2 arrays, serving as internal controls. There was a high degree of overlap in expression profile between 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2. In total, 14 genes were downregulated at least 1.5-fold and 26 genes were up-regulated at least 1.5-fold both in 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2 (Fig. 4B). Table II lists the genes that were up-regulated at least 1.5-fold in both Δtsc1 and Δtsc2. Many of the up-regulated genes have predicted roles in iron transport and amino acid metabolism including the arginase gene, car1+.Table IIGenes upregulated at least 1.5-fold in 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2Gene nameFold changeaFold change is the average of four independent comparisons and was only included when all four fold changes were >1.5Predicted functionbPredicted function derived from Proteome Knowledge LibraryΔtsc1Δtsc2bfr11.81.9ABC transporterc359.051.61.6ABC transporterc569.05c1.91.7Sugar transporterc1020.031.71.6Iron ion transporterfio11.51.8Iron permeasefip11.71.8Iron permeasec750.05c2.51.9Vitamin/cofactor transporterc1002.16c2.41.8Vitamin/cofactor transportercar13.12.6Arginaseplr1.52.2Pyridoxal reductasec29B12.041.91.7Pyridoxine biosynthesisc5H10.102.82.0NADPH dehydrogenasec750.012.13.6Oxidoreductasep8B7.18c2.32.2Phosphomethylpyrimidine kinasec977.14c2.03.3Alcohol dehydrogenasec9E9.09c2.01.9Aldehyde dehydrogenasepB24D3.08c1.62.1Alcohol dehydrogenasec1271.07c2.31.7N-acetyltransferasec21E11.043.11.7N-acetyltransferaseobr12.12.9DNA bindingc530.07c2.42.0Unknownc70.08c4.02.0Unknownc1348.022.01.6Unknownc186.05c8.78.1Unknownc977.012.21.8Unknownc1271.08c2.21.7Unknowna Fold change is the average of four independent comparisons and was only included when all four fold changes were >1.5b Predicted function derived from Proteome Knowledge Library Open table in a new tab Table III lists the genes that were down-regulated at least 1.5-fold in both Δtsc1 and Δtsc2. Many of the down-regulated genes were putative transporters including three amino acid permeases, two oligopeptide transporters, two polyamine transporters, and one with homology to vitamin/cofactor transporters. Interestingly, the three down-regulated amino acid permeases had homology to the Gap1p (general amino acid permease) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The expression change for these three permeases was confirmed by Northern blotting (Fig. 4C). The fold change on the Northern blot was determined by densitometry and was in each case slightly greater than the fold change on the array, further validating the array result. These data support that Tsc1 and Tsc2 function in the same pathway in S. pombe and suggest that they have a central role in the regulation of the biosynthesis and uptake of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polyamines.Table IIIGenes downregulated at least 1.5-fold in 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2Gene nameFold changeaFold change is the average of four independent comparisons and was only included when all four fold changes were >1.5Predicted functionbPredicted function derived from Proteome Knowledge Library972Δtsc1972Δtsc2isp53.62.6Amino acid permeasec869.10c1.61.5Amino acid permeasep7G5.061.71.5Amino acid permeaseisp44.43.7Oligopeptide transporterptr22.42.3Oligopeptide transporterc409.081.61.5Polyamine transporterc794.04c3.32.3Polyamine transporterc11D3.18c3.42.5Vitamin/cofactor transporterc1039.102.31.8Translation initiation inhibitorc11D3.14c3.62.35-Oxoprolinasec11D3.153.72.35-Oxoprolinasec2H10.012.11.6Transcription factorc1223.091.71.6Urate oxidasec5H10.016.73.1Unknowna Fold change is the average of four independent comparisons and was only included when all four fold changes were >1.5b Predicted function derived from Proteome Knowledge Library Open table in a new tab Intracellular Amino Acid Concentrations Are Decreased in 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2—The down-regulation of permease expression and decreased uptake of amino acids in the 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2 strains could represent an appropriate response to high intracellular amino acid concentrations. However, we found that the intracellular levels of multiple amino acids were low in 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc2 compared with 972 wild-type yeast (Fig. 5A). Ornithine, which is a product of both glutamate and arginine metabolism, showed the largest relative decrease from ∼15 nm in wild-type 972 to nearly undetectable levels in 972Δtsc1 and 972Δtsc, whereas lysine was not changed (Fig. 5B). A decrease of at least 40% was detected for alanine, asparagine, histidine, glutamine, ornithine, citrulline, and arginine. Interestingly, the latter four are linked to arginine biosynthesis (Fig. 5C). The low intracellular amino acid levels, combined with the low amino acid permease expression levels and the decreased arginine uptake, strongly suggest that yeast lacking tsc1+ or tsc2+ have an intrinsic defect in amino acid sensing. We report here that S. pombe lacking tsc1+ or tsc2+ have defects in amino acid transport, involving not only the permease localization reported previously (24Matsumoto S. Bandyopadhyay A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Maitra U. Matsumoto T. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1053-1063PubMed Google Scholar) but also decreased expression of amino acid permeases, decreased uptake of arginine, and low intracellular amino acid levels. The decreased uptake of arginine in the Δtsc2 cells could be restored by expressing wild-type tsc2+ but not by expressing the tsc2+ gene carrying a mutation in the highly conserved GAP domain. This mutation is homologous to the patient-derived N1643K. Interestingly, the small GTPase Rheb was recently identified as the key target of the GAP domain of the TSC2 gene product, tuberin, in mammals and Drosophila (5Saucedo L.J. Gao X. Chiarelli D.A. Li L. Pan D. Edgar B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 6Stocker H. Radimerski T. Schindelholz B. Wittwer F. Belawat P. Daram P. Breuer S. Thomas G.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1457-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). From previous studies, it was known that Rhb1 regulates arginine uptake in S. pombe (25Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in S. cerevisiae (31Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11198-11206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We found that the arginine uptake defect in the Δtsc2 yeast was rescued by expression of a dominant negative form of S. pombe Rhb1, D60K. The rescue by Rhb1-D60K suggests that Rhb1 is downstream of Tsc2 in S. pombe as well as in other species and further strengthens the relevance of the S. pombe model to human TSC. Previously, the mislocalization of an amino acid permease c359.03+ (GenBank™ accession number CAB91572) in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 was postulated to be the result of aberrant protein trafficking (24Matsumoto S. Bandyopadhyay A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Maitra U. Matsumoto T. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1053-1063PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that the expression of three other amino acid permeases with high homology to the general amino acid permease (Gap1p) in S. cerevisiae were down-regulated both in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 cells. The permease c359.03+ was not down-regulated in Δtsc1 or Δtsc2, suggesting that permeases are regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels in Δtsc1 and Δtsc2. In S. cerevisiae, decreased expression of GAP1 and sorting of Gap1p from the plasma membrane to the vacuole are the appropriate response to high levels of intracellular amino acids (33Chen E.J. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, the decreased permease expression in Δtsc1 or Δtsc2 yeast was associated with low intracellular amino acids including alanine, asparagine, histidine, glutamine, ornithine, citrulline, and arginine. The inability to respond appropriately to low amino acid levels suggests that Tsc1 and Tsc2 play a role in amino acid sensing and would argue that the expression levels of permeases as well as their localization are crucial in coordinating sensing and growth in S. pombe. Altered intracellular amino acid levels have not been detected in mammalian cells lacking tuberin or hamartin, although to our knowledge only limited studies have looked into this phenomenon. The only study published so far measured the levels of valine, leucine, phenylalanine, and lysine in Drosophila S2 cells treated with TSC2 small interference RNA (17Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). A difference in intracellular levels was not detected, but those four amino acids were not changed in S. pombe lacking tsc1+ and tsc2+. The expression profile of Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 cells showed extensive overlap, consistent with similar phenotypes of TSC1 and TSC2 mutations in humans, rodents, Drosophila, and S. pombe. In addition to the down-regulated amino acid permeases, two enzymes linked to arginine biosynthetic pathways were differentially expressed: arginase and 5-oxoprolinase. Two genes with homology to mammalian 5-oxoprolinase were down-regulated in both Δtsc1 and Δtsc2. 5-Oxoprolinase hydrolyzed pyroglutamic acid to glutamate and was down-regulated in some human tumors (34Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. Patapoutian A. Hampton G.M. Schultz P.G. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Arginase was up-regulated in both Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 despite the low intracellular arginine levels. Arginase plays an important role in the production of ornithine (35Bansal V. Ochoa J.B. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2003; 6: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), so the increase in arginase mRNA could be a response to the drop in ornithine levels from 15 nm in wild type to nearly undetectable levels in the Δtsc1 and Δtsc2 strains. Ornithine is the precursor of polyamines including spermidine. Spermidine is essential for growth and cell cycle progression in S. pombe (36Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10330-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Polyamines are also critical to the growth and differentiation of mammalian cells and are elevated in many human cancers (37Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 38Thomas T. Thomas T.J. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Finally, arginase is important in mammalian cells because it competes with nitric-oxide synthetase for arginine, which is the substrate for both arginase and nitric-oxide synthetase. In mammalian cells, nitric oxide is a key second messenger regulating many processes including neuronal signaling (39Wu G. Morris Jr., S.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). It will clearly be important to determine whether expression of permeases, arginase, or 5-oxoprolinase is regulated by mammalian TSC1 and TSC2. Mice with conditional inactivation of Tsc1 in brain astrocytes develop seizures (40Wong M. Ess K.C. Uhlmann E.J. Jansen L.A. Li W. Crino P.B. Mennerick S. Yamada K.A. Gutmann D.H. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Seizures are a major clinical problem in TSC, affecting 80% of patients, and are often refractory to treatment. Interestingly, the Tsc1-/- astrocytes have decreased uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and decreased expression of two glutamate transporters (40Wong M. Ess K.C. Uhlmann E.J. Jansen L.A. Li W. Crino P.B. Mennerick S. Yamada K.A. Gutmann D.H. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is postulated that reduced astrocyte clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft slows the decay of excitatory stimuli, lowering the seizure threshold. If the decreased glutamate uptake is mechanistically related to the decreased amino acid uptake in S. pombe, the yeast model could provide a novel system for the study of epilepsy. In conclusion, our data show for the first time that Tsc1 and Tsc2 regulate arginine uptake and arginine biosynthesis in S. pombe. Rescue of the arginine uptake defect by a dominant negative form of Rhb1 suggests that Rhb1 is downstream of Tsc2 in S. pombe as well as in other species. The complexity of the amino acid phenotype is suggestive of an intrinsic defect in amino acid sensing, involving amino acids and enzymes closely linked to ornithine and arginine. If similar pathways are affected in mammalian cells lacking TSC1 or TSC2, defects in polyamines and/or nitric oxide levels could be pathogenically linked to the clinical manifestations of TSC, including refractory seizures.

https://openalex.org/W2028303181,"Superoxide is increased in the vessel wall of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) where, if ""blocked,"" potentiates endothelium-dependent vasodilation. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of superoxide anion in hypertension and its interaction with nitric oxide (NO). For this purpose we used a low molecular weight synthetic superoxide dismutase mimetic (M40403), known to remove selectively superoxide anion. Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly elevated in the SHR compared with its normal counterpart, Wistar Kyoto (WKY). M40403 at a dose (2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), which had no effect in the WKY, significantly decreased MAP in SHR rats. To determine whether superoxide anion increases MAP by inactivating NO, NO synthesis was blocked with N(G) nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 3 mg/kg i.v.), a nonselective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. L-NAME (3 mg/kg, i.v) blocked the anti-hypertensive effect of M40403 (2 mg/kg over 30 min). When used at a dose that yielded similar increases in MAP, norepinephrine (2.1 microg/kg) failed to alter the anti-hypertensive effects of M40403 in the SHR. To investigate whether the anti-hypertensive effect of M40403 was associated with an improvement of the alterations in vascular reactivity, a separate group of experiments was carried out ex vivo. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (10 nM-10 microM), an index of endothelial function, was reduced in aortic rings taken from SHR rats when compared with WKY rats. In vivo treatment with M40403 caused an improvement of the degree of the endothelial dysfunction in SHR rats. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine (the product formed from the interaction of nitric oxide with superoxide) revealed a positive staining in aorta from SHR rats. The degree of staining for nitrotyrosine was markedly reduced in tissue sections obtained from SHR rats treated with M40403. Our data suggest that overt production of superoxide in SHR couples with nitric oxide, reducing its function and leading to a loss of blood vessel tone and hypertension. Another important effect appears to be at the level of endothelial cellular integrity, where by interacting with nitric oxide, superoxide anion forms peroxynitrite and subsequent endothelial cell dysfunction. By removing superoxide, M40403 restores blood pressure to near-to-normal values."
https://openalex.org/W2085641812,"PTEN, mutated in a variety of human cancers, is a dual specificity protein phosphatase and also possesses D3-phosphoinositide phosphatase activity on phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-tris-phosphate (PIP3), a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. This PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN contributes to its tumor suppressor function by inhibition of Akt kinase, a direct target of PIP3. We have recently shown that Akt regulates PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of PTEN in mesangial cells inhibits PDGF-induced Akt activation leading to reduction in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. As a potential mechanism, we show that PTEN inhibits PDGF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation with concomitant dephosphorylation and inactivation of tyrosine phosphorylated and activated PDGF receptor. Recombinant as well as immunopurified PTEN dephosphorylates autophosphorylated PDGF receptor in vitro. Expression of phosphatase deficient mutant of PTEN does not dephosphorylate PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylated PDGF receptor. Rather its expression increases tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptor. Furthermore, expression of PTEN attenuated PDGF-induced signal transduction including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Erk1/2 MAPK activities. Our data provide the first evidence that PTEN is physically associated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and that PDGF causes its dissociation from the receptor. Finally, we show that both the C2 and tail domains of PTEN contribute to binding to the PDGF receptor. These data demonstrate a novel aspect of PTEN function where it acts as an effector for the PDGF receptor function and negatively regulates PDGF receptor activation. PTEN, mutated in a variety of human cancers, is a dual specificity protein phosphatase and also possesses D3-phosphoinositide phosphatase activity on phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-tris-phosphate (PIP3), a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. This PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN contributes to its tumor suppressor function by inhibition of Akt kinase, a direct target of PIP3. We have recently shown that Akt regulates PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in mesangial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of PTEN in mesangial cells inhibits PDGF-induced Akt activation leading to reduction in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. As a potential mechanism, we show that PTEN inhibits PDGF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation with concomitant dephosphorylation and inactivation of tyrosine phosphorylated and activated PDGF receptor. Recombinant as well as immunopurified PTEN dephosphorylates autophosphorylated PDGF receptor in vitro. Expression of phosphatase deficient mutant of PTEN does not dephosphorylate PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylated PDGF receptor. Rather its expression increases tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptor. Furthermore, expression of PTEN attenuated PDGF-induced signal transduction including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Erk1/2 MAPK activities. Our data provide the first evidence that PTEN is physically associated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and that PDGF causes its dissociation from the receptor. Finally, we show that both the C2 and tail domains of PTEN contribute to binding to the PDGF receptor. These data demonstrate a novel aspect of PTEN function where it acts as an effector for the PDGF receptor function and negatively regulates PDGF receptor activation. The tumor suppressor protein, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) is frequently inactivated in advanced cancer including endometrial carcinoma, sporadic glioblastoma, melanoma, meningioma, and breast, prostate, renal, and small cell lung cancer (1Li J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar). However, extensive studies revealed that PTEN is a poor phosphatase for proteins (9Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J.

Crystal structure of PTEN showed that the active site pocket in the phosphatase domain is very deep and wide unlike the catalytic sites of tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases that indispensably recognize protein substrates (12Lee J.O.

Another feature of the PTEN catalytic pocket is that it is highly basic, indicating that it may accommodate highly acidic substrates. This observation led to the discovery of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), 1The abbreviations used are: PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor β; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Ad, adenovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor β; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Ad, adenovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. the product of PI 3-kinase, as the primary physiologic substrate of PTEN (13Maehema T.

This observation is also supported by the presence of an increased level of PIP3 in the embryonic fibroblasts isolated from PTEN null mice (7Stambolic V. Tsao M.S. Macpherson D. Suzuki A. Chapman W.B. Mak T.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3605-3611PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P.

Restoration of wild type PTEN in mutated tumor cells has established that the lipid phosphatase activity of the protein is sufficient to repress the tumor cell growth (14Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemming B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). This ability of PTEN to antagonize PI 3-kinase signaling by down-regulating its immediate target, Akt serine threonine kinase, is consistent in different cells, although the downstream consequences of this lipid phosphatase activity vary widely and include cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (15Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Parsons R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5667-5672PubMed Google Scholar, 16Furmari F.B. Huang J.J. Cavence W.K.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2318-2323PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas tumor suppressor activity of PTEN is elicited by its lipid phosphatase activity, its detectable protein phosphatase activity toward multiply phosphorylated proteins suggested that PTEN may also act on protein substrates in vivo (9Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In fact, PTEN can dephosphorylate focal adhesion kinase and adaptor protein Shc in vitro. When overexpressed in cells, as a result of integrin ligation, PTEN dephosphorylates both of these signaling proteins (18Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumuto K. Aota S-I. Parsons R. Yamada K.M.

It stimulates proliferation of a variety of cells, including fibroblast, smooth muscle, glial, and glomerular mesangial cells (21Abboud H.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 23Rosenkranz S.

BioEssays. 2001; 23: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Four different polypeptide subunits (A, B, C, and D) have been identified, which can give rise to five different isoforms of PDGF (24Betsholtz C. Karlsson L. Lindahl P. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Most extensively studied PDGF is formed by dimerization of the B-chain to form BB homodimer or AB heterodimer. Although these dimers bind both PDGF receptors, the affinity for PDGF receptor β (PDGFR) is higher (23Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Betsholtz C. Karlsson L. Lindahl P.

Molecular Nephrology: Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1995: 573-590Google Scholar). Mice with a targeted homozygous mutation of PDGF B-chain or PDGFR exhibit a common phenotype of lacking glomerular mesangial cells (26Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1875-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 27Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Indeed, PDGF is required for the proliferation, survival, and development of mesangial cells (25Abboud H.E. Bhandari B. Ghosh Choudhury G. Bonventre J. Schlondorf D. Molecular Nephrology: Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1995: 573-590Google Scholar, 26Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C.

Expression of both PDGF B-chain and PDGFR is increased in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis in which proliferation of mesangial cells is the major pathologic feature (28Jefferson J.A. Johnson R.J. J. Nephrol. 1999; 12: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of antibody against PDGF B-chain ameliorates this disease (29Johnson R.J. Raines E.W. Floege J. Yoshimura A. Pritzl P. Alpers C. Ross R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PDGFR signal transduction plays a key role in the development and survival of these cells during embryogenesis as well as contributes to their proliferation in glomerular disease.Binding of PDGF to its cognate receptor induces a conformational change relieving an inhibitory effect of the juxtamembrane domain on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (22Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 25Abboud H.E. Bhandari B. Ghosh Choudhury G. Bonventre J. Schlondorf D.

Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar). Activated PDGFR then undergoes autophosphorylation to create binding sites for signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 domains (22Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 23Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). One of the Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, PI 3-kinase, physically binds to the specific phosphotyrosines of the PDGFR, resulting in its activation to produce PIP3. This D3-phosphoinositide then binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt (also known as PKB) serine threonine kinase to induce translocation to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and PDK2 kinases (31Frake T.F.

We and others have shown that PI 3-kinase/Akt signal transduction is necessary for PDGF-induced proliferation of various cells including mesangial cells (33Valius M. Kazlauskas A.

However, its role in normal cell function is largely unknown. PTEN dephosphorylates highly negatively charged artificial substrate in vitro (9Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Upon binding, to PDGF, PDGFR is autophosphorylated in at least 16 tyrosine residues, thus becoming a negatively charged protein. We hypothesized that tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFR may be a substrate for PTEN and that PTEN may regulate PDGF-induced biological activity by inhibiting the receptor phosphorylation at the membrane. We report here that expression of PTEN in mesangial cells significantly abolished PDGF-induced Akt activation, resulting in inhibition of PDGF-induced DNA synthesis without inducing apoptosis. This action of PTEN was due to inhibition of PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. PTEN blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR in vivo, resulting in inhibition of its tyrosine kinase activity. PTEN also dephosphorylated PDGFR in vitro. Furthermore, PTEN expression attenuated the PDGFR-mediated PI 3-kinase and MAPK activities. Finally, we provide evidence that PTEN is associated with PDGFR, and the addition of PDGF causes dissociation of this phosphatase from the receptor. We conclude that PTEN is a PDGFR phosphatase and may act to negatively regulate the receptor tyrosine kinase activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Antibodies—Adenovirus vectors encoding PTEN (Ad PTEN) and phosphatase-dead PTEN C/S (Ad PTEN C/S) were provided by Dr. Ramon Parsons (Department of Pathology and Medicine, Columbia University, New York) and Dr. Christopher D.

Apoptosis was measured using an apoptosis detection kit, which utilizes Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide fluorescence, as described by the vendor. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with the excitation wavelength at 488 nm. The FITC signal was detected at 518 nm. The propidium iodide fluorescence was measured at 620 nm. For Hoechst staining, cells in chamber slides were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 50 Ad PTEN or Ad GFP for 48 h.

We examined the effects of the size of discoidal HDL particles containing wild-type (WT) apoA-I on selective uptake of CE and efflux of cellular free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) from COS-7 cells expressing SR-BI to determine the following: 1) the influence of apoA-I conformation on the lipid transfer process, and 2) the contribution of receptor binding-dependent processes to the overall efflux of cellular FC. Large (10 nm diameter) reconstituted HDL bound to SR-BI better (Bmax ∼420 versus 220 ng of apoA-I/mg cell protein), delivered more CE, and promoted more FC efflux than small (∼8 nm) particles. When normalized to the number of reconstituted HDL particles bound to the receptor, the efficiencies of either CE uptake or FC efflux with these particles were the same indicating that altering the conformation of WT apoA-I modulates binding to the receptor (step 1) but does not change the efficiency of the subsequent lipid transfer (step 2); this implies that binding induces an optimal alignment of the WT apoA-I·SR-BI complex so that the efficiency of lipid transfer is always the same.

Studies in recent years have identified the cell surface receptor, scavenger receptor (SR)-BI, as playing a key role in the cellular metabolism of HDL (for review see Refs. 2Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E.

Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consequently, the interaction between HDL and SR-BI is under intense investigation. Early studies on SR-BI demonstrated that it can mediate the selective transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) from HDL into cells (4Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar) and also function to promote the bidirectional flux of free cholesterol (FC) between HDL and the cell plasma membrane (5Ji Y.

This functionality resides in the extracellular region of the receptor (6Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Despite intensive investigations, many aspects of the mechanism of SR-BI-mediated lipid flux (e.g. FC efflux and CE-selective uptake) between HDL and the cell plasma membrane remain unclear. With respect to the selective uptake of CE, we (8Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have proposed that SR-BI functions in a two-step process where the binding of the HDL to the receptor is coupled to the flux of lipids (such a reaction scheme is analyzed in the Appendix to Ref. 9Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1132-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the lipid transfer step involves a hydrophobic pathway created between the bound HDL particle and the cell plasma membrane (8Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), whereas others have favored a hemifusion process (7Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We have also shown that despite being of similar size and structure, rHDL composed of apoA-I and apoE have different CE-selective uptake efficiencies (11Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43801-43808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), implying that an appropriate alignment of the bound HDL and SR-BI is required for this process to occur optimally. This idea of proper ligand alignment on SR-BI and formation of a “productive complex” has been shown with a mutant of apoA-I that displays a reduced FC efflux capacity despite similar binding of HDL (12Liu T. Krieger M. Kan H.Y. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21576-21584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Early studies using both synthetic rHDL and rat HDL showed that higher density (hence smaller diameter) HDL gives more selective CE uptake (13Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, by using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SR-BI, de Beer et al. (14de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Jonas A. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 309-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that less dense, bigger diameter HDLs are able to deliver more CE compared with higher density HDLs. The fact that HDL size affects SR-BI-mediated selective CE uptake suggests that the nature of the HDL-SR-BI interaction is critical, although this is poorly understood at this time. It has been shown (14de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Jonas A. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 309-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that differences in apoA-I conformation in differently sized rHDL particles influence binding to SR-BI (step 1), but the consequences for the subsequent lipid flux (step 2) have not been investigated. Insight into how apoA-I conformation affects the lipid transfer will help in understanding the performances of different apoA-I-containing HDL particles (e.g. lipoprotein A-I) in reverse cholesterol transport (3Williams D.L. Connelly M.A. Temel R.E. Swarnakar S. Phillips M.C. de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Studies using cholesterol oxidase have indicated that SR-BI is capable of perturbing the plasma membrane in such a way that the enzyme has easier access to the FC (15Kellner-Weibel G. de la Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Stoudt G. Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and FC efflux to acceptors such as cyclodextrins is enhanced by this plasma membrane reorganization (16Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the idea that SR-BI does not have to interact directly with an extracellular acceptor of FC in order to promote FC efflux (17de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weibel G. Sakr S.W. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 575-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a different line of evidence suggests that binding of an extracellular acceptor to SR-BI is necessary for FC efflux (18Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Binding to simply hold the acceptor HDL particles near the plasma membrane is insufficient to enhance efflux (17de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weibel G. Sakr S.W. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 575-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the quantitative contribution to FC efflux of binding of an extracellular FC acceptor such as HDL to SR-BI is not established, and the mechanism of SR-BI-mediated FC efflux remains controversial (cf. Refs. 12Liu T. Krieger M. Kan H.Y. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21576-21584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H.

To address the gaps in understanding of the mechanism of SR-BI-mediated lipid transfer outlined above, we studied the influence of the conformation of the wild-type (WT) apoA-I molecule on the facilitation of lipid flux via SR-BI, and we defined the contributions of the ligand binding and membrane perturbing properties of SR-BI to the efflux of cellular cholesterol to HDL. The results show that although WT apoA-I conformation influences the degree of HDL binding to SR-BI (step 1), the efficiency of the lipid transfer process (step 2) is independent of WT apoA-I conformation. In the case of SR-BI-mediated efflux of cellular FC, the lipid transfer step is more complicated because although binding of HDL to SR-BI affects FC efflux at low HDL concentrations, the membrane-perturbing effects of SR-BI contribute to changes in the efflux under conditions where binding to SR-BI is saturated. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) dissolved in chloroform was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

FuGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. The construction and use of pSG5 plasmids containing the cDNA for WT and tag A-VI SR-BI have been described in detail elsewhere (6Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Primers 5′-AGCCAGCTCTTCACACGCAATGGGTGGCAAGCCCCTGAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCTAGCTCTTCAGTGGCTCTGTTCGAACCACAGCAACGG-3′ were employed to amplify the entire pSG5(SR-BI) plasmid. The resulting PCR products were digested with SapI (New England Biolabs) and recircularized. Normolipidemic serum was used to isolate WT human apoA-I by using established methods (19Weisweiler P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The generation of the expression plasmid (pET32) and point mutations of apoA-I have been described previously (20Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23227-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, the human apoA-I cDNA was mutagenized by using the PCR with the following primers designed to introduce point mutations at residues 102 and 103 by converting aspartic acid residues to alanine: 5′-GGTGCAGCCCTACCTGGCATTCCAGAAGAAGTGGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCCACTTCTTCTGGAATGCCGCCAGGTAGGGCTGCACC-3′. Successful introduction of the desired point mutations was confirmed by sequencing the recombinant DNA. The resulting recombinant product containing the point mutations of interest was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the expressed apoA-I was purified as described previously (21Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both the WT and apoA-I mutant Asp-102 → Ala/Asp-103 → Ala (D102A/D103A) apolipoproteins were lyophilized after purification and stored at -20 °C. Prior to use the apolipoproteins were solubilized in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Compared with WT apoA-I, the solubility of D102A/D103A apoA-I was reduced somewhat, in that some of the D102A/D103A mutant precipitated after dialysis; this material was removed by spinning in a tabletop centrifuge at low speed. The concentrations of WT and variant apoA-I were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using the absorbance coefficient of 1.13 for 1 mg/ml solutions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectral analysis (data not shown) showed that the D102A/D103A apoA-I mutant had an increase of 88 Da in molecular mass consistent with the expected value resulting from the substitution of two alanines for two aspartic acid residues. Also, agarose gel electrophoresis of the D102A/D103A apoA-I showed that the net charge of the protein had changed as expected because of the substitution of two negatively charged aspartic acid residues for two neutral alanine residues (data not shown). Discoidal Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) Particles—rHDL containing apoA-I and POPC was prepared by the cholate dispersion method (22Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rHDL particles containing POPC and apoA-I at initial molar ratios of either 100:1 or 40:1 were prepared. The resulting rHDL particles were passed through a Superdex 200HR gel filtration column (1 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences), and the appropriate fractions were isolated. rHDL resulting from the 100:1 molar ratio of POPC/apoA-I formed homogenous particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of ∼10 nm. In the case of the 40:1 mixture, a heterogeneous population of particles was created. The gel filtration fractions that contained particles of ∼8 nm in diameter were pooled. These 8- and 10-nm particles were used in experiments to determine their FC efflux capacities. To determine the selective uptake CE from rHDL, apoA-I was first labeled with 125I by using the iodine monochloride method (23Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). This 125I-apoA-I was then complexed with POPC (at 100:1 or 40:1 mol/mol) containing 1 mol % of cholesteryl oleate and a trace amount of [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether (specific activity of 24 cpm/ng cholesteryl oleate) using the cholate dispersion method (22Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100:1 mol/mol POPC/apoA-I rHDL containing D102A/D103A apoA-I was also prepared in parallel. Thereafter, the particles were isolated and characterized as described above. Both WT and D102A/D103A apoA-I generated similar 10 nm diameter rHDL particles. The phospholipid content of the particles was determined enzymatically using phospholipase D (Wako Chemical, Richmond, VA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (24Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) was used to chemically cross-link the apoA-I molecules within the rHDL particles to assess the number of apoA-I molecules per particle. Lipid-free apoA-I, large rHDL, and small rHDL were incubated with 10 mm BS3 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 3.5 h, and the reaction was quenched with 250 mm ethanolamine. The samples were then fractionated using 8-25% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the degree of apoA-I oligomerization was determined. Cell Culture Experiments—COS-7 kidney cells that had been transiently transfected with SR-BI were used in all experiments. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential media supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Plasmid cDNA containing SR-BI or plasmid cDNA alone was transiently transfected in this cell line with FuGENE 6 as the carrier by using an established procedure (6Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To determine the cellular efflux of cholesterol, the transfected cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and efflux was measured as described previously (17de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H.

The binding of dual-labeled rHDL and the selective uptake of CE, defined as the amount of CE uptake in excess of that due to whole particle uptake, were determined as described (8Rodrigueza W.V.

Generation of rHDL Particles of Two Different Sizes—To examine the effects of HDL size on its ability to bind to SR-BI, promote selective CE uptake, and serve as an acceptor of FC, we generated two different sized rHDLs composed of apoA-I and POPC. By using established methods, rHDL of ∼8 and 10 nm in diameter were created (Fig. 1A). As assessed by chemical cross-linking (Fig. 1B), these rHDLs both contained an average of two apoA-I molecules per particle. In addition, they had similar phospholipid to CE ratios (in the range 25-30 mol/mol) with the major difference between the two particles being the phospholipid to protein ratio. The final phospholipid to protein mass ratio for the large (∼10 nm particle) rHDL was 1.7 ± 0.2 (70:1 mol/mol) and for the small (∼8 nm particle) rHDL it was 0.6 ± 0.06 (30:1 mol/mol); these parameters are similar to those reported previously by others (25Tricerri M.A. Sanchez S.A. Arnulphi C. Durbin D.M. Gratton E. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Large rHDLs Bind More Than Small rHDLs to SR-BI and Deliver More CE to Cells—To compare the functionalities of small and large rHDL, we incubated dual-labeled ([3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether and 125I-apoA-I) rHDLs with COS-7 cells transiently expressing SR-BI. In each case the data shown are SR-BI-specific where the values from mock-transfected (vector DNA) cells have been subtracted. It should be noted that the binding of HDL was saturated within 30 min of incubation with the cells, while the selective uptake of CE was still in the linear range at 2 h of incubation (data not shown). Because the exact level of SR-BI cell surface expression cannot be controlled precisely, the Bmax values for the binding of rHDL varied from one transfection to another. Typically, expression of SR-BI increased the binding of rHDL 4-8-fold, relative to mock-transfected cells. As reported previously (14de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Jonas A. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 309-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rHDLs composed of POPC/apoA-I with a diameter of ∼10 nm were better ligands (higher Bmax and lower Kd values) for SR-BI than smaller rHDLs with diameters of ∼8 nm (Fig. 2A). For these binding isotherms, Kd and Bmax values were 1 ± 0.3 μg/ml and 420 ± 30 ng/mg cell protein, respectively, for the large rHDL, and 10 ± 4 μg/ml and 220 ± 65 ng/ml cell protein for the small rHDL. These values are not the same as those reported in Chinese hamster ovary cells transiently expressing SR-BI (14de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Jonas A. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 309-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but they show a similar effect of HDL size. Because both types of rHDL contained two apoA-I molecules per particle (Fig. 1B), the concentration expressed as μg of apoA-I/ml is indicative of the particle number (i.e. at a given protein concentration, the same number of each size of rHDL particles was present). When the data are expressed as μg of phospholipid/ml of the ligand present in the medium (Fig. 2D), the difference in the binding and selective uptake between the two sizes of rHDL remains. Note that if the binding of the ligand is expressed as the amount of PL bound, the difference in the amount of binding between the large and small rHDL particles is even more dramatic (Fig. 2C). Correspondingly, the amount of CE-selective uptake was dependent on the amount of rHDL binding (Fig. 2B). The absolute amount of CE-selective uptake was diminished for the small rHDL, but when normalized to the amount of rHDL bound to SR-BI, both sizes showed the same efficiency of CE-selective uptake (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3A, both the binding and selective CE uptake are plotted on the same axes, and it is evident that both parameters are correlated. In Fig. 3B, the binding of rHDL expressed as the number of rHDL particles bound is plotted against the selective uptake of CE; the correlations for both sizes of rHDL are fitted by linear regression (R2 values of 0.93). The slopes of both lines are similar indicating that despite differences in the total amount of ligand bound, bound rHDL particles of both sizes are equally efficient in delivering CE.Fig. 3The binding of large and small rHDL to SR-BI and selective uptake of CE from these particles are correlated. The data from Fig. 2 are replotted to show the correlation between the binding of the ligands and the selective uptake of CE. A shows large rHDL binding (▪) and selective CE uptake (□), and small rHDL binding (▴) and selective CE uptake (▵). B shows linear correlations between the binding of the large rHDL and selective uptake from these particles (▪) and the binding and selective uptake of small rHDL (▴). The particle numbers were determined by assuming that each rHDL particle contain 2 apoA-I molecules (Fig. 1) and converting the amount of protein bound to the equivalent number of HDL particles. The R2 value for each line is 0.93 from the linear regression analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Large rHDL Is a Better Acceptor of Cellular FC Than Small rHDL—To examine if the greater binding of large rHDL leads to enhanced efflux of FC, COS-7 cells were labeled with [3H]FC, and the efflux capacities of large and small rHDL were compared. Fig. 4A shows that larger rHDL induced more FC efflux than small rHDL when compared on the basis of particle (protein) concentration. The results in Fig. 4A are for FC efflux after 2 h of incubation, but the difference observed between the large and small rHDL remained for incubations ranging from 30 min to 6 h (data not shown). There was still a difference if the FC efflux was measured as a function of the amount of rHDL phospholipid present in the incubation medium (Fig. 4B). In Fig. 4C, the concentration dependence of HDL binding and FC efflux is compared. It is apparent that after the binding of both sizes of rHDL particles had saturated, the efflux of FC continued to rise. This is clearly seen in Fig. 4D where FC efflux is plotted as a function of the number of rHDL particles bound to SR-BI. In the low range of rHDL binding, the slopes of the lines for both the large and small HDLs are similar reflecting binding-dependent FC efflux of similar efficiency. However, once the receptors are saturated, the lines become approximately vertical in each case indicating that, despite saturation of binding sites on SR-BI, FC efflux continues to increase. The Effect of ApoA-I Mutation on rHDL Binding, FC Efflux, and Selective CE Uptake—To test if the binding of HDL to SR-BI is in itself sufficient for optimal selective CE uptake, we examined the ability of apoA-I D102A/D103A to mediate this process. This mutant of apoA-I has been identified by its ability to bind, in an rHDL particle, to SR-BI similarly to the WT apoA-I but induce relatively low FC efflux (12Liu T. Krieger M. Kan H.Y. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21576-21584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Substitution of the acidic residues in WT apoA-I with two non-polar residues imparted some differences in the physical parameters of the apolipoprotein. The most striking difference between the WT apoA-I and the D102A/D103A mutant was the lowered solubility of the mutant in aqueous buffer. In addition, compared with the WT protein, the lipid-free mutant was slightly less stable than the WT protein to denaturation, and more of its hydrophobic surface was exposed to the aqueous phase as assessed by binding of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid to the protein. 2H. Saito, S. Lund-Katz, and M. C. Phillips, unpublished observation. Despite these differences, D102A/D103A apoA-I formed large rHDLs of comparable size to WT apoA-I. Fig. 5A shows the concentration dependence of binding for these two rHDL particles. As reported by Liu et al. (12Liu T. Krieger M. Kan H.Y. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21576-21584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the binding isotherms for rHDL containing WT apoA-I and apoA-I D102A/D103A are similar, although not identical. By using four independent preparations of rHDL, it appeared that the total amount of binding of the mutant rHDL was slightly more than that of the WT rHDL. Despite this similarity in binding, the mutant protein had a diminished capacity to promote FC efflux compared with the WT protein (Fig. 5B), as observed by Liu et al. (12Liu T. Krieger M. Kan H.Y. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21576-21584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We also compared the effects of this apoA-I mutation on CE-selective uptake; similar to the reduction in FC efflux, the amount of CE-selective uptake was also reduced compared with the WT rHDL (Fig. 5C). To compare the effect of the apoA-I mutation on the functionality of the rHDL particles, we plotted the binding of the rHDL versus the selective uptake of CE (Fig. 5D). The steeper slope for the WT rHDL relative to that of the mutant rHDL indicates that the efficiency for CE-selective uptake was reduced due to the mutation in apoA-I (cf. Fig. 3B for large and small rHDL containing WT apoA-I where the efficiencies were similar). A similar type of analysis to that of Fig. 5D for the FC efflux data showed that the efficiency of FC efflux was also reduced due to the apoA-I mutation (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2039023142,"Most eukaryotes utilize a single pool of clathrin to assemble clathrin-coated transport vesicles at different intracellular locations. Coat assembly is a cyclical process. Soluble clathrin triskelia are recruited to the membrane surface by compartment-specific adaptor and/or accessory proteins. Adjacent triskelia then pack together to assemble a polyhedral lattice that progressively invaginates, budding off the membrane surface encasing a nascent transport vesicle that is quickly uncoated. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to follow clathrin dynamics close to the cell surface, we find that the majority of labeled clathrin structures are relatively static, moving vertically in and out of the evanescent field but with little lateral motion. A small minority shows rapid lateral and directed movement over micrometer distances. Adaptor proteins, including the α subunit of AP-2, ARH, and Dab2 are also relatively static and exhibit virtually no lateral movement. A fluorescently labeled AP-2 β2 subunit, incorporated into both AP-2 and AP-1 adaptor complexes, exhibits both types of behavior. This suggests that the highly motile clathrin puncta may be distinct from plasma membrane-associated clathrin structures. When endocytosed cargo molecules, such as transferrin or low density lipoprotein, are followed into cells, they exhibit even more lateral motion than clathrin, and gradually concentrate in the perinuclear region, consistent with classical endosomal trafficking. Importantly, clathrin partially colocalizes with internalized transferrin, but diverges as the structures move longitudinally. Thus, highly motile clathrin structures are apparently distinct from the plasma membrane, accompany transferrin, and contain AP-1, revealing an endosomal population of clathrin structures.

A clathrin coat forms upon membranes as a polygonal lattice, which progressively curves to incorporate membrane, cargo, and extracellular fluid into a vesicular transport intermediate (1Kirchhausen T.

Whereas the trafficking itineraries of many cargo molecules sorted into clathrin-coated vesicles are known, the kinetics of clathrin coat assembly, and the mechanics of adaptor protein interaction are not well understood. Transiently transfected, fluorescently-tagged clathrin, combined with live cell imaging, shows that clathrin-coated structures are extremely dynamic (9Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) has extended the time-resolved study of clathrin structures by allowing the selective imaging of molecular events very close to the plasma membrane. This permits analysis of the temporal colocalization of clathrin with other proteins (10Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat.

In these studies, four distinct behaviors of clathrin-coated structures have been reported: stasis, disappearance, reappearance, and lateral motility (9Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Merrifield C.J.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The evanescent field utilized in TIR-FM has a decay or penetration depth of 70-110 nm, exciting only those fluorophores close to the basal plasma membrane (13Axelrod D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, clathrin-coated structures that disappear from the TIR-FM field could be internalized vesicles moving deeper into the cell, the loss of concentrated and hence detectable clathrin because of vesicle uncoating or, finally, because of the physical deformation of the plasma membrane out of the TIR-FM field (10Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E230-E232Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These dynamics are coupled, in part, to the activity of dynamin, actin, and tubulin (9Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M.

The selective excitation of TIR-FM also allows imaging of adaptor proteins, which link transmembrane receptors to the clathrin coat. Endocytic adaptor proteins, including AP-2, Disabled-2 (Dab2), and the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) protein, bind to the plasma membrane via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, recruit and polymerize clathrin on the membrane, and synchronously bind cargo molecule receptors such as transferrin or low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15Ohno H.

With the demonstration that AP-2 is not absolutely required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, understanding the operation of these alternate adaptors is now a priority (20Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Hinrichsen L. Harborth J. Andrees L. Weber K. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). There is an emerging role for these proteins as part of the endocytic cargo selection machinery, analogous to the role GGA proteins play at the TGN (17Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16099-16104Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J.

Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here, we describe two other phenomena associated with temporal changes in clathrin-coated structures: coalescence and separation. Examination of the endocytic adaptor proteins AP-2, Dab2, and ARH, along with the cargo molecules transferrin, LDL, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) shows that the previous appearance and disappearance of labeled structures observed using TIR-FM is common to plasma membrane-localized proteins, while proteins and cargo that are associated with endosomes exhibit significant lateral motion within the TIR-FM field. Dual-color TIR-FM defines the relationship between AP-2, transferrin, and clathrin structures, revealing an endosomal clathrin population sensitive to nocodazole treatment. The depth of the evanescent field is also determined empirically, and endosomes are found within this plane. Thus, the highly mobile clathrin structures observed by TIR-FM appear to be endosomal in nature. Plasmids—To label clathrin with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) we used a plasmid containing a human neuronal-specific clathrin light chain a (LCa) isoform ligated into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pEGFP-C3 (GFP-LCa). By inserting the brain LCa via the internal BamHI site, the four amino-terminal residues (MAEL) of the 248-amino acid light chain sequence are removed and replaced with residues (PRAR) encoded by the vector polylinker joining the carboxyl terminus of GFP to the amino-terminal end of LCa. The plasmid encoding DsRed fused to the amino terminus of a non-neuronal LCa (DsRed-LCa) was kindly provided by Tom Kirchhausen, the plasmid encoding the AP-2 αC-subunit fused via the carboxyl terminus to YFP (αC-YFP) was a kind gift from Jim Keen, whereas the AP-2 β2 subunit fused via the carboxyl terminus to YFP (β2-YFP) was a kind gift from Alexander Sorkin. The ARH-GFP construct was prepared by ligating full-length human ARH, generated by PCR using the primers 5′-TATAGCTAGCCGCCACCATGGACGCGCTCAAGTCGG-3′ and 5′-GCGCAGATCTGCGAAGCTGAAGAGGTCATCCTG-3′, into the NheI and BglII sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The Dab2-GFP construct has been previously described (18Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and was kindly provided by Jonathan Cooper. The Hip1R-GFP construct (24Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Warren R.A. Kessels M.M. Keen J.H. Heuser J. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by David Drubin. All plasmids and constructs were verified by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Cell Culture—CV-1 (CCL-70, ATCC) and A431 (CRL-1555, ATCC) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone) and 2% l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2. Normal human fibroblasts (GM 01386, Human Genetic Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2% l-glutamine. All cells were plated onto glass-bottom 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Mat-tek) at ∼40% confluence 1 day prior to transfection. TIR-FM Imaging—Cells grown on glass-bottom dishes were transfected with 500 ng of DNA 1 day prior to imaging using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were imaged either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2% l-glutamine or phenol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) (starvation medium), neither of which affected the dynamics or the imaging of the cells, although 0.45 m sucrose had a higher refractive index than normal medium, so the evanescent wave penetrated deeper. Cells were imaged on a Nikon 2000E inverted microscope (Melville, NY) with a 1.45 NA oil immersion objective capable of both epifluorescence and TIR-FM illumination through the objective. GFP, YFP, Alexa 488, and DiO were excited with a 488 nm line of an argon laser, whereas DsRed was excited with a 567 nm line of a krypton laser (laser bench provided by Prairie Technologies, Madison, WI). All laser lines were selectively blocked within the laser bench and illumination (both intensity and blanking) was controlled by acousto-optical tunable filters. To image both green and red fluorophores simultaneously, an Optical Insights image splitter was used. Images were collected using a water-cooled Orca II ER (Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Japan). Data sets were acquired using SimplePCI (C-imaging systems, Cranberry, PA) software. In all experiments images were collected at ∼1 frame/s. The only post-processing performed was to ensure appropriate registration (using fiduciary points) of two color images, and image scaling such that labeled structures are clearly visible. No other filters or enhancements were applied to the data sets. Pharmacology—For sucrose treatments, the culture medium in the dish was replaced after acquiring several images of a single cell by TIR-FM with 0.45 m sucrose in starvation medium. The cell was located and imaging resumed ∼30 s after addition of the sucrose solution. Cells were then imaged for up to 1 h after treatment, during which they remained the same in appearance. To depolymerize the microtubule cytoskeleton, cells were incubated with 10 μm nocodazole (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C in starvation medium prior to imaging, and then imaged in the continued presence of the nocodazole. Ligand Internalization—For the transferrin or EGF uptake experiments, cells were serum starved by incubation in starvation medium for 1 h at 37 °C prior to placement on the microscope stage. Once cells were ready for imaging, transferrin conjugated to Alexa 488 (Tfn488) (Molecular Probes), or EGF conjugated to Alexa 488 (EGF488) (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml or 10 ng/ml, respectively, and the cells were imaged immediately. For LDL uptake experiments, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum and 2% l-glutamine for 24 h prior to imaging to up-regulate endogenous LDL receptors. Cells were given 20 μg/ml DiO-LDL (Biomedical Technologies) and imaged immediately. For transferrin pulse experiments, cells transfected with DsRed-LCa were serum starved as above, incubated with 50 μg/ml Tfn488 for 30 min, washed, and imaged in starvation medium. Image Processing and Data Presentation—Visualization of subtle motion is difficult in monochromatic image sequences. However, using color superposition of these monochrome stacks, it is possible to see quite small changes in object position. Thus, by sequencing temporal imaging sets in the red, green, and blue color channels of a color image, non-motile structures will appear as white structures, whereas motile structures will show a green-red-blue trail. For image motion over time, an XY time image can be generated such that the position is visualized in the x axis, and time visualized in the y axis, which is similar to a classical kymograph, and used extensively here. On the kymographs, a solid, vertical line represents a non-moving vesicle, whereas breaks in an individual line represent the appearance/disappearance of the object from the region, and slanted lines represent lateral particle motion. Even breaks across the entire projection represent a temporary adjustment of focus. Two-color TIR-FM images were processed similarly, except they were not time colored.

Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 26Blanpied T.A. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2002; 36: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). By epifluorescence, the cytosolic pool of unpolymerized fluorescent clathrin is visible as a diffuse haze, along with bright TGN and surface puncta (Fig. 1B). When the same fibroblasts are imaged using TIR-FM optics, the signal is restricted to fluorescent structures close to the plasma membrane surface, hence the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the image (Fig. 1C). In agreement with previous studies examining clathrin dynamics (9Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Rappoport J.Z.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47357-47360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we observe fluorescent clathrin structures with four different behaviors in living cells (Fig. 1, D-I): appearing (Fig. 1, open arrows), disappearing (white arrows), moving laterally (arrowheads), and relatively stationary. Importantly, the high signal-to-noise ratio in TIR-FM allows images to be collected using low laser power, restricting the evanescent field and minimizing photobleaching. The lack of photobleaching is evident from the persistence of the fluorescence in non-motile structures immediately adjacent to abruptly disappearing spots (Fig. 1F). Two different types of lateral motion are apparent in our data sets. The first is the uncoordinated gyration of a coated structure about a ∼1-μm region, which we term local motion (Fig. 1, D-F, open arrowheads). The second type of lateral motion is the dynamic (0.5-0.67 μm/s), directed transit of a structure down a roughly linear path (1.5-9 μm travel distance), designated long distance motion (Fig. 1G, white arrowheads). Others consider this long distance motion to be planar clathrin-coated lattices or invaginated coated pits moving in a microtubule-dependent fashion while still associated with the plasma membrane, although localization to endosomes was not excluded (10Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Lemeer S. Benmerah A. Simon S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47357-47360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, Fig. 1G shows a large (∼0.6 μm diameter) clathrin-coated structure moving laterally (white arrowheads, and seen by the green-red-blue transition in the image sequence stills). Along its entire trajectory, this structure travels by several non-motile clathrin-positive structures without evidence of interaction; there is no change in speed, surface area, or collisional activity (see Supplemental Materials movie 3). Because these objects are larger than the diffraction limit of the optical system being used, and invaginated coated pits are ∼100 nm in depth (14Santini F. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E230-E232Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), this suggests that the evanescent wave allows visualization of subcellular structures beyond that indicated by the absolute value of the decay depth (9Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Simon S.M.

Because structures with sizes on the order of the depth of the evanescent wave can apparently pass each other within the TIR-FM field, we determined the depth of the excitatory evanescent wave empirically. The intensity of the evanescent wave decreases exponentially with distance, Iz=I0e-z/d(Eq. 1) where Iz is the intensity at depth z, I0 is the initial intensity, and d is the characteristic decay depth defined as, d=λ/(4πn2)·((sin2θ/sin2θc)-1)-1/2(Eq. 2) where λ is the wavelength of the incident light in a vacuum, θ is the angle of the incident light, θC is the critical angle, defined as sin-1 (n2/n1), and n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the substrate and liquid medium, respectively (13Axelrod D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The refractive indices of the glass coverslip and aqueous culture medium (Fig. 6B shows Tfn488 in the medium under ∼85% of the cell in the TIR-FM field) are 1.518 and 1.33, respectively, making the calculated critical angle 61.2°. Thus, using 69° incident light and a 488-nm excitation wavelength, d is calculated to be 79.4 nm. Empirically, in our system, we measured the critical angle to be 60.2°. Substituting this value for the theoretical value of 61.2° decreases the calculated decay depth for 69° incident light to 73.6 nm. If the refractive index of cytosol (1.36) is used instead of the value for the aqueous medium (1.33) to calculate the critical angle (now 63.6°), then the calculated decay depth becomes 97.5 nm. These values are all within the 70-110 nm range for d quoted in the literature. However, d is only the depth at which the intensity of the evanescent wave is 37% of the initial intensity. To empirically determine the experimental depth at which fluorophores are visible, 1-μm fluorescent beads were imaged in"

MOCA produces aggresomes via one of the mechanisms that has been proposed for the formation of cytoplasmic deposits linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders (3Namekata K. Nishimura N. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 819-827Google Scholar, 4Chen Q. Yoshida H. Schubert D. Maher P. Mallory M. Masliah E. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1597-1602Google Scholar). MOCA may also be involved in the processing of amyloid precursor proteins (5Chen Q. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 79-89Google Scholar). Most of the studies of MOCA have concentrated on its involvement in the mechanism of neuronal disorders, but the physiological function of this protein has not been well understood. MOCA has a 40% sequence homology with Dock180, which has an SH3 domain and two CrkII-binding motifs, and has been proposed as an upstream regulator of a small GTPase, Rac1 (6Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N.

Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Google Scholar). Small GTPases of the Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) transduce signals from extracellular stimuli and are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton that cause changes in cell morphology, including neurite extension and retraction (9Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Google Scholar, 10Luo L. Liao Y.J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Google Scholar). Cell migration induced by overexpression of Dock180 is inhibited by co-expression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 (11Albert M.L. Kim J.I. Birge R.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 899-905Google Scholar, 12Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Google Scholar). Rac1 also controls membrane ruffling and formation of the lamellipodia, which is a sheetlike structure consisting of a cross-linked meshwork of actin filaments that appears at the leading edge of the cell. Integrins comprise a large family of cell surface receptors that recognize several extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagen. Integrin-mediated Rac1 activation induces the activation of JNK, which is involved in cell movement, proliferation, and survival by activating transcription factors in response to stress stimuli such as UV irradiation and inflammatory cytokines (13Dolfi F.

Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Google Scholar). The present study shows that MOCA interacts with Rac1 and induces the GTP loading of Rac1. Membrane-targeted MOCA induces membrane spreading by enhancing the activity of Rac1 more markedly than wild-type MOCA. MOCA is co-localized with actin filaments at the growth cone in primary cultures of cortical neurons. These observations suggest that MOCA is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization by regulating the activity of Rac1. Plasmids and Antibodies—Plasmids encoding Rac1 and CrkII cDNA were generous gifts from Dr. M. Matsuda. Plasmids encoding Rhotekin and CRIB cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. M. Negishi. MOCA mutant cDNAs (MOCA67, MOCA1060, MOCA1413, MOCA1777, and delMOCA) were amplified by PCR using a full-length MOCA cDNA as a template and ligated into pCIneo expression vector. His-tagged MOCA C-terminal cDNA generated by PCR was ligated into pET32 expression vector. HA-tagged Cdc42, RhoA, Grb2, and His-tagged JNK cDNAs were amplified and ligated into a pCIneo expression vector. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against MOCA was made in our laboratory. Anti-HA polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-CrkII, anti-Grb2, and monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibodies were from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ); and anti-phospho-c-Jun and anti-JNK polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Immunohistochemistry—The whole body of a C57BL/6 mouse at embryonic day 16 was immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 n phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). 10-μm sections were cut using a cryostat, incubated overnight with an affinity-purified antibody against MOCA at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml at 4 °C, and further incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 30 min (Histofine simple stain rat MAX-PO kit, Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoreactivity was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and nickel. For double labeling immunofluorescence, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-MOCA (1.0 μg/ml) and with mouse anti-MAP2 (1:500) antibodies (Sigma). Immunoreactivity to the antibody against MOCA was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and immunoreactivity to the antibody against MAP2 was visualized with Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG for 1 h (1:500). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, NIH 3T3, and SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary cultures of mouse cerebral cortices were prepared as described previously (16Abe K. Takayanagi M. Saito H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 54: 45-51Google Scholar). Briefly, 16-day-old mouse embryos were killed by decapitation, and the cerebral cortices were dissected in L-15 medium, treated with 0.25% trypsin (0.25% trypsin, 0.5% glucose, and 1% DNase I in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 30 min, washed, and dissociated by pipetting. The resulting dissociated cells were plated on a poly-d-lysine-coated cover glass and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Binding Assay for Small G Proteins—GST-Rac1, GST-Cdc42, and GST-RhoA were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). After 24 h of transfection with pCIneo-MOCA or pCIneo-delMOCA, COS-7 cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with EDTA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and centrifuged. The supernatants were incubated with agarose bead-associated GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed four times. MOCA bound to small GTPase proteins was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and assessed by Western blotting with an anti-MOCA antibody. Measurement of the Activity of Rho Family Proteins—The activities of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA were measured as described previously (17Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Google Scholar). GST-CRIB and GST-Rhotekin were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-agarose. After 24 h of transfection, COS-7 cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm MgCl2 containing protease inhibitor mixture), and then centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were incubated with agarose bead-associated GST fusion proteins for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, the bound small GTPase proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-HA antibody. Measurement of JNK Activity—pCIneo-His-JNK was transfected into COS-7 cells with pCIneo-MOCA, pCIneo-farnesylated MOCA, pCIneo-farnesylated delMOCA, or the vector alone. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 containing protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were sonicated four times for 5 s on ice and then centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was incubated with TALON resin (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml c-Jun protein, and 300 μm ATP containing protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Phosphorylated c-Jun was detected by an antibody against phosphorylated c-Jun. Identification of Proteins Associated with a C-terminal Fragment of MOCA—The C-terminal fragment of MOCA (amino acids 1841-2028) with a His tag epitope was purified from bacterial lysates using TALON resin. The purified MOCA fragment was fixed in AffiGel 10/15 (Bio-Rad). Rat brain homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was preabsorbed with AffiGel 10/15 for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with AffiGel 10/15 containing a MOCA fragment or with AffiGel 10/15 alone as a control for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, proteins bound to the MOCA fragment were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 600 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, and 1.5 m thiourea) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—An expression plasmid containing a MOCA cDNA was transfected into COS-7 cells with or without expression plasmids containing CrkII cDNA or Grb2 cDNA tagged with HA epitope, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The cells were then extracted with immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 150 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-HA antibody or anti-CrkII antibody (each 10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Protein G-Sepharose was added to the samples and further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Precipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured on a cover glass that was either uncoated or coated with poly-l-lysine (BD Biosciences), fibronectin (30 μg/ml), or laminin (30 μg/ml). NIH 3T3 and SY5Y cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min or with cold acetone for 3 min at room temperature for primary cultures of cells. Samples were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for at least 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% goat serum. After washing four times with PBS, samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 or Alexa Fluor 488 and diluted in PBS containing 5% goat serum. For visualization of F-actin, phalloidin conjugated with rhodamine was used. Reattachment Assay—SY5Y cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the MOCA cDNA and incubated for 20 h. After they were detached by trypsinization, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 1 h with gentle rocking. Cells were replated on the poly-l-lysine-coated cover glasses at 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 and incubated for 50 min. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed, and immunostaining was performed. MOCA Localizes to the Central Nervous System—We have demonstrated by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization that MOCA is expressed in the cerebral cortex (2Kashiwa A. Yoshida H. Lee S. Paladino T. Liu Y. Chen Q. Dargusch R. Schubert D. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 109-116Google Scholar, 3Namekata K. Nishimura N. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 819-827Google Scholar). To further examine the localization of MOCA, immunohistochemical analysis was performed by using a specific antibody against MOCA. Bright-field photographs of immunoreactivity for MOCA in the sagittal sections of 16-day-old mouse embryos showed that MOCA is localized mainly to the brain and spinal cord (Fig. 1A). Immunostaining with antibodies against MOCA and MAP2 (a neuronal marker) showed that MOCA is co-localized mainly with MAP2, suggesting that MOCA is specifically localized to neurons (Fig. 1, B-D). To confirm these findings, we performed Western blot analysis with homogenates from several tissues of embryonic day-16 mice using an antibody against MOCA (Fig. 1E). MOCA is expressed in the brain and spinal cord, but its expression is below a level that is detectable in the heart, lung, gut, liver, and kidney. MOCA Binds to and Activates Rac1—Because the Dock180 family of proteins interacts with and activates the Rho family of small GTPases (1Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Google Scholar, 8Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Google Scholar, 19Nishihara H. Kobayashi S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3337-3342Google Scholar), we investigated whether MOCA can interact with Rho family proteins. GST fusion of small GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA was mixed with lysates of COS-7 cells, which overexpress MOCA, and were subjected to Western blot analysis with an antibody against MOCA. MOCA binds to Rac1 but not to Cdc42 and RhoA (Fig. 2A). To examine whether MOCA replaces GDP with GTP for Rac1, the levels of GTP-bound Rac1 were measured using GST-CRIB, which specifically binds to GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42, in the presence or absence of MOCA. GST-Rhotekin was used to measure the levels of GTP-bound RhoA. In the presence of MOCA the amount of GTP-bound Rac1 was increased, whereas GTP-bound RhoA or Cdc42 did not show any change (Fig. 2, B-D). These observations indicate that MOCA specifically promotes guanine nucleotide exchange for Rac1. Rac1 Activation Domain of MOCA—To determine the region of MOCA required for the activation of Rac1, we constructed several deletion mutants of MOCA and measured their activity for GTP loading of Rac1 (Fig. 3A). Each deletion mutant of MOCA was co-expressed with Rac1, and the amounts of GTP-bound Rac1 were measured with GST-CRIB (Fig. 3B). An SH3 deletion mutant (MOCA67) greatly enhanced GTP loading of Rac1, similarly to the wild-type MOCA. The MOCA1060 mutant, which lacks the N-terminal 1059 amino acids, also enhanced GTP loading of Rac1 but slightly less efficiently than the wild type. Three other deletion mutants, MOCA1413 (lacking the N-terminal 1412 amino acids), MOCA1777 (lacking the N-terminal 1776 amino acids), and delMOCA (lacking amino acids 1061-1392) had no effect on GTP loading of Rac1. These observations suggest that the amino acids 1061-1392 of MOCA are required for promoting GTP loading of Rac1. To confirm the above observations, we tested whether this region of MOCA is required for the binding to Rac1. GST-Rac1 was mixed with lysates of cells expressing wild-type MOCA or delMOCA, and pull-down assays were performed. Wild-type MOCA interacted with Rac1, whereas delMOCA did not (Fig. 3C). These observations indicate that the amino acid 1061-1392 region of MOCA is required for the binding and GTP loading of Rac1. Farnesylated MOCA Enhances GTP Loading of Rac1 and JNK Activation—Because Rac1 is activated at the plasma membrane by prenylation of its C terminus (21Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Google Scholar), it is possible that Rac1 can be efficiently activated when the localization of MOCA shifts to the membrane. To examine this possibility, the C terminus of Ki-Ras, which contains the CAAX farnesylation signal (22Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Google Scholar), was attached to MOCA, and its effect on GTP loading of Rac1 was examined. Farnesylated MOCA enhanced GTP loading of Rac1 more efficiently than the wild-type MOCA (Fig. 4A). This observation suggests that MOCA enhances GTP loading of Rac1 at the plasma membrane. Because GTP-bound Rac1 activates JNK (23Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 24Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar), we tested whether or not MOCA activates JNK. His-tagged JNK was co-expressed with the wild-type or farnesylated MOCA, and JNK activity was measured in vitro with c-Jun as a substrate. Farnesylated MOCA increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun more efficiently than the wild-type MOCA (Fig. 4B). We also tested the effect of delMOCA or farnesylated delMOCA on the phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of both mutants caused phosphorylation of c-Jun less effectively than the wild-type MOCA. These observations suggest that Rac1 activation mediated by MOCA induces JNK activation. Interaction of MOCA with Adapter Proteins—MOCA has three proline-rich PXXP motifs (2Kashiwa A. Yoshida H. Lee S. Paladino T. Liu Y. Chen Q. Dargusch R. Schubert D. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 109-116Google Scholar), which interact with the SH3 domain, in its C termini. Because MOCA binds to CrkII (2Kashiwa A. Yoshida H. Lee S. Paladino T. Liu Y. Chen Q. Dargusch R. Schubert D. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 109-116Google Scholar), the interaction of the C-terminal fragment of MOCA (amino acids 1841-2028) attached to AffiGel 10/15 with other SH3 domain-containing adapter proteins was examined. The MOCA fragment interacts with two adapter proteins, CrkII and Grb2 (Fig. 5A). The interaction of full-length MOCA was also examined by immunoprecipitation assays. Full-length MOCA was co-immunoprecipitated with CrkII and Grb2 (Fig. 5, B and C). These observations show that MOCA interacts with CrkII and Grb2. Because JNK activation mediated by the Dock180-Rac1 pathway is enhanced by CrkII (8Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Google Scholar), it is possible that JNK activation mediated by the MOCA-Rac1 pathway is also enhanced by CrkII or Grb2. Neither adapter protein, however, had any effect on the JNK activation mediated by MOCA (data not shown). Effect of MOCA on Cell Morphology—Because MOCA regulates cell adhesion (5Chen Q. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 79-89Google Scholar), it is possible that cells expressing MOCA may have specific morphological characteristics. To test this possibility, the effects of the wild-type and farnesylated MOCA on cell morphology were examined using NIH 3T3 cells. Although there was no significant change in morphology in cells expressing the wild-type MOCA, membrane spreading was observed in cells expressing farnesylated MOCA (Fig. 6, A and B). When cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated slides, the expression of farnesylated MOCA caused the round, flattened shape characteristic of the morphology observed in cells in which Rac1 is constitutively activated (Rac1Q61L) (25Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, E and G). Similar results were observed when the cells were cultured on laminin (Fig. 6H). To further examine whether Rac1 activation is involved in the morphological changes, the effect of farnesylated delMOCA, which does not activate Rac 1 (Fig. 4), on morphology was investigated. No significant change in morphology was observed in cells expressing farnesylated delMOCA (Fig. 6F). These observations suggest that MOCA may promote GTP loading of Rac1 at the plasma membrane and cause morphological changes. MOCA Co-localizes with F-actin at the Leading Edge of Membrane Protrusion—Because farnesylated MOCA causes changes in cell morphology (Fig. 6), MOCA may be involved in the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. The localization and distribution of MOCA at the location of cell spreading were examined using a human neuroblastoma cell line, SY5Y, which endogenously expresses MOCA (3Namekata K. Nishimura N. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 819-827Google Scholar). The localization of MOCA was examined 50 min after the inoculation of cells onto culture dishes. When cells exhibited extensive spreading and formed broad membrane protrusion, MOCA was translocated to the leading edge of the broad membrane protrusions (lamellipodia) and co-localized with actin filaments (Fig. 7, D-F). Similar results were obtained with cells overexpressing MOCA (Fig. 7, G-I). These observations suggest that MOCA may regulate cell spreading by reorganizing actin filaments through the activation of Rac1. MOCA Co-localizes with GAP43 and Actin Filaments at the Growth Cone—Because MOCA is a neuron-specific protein (Fig. 1, and Ref. 2Kashiwa A. Yoshida H. Lee S. Paladino T. Liu Y. Chen Q. Dargusch R. Schubert D. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 109-116Google Scholar), it is possible that MOCA is involved in axonal elongation. To examine this possibility, the localization of MOCA in primary cultures of cortical neurons was investigated. Analysis of the immunoreactivity for MOCA showed that MOCA co-localized with GAP43, which was expressed in growth cones of elongating axon (Fig. 8, A-F) (26Basi G.S. Jacobson R.D. Virag I. Schilling J. Skene J.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 785-791Google Scholar, 27Meiri H. Spira G. Sammar M. Namir M. Schwartz A. Komoriya A. Kosower E.M. Palti Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5058-5062Google Scholar). At the growth cones, MOCA was also co-localized with actin filaments (Fig. 8, G-L). These observations suggest that MOCA may be involved in axon elongation where actin filaments are reorganized by regulating Rac1 activation. The present study showed that MOCA binds to and activates a small GTPase (Rac1), leading to the enhancement of JNK activation. Although MOCA lacks the tandem Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains found in most guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate the Rho family of GTPases (28Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Google Scholar), we have identified the domain (amino acid 1061-1393) that is required for the binding and activation of Rac1. The fact that the corresponding region of Dock180 (called Docker (amino acids 1111-1657) or DHR-2 (amino acids 1111-1636) domain) is required for Dock 180 to bind to and activate Rac1 supports our findings (1Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Google Scholar, 29Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 574-582Google Scholar). In contrast to our observations, it has been reported that a peptide fragment containing the DHR-2 domain of MOCA fails to activate Rac1 (1Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Google Scholar). This discrepancy may have been caused by the different constructions of MOCA used, whereas our observations were obtained with full-length MOCA. Membrane-targeted MOCA produced by farnesylation increased the GTP loading of Rac1 and enhanced the JNK activity more markedly than wild-type MOCA (Fig. 4). Farnesylated MOCA also induced membrane spreading (Fig. 6). Guanine nucleotide exchange proteins require adapter proteins to be localized to the plasma membrane and enhance GTP loading of the Rho family of proteins. For example, a guanine exchange protein for Ras, SOS, binds to SH3 of Grb2 to be localized to the plasma membrane (30Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Google Scholar, 31Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Google Scholar), and farnesylated membrane-targeted SOS increases the levels of GTP-bound Ras without binding to Grb2 (31Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Google Scholar). Dock180 activates JNK by interacting with CrkII, and Dock2 enhances the GTP loading of Rac1 by interacting with CrkL kinases (8Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Google Scholar, 32Nishihara H. Maeda M. Oda A. Tsuda M. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Tanaka S. Blood. 2002; 100: 3968-3974Google Scholar). In contrast, both CrkII and Grb2 bound to MOCA but failed to enhance MOCA-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that MOCA binds to CrkII or Grb2 but may not localize to the membrane to induce Rac1 activation. Because MOCA has three basic SH3-binding motifs (PXXP) in its C terminus, there may be an unknown adapter protein that binds to MOCA for its localization to the appropriate site in the plasma membrane. Elmo has recently been found as a binding protein for Dock180 that enhances Rac1 activation (29Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 574-582Google Scholar, 33Scott M.P. Zappacosta F. Kim E.Y. Annan R.S. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28238-28246Google Scholar, 34Katoh H. Negishi M. Nature. 2003; 424: 461-464Google Scholar). It is possible that Elmo is involved in the activation of MOCA. To examine this possibility, Elmo was co-transfected with MOCA, and the activation of Rac1 was investigated by measuring its interaction with GST-CRIB. Co-expression of MOCA and Elmo did not induce interaction with GST-CRIB, suggesting that Elmo may not be involved in the activation of Rac1 by MOCA (data not shown). Farnesylated MOCA caused membrane spreading even when cells were cultured on non-coated cover glasses (Fig. 6). On fibronectin-coated dishes, cells overexpressing farnesylated MOCA displayed a round, flattened shape similar to that of cells overexpressing constitutively active Rac1 (Fig. 6). These observations suggest that integrin signaling enhances the effect of farnesylated MOCA, which activates Rac1 to cause membrane spreading. Because wild-type MOCA does not induce morphological changes even on fibronectin-coated dishes, the interaction of MOCA with the plasma membrane may be required for effective transduction of integrin signaling. Alternatively, considering the fact that Dock180 forms complexes with CrkII and p130Cas to transduce integrin signaling to Rac1 (35Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Google Scholar), MOCA may also form a complex with unknown protein(s) at the plasma membrane to transduce integrin signaling to fully activate Rac1. Neuroblastoma cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Rac1 do not extend neurites, and primary cultures of neurons expressing a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 do not form lamellipodia (36Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Google Scholar, 37Albertinazzi C. Gilardelli D. Paris S. Longhi R. de Curtis I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 815-825Google Scholar). MOCA is concentrated with actin on the growth cone of primary cultures of neurons, and it is also concentrated on lamellipodia when SY5Y cells adhere to dishes (Figs. 7 and 8). These observations suggest that Rac1 activation by MOCA may be involved in the reorganization of actin filaments at lamellipodia in neuroblastoma cells as well as at the growth cone in primary cultures of neurons. In conclusion, MOCA binds to Rac1 and promotes GTP loading of Rac1, which leads to the activation of JNK. Farnesylated MOCA is concentrated with actin filaments on lamellipodia and growth cones. These observations suggest that MOCA may be involved in cell morphological changes at neural extension by regulating actin reorganization.

https://openalex.org/W2101840841,"What happens to organelles during mitosis, and how they are apportioned to each of the daughter cells, is not completely clear. We have devised a procedure to address whether Golgi membranes fuse with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) during mitosis via the detection of interactions between ER and Golgi proteins. This procedure involves coexpressing an FKBP-tagged Golgi enzyme with an ER-retained protein fused to FRAP in COS cells. Since treatment with rapamycin induces a tight association between FKBP and FRAP, one would expect rapamycin to trap the FKBP-fused Golgi protein in the ER if it ever visits the ER during mitosis. However, after the doubly transfected cells progress through mitosis in the presence of rapamycin, we find the Golgi protein in the newly formed Golgi stacks and not in the ER. Based on these results, we conclude that Golgi membranes remain separate from the ER during mitosis in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2111776675,"The human muscle chloride channel ClC-1 has a 398-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain that resides in the cytoplasm and contains two CBS (cystathionine-β-synthase) domains. To examine the role of this region, we studied various carboxyl-terminal truncations by heterologous expression in mammalian cells, whole-cell patch clamp recording, and confocal imaging.

ClC channels are dimeric proteins with two ion conduction pathways (protopores).

Fusion proteins of cyan fluorescent protein linked to various fragments of the carboxyl terminus formed soluble proteins that could be redistributed to the surface membrane through binding to certain truncated channel subunits. Stable binding only occurs between carboxyl-terminal fragments of a single subunit, not between carboxyl termini of different subunits and not between carboxyl-terminal and transmembrane domains. However, an interaction with transmembrane domains can modify the binding properties of particular carboxyl-terminal proteins.

Nine isoforms (ClC-1 to ClC-7, ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb) were shown to be expressed in human tissues and to fulfil a variety of functional roles. ClC-1 is the major muscle chloride channel responsible for the regulation of muscle excitability (1Koch M.C. Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Ricker K. Wolf F. Otto M. Zoll B. Lehmann-Horn F. Grzeschik K.H.

Although co-expression of the complementary carboxyl terminus restored the function of these channels, this was not the case for truncations removing carboxyl-terminal fragments containing both CBS domains (13Schmidt-Rose T.

Although these results demonstrated the importance of this region for the function of the channel in the surface membrane, it is still unclear by which mechanism the carboxyl terminus supports this function. It is not known whether ClC channel carboxyl termini are necessary for channel trafficking or for the proper function of the channel. Because ClC channels exhibit two ion conduction pathways (protopores) per functional channel (8Dutzler R. Campbell E.D. Cadene M. Chait M.B. MacKinnon R.

Nature. 2001; 409: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the carboxyl terminus of one subunit might modify either the function of an individual protopore or of both protopores of the double-barreled channels. In the present work, we addressed these questions by studying the functional role of carboxyl-terminal regions of hClC-1 channels and interactions between them and transmembrane domains. We demonstrate that carboxyl-terminal truncations result in a loss of function rather than in an impaired plasma membrane insertion of functional channels. In heterodimeric channels with only one carboxyl terminus, only one protopore is functional. Moreover, we show interactions between carboxyl-terminal fragments stable enough to redistribute a cytoplasmic channel fragment to the membrane. Such interactions are only possible within one subunit and not between domains belonging to two separate subunits. Mutagenesis and Channel Expression—Truncations and point mutations were introduced into the plasmid pRc/CMV-hClC-1 containing the full-length WT hClC-1 cDNA (19Fahlke C. Rüdel R. Mitrovic N. Zhou M. George Jr., A.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) by PCR-based strategies. To create YFP or CFP fusion proteins with hClC-1, the YPF/CFP was excised from pEYFP-N1/pECFP-N1 (Clontech) and inserted into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) using HindIII and BsrGI (YFP) or BamHI and XbaI (CFP) together with fragments of the hClC-1 coding sequence connected by short linker sequences in a single open reading frame. All mutations were verified by direct sequencing. Construction of concatamers was performed as previously described (20Fahlke C. Knittle T.J. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For all constructs, two independent mutant clones were used for expression studies. Expression of hClC-1 Channel Fragments—Transient transfections in tsA201 cells were performed with 0.1-10 μg of plasmid DNA using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Fahlke C. Knittle T.J.

J. 2003; 84: 2306-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The standard extracellular solution contained (in mm) NaCl (140), KCl (4), CaCl2 (2), MgCl2 (1), HEPES (5); the standard intracellular solution contained (in mm) NaCl (120), MgCl2 (2), EGTA (5), HEPES (10). All solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4. Cells were clamped to 0 mV between two test sweeps. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed by a combination of PulseTools (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany), pClamp (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) programs. To determine the unitary current amplitude as well as the absolute open probabilities of mutant hClC-1 channels, non-stationary noise analysis was performed as described (23Hebeisen S. Heidtmann L. Cosmelli D. Gonzalez C. Poser B. Latorre R. Alvarez O. Fahlke C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2306-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To obtain the voltage dependence of activation, instantaneous current amplitudes were determined 200 μs after a voltage step to -125 mV following 0.2-s prepulses to various voltages, normalized by their maximum value, and plotted versus the preceding potential. To determine the voltage dependence of the opening of the slow gate, a short 400-μs pulse to +180 mV was inserted before the test step to -125 mV to fully activate the fast gate (24Accardi A. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A plot of the instantaneous current amplitude at -125 mV versus the prepulse potential yields the voltage dependence of the slow gate. The relative open probability of the fast gate was calculated by dividing the voltage dependence of the relative open probability by the open probability of the slow gate. Activation curves for the fast and for the slow gate were fit with a sum of a voltage-independent minimum open probability (Pmin) and a voltage-dependent term: I(V) = Amp/(1 + e(V - V 0.5)/kV) + Pmin. For the determination of mean peak current amplitudes (Fig. 5), whole-cell and excised outside-out patch currents were averaged. To account for the distinct membrane area in patches compared with a whole cell, the patch current amplitudes were multiplied by the ratios of resting conductance before excision by the corresponding value after excision. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal imaging was carried out on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an argon-ion laser (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) (25Giese B. Au-Yeung C. Herrmann A. Diefenbach S. Haan C. Kuster A. Wortmann S. Roderburg C. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39205-39213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The argon-ion laser was modulated by an acusto-optical modulator. For excitation of CFP the 458-nm line was used. The beampath for CFP contained a 458-nm main dichroic mirror and a 480/20-nm bandpass filter for detection of emitted fluorescence. This narrow filter excludes any fluorescence emerging from YFP that is also excited by the 458-nm laser beam. The beampath for YFP detection contained excitation at 514 nm and a main dichroic mirror of 514 nm. The emitted light was monitored with a 530-600-nm bandpass filter. CFP is not excited by the 514-nm laser. For cells co-expressing CFP and YFP the multitrack function of the LSM 510 was used. Live cell imaging was carried out with transiently transfected tsA201 cells on a glass coverslip in a perfused recording chamber 48 h after transfection. Effects of Carboxyl-terminal Truncations and Deletions of hClC-1—We investigated various truncation mutants of hClC-1 (Fig. 1A) heterologously expressed in tsA201 cells to study the functional role of distinct components of the carboxyl terminus. Experiments were performed with homodimeric proteins obtained through transfection of plasmids encoding hClC-1 monomeric constructs. Truncations distal the second CBS domain did not change macroscopic hClC-1 currents (Fig. 1B). In contrast, deletions of parts of CBS2, even as little as 6 amino acids (E865X), caused a complete disappearance of the ClC-1 current component (Fig. 1B). Although deletion of CBS1 did not change the macroscopic current amplitudes, removal of increasing parts of the interlinker between CBS1 and CBS2 caused a gradual decrease of the current amplitude (Fig. 1B). Substitution of CBS2 with CBS1 in Δ(D607-Q662)CBS1 hClC-1 resulted in comparable macroscopic current amplitudes, indicating that the two CBS domains can substitute for each other (Fig. 1B). The reduced macroscopic current amplitude in cells expressing truncated channels might be because of an impaired surface targeting, a reduced unitary current amplitude, or a reduced absolute open probability of functional channels as well as a reduction of functional channels in the surface membrane. To study the subcellular distribution of truncated ClC-1 channels, we generated YFP-tagged channel constructs and examined cells expressing various YFP-ClC-1del constructs by confocal imaging. Cells expressing WT as well as G750X, A700X, and L590X hClC-1 channels showed a staining of the surface membrane (Fig. 1, C, E-G). We conclude that these mutant channels do not abolish surface membrane insertion but rather alter the function of inserted channels. In cells expressing Y850X hClC-1 channels, the staining of the surface membrane was decreased, suggesting that this mutation might also interfere with surface membrane insertion. Similar to another ClC isoform, hClC-2 (3Haug K. Warnstedt M. Alekov A. Sander T. Ramirez A. Poser B. Maljevic S. Hebeisen S. Kubisch C. Rebstock J. Horvath S. Hallmann K. Dullinger J. Rau B. Haverkamp F. Beyenbrug S. Schulz H. Janz D. Giese B. Müller-Newen G. Propping P. Elger C. Fahlke C. Lerche H. Heils A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), all tested constructs also appeared in internal membrane compartments (Fig. 1, C-G). Functional Alterations in Carboxyl-terminal-deleted Channels—We next investigated gating and ion permeation properties of mutant ClC-1 channels lacking the CBS1 domain plus various fractions of the CBS interlinker (Fig. 2). All tested deletion mutants showed the hallmarks of ClC-1 gating, i.e. depolarization-induced activation, a biexponential deactivation time course, and the presence of two kinetically distinct gating processes (fast and slow gating) (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutant channels only differed in a slightly shifted voltage dependence of the fast and of the slow gate from WT (Fig. 2, A and B). No differences could be observed between distinct truncation mutants (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine the unitary current amplitude and the absolute open probability, we performed non-stationary noise analysis. Fig. 2 illustrates the time course of the mean current for a voltage step from a holding potential of 0 mV to a test potential of -160 mV (Fig. 2C) and the corresponding time course of the variance (Fig. 2D) measured at an outside-out patch of a tsA201 cell expressing Δ(D607-A700) hClC-1 in standard internal and external solution. As shown in Equation 1, to obtain the unitary current amplitude (i) and the absolute open probability of the underlying channels, the variance-mean current plot in Fig. 2E was fitted to σ2(t)=iI(t)-I2(t)N(Eq. 1) where i is the single channel current amplitude, N the number of channels, and I the mean current amplitude (26Sigworth F.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1980; 307: 97-129Crossref Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 27Heinemann S.H. Conti F. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). From these fits, the unitary current amplitude at -160 mV (0.32 ± 0.03 pA, n = 6, as compared with WT, 0.28 ± 0.02 pA, n = 6) and the number of channels in the cells were obtained. Because hClC-1 exhibits two ion conduction pathways, the so-obtained single channel amplitudes have a value between the half- and the full-conductance current amplitude (23Hebeisen S. Heidtmann L. Cosmelli D. Gonzalez C. Poser B. Latorre R. Alvarez O. Fahlke C. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2306-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results of noise analysis nevertheless demonstrate that deleting parts of the carboxyl terminus does not cause substantial changes of the unitary current amplitude. By dividing the instantaneous current amplitude by the product of the unitary current amplitude and the number of channels, we then calculated the absolute open probability at the holding potential (Δ(D607-A700) hClC-1, 0.90 ± 0.03, n = 8; WT, 0.89 ± 0.02, n = 6). The results taken together indicate that removal of CBS1 and major components of the CBS interlinker do not alter ion conduction and only mildly affect gating properties of ClC-1. Only One CBS2 Domain Is Necessary to Support the Function of Heterodimeric ClC-1 Channels—ClC channels are dimeric proteins with two functional ion conduction pathways. The importance of the carboxyl terminus for the functional expression of ClC-1 (Fig. 1B) raised the question whether each individual protopore or each channel requires the minimum set of carboxyl-terminal fragments for proper function. To address this question we studied heterodimeric channels using a concatameric construct that links two ClC-1 coding regions in a single open reading frame (20Fahlke C. Knittle T.J. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Heterodimeric WT-L590X hClC-1 channels containing only one complete carboxyl terminus and even Δ(D607-Q662)-L590X hClC-1 channels with only one CBS domain both form functional channels with gating and permeation properties similar to those of WT (Fig. 3, A and B), albeit with decreased macroscopic current amplitudes (Fig. 3C). Obviously, a single CBS domain is sufficient for channel function. Covalent linkage of two different subunits does not completely dismiss the possibility of the formation of homodimeric channels assembled by two identical subunits belonging to two distinct concatamers. To test whether the expression of heterodimeric concatamers supports the formation of homodimers by such a mechanism, we inserted a naturally occurring, disease-causing point mutation, S132C (28Wu F.F. Ryan A. Devaney J.M. Warnstedt M. Korade-Mirnics Z. Poser B. Escriva M.J. Pegoraro E. Yee A.S. Felice K.J. Giuliani M.J. Mayer R.F. Mongini T. Palmucci L.M. Marino M. Rüdel R. Hoffman E.P. Fahlke C. Brain. 2002; 125: 2392-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), in one of the two subunits. S132C modifies gating properties of ClC-1 in homodimeric S132C hClC-1 and in heterodimeric WT-S132C hClC-1 channels in a different way (Fig. 3, D-F). Homodimeric S132C hClC-1 channels activate upon membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 3D), whereas expression of WT-S132C hClC-1 concatamers results in a depolarization-activated anion current that differs from homodimeric WT channels in voltage dependence and in minimum open probability at negative potentials (Fig. 3, A and E). The absence of a hyperpolarization-activated current amplitude indicates that homodimeric S132C hClC-1 channels are not formed under these conditions and demonstrates that expression of concatamers results in a homogenous population of heterodimeric anion channels. Expression of a concatameric construct linking S132C hClC-1 with L590X hClC-1 in tsA201 cells gives rise to the expression of an anion current whose gating properties are similar to those of heterodimeric WT-S132C hClC-1 channels (Fig. 3F). Because L590X hClC-1 homodimeric channels are non-functional, currents that deactivate upon hyperpolarizing voltage steps must be conducted by heterodimeric channels with only one carboxyl terminus (Fig. 3F). Within the double-barreled architecture of ClC-1 channels, an individual carboxyl terminus might support the function of both protopores of an individual channel or the anion transfer through the corresponding protopore. We engineered truncated ClC-1 subunits carrying a point mutation (S537F) rendering mutant hClC-1 channels insensitive to block by 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9-AC) (29Bryant S.H. Morales-Aguilera A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1971; 219: 361-383Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Estevez R. Schroeder B.C. Accardi A. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. Neuron. 2003; 38: 47-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As 9-AC binds within the ion conduction pathway, a heterodimer consisting of one 9-AC-sensitive and one 9-AC-insensitive subunit provides insights into the function of individual protopores. If both protopores were functional in heterodimeric channels with only one carboxyl terminus, one would expect a similar relative current reduction by 9-AC in cells expressing WT-S537F and in cells expressing heterodimeric channels in which one of the two carboxyl termini is deleted, i.e. WT-S537F/L590X and S537F-L590X hClC-1 channels. This was not the case. Fig. 4A shows current recordings of a tsA201 cell expressing a WT-S537F/L590X hClC-1 heterodimeric construct after application of 0.2 mm 9-AC in the external solution. In the presence of 0.2 mm 9-AC, the current amplitude decreased in a monoexponential fashion to a steady-state value of about 20% of the initial current amplitude (Fig. 4B). The relative block of WT-S537F/L590X hClC-1 channels (blocked current fraction: 0.80 ± 0.01, n = 15, p < 0.01) was significantly larger, and the relative block observed for S537F-L590X heterodimers (0.29 ± 0.02, n = 12, p < 0.01) significantly smaller than the relative block of WT-S537F hClC-1 (0.55 ± 0.03, n = 8) (Fig. 4C). This demonstrates that the protopore without attached carboxyl terminus is non-functional in the WT-S537F/L590X as well as in the S537F-L590X hClC-1 heterodimer. We conclude that the hClC-1 carboxyl terminus supports only the function of the protopore to which it is attached. Rescue of ClC-1 Function by Co-expression of Truncated Channel Constructs with Isolated Carboxyl Termini—Co-expressing isolated carboxyl-terminal proteins rescued non-functional truncation mutants of hClC-1 in mammalian cells in agreement with earlier results using Xenopus oocytes or insect cells (13Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Maduke M. Williams C. Miller C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4304-4307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Channels formed by assembly of such fragments exhibit unaltered gating and conduction properties, but there were marked differences in current amplitudes between separate sets of co-expressed fragments. Fig. 5A shows mean current amplitudes for five distinct carboxyl-terminal truncations that are non-functional when expressed alone, L590X, G650X, A700X, G750X, and E800X. Each of these truncation mutants was co-transfected with expression constructs encoding isolated carboxyl termini of variable length, i.e. Cterm(L590-L988), Cterm(A700-L988), Cterm(G750-L988), Cterm(E800-L988), as well as Cterm(A700-L988CBS1) in which CBS2 was substituted with CBS1. For deletions amino-terminal or within CBS1, none of the co-transfections resulted in the expression of functional channels. A700X ClC-1 and mutant ClC-1 with larger carboxyl termini were rescued by co-expressing various carboxyl-terminal proteins (Fig. 5A). Co-transfection of A700X, G750X, and E800X with Cterm(E800-L988) did not result in the appearance of a ClC-1 current component, which demonstrates the importance of the linker between amino acids 700 and 800 for this interaction. Moreover, in co-expression experiments CBS1 and CBS2 were not equivalent because co-expressing A700X hClC-1 with Cterm(A700-L988CBS1) did not result in the formation of functional channels (Fig. 5A). The mean current amplitudes observed in co-transfected cells depended on the length of the carboxyl-terminal fragment. For all tested transmembrane constructs, expression levels were highest when co-expressed with Cterm(G750-L988) (Fig. 5A). Comparing expression levels for various transmembrane constructs with a given carboxyl terminus, G750X exhibited the highest expression levels of all combinations (Fig. 5A). When transfected with Cterm(G750-L988), no significant difference in the current amplitudes for G750X and E800X were observed (Fig. 5A), indicating that a doubling of this particular region is of no functional consequence. Binding of Carboxyl-terminal Proteins to ClC-1 Truncation Mutants—The co-expression results indicate a specific interaction between carboxyl-terminal proteins and truncated hClC-1 channel constructs. To study interactions between hClC-1 protein fragments more directly, we used co-transfection and confocal imaging of truncated ClC-1 and carboxyl-terminal fragments, both fused to fluorescent proteins. All carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins formed soluble proteins (Fig. 5, B-D). Although fusion proteins containing only parts of the ClC-1 carboxyl terminus (Cterm(A700-L988)-CFP (Fig. 5C), Cterm(G750-L988)-CFP, Cterm(E800-L988)-CFP) (data not shown) were small enough to enter the nucleus, resulting in a fluorescent staining of the whole cell, only the cytoplasm was fluorescently labeled in cells expressing Cterm(L590-L988)-CFP (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection of carboxyl-terminal proteins together with certain truncation mutants caused a redistribution of the soluble proteins to the membrane (Table I). For example, in cells co-transfected with YFP-A700X hClC-1 and Cterm(A700-L988)-CFP the majority of CFP fluorescence is overlaid to the YFP fluorescence (visible as orange color in Fig. 5F), indicating a stable binding of YFP-A700X hClC-1 and Cterm(A700-L988)-CFP. This result is further supported by the finding that no fluorescence is observed in the nucleus of co-transfected cells (Fig. 5F).Table ICo-localization of C-terminal and transmembrane fluorescent fusion proteinsTransmembrane YFP constructsSoluble CFP constructsCterm(L590-L988)Cterm(A700-L988)Cterm(A700-L988CBS1)Cterm(E800-L988)L590X hC1C-1−a−, no co-localization.−−−A700X hC1C-1+b+, co-localization.+−−G750X hC1C-1++−−E800X hC1C-1++−+Y850X hC1C-1NDcND, not determined.+NDNDΔ(D607-Q662) hC1C-1ND−−NDΔ(D607-Q662)-E800X hC1C-1ND+−+WT hC1C-1−−−−a −, no co-localization.b +, co-localization.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Fig. 5 and Table I give the results of additional co-transfection experiments of fluorescent carboxyl termini and truncated channels. No redistribution and no overlay could be observed for the two complementary fragments YFP-L590X hClC-1 and Cterm(L590-L988)-CFP (Fig. 5E), indicating that carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins most likely do not stably bind to the transmembrane domain. In cells co-expressing YFP-Δ(D607-Q662) hClC-1 (containing CBS2) and Cterm(A700-L988CBS1)-CFP (containing CBS1), the nucleus was still stained and YFP and CFP were not co-localized (Fig. 5G). CBS1 and CBS2 are either not direct binding partners or these domains adopt different conformations when attached to other regions of the carboxyl terminus. Our results (Table I) cannot be readily explained by assuming two defined binding partners within the carboxyl terminus. Rather, they suggest that certain domains within the carboxyl terminus exhibit distinct conformations in separate constructs. Such a feature can be directly demonstrated by co-transfection experiments involving one complete carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6). YFP-WT hClC-1 channels bind neither the Cterm(A700-L988)-CFP (Fig. 6A) nor Cterm(A700-L988CBS1)-CFP (Fig. 6B), indicating that the binding sites that allow truncated channels to translocate these carboxyl-terminal fragments are not accessible in WT. Most likely, these sites are occupied by fragments of the same polypeptide chain, preventing the binding of additional carboxyl-terminal fragments. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal fusion protein Cterm(L590-L988)-CFP is redistributed by YFP-A700X hClC-1 (Fig. 6C). The isolated Cterm(L590-L988)-CFP obviously exhibits different binding properties than a carboxyl terminus attached to a transmembrane domain. Carboxyl-terminal Fragments Only Interact within a Single Polypeptide Chain—A dimeric ClC channel possesses two carboxyl termini, and therefore interactions between separate carboxyl-terminal fragments might occur within a single polypeptide chain or between the two subunits. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed co-expression experiments with fluorescent protein-tagged channel constructs (Fig. 7). We designed a concatameric construct in which one hClC-1 subunit lacking CBS1 (YFP-Δ(D607-Q662) hClC-1) was linked to E800X hClC-1 (Fig. 7A). This heterodimeric channel is present in the surface membrane and exhibits functional properties similar to homodimeric WT hClC-1 (data not shown). Co-transfection of this concatamer with Cterm(A700-L988)-CFP caused a redistribution of the carboxyl-terminal fusion protein. YFP and CFP fluorescences overlap, and no fluorescence is visible within the nucleus (Fig. 7A). In contrast, a heterodimer consisting of one YFP-WT hClC-1 and one L590X hClC-1 subunit does not bind Cterm(A700-L988)-CFP (Fig. 7B). Although both heterodimers exhibit the same set of carboxyl-terminal fragments, they differ in their binding properties. Although separate segments of the WT carboxyl terminus bind to each other, preventing an interaction of the soluble fusion protein with WT-L590X hClC-1 heterodimers, Cterm(A700-L988)-CFP can bind to YFP-Δ(D607-Q662)-E800X hClC-1 heterodimers, indicating an accessible binding site within the carboxyl termini. We conclude that carboxyl-terminal fragments attached to distinct subunits do not bind to each other. All mammalian ClC channels exhibit a cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus with two so-called CBS domains (Fig. 1A). The functional importance of this channel region is illustrated by various disease-causing mutations (3Haug K. Warnstedt M. Alekov A. Sander T. Ramirez A. Poser B. Maljevic S. Hebeisen S. Kubisch C.

The loss of function of truncated ClC channels appears to occur by distinct mechanisms in separate ClC isoforms. Maduke et al. (14Maduke M. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated that injection of a purified protein fragment corresponding to the last 150 amino acids of ClC-0 restored channel function of a truncated ClC-0; however, this effect was prevented by incubation with brefeldin A, an agent inhibiting plasma membrane trafficking. This result suggested an inability of truncated ClC-0 to insert into the membrane and a role of CBS2 in intracellular trafficking. Mutations within CBS2 or deletion of this region caused a mistargeting of Gef1, a yeast ClC channel isoform that is normally present in the Golgi apparatus (16Schwappach B. Stobrawa S. Hechenberger M. Steinmeyer K. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15110-15118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For ClC-5, a predominantly intracellularly located ClC isoform, truncated channels missing large portions of the carboxyl terminus or even some of the transmembrane domains were reported to insert into the plasma membrane (31Mo L. Xiong W. Qian T. Sun H. Wills N.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 286: C79-C89Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, several ClC-1 truncation mutants were inserted into the surface membrane (Fig. 1), demonstrating that the carboxyl terminus of ClC-1 is not necessary for insertion into the plasma membrane. We could show further that carboxyl-terminal deletion does not alter anion permeation or gating properties so that truncated channels are permanently closed, for example by a change of the voltage dependence or of the absolute open probability (Fig. 2). For ClC-1, increasing deletions of CBS1 and the CBS1-CBS2 interlinker do not result in changed gating properties but cause a progressive decrease of the maximum current amplitude (Figs. 1 and 2). CBS domains are thought to interact with each other (9Ponting C.P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and therefore interaction of CBS1 and CBS2 was assumed to be necessary for normal ClC channel function (13Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We here demonstrate that heterodimeric channels with only a single CBS domain are functional, refuting this suggestion (Fig. 3). ClC-1 mutants with deleted CBS1 (Δ(D607-Q662) hClC-1) do not bind a carboxyl-terminal fusion protein with CBS1 (Cterm(A700-L988CBS1)) (Fig. 5G). Moreover, no colocalization of A700X and G750X hClC-1 (containing CBS1) with Cterm(E800-L988) (containing CBS2) was observed (Table I). These results argue against the notion that CBS1 and CBS2 bind to each other. All tested carboxyl-terminal fusion proteins are located in the cytoplasm and some, depending on their size, are even able to enter the nucleus (Fig. 5). Co-expression with certain membrane-spanning fragments caused a redistribution, indicating a stable binding of the two components to each other. However, an isolated complete hClC-1 carboxyl terminus (Cterm(L590-L988)) does not co-localize with a L590X hClC-1, indicating that the carboxyl terminus does not bind directly to a transmembrane domain (Fig. 5). The conformation of Cterm(L590-L988) depends on the presence of the transmembrane domains of hClC-1. The isolated carboxyl terminus (Cterm(L590-L988)) is capable of binding to A700X hClC-1 and of relocalization to the membrane (Fig. 6C). When attached to the pore-forming domains in WT channel, it is unable to bind carboxyl-terminal fragments (Cterm(A700-L988) and Cterm(A700-L988CBS1)) (Fig. 6A). Obviously, Cterm(L590-L988) exhibits a distinct conformation when attached to transmembrane domains, suggesting an interaction but no stable binding of carboxyl terminus and transmembrane domains. ClC channels exhibit a unique architecture with two subunits each forming an ion conduction pathway. So far, it was unclear whether this particular symmetry also extended to the carboxyl termini, i.e. whether the two carboxyl termini of a dimeric ClC channel interact with each other and whether they affect the function of the individual protopore or both protopores cooperatively. For the Torpedo isoform, ClC-0, it has been postulated that structures at the carboxyl terminus are involved in gating processes that cooperatively open and close both protopores (32Fong P.Y. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 274: C966-C973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that some interaction between the two carboxyl termini exists. Our co-expression experiments of heterodimeric channel constructs with carboxyl-terminal proteins (Fig. 7, Table I) support the notion that each carboxyl terminus folds independently and that there are no interactions between them. The carboxyl terminus obviously does not provide a domain that would allow interaction between the two subunits and between the two protopores. The blocking experiments with one 9-AC-sensitive and one -insensitive protopore (Fig. 4) indicate that each carboxyl terminus acts only on the corresponding protopore, thus demonstrating that the role of the carboxyl terminus represents another example of the functional independence of the two channel halves.

https://openalex.org/W2171332720,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a genetically heterogeneous inherited disease affecting vesicle trafficking among lysosome-related organelles. The Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 genes are mutated in the cocoa, ruby-eye-2, and ruby-eye mouse pigment mutants, respectively, and their human orthologs are mutated in HPS3, HPS5, and HPS6 patients. These three genes encode novel proteins of unknown function. The phenotypes of Hps5/Hps5,Hps6/Hps6 and Hps3/Hps3,Hps6/Hps6 double mutant mice mimic, in coat and eye colors, in melanosome ultrastructure, and in levels of platelet dense granule serotonin, the corresponding phenotypes of single mutants. These facts suggest that the proteins encoded by these genes act within the same pathway or protein complex in vivo to regulate vesicle trafficking. Further, the Hps5 protein is destabilized within tissues of Hps3 and Hps6 mutants, as is the Hps6 protein within tissues of Hps3 and Hps5 mutants. Also, proteins encoded by these genes co-immunoprecipitate and occur in a complex of 350 kDa as determined by sucrose gradient and gel filtration analyses. Together, these results indicate that the Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 proteins regulate vesicle trafficking to lysosome-related organelles at the physiological level as components of the BLOC-2 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-2) protein complex and suggest that the pathogenesis and future therapies of HPS3, HPS5, and HPS6 patients are likely to be similar. Interaction of the Hps5 and Hps6 proteins within BLOC-2 is abolished by the three-amino acid deletion in the Hps6ru mutant allele, indicating that these three amino acids are important for normal BLOC-2 complex formation.

These facts suggested that the function(s) of the Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 genes are related and that they might be residents of a common protein complex. To test this hypothesis and to better understand the novel proteins of the BLOC-2 complex, we tested for epistatic interactions of the Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 genes in doubly mutant mice and for complex formation by their protein products. Mice—Mutant mice together with normal C57BL/6J mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were subsequently bred and maintained in the animal facilities of Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Unless indicated otherwise, the particular alleles utilized in these studies are as follows. The Hps3coa allele contains a splice site mutation resulting in a frameshift and loss of expression of the Hps3 mRNA (1Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Wilson A. Bennett D.C. Roe B.A. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A.

Jenkins N.A. Swank R.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the Hps6ru allele contains a small in-frame deletion that results in loss of three amino acids at positions 187-189 (2Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R. Chintala S. O'Brien E.P. Zhang Y. Roe B.A. Elliott R.W. Eicher E.M. Liang P. Kratz C. Legius E. Spritz R.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Swank R.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The Hps6ru-6J mutation contains a 5.3-kb intracisternal A particle element insertion that causes loss of transcript expression (2Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R.

Genet. 2003; 33: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The Hps3coa mutation arose and is maintained on the C57BL/10J background (15Novak E.K. Sweet H.O. Prochazka M. Parentis M. Soble R. Reddington M. Cairo A. Swank R.T. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 69: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both the Hps5ru-2J and Hps6ru mutations arose on the C3H inbred strain background and were subsequently transferred to and maintained as congenic mutants on the C57BL/6J inbred strain background. All mice utilized in these experiments were 2-5 months old. All procedures (mouse protocol 125M) were reviewed and approved by the Roswell Park Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered to the principles of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Construction of Double Mutant Mice—Heterozygous F1 offspring (Hps3/+ and Hps6/+ or Hps5/+ and Hps6/+) were produced by mating of Hps3/Hps3 and Hps6/Hps6 or Hps5/Hps5 and Hps6/Hps6 mice and were, as expected, of normal black coat and eye color. F1 offspring were mated to produce an F2 generation. F2 mice doubly homozygous (Hps3/Hps3,Hps6/Hps6 or Hps5/Hps5,Hps6/Hps6) for mutant genes were verified by molecular diagnoses of genotype at each gene by PCR amplification and sequencing of normal and genomic tail DNA using appropriate primers (1Suzuki T.

Because double mutants appeared healthy and had no obvious reductions in breeding efficiency, they were mated among themselves to maintain the double mutant colonies. Because all single and double mutants are on the C57BL/6J strain background (or on the closely related C57BL/10J strain background in the case of the Hps3 mutant), contributions of background genes are essentially identical in all. Antibodies—The peptide sequence, CNQERRGKPERIHVSSE, located near the amino terminus of the Hps5 protein (2Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R. Chintala S. O'Brien E.P.

To prepare antisera to the Hps6 protein, an expression plasmid pET 15b (Novagen) encoding the His-tagged C-terminal half (residues 1201 to 2418) of the Hps6 protein was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 (Novagen). The Hps6 protein was expressed within inclusion bodies, solubilized with 6 m urea, and purified by Ni2+-Sepharose affinity chromatography (16Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) followed by dialysis successively against 4 m, 2 m, and no urea in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Rabbits were initially injected with 250 μg of purified His-Ruby protein followed by boosting with 125 μg bi-weekly before final collection of antisera at 100 days. Platelet Collection and Platelet Serotonin Analyses—Platelets were harvested from the peripheral blood of normal and mutant mice in the presence of sodium citrate (17Swank R.T. Reddington M. Howlett O. Novak E.K. Blood. 1991; 78: 2036-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were lysed in 1 ml of distilled water, counted in a Coulter Z2 particle count and size analyzer, and assayed fluorometrically for serotonin (17Swank R.T. Reddington M. Howlett O. Novak E.K. Blood. 1991; 78: 2036-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Tissue extracts were subjected to denaturing SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with nonfat dry milk or ECL Advance blocking agent in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antiserum at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. After washing 1 h with blocking solution the membrane was incubated with 1:50,000 dilution of anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound antibody was detected using the ECL Plus (+) system for Hps6 and ECL Advance for Hps5 (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were calibrated with Kaleidoscope prestained molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Monoclonal mouse anti-α tubulin (Sigma) was used as loading control. Multiple exposures confirmed that blots were exposed within a linear range. Yeast Two-hybrid Analyses—The Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 kit (Clontech) for two-hybrid analyses was used at low and high stringency as described (2Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R. Chintala S. O'Brien E.P. Zhang Y. Roe B.A. Elliott R.W. Eicher E.M. Liang P. Kratz C. Legius E. Spritz R.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Swank R.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). HPS6 mutant constructs in DNA binding domain (pGBKT7) and activation domain (pGADT7) vectors were produced by deleting the three amino acids (His-Cys-Pro) at positions 187-189 from the wild type HPS6 cDNA. HPS6 alanine mutant constructs were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis by singly replacing each of these three amino acids in the wild type construct with alanine. All constructs were cloned in-frame to the DNA binding and activation domains of the Gal4 transcription factor and verified by sequencing. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days and monitored for growth and blue color by visual inspection. To verify production of construct proteins in yeast, extracts from colonies growing on low stringency plates were immunoblotted with antibodies to either Myc (goat polyclonal, 1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or hemagglutinin (mouse monoclonal antibody, 1:1000 dilution; Berkeley Antibody Company) epitopes, which were fused in-frame to cDNAs. Electron Microscopy—Eyes were fixed in glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, and embedded in spur resin as described (1Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Wilson A. Bennett D.C. Roe B.A. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Genomics. 2001; 78: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) before viewing on a Siemens 101 Electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Coimmunoprecipitation—Open reading frames of Hps3, Hps5, Hps6, Hps7, Ap3b1, and pa cDNAs were fused in-frame to pCMV-Tag vectors (Myc and FLAG), and the resulting fusion constructs were verified by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (3 × 105) were cotransfected, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), with epitope-tagged constructs at a ratio of 1:1, except in the cases of (a) Hps5 FLAG with Ap3b1-Myc, Hps6-Myc, or Hps3-Myc (1.8:0.2), (b) Hps7-FLAG with coa-Myc (0.5:1.5), and (c) Hps6-FLAG with Hps3-Myc (0.25:1.75). The cells were also singly transfected with Myc epitope-tagged constructs of pa, Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6. At 48 h after transfection, proteins were solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were immunoprecipitated by incubating them for 1 h at 4 °C with FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma) and washed with agarose beads three times with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus 1.5 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by treating the samples for 5 min at 95 °C with denaturing Laemmli buffer, and blots of 8% SDS-PAGE gels were analyzed with either rabbit polyclonal antibody against FLAG (1:1,000 dilution; Affinity Bio-Reagents) or with goat polyclonal antibody against Myc (1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:5000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) was used as a secondary antibody for FLAG blots, and horseradish peroxidase-linked bovine antibody against goat immunoglobulin G (1:5000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used as a secondary antibody for Myc blots. Blots were treated with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL Plus (+); Amersham Biosciences) and exposed for 1 min. Size-exclusion Chromatography and Sedimentation Velocity Analysis—Cytosolic extracts from the liver of normal and mutant mice were prepared by homogenization in detergent-free Tris buffer (0.3 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 5 mg/liter aprotinin and 1 mg/liter pepstatin A), using a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and then at 120,000 × g for 90 min, at 4 °C. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed as described (18Falcon-Perez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28191-28199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity analysis was carried out by ultracentrifugation of cytosolic extract (0.2 ml, ∼5 mg total protein) loaded on top of a linear 5-20% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared in detergent-free Tris buffer (12 ml), for 13 h at 39,000 rpm on a SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. Fractions resulting from both the size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity experiments were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to Hps5 and Hps6 proteins. Cytosolic liver extracts from Hps5ru-2J and Hps6ru-6J null mutant mice were analyzed in parallel to confirm the identity of the Hps5 and Hps6 protein bands, respectively. In Vivo Physiological Interactions of Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 Proteins in the Production of Lysosome-related Organelles in Doubly Mutant Mice—To test for interactions between (a) the Hps5 and Hps6 gene products and (b) the Hps3 and Hps6 gene products at the physiological level, appropriate double mutant mice (i.e. homozygous for mutant genes at two of these HPS loci) were bred, verified (see “Experimental Procedures”), and analyzed for abnormalities of melanosomes and platelet dense granules, the lysosome-related organelles most severely affected in Hps5 and Hps6 mutants. The coat and eye colors of Hps5/Hps5,Hps6/Hps6 double mutants are hypopigmented in comparison to C57BL/6J controls and identical (Fig. 1A) to those of the Hps5/Hps5 and Hps6/Hps6 single mutants (which themselves exhibit mimic phenotypes) (see Fig. 1A) suggesting a common abnormality in melanosomes, the subcellular organelle that imparts coat and eye coloration. In both single and double mutants, coat colors are the classical (14Silvers W.K. The Coat Colors of Mice. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 103-104Google Scholar) ruby color. Eye color in all is a light pink in offspring less than 1 week of age (not shown). This deepens in adults to a dark ruby eye color, distinguishable from the black eyes of normal C57BL/6J mice only when closely observed with intense light. The detailed mimicry in pigmentation and melanosomal properties of the Hps5 and Hps6 single and double mutants extends to the ultrastructural level in melanosomes of the retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) and choroids of the eye (Fig. 2). Quantitatively, there are major and similar reductions in numbers of melanosomes of the RPE in single and double mutants. Likewise, all mutant abnormalities are qualitatively concordant. The few remaining melanosomes within the RPE are often of unusual morphology, and some appear to be end-stage degradative organelles. All mutants contain larger numbers of choroidal than RPE melanosomes. However, all choroidal melanosomes are smaller than those of the control C57BL/6J and often have uneven “ragged” edges. The most conspicuous feature of the choroids of all single and double mutants is clumping (Fig. 2) of melanosomes within a single membrane-limited body, a morphological feature not observed in other mouse HPS mutants. Identical conclusions apply to Hps3 and Hps6 single and double mutant mice, which were likewise bred and analyzed for abnormalities of coat and eye color and melanosome ultrastructure. Coat and eye colors of single (Hps3/Hps3 and Hps6/Hps6) mimic those of double (Hps3/Hps3,Hps6/Hps6) mutants (Fig. 1B). Likewise, the degree of hypopigmentation and the color of the eyes of newborn (not shown) Hps3/Hps3 and Hps3/Hps3,Hps6/Hps6 mutants mimic those of the above-described newborn Hps5/Hps5 and Hps6/Hps6 mice. At the ultrastructural level melanosomes of the RPE and choroid of double mutants are indistinguishable from those of all three single mutants and include the distinctive melanosome aggregates (Fig. 2) within the choroids. Taken together, these analyses of coat color and melanosome ultrastructure in three single and two double mutants suggest a common defect in the synthesis and/or processing of melanosomes in Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 mutants. Gene dosage does not affect the mutant phenotype, because by visual examination, the Hps5/+,Hps6/Hps6; Hps5/Hps5, Hps6/+; Hps3/+,Hps6/Hps6, and Hps3/Hps3,Hps6/+ mice (not shown) are identical in coat and eye color to the original single mutant mice and to each other. Both single and double mutant mice appear healthy and robust for at least eight months of age. A lysosome-related organelle invariably affected in all HPS patients and animal models is the platelet dense granule (5Swank R.T. Novak E.K. McGarry M.P. Rusiniak M.E. Feng L. Pigment Cell Res. 1998; 11: 60-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Huizing M. Gahl W.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 451-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Spritz R.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Typically, platelet dense granules are either missing or greatly reduced in number. Alternatively, granules may be present, but are “empty,” a condition documented in Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 mutants (15Novak E.K. Sweet H.O. Prochazka M. Parentis M. Soble R. Reddington M. Cairo A. Swank R.T. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 69: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Reddington M. Novak E.K. Hurley E. Medda C. McGarry M.P. Swank R.T. Blood. 1987; 69: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Either condition leads to functionally abnormal platelets and prolonged bleeding times. The serotonin concentrations within platelet dense granules were indistinguishable among all single and double mutants, being greatly depressed to 6-8% that of normal C57BL/6J controls. Consistent with these findings, all single and double mutants had bleeding times (not shown) greater than 15 min compared with the 2-4-min times of C57BL/6J controls. Combined, these several mimic effects on melanosomes and platelet dense granules suggest that the Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 genes regulate the synthesis of lysosome-related organelles by a common mechanism at the physiological level. Test for Destabilization of HPS5 and HPS6 Proteins in Extracts of Other Hps Mutants—The above mimic effects of the Hps3, Hps5, and Hps6 genes suggested possible co-residence of their protein products within a common protein complex. An indication of residence of two proteins within a common protein complex is destabilization of the partner protein within cells derived from mutants lacking one of the proteins, as loss of one member of a protein complex often leads to destabilization of other members of that complex (18Falcon-Perez J.M.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Accordingly, polyclonal antibodies to the Hps5 and Hps6 proteins were produced, and levels of these proteins were analyzed by Western blotting in tissues of 14 mouse HPS mutants and alleles to determine whether mutations in other HPS genes affected their concentrations (Fig. 3). Consistent with its residence, together with the Hps6 protein, within the BLOC-2 complex (2Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R. Chintala S. O'Brien E.P. Zhang Y.

Genet. 2003; 33: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the Hps5 protein exhibits destabilization within spleen and lung extracts of the Hps6ru-6J null mutant (Fig. 3). Significant destabilization of Hps5 protein is also apparent in extracts of the Hps3 null mutant. Its concentration is also, as expected, depressed in extracts of single and double mutants containing the Hps5ru2-J allele, which have undetectable Hps5 protein levels, an expected result given the frameshift null mutation within this allele (2Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R. Chintala S. O'Brien E.P. Zhang Y. Roe B.A. Elliott R.W. Eicher E.M. Liang P. Kratz C. Legius E. Spritz R.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Copeland N.G.

No significant destabilization was apparent in any of the remaining 11 HPS mutants or the misty hypopigmentation mutant. Similarly, in regard to possible residence within a common protein complex, there was a notable"
https://openalex.org/W1969083682,"A common phenotype in breast cancer is the expansion of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER+) cell population and an inappropriate elevation of ERalpha protein, the latter predisposing patients for a poorer prognosis than those with lower levels of the receptor. A tetracycline-inducible ERalpha overexpression model was developed in the MCF-7 cell line to assess induction of endogenous gene activation and growth in response to elevations in ERalpha protein. Heightened levels of ERalpha resulted in aberrant promoter occupancy and gene activation in the absence of hormone, which was independent of ligand and AF-2 function. This increased receptor activity required the amino-terminal A/B domain and was not inhibited by tamoxifen, which supports an enhancement of AF-1 function, yet was independent of serine-104, 106, and 118 phosphorylation. Ligand-independent transcription was accompanied by an increase in growth in the absence of hormonal stimulation. The results suggest that elevated levels of ERalpha in breast cancer cells can result in activation of receptor transcriptional function in a manner distinct from classical mechanisms that involve ligand binding or growth factor-induced phosphorylation. Further, they describe a potential mechanism whereby increases in ERalpha concentration may provide a proliferative advantage by augmenting ERalpha function regardless of ligand status."

Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5113) Google Scholar). By anchoring to the plasma membrane through a transmembrane domain, MT1-MMP acts in the pericellular space on the cell surface. This property is particularly suitable for the degradation of extracellular matrix required for cellular functions such as migration, invasion, proliferation, and the regulation of cell morphology (2Seiki M. Koshikawa N. Yana I. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Seiki M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because MT1-MMP is frequently expressed in malignant tumors, it is believed to play a major role in tumor invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix in the direction of cell migration and by processing of cell surface molecules (2Seiki M. Koshikawa N. Yana I. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Seiki M. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). As a member of the MMP family, MT1-MMP has a propeptide, a catalytic domain, hinge, and a hemopexin-like (HPX) domain starting from the N terminus, and this extracellular portion is linked to the membrane through the transmembrane domain, which follows a short cytoplasmic tail composed of 20 amino acids (1Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5113) Google Scholar, 2Seiki M. Koshikawa N. Yana I.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3877) Google Scholar). As an invasion-promoting enzyme, the activity, localization, and turnover of MT1-MMP are tightly regulated during cell locomotion (3Seiki M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For example, MT1-MMP localizes at the leading edge of migrating cells, and this localization is regulated through interaction between CD44 and the HPX domain (6Mori H. Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Kajita M. Itoh Y. Sato H. Tojo H. Yana I. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule that acts as a receptor for hyaluronan and mediates flexible adhesion to the provisional hyaluronan-rich matrix in the dynamic ruffling membrane area. Such adhesion is expected to be followed by a firmer adhesion through integrins to generate force for migration (3Seiki M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At the migration edge MT1-MMP forms oligomers through the HPX domain with possible participation of the cytoplasmic tail, the hinge region, and extracellular matrix that binds to the molecule (7Itoh Y.

Activation of proMMP-2 by MT1-MMP is expected to be carried out efficiently within the oligomeric complex at the leading edge (7Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP exposed on the cell surface is regulated negatively by TIMPs (5Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Internalization of MT1-MMP depends on the cytoplasmic tail, and an LLY motif in the region was found to act as a binding site for AP-2 complex that mediates incorporation of target proteins into clathrin-coated pits (12Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail inhibits not only the internalization of MT1-MMP but also the invasion-promoting activity against the reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) mediated by MT1-MMP (12Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Lehti K. Valtanen H. Wickstrom S. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol.

Thus, the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP alone is not enough for the invasion-promoting activity, and it has to be regulated further by the function of the cytoplasmic tail. Although the cytoplasmic tail is short, containing 20 amino acids, it is reported to affect functions of MT1-MMP such as the formation of oligomers (8Lehti K. Lohi J. Juntunen M.M. Pei D.

However, it has not been elucidated how the cytoplasmic tail affects these functions except for the mechanism of internalization. To obtain clues about the mechanism by which the cytoplasmic tail regulates MT1-MMP, we attempted to isolate genes whose products interact with this portion using the yeast two-hybrid screening system. Using a cDNA library established from human fibroblast WI-38 cells we isolated a new gene whose product shows homology to members of the Cupin superfamily, a new family composed of proteins with diverse functions and which has a conserved three-dimensional structure (16Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Good-enough P.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We named this protein MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail-binding protein-1 (MTCBP-1). MTCBP-1 is expressed as a 19-kDa protein and is co-localized with MT1-MMP at the adherent membrane edge. It was also found in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The formation of a complex between MTCBP-1 and MT1-MMP was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Characteristics of MTCBP-1 and its possible role as an invasion suppressor are discussed. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—A LexA-based yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described in the instructions for the MATCH-MAKER two-hybrid kit (Clontech) using the cytoplasmic tail sequence of MT1-MMP as bait and a galactose inducible prey-fusion library. A DNA fragment encoding the intracellular sequence of human MT1-MMP (Arg-563–Val-582) was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-ggaattcagacgccatgggacccccagg-3′ and 5′-gagctcgcctcagaccttgtccagcagggaac-3′) and ligated to the LexA-encoding sequence for expression as a fusion protein. The fragment was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pEG202. The basal transcription activation activity of the bait plasmid pLexA-MT1-MMP-tail was negligible. The MATCHMAKER cDNA library used for screening was generated from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from a human lung fibroblast cell line, WI-38 (Clontech). Potential interactors were screened by auxotrophic selection on plates supplemented with galactose or glucose but lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan, and uracil (Gal/-HLTU or Glu/-HLTU) and for the ability to metabolize X-gal on Gal/X-gal/-HTU or Glu/X-gal/-HTU plates. Positive colonies that grew on Gal/-HLTU plates and appeared blue on Gal/X-gal/-HLTU plates were collected. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed using The Human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot membrane (Clontech). Fragments of the cDNAs for human MT1-MMP, MTCBP-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and used as probes. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using 0.3 μg of each random primer (Invitrogen) and 200 units of Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (RTase) (Invitrogen). After removal of the random primers, 1 μl of the RT product was used as a template for PCR (25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min). Primer sequences are indicated in the figure legends. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was amplified similarly as an internal control. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human fetus lung normal diploid fibroblasts (WI-38 and TIG-20), human fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and green monkey kidney (COS-1) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma). Human fibrosarcoma (SW684) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Sigma). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 1.0–1.5 × 105 cells/well, and transfection was carried out after 16 h using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells (1.5 × 105 cells) cultured in 6-well dishes were lysed in a lysis buffer (1% Brij-99, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. After the beads were collected and washed three times with lysis buffer, precipitates were eluted using a FLAG peptide and then analyzed by Western blotting using the same antibody. Subcellular Fractionation—After washing, cells in a culture dish were collected with a cell scraper on ice and suspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Then the cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes) and centrifuged in a microtube at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the nucleus and undisrupted cells. The supernatant fraction was collected and centrifuged further at 65,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C using a Beckman rotor (NTV-90). Plasma membrane fraction was recovered in the pellet, and cytoplasmic proteins were in the supernatant. Western Blot Analysis—Human tissue samples (Protein Medley™) (Clontech) and cells in culture were lysed in a SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After the blocking of the membrane with 10% fat-free dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), the membrane was probed with antibodies for detection. The membrane was further probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) to visualize the reacted antibody. Purification of Recombinant MTCBP-1 and Preparation of a Polyclonal Antibody—Recombinant human MTCBP-1 was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene) by transfecting MTCBP-1/pRSET B vector plasmid (Invitrogen), with which expression of the gene can be induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture medium. Cells were collected and sonicated in a TNC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Supernatant was collected, and the His6-tagged protein was purified on a chelating Sepharose column. The bound protein was eluted with TNC buffer containing 500 mm imidazole and separated further with a gel filtration column of Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences). To remove the His tag, EnterokinaseMax™ (Invitrogen) was used under the reaction conditions recommended by the manufacturer. To obtain polyclonal antibody for MTCBP-1 two female rabbits were immunized with the purified recombinant protein conjugate emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. A week after the last injection serum was obtained from the animals and subjected to a 40% saturated ammonium sulfate fractionation. Antibody reactive to MTCBP-1 was further purified using an affinity column of Sepharose 4B conjugated with recombinant MTCBP-1 (rMTCBP-1). Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining—Transfected HT-1080 cells were seeded on fibronectin/gelatin-coated coverslips. After 24 h the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. To detect the MTCBP-1 signal, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking treatment with 5% goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, cells were reacted with rabbit anti-MTCBP-1 antibody or mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody at room temperature for 2 h. To visualize MTCBP-1 and FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP, cells were further incubated with Alexa™488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., OR) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories, Inc.). Fluorescence signals were detected using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser microscope. Gelatin Zymography—Gelatin zymography was conducted with an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing gelatin (0.8 mg/ml) as described previously (4Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with SDS/PAGE loading buffer without a reducing agent and subjected to electrophoretic analysis at room temperature. Enzyme activity was visualized as negative staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Phagokinetic Track Motility Assay—The phagokinetic track motility assay was performed as described previously (12Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J.

After 12 h of incubation at 37 °C, the phagokinetic tracks were visualized under bright-field illumination using a CoolSNAP-fx monochrome CCD camera (Roper Scientific). The track area was measured using NIH Image software Version 1.62. Matrigel Invasion Assay—The Matrigel invasion assay was performed as described previously (7Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). MTCBP-1 plasmid was introduced into HT-1080 cells with a plasmid for the expression of green fluorescent protein. The transfected cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and seeded onto a Matrigel-coated filter (8-μm pore) in the Transwell chamber. Fetal bovine serum (10%) was added to the medium in the lower chambers and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. Non-invading cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were removed and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. The green fluorescent protein-positive cells on the lower surface of the filter were enumerated under microscope at a magnification of ×400. Each assay was performed in triplicate, and five microscopic fields from each of the three filters were counted. Screening of Human Genes Whose Products Bind MT1-MMP at the Cytoplasmic Tail—To isolate candidate genes whose products bind the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a human cDNA library established from lung fibroblast cells (WI-38). The cytoplasmic tail peptide (RRHGTPRRLLYCQRSLLDKV) was expressed as bait fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA protein. From 8 × 107 transformants, 23 clones were obtained and confirmed to be true positives. These clones can be divided into two groups by their size (1062 and 1617 bp) with one exception. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the 1062-bp fragment matched exactly the 5′ portion of the 1617-bp fragment, sharing the same 5′ end, and that both had a poly(A) tail at their 3′ end (Fig. 1). Thus, these two cDNAs are presumably derived from transcripts of a single gene that has multiple transcriptional termination sites. Both transcripts have one open reading frame that potentially encodes a 179-amino acid polypeptide. Because the product of the gene is expected to bind to the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP, it was named MT1-MMP cytoplasmic-binding protein-1 (MTCBP-1). One cDNA that did not show any homology to the MTCBP-1 gene was not analyzed further in this study. Structure of MTCBP-1 and Its Homologues—A BLAST search with MTCBP-1 of the human DNA databases yielded a gene called Sip-L (Fig. 2), the expression of which is reported to render cells susceptible to infection by human hepatitis C virus by allowing its replication (17Yeh C.T. Lai H.Y. Chen T.C. Chu C.M. Liaw Y.F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11017-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the two genes matched completely, the reported Sip-L cDNA lacks the 5′ sequence of MTCBP-1 that includes the non-coding and part of the 5′-coding sequence. As a result, Sip-L lacks the N-terminal 63 amino acids of MTCBP-1. However, the transcripts and protein product of Sip-L have not been characterized well in the previous study (17Yeh C.T. Lai H.Y. Chen T.C. Chu C.M. Liaw Y.F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11017-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as discussed later. MTCBP-1 also showed significant homology to the bacterial genes that encode aci-reductone dioxygenase (ARD) used in the salvage pathway of methionine metabolism. The homology of MTCBP-1 to the ARD of Klebsiella oxytoca (28.2%) and other homologues in different species is summarized in Fig. 2B. MTCBP-1 homologues are composed of 178–188 amino acids. Among them, ARDs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and oxytoca, including the three-dimensional structure, are the best characterized (18Dai Y. Wensink P.C. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1193-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Dai Y. Pochapsky T.C. Abeles R.H.

Biol. 2002; 9: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although the functions of the eukaryotic homologues have yet to be studied. ARD has a β-barrel hold that is also known as a double stranded β helix (DSBH) domain (20Pochapsky T.C. Pochapsky S.S. Ju T. Mo H. Al-Mjeni F. Maroney M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is characteristically conserved in members of the Cupin superfamily that was proposed recently (16Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Good-enough P.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Despite this structural conservation, the members of this family vary widely in function and include metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, scaffold proteins etc. Interaction between MTCBP-1 and MT1-MMP in Cells— rMTCBP-1 was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Rabbit polyclonal antibody was also prepared using rMTCBP-1 as an immunogen. To examine whether MTCBP-1 binds to the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP directly, a cytoplasmic tail peptide with His6 tag (CP-WT) and a control peptide with a randomized sequence (CP-RD) were prepared. The peptides were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane filter and then blotted with rMTCBP-1. The protein bound to the filter was visualized using anti-MTCBP-1 antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 3A). MTCBP-1 was bound to CP-WT but not CP-RD. The binding to CP-WT was specific because it was blocked almost completely with an excess amount of the CP-WT peptide but not with CP-RD. To confirm the binding within cells either a full-length MT1-MMP having a FLAG tag immediately downstream of the furin site (MT1F) or its mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tail (dCPF) was expressed together with MTCBP-1 in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Transfected cells were lysed, and MT1F was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitates were eluted from the antibody using FLAG peptide, and the eluate was analyzed further by Western blotting using anti-MTCBP-1 antibody (Fig. 3B). Expression of each protein in the cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B, total lysate). Although MTCBP-1 itself was not precipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody, it was precipitated with MT1F when both were co-expressed. The mutant MT1F lacking the cytoplasmic tail (dCPF) failed to precipitate MTCBP-1. Thus, MTCBP-1 binds to the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP in the cells. MT1-MMP Recruits MTCBP-1 to the Plasma Membrane Fraction—If MTCBP-1 bound MT1-MMP, the proteins would co-localize in the cells. MT1-F and MTCBP-1 were co-expressed in HT1080 cells, and localization of the products was examined by immunostaining (Fig. 3C). MT1F was detected on the cell surface especially at the ruffling edge when the cells were examined without permeabilization (no treatment with Triton X-100). Under the same conditions MTCBP-1 was not detected as it is a cytoplasmic protein. After the cells were treated with Triton X-100, co-localization of MTCBP-1 and MT1F was detected at the periphery of the cells (Fig. 3C). Some MT1F signals within the cells presumably represent the translation products in vesicles and the Golgi apparatus. Although MTCBP-1 was also detected in the cytoplasm, its localization did not coincide with that of MT1F. Some MTCBP-1 was detected in the nucleus as well, indicating the possibility that MTCBP-1 shuttles between the three compartments, membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. To confirm the interaction of both proteins further, plasma membrane-enriched fraction was prepared and examined by Western blotting (Fig. 3D). Accumulation of MTCBP-1 in the membrane fraction was not much when it is expressed without MT1F. However, co-expression increased the amount of MTCBP-1 in the membrane fraction significantly. This accumulation was dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of MT1F because co-expression of dCPF failed to increase this amount. Appropriate fractionation was monitored using marker proteins such as transferring receptor (TfnR) for membrane proteins and actin for cytoplasmic proteins. Expression of MT1F and dCPF did not affect the expression levels of MTCBP-1 and the fractionation (Fig. 3D). Thus, the results strongly suggest that MT1-MMP forms a complex with MTCBP-1 within the cells. Expression and Tissue Distribution of MTCBP-1—The expression of MTCBP-1 mRNA in different human tissues was examined by Northern blotting and compared with that of MT1-MMP (Fig. 4A). Three MTCBP-1 transcripts (1.2, 1.5, and 2.0 kb) were detected in tissue samples. The three presumably represent transcripts terminating at different sites. Corresponding to the three transcripts, three potential poly(A) signals can be seen in the 3′-non-coding region of the 1.6-kb cDNA sequence as indicated in Fig. 1. The expression levels were higher in heart and lower in brain and placenta (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, MT1-MMP mRNA was predominantly expressed in lung and placenta, where MTCBP-1 expression is low. Thus, MT1-MMP may not require MTCBP-1 to function, at least in these tissues. The antibody against MTCBP-1 detected a 19-kDa protein in the COS-1 cells transfected with the expression plasmid for MTCBP-1 but not in the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). A band similar in size was also detected in the tissue extract from human lung and liver. Inverse Correlation of MTCBP-1 and MT1-MMP Expression in the Transformed and Non-transformed Human Cell Lines— MT1-MMP is frequently expressed in human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. Thus, expression of MTCBP-1 and MT1-MMP was examined further using cell lines to confirm the relationship between the two (Fig. 5, A and B). As tumor cell lines, four gastric carcinoma (MKN-7, MKN-28, NUGU-3, and NUGC-4) and two fibrosarcoma (HT1080 and SW684) cell lines were analyzed by RT-PCR using specific primers (Fig. 5A). Non-transformed fibroblasts WI-38 and TIG-20 were also examined. MT1-MMP mRNA was detected in the tumor cell lines, reported at higher levels than in the non-transformed cells (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2065685061,"Several mutations in the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b have been reported in patients. To characterize their effect, we introduced six “human” mutations, namely G33S, S152P, G252D, Y279C, G291D, and Δ252-259 in the highly similar yeast cytochrome b. G252D showed wild type behavior in standard conditions. However, Asp-252 may interfere with structural lipid and, in consequence, destabilize the enzyme assembly, which could explain the pathogenicity of the mutation. The mutations G33S, S152P, G291D, and Δ252-259 were clearly pathogenic. They caused a severe decrease of the respiratory function and altered the assembly of the iron-sulfur protein in the bc1 complex, as observed by immunodetection. Suppressor mutations that partially restored the respiratory function impaired by S152P or G291D were found in or close to the hinge region of the iron-sulfur protein, suggesting that this region may play a role in the stable binding of the subunit to the bc1 complex. Y279C caused a significant decrease of the bc1 function and perturbed the quinol binding. The EPR spectra showed an altered signal, indicative of a lower occupancy of the Qo site. The effect of human mutation of residue 279 was confirmed by another change, Y279A, which had a more severe effect on Qo site properties. Thus by using yeast as a model system, we identified the molecular basis of the respiratory defect caused by the disease mutations in cytochrome b. Several mutations in the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b have been reported in patients. To characterize their effect, we introduced six “human” mutations, namely G33S, S152P, G252D, Y279C, G291D, and Δ252-259 in the highly similar yeast cytochrome b.

The effect of human mutation of residue 279 was confirmed by another change, Y279A, which had a more severe effect on Qo site properties. Thus by using yeast as a model system, we identified the molecular basis of the respiratory defect caused by the disease mutations in cytochrome b. The mitochondrial bc1 complex is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and couples this electron transfer to vectorial proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The enzyme exists as a functional dimer, consisting of 10 or 11 polypeptides in the eukaryotic monomeric subunit. One subunit, cytochrome b, is encoded by the mitochondrial genome, whereas the others are nuclearly encoded. Redox prosthetic groups are located within three subunits: cytochrome c1 and the iron-sulfur protein (ISP), 1The abbreviations used are: ISP, iron-sulfur protein; rho0, complete deletion of the mitochondrial genome; Qo, quinol oxidation site; Qi, quinone reduction site; bl, low potential cytochrome b heme; bh, high potential cytochrome b heme; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; WT, wild type. which are membrane proteins with large, hydrophilic domains, and cytochrome b, a predominantly hydrophobic protein consisting of eight transmembrane helices that contains two b-type hemes (bl and bh) and forms the two quinol binding sites: Qo (site of quinol oxidation) and Qi (site of quinol reduction), located on opposite sides of the membrane. The catalytic mechanism of the bc1 complex is essentially described by Mitchell's Q-cycle model. A quinol molecule binds at the Qo-site, is deprotonated, and transfers one electron through the “high potential” electron transfer chain consisting of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the ISP and the c-type heme of cytochrome c1 to the soluble acceptor, cytochrome c. Following a bifurcated pathway, a second electron is transferred across the membrane by the “low potential” pathway formed from hemes bl and bh and delivered to quinone bound at the Qi site, forming a stable semiquinone. A number of mutations in the human cytochrome b have been linked with diseases. Nonsense or frameshift mutations that result in truncated cytochrome b almost invariably abolish complex assembly. The precise effect of the missense mutations is more difficult to predict, and their characterization is often hampered by the limited amount of tissue available. In this work, we use yeast mutants as models to characterize the deleterious effect of six mutations reported in patients, namely G33S, S152P, G252D, Y279C, G291D, and a short in-frame deletion of eight residues, Δ252-259 (yeast numbering) (Fig. 1). Two other mutations of residue Tyr-279, Y279A and -W, were also analyzed. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and human cytochrome b share a very high degree of sequence similarity (55%), allowing the study of disease-related mutations in a convenient model system. G33S has been found in a patient with exercise intolerance (1Andreu A.L. Hanna M.G. Reichmann H. Bruno C. Penn A.S. Tanji K. Pallotti F. Iwata S. Bonilla E. Lach B. Morgan-Hughes J. DiMauro S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Gly-33 is located within transmembrane helix A, a hydrophobic environment at the Qi site and close to heme bh. S152P has also been reported in a patient with exercise intolerance (2Legros F. Chatzoglou E. Frachon P. Ogier de Baulny H. Laforet P. Jardel C. Godinot C. Lombes A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 9: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ser-152 is located in a loop connecting helices cd1 and cd2 at the entry of the Qo binding pocket. The mutation G252D and the in-frame deletion of eight amino acids (residues 252-259) have been detected in patients suffering from cardiomyopathy (3Andreu A.L. Checcarelli N. Iwata S. Shanske S. DiMauro S. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and exercise intolerance (1Andreu A.L. Hanna M.G. Reichmann H. Bruno C. Penn A.S. Tanji K. Pallotti F. Iwata S. Bonilla E. Lach B. Morgan-Hughes J. DiMauro S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), respectively. These residues are located in the E-ef loop on the P side of the membrane. The mutation Y279C has been found in a patient with severe exercise intolerance and multisystem disorder (4Wibrand F. Ravn K. Schwartz M. Rosenberg T. Horn N. Vissing J. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been also reported in atovaquone-resistant isolates of the parasite Plasmodium yoeli (5Srivastava I.K. Morrisey J.M. Darrouzet E. Daldal F. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Tyr-279 is in close proximity to the highly conserved “PEWY” motif region at the N-terminal region of the ef helix and 3.5 Å from residue 181, a ligand of the ISP [2Fe-2S] cluster. The mutation G291D is also associated with exercise intolerance (6Dumoulin R. Sagnol I. Ferlin T. Bozon D. Stepien G. Mousson B. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1996; 10: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Gly-291 is located in transmembrane helix F1, in close vicinity of the Qo site. These human mutations were introduced into yeast cytochrome b, and their effects on the assembly and activity of the mutant bc1 complexes were studied. The mutations G33S, S152P, Δ252-259, and G291D were highly deleterious. Y279C had a less severe effect on the respiratory function. G252D has no effect in standard conditions. Respiratory competent clones were selected from mutants S152P and G291D. Compensatory mutations were identified in cytochrome b and in the hinge region of the ISP. Media and Chemicals—The following media were used for the growth of yeast: YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glucose), YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), and transformation medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base, 3% glucose, 2% agar, 1 m sorbitol, and 0.8 g/liter of a complete supplement mixture minus uracil, supplied by Anachem). Decylubiquinone and myxothiazol were purchased from Sigma. Stigmatellin was purchased from Fluka. Generation of the Mutant Strains—The plasmid pBM5 carrying the wild type intronless sequence of the CYTB gene has been constructed by blunt end cloning of a PCR product of CYTB into the pCRscript vector (Stratagene). The mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After verification of the sequence, the plasmids carrying the mutated genes were used for biolistic transformation.

Isolation and Genetic Analysis of the Revertants—Diploid strains respiratory growth deficient generated by biolistic transformation were used to select revertants. The mutants were subcloned. Several subclones were grown in YPD, and then incubated on respiratory medium (YPG). Respiratory competent clones appeared after a 1- or 2-week incubation. Four to 15 independent revertants (each from different subclones) were then sporulated. Respiratory competent haploid clones were analyzed as described in Ref. 10Saint-Georges Y.

For the mitochondrial reversion, the cytochrome b gene of the revertant was sequenced to identify the secondary change. The nuclear reversions were identified by directly sequencing the most probable candidate gene, which was the nuclearly encoded gene RIP, coding for the ISP. The cytochrome b gene was also sequenced to confirm the presence of the primary mutation. For characterization on the effect of nuclear reversions in ISP, strains combining the mutations in ISP with either the WT or mutant cytochrome b were constructed by cytoduction (11Conde J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3651-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), by transferring the mitochondrial genome from a donor strain into the rho° derivative of the recipient strain harboring the ISP mutation. Preparation of Decylubiquinol—10 mg of 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-n-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (decylubiquinone), an analogue of ubiquinone (Sigma), was dissolved in 400 μl of nitrogen-saturated hexane. An equal volume of aqueous 1.15 m sodium dithionite was added, and the mixture was shaken vigorously until colorless. The upper, organic phase was collected, and the decylubiquinol recovered by evaporating off the hexane under nitrogen. The decylubiquinol was dissolved in 100 μl of 96% EtOH (acidified with 10 mm HCl) and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Decylubiquinol concentration was determined spectrophotometrically from absolute spectra, using ϵ288-320 = 4.14 mm-1 cm-1. Preparation of Crude Mitochondrial Membranes and Measurement of Cytochrome c Reductase Activity—Wild type and mutant yeast strains were grown to stationary phase (48 h) in 200 ml of YPD cultures at 28 °C. The cells (∼2 g wet weight per culture) were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were washed by resuspension in 40 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) and centrifuged as before. The harvested cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin prior to disruption in a Retsch MM300 glass bead mill operating at 30 Hz for 10 min at 4 °C. Membranes were separated from cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min and the pelleted membranes were suspended in a minimal volume of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. Resuspended membranes (2 μm bc1) were stored in 100-μl aliquots at -80 °C. Cytochrome c reductase activity measurements were assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCN, 0.025% (w/v) lauryl maltoside, and 30 μm equine cytochrome c at room temperature. Membranes were diluted to 2.5 nm cytochrome bc1 complex (determined from the dithionite reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectra, using ϵ562-575 = 28.5 mm-1 cm-1 (12Vanneste W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 175-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c reductase activity was initiated by the addition of decylubiquinol (5-100 μm). Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored in a Cary 4000 spectrophotometer at 550 versus 542 nm. Initial rates (computer-fitted as zero-order kinetics) were measured as a function of decylubiquinol concentration, and Vm and Km values were derived from Eadie-Hofstee (v versus v/[S]) plots. All rate measurements were performed in triplicate. Spectroscopic Analysis of Cytochromes in Whole Cells—Spectra were generated by scanning of cell suspensions with a single beam spectrophotometer built in-house operating at room and cryogenic temperatures (77 K). The cells, grown on YPD plates for 48 h, were re-suspended at a concentration of around 200 mg (room temperature spectra) or around 400 mg (77 K spectra) of cells/ml and reduced by dithionite. Quadratic baseline compensation was carried out on the data as described (13Brown S. Colson A.-M. Meunier B. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to remove the distortion of the baseline. Spectral resolution was 0.2 nm. Western Blotting Analysis—Immunodetection analyses were performed on crude mitochondrial membranes. Loading solution of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol was added to each sample (1:2, v/v). The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The analyses were performed as described in Ref. 10Saint-Georges Y. Bonnefoy N. di Rago J.-P. Chiron S. Dujardin G. J. Biol.

It is interesting to note that all the strains constructed were homoplasmic and contained only one population of mitochondrial DNA. The mutants G33S, S152P, G291D, and Δ252-259 were not able to grow on respiratory medium. Y279C had a less severe impairment of the respiratory growth. The growth rate (doubling time) in respiratory medium (YPG) at 28 °C was ∼12 h, compared with 4 h for the wild type (WT) cells. G252D showed no respiratory growth deficiency, as observed previously (10Saint-Georges Y. Bonnefoy N. di Rago J.-P. Chiron S. Dujardin G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49397-49402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The respiratory growth rate was 4 h, identical to WT. Effect of the Mutations on Cytochrome b and ISP Content—The effects of the mutations on the level of cytochrome b in whole cells were monitored (Table I). The cytochrome b content (based on the dithionite reduced spectra in the visible region, as exemplified in Fig. 2) was decreased by 25 to 50% of the wild type level, whereas the cytochrome c content was increased as observed previously for other respiratory deficient mutants (15Meunier B.

It is interesting to note that in the respiratory deficient mutants, as shown for Δ252-259 in Fig. 2, the aerobic spectrum (dotted line) showed a peak at 562 nm, corresponding to reduced cytochrome b, presumably bh, and a small peak at 575 nm, corresponding to oxyflavohemoprotein (16Gardner P.R.

Upon addition of dithionite (solid line), cytochromes c, c1, and oxidase (aa3) were reduced and the signal of oxyflavohemoprotein disappeared. This behavior was observed for all the mutants studied here, except for G252D. WT and G252D exhibited fast O2 consumption. The cell suspensions became anaerobic immediately, and the cytochromes became fully reduced.Table ICytochrome b content in cells and bc1 complex activity in membranesStrainsCytochrome b contentVmKm% WTs−1QH2 μmWT1008018G33S551014S152P555<4Δ252-25960inactive—G252D908016Y279A70179Y279C754723Y279W75inactive—G291D5094 Open table in a new tab To analyze further the content in bc1 complex subunits, mitochondrial membranes were prepared and the level of ISP, cytochrome c1, and QCR7p monitored by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, a severe decrease in ISP content was observed for mutants G33S, S152P, Δ252-259, Y279W, and G291D, whereas Y279C and -A contained the WT level of this subunit. The amount of QCR7p was also decreased in these mutants, but to a lesser degree, whereas the cytochrome c1 content was not affected. Mutant S152P seemed the most affected as ISP was only detected after a longer exposure. The decreased level of the ISP in the G33S mutant was unexpected because this residue is located at the Qi site, far from the domains of contact between cytochrome b and the ISP. However, 77 K spectra of whole cell suspension (Fig. 4) showed that the peak position of cytochrome b was red-shifted from 561 to 562.5 nm. This is suggestive of distortion of the local environment around heme bh. Total loss of heme bh in the G33S mutant could be excluded as the bc1 complex retained a low level of catalytic activity (Table I). The resulting alteration in the structure of the cytochrome b polypepeptide is apparently responsible for the destabilization and loss of the ISP from the complex.Fig. 4Low temperature (77 K) visible absorption spectra. 77 K visible absorption spectra of cell suspensions were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Spectral resolution was 0.2 nm. The spectra were normalized for the cytochrome oxidase signal at 606 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of the Mutations on the bc1 Activity—The cytochrome c reductase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically as a function of decylubiquinol (QH2) concentration, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The apparent Vm and Km for QH2 were calculated from initial rate measurements using derived Eadie-Hofstee plots (Table I). No bc1 activity could be detected in mitochondrial membranes prepared from mutants Δ252-259 and Y279W. It seemed likely therefore that the small population of ISP-containing enzyme observed in Fig. 3 was non-functional. G33S, S152P, and G291D showed a severely decreased catalytic activity: Vm 10, 5, and 9 s-1, respectively, compared with 80 s-1 for the WT. The decreased level of ISP in the mutants could account for the low turnover rate observed. Because the mutated residues are located in the catalytic domain of the enzyme, it is likely that they would also hinder the functioning of a fully assembled complex. Y279A and -C exhibited a different behavior because the enzyme was assembled at near WT level, as judged by the amount of ISP. However, the catalytic activity of these two mutants was diminished compared with WT (Vm values: 21 and 59% of the WT rates for Y279A and -C, respectively, under the assay conditions). The mutation Y279C increased the Km for quinol from 18 to 23 μm, which is suggestive of a less efficient binding interaction at Qo. The mutation Y279A decreased the Km for quinol 2-fold, indicating that the Qo site was becoming saturated at lower concentrations of quinol than the WT, and may also be indicative of a decreased quinol “on” rate. It should be noted that the kmin (an apparent second-order rate constant equal to Vm/Km) values for the Y279A and -C mutants are very similar at 1.89 and 2.04 μm-1 s-1 (cf. 4.44 μm-1 s-1 for the WT). EPR analyses were performed to obtain more information on quinol binding in these two mutants. EPR Analysis of Y279C and -A—Residue Tyr-279 is located near the docking site of the ISP [2Fe-2S] center and is likely to be involved in the stabilization and/or positioning of the quinol in the active site (17Palsdottir H. Lojero C.G. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31303-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to monitor the Qo site occupancy by EPR using the characteristic interaction between the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the ISP and the quinone/quinol binding at the Qo site. It is well known that a gx signal centered at g = 1.80 is observed when the Q pool is fully oxidized and that this signal shifts to a lower gx value of around 1.77 when the Q pool is fully reduced (18Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19Ding H. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15997-16003Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When the Qo site is empty, because of either a mutation or extraction of quinones, the value of the gx signal shifts to a lower value of around 1.76. The EPR spectrum of the WT sample reduced with ascorbate showed a gy peak at g = 1.90 and a gx trough centered at g = 1.80, which is characteristic of a Qo site fully occupied with oxidized quinone (Fig. 5A). In Y279A and -C, the total level of [2Fe-2S] cluster as indicated by the gy signal was identical to that of the WT. However, the gx trough was less pronounced and shifted to a lower value of gx = 1.76-1.77, thus indicating a partially empty Qo site. This result is in agreement with the lower catalytic efficiency for quinol (kmin) observed in the mutants. Addition of stigmatellin fixes the ISP [2Fe-2S] cluster in a position close to cytochrome b (Fig. 5C). The mutants were still able to bind the inhibitor as shown by the gx trough. However, Y279C exhibited a shifted gx signal (gx = 1.80) in comparison with that of the WT (gx = 1.775). This indicates a modified binding of stigmatellin within the Qo site or an altered interaction between ISP and stigmatellin. Reversion Analysis of Mutations—From the data obtained here, it appeared that several mutations in the Qo domain affected the assembly of the ISP. We addressed then the question whether other modifications could restore the assembly of the ISP and the enzyme activity. That may highlight domains of the enzyme important for the assembly of the ISP and its interaction with cytochrome b. To this end, revertants (respiratory growth competent clones) were selected on respiratory medium from the respiratory deficient mutants S152P and G291D. The revertants were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reversion mutations were identified by sequencing. For S152P, two compensatory mutations were observed: a mutation at the same codon in cytochrome b restoring Ser-152; and a mutation in the ISP, A90D, which was found in three independent revertants. For G291D, several secondary mutations were found: two mutations in cytochrome b, D287H located in the vicinity of the primary mutation, and H53D, more than 20 Å from the primary site; five changes in the ISP, V88A/G/D, A90T/D, located in the hinge region of this subunit (Fig. 1). A90D was found in 6 independent revertants from G291D, whereas the other reversions were observed only in one or two revertants. The change A90D was thus the most frequent reversion and suppressed both S152P and G291D mutations. The non-native reversions compensate partially the respiratory defect induced by the primary mutations. Their doubling time was between 10 and 12 h (4 h in WT). Further analyses were performed on the compensatory mutation A90D in the ISP. Membranes were prepared from three strains that combined the mutation in ISP A90D with the WT cytochrome b, the mutation S152P, or the mutation G291D. The strains were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The QH2-cytochrome c reductase activities were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Introduction of the ISP A90D mutation into the WT cytochrome b background had no effect on the bc1 complex activity (not shown). Thus despite its high conservation in sequences from various organisms, residue Ala-90 can be replaced by a larger and charged residue without loss of function. Introduction of the ISP A90D mutation into the S152P and G291D cytochrome b mutants resulted in enzymatic activity 2.5- and 3.3-fold higher than the rate observed for the cytochrome b mutant background alone (assayed at 70 μm QH2). This was sufficient to support a slow respiratory rate. Fig. 6 shows the steady-state level of ISP in the strains combining ISP A90D with WT cytochrome b (lane 1), S152P (lane 2), or G291D (lane 3). The level of ISP in the revertants was similar to that of the control strain combining ISP A90D with the WT cytochrome b. It appears therefore that the change in A90D stabilizes the binding of ISP to the bc1 complex. The low activity of the S152P and G291D revertants suggests that the cytochrome b mutations alone cause a severe disruption of the Qo site activity in the ISP-containing complex. Several mutations in the hinge region of the ISP have been previously obtained as suppressors of the cytochrome b mutation A144F. 2B. Meunier and G. Brasseur, unpublished data. The mutation A144F affects the binding of quinol, presumably by altering the local structure of the Qo site. The reported suppressor mutations were likely to correct the positioning of the ISP head group on the mutant cytochrome b. It was therefore interesting to see whether these suppressor mutations could compensate the defect caused by S152P and G291D. To this end, we constructed double mutants that combined the ISP mutations with cytochrome b mutations A144F, S152P, or G291D. The respiratory growth competence of the double mutants was then monitored. As shown in Fig. 7, the compensatory effect of the ISP mutations seems specific for cytochrome b mutations. The ISP mutations at residues 85, 92, and 93 compensated A144F only, whereas mutations at residues 88, 89, and 90 corrected partially A144F and G291D. S152P was compensated by the ISP mutation A90D, and very partially by ISP V88G. We could suggest that mutations at residues 85, 92, and 93 by altering the structure of the hinge region allows a greater reach of the ISP head group and a more efficient docking on the Qo site distorted by A144F. ISP A90D, on the other hand, would stabilize the binding of ISP on the bc1 complex. In this work, we used yeast mutants to characterize the deleterious effect of six mutations reported in patients, namely G33S, S152P, G252D, Y279C, G291D, and a short in-frame deletion of eight residues, Δ252-259 (yeast notation). The stable integration of the ISP into the bc1 complex was defective in mutants G33S, S152P, Δ252-259, and G291D as observed by immunodetection. Δ252-259 and G33S are located far from the region of contact with ISP. An indirect long distance effect needs to be invoked to explain the loss of the ISP. The deletion of eight amino acids (Δ252-259) may reasonably be expected to severely disrupt the assem"

Previously, we identified an inhibitory role for activin-like kinase receptors and Smad1 in BMP-dependent inhibition (Piscione, T. D., Phan, T., and Rosenblum, N. D. (2001) Am. J. Physiol. 280, F19–F33). Here we demonstrate a novel role for p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38MAPK) in BMP7-dependent stimulatory signaling. Stimulatory doses (0.25 nm) of BMP7 increased p38MAPK activity and stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) in a p38MAPK-dependent manner in murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) cells. In contrast, high doses (10 nm) of BMP7 inhibited p38MAPK activity and phosphorylation of endogenous ATF2. Treatment with BMP7 exerted no significant effect on the levels of the phosphorylated forms of endogenous SAPK/JNK or p44 and p42 (ERK1 and ERK2) protein kinases. To investigate the functional importance of p38MAPK signaling, we showed that SB203580, a p38MAPK inhibitor, blocked the stimulatory effect of BMP7 on mIMCD-3 cell morphogenesis but had no effect on BMP7-dependent inhibition in a three-dimensional culture model. To identify mechanisms by which BMP7-dependent inhibitory signaling suppresses p38MAPK activity, we measured p38MAPK activity in ligand independent mIMCD-3 models of enhanced and suppressed Smad signaling. Basal activity of p38MAPK was decreased in mIMCD-3 cells and in embryonic kidney tissue expressing a constitutively active activin-like kinase receptor, but was increased in mIMCD-3 cells stably expressing a dominant negative form of Smad1. We conclude that BMP7 stimulates renal epithelial cell morphogenesis via p38MAPK and that p38MAPK activity is negatively regulated by Smad1.

Renal branching morphogenesis, defined as growth and branching of epithelial tubules during embryogenesis, is dependent on reciprocal inductive tissue interactions between the mesenchymal metanephric blastema and the epithelial ureteric bud and its daughter collecting ducts. These interactions are mediated, in part, by secreted growth factors and their cognate signaling effectors.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The response of ureteric bud and collecting duct cells to BMP7 is complex and distinct from that of other members of the TGF-β superfamily. BMP7 exerts dose-dependent and opposite effects on ureteric bud morphogenesis in embryonic kidney explants treated with BMP7-agarose beads and in the murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) cell culture model (4Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar, 5Piscione T.D. Phan T. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F19-F33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, BMP2, a related TGF-β superfamily member expressed during renal embryogenesis, only inhibits ureteric bud and collecting duct morphogenesis in a monophasic dose-dependent manner (4Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that BMP7 acts via distinct intracellular signaling pathways to exert stimulatory and inhibitory effects. BMPs initiate intracellular signaling after binding to cell surface type I (activin-like kinase (ALK)) and type II serine/threonine kinases. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor, BMPRII, transphosphorylates and activates the ALK receptor. ALK receptors signal via Smad proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Activation of the ALK receptor leads to association and phosphorylation of a receptor-activated Smad protein. Phosphorylation induces the receptor-activated Smad to dissociate from the receptor, stimulates the assembly of a heteromeric complex between the phosphorylated receptor-activated Smad and the co-Smad, Smad 4, and induces nuclear accumulation of this complex (6Hoodless P.A.

We have demonstrated that BMPs inhibit renal epithelial cell morphogenesis after binding ALK receptors and activating receptor-dependent Smads (7Gupta I.R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Phan T.

Kim S. Zhou X. Piscione T.D. Whiteside C. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of BMP7, high doses activate Smad1 and induce formation of Smad1-Smad4 molecular complexes. Suppression of Smad1 signaling by overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad1 (Smad1Δ458) abrogates the inhibitory actions of BMP7 on mIMCD-3 cell morphogenesis (5Piscione T.D. Phan T. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F19-F33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, low doses of BMP7 fail to activate Smad1 and stimulate collecting duct morphogenesis in a manner independent of Smad1 activity (5Piscione T.D. Phan T. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F19-F33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that BMP7-dependent stimulatory signaling occurs via a Smad1-independent pathway. BMPs have also been shown to signal via the p38 class of MAPK in nonrenal cells (9Lee K.S. Hong S.H. Bae S.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7156-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 10Iwasaki S.

In addition, p38MAPK activity can be regulated by BMP signaling, providing a feedback mechanism to regulate the cellular response to BMPs. For example, in MH60 cells, the ALK receptor inhibitor, Smad6, blocks BMP2-induced activation of p38MAPK (11Kimura N. Matsuo R. Shibuya H. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17647-17652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because Smad6 functions by inhibiting activation of receptor-activated Smads by ALK receptors, this observation suggests that ALK receptors can activate p38MAPK. The spatial expression of p38MAPK in both the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema (12Omori S. Hida M. Ishikura K. Kuramochi S. Awazu M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggests a functional role for this MAPK during kidney development. This is supported by the observation that pharmacologic inhibition of p38MAPK in embryonic explants inhibits kidney growth and induces marked mesenchymal cell apoptosis (13Hida M. Omori S. Awazu M. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 1252-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the effects of BMPs on p38MAPK in the embryonic kidney are undefined, the presence of massive mesenchymal cell apoptosis in the Bmp7 null mouse (2Dudley A.T. Lyons K.M. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2795-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) suggests the possibility that loss of BMP7-dependent regulation of p38MAPK could contribute to this phenotype. In this paper, we investigated molecular mechanisms that control BMP7-dependent stimulation of collecting duct cell morphogenesis. We demonstrate that BMP7 regulates p38MAPK activity in a dose-dependent manner, stimulating at high doses and inhibiting at high doses. In the mIMCD-3 cell culture model, we show that BMP7-dependent stimulation of epithelial cell morphogenesis is abrogated by pharmacologic inhibition of p38MAPK. By using a ligand-independent model of BMP7 signaling in which a constitutive active form of ALK2 is stably expressed in mIMCD-3 cells, we demonstrate that ALK/Smad1 signaling negatively regulates p38MAPK activity. Our observation that phosphorylation of activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, a p38MAPK target, is decreased in embryonic kidneys expressing a constitutive active ALK receptor suggests that p38MAPK-Smad interactions occur in vivo. Our results provide a molecular explanation for BMP7 dose-dependent signaling in epithelial cells. In addition, our findings suggest a mechanism controlling the biological response to increasing doses of BMP7 during renal branching morphogenesis. Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Proteins in cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. p38MAPK, ATF2, SAPK/JNK, and ERK1/2 were identified with specific antibodies directed against phosphorylated or total (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) forms (p38MAPK, 1:250 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; ATF2, 1:500 dilution, SAPK/JNK and ERK1/2, 1:250 dilution, Cell Signaling). For assays of p38MAPK activity, cell lysates were incubated with protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-p38MAPK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After washing the immunocomplex sequentially in lysate buffer and kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate; 1 mm Na3VO4; 10 mm okadaic acid; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 10 mm MgCl2), beads were incubated with kinase buffer, ATF2 protein (Cell Signaling), and [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) and chemiluminescence. For Smad1-Smad4 complex assays, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by absorption to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using a rabbit anti-Smad4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.)

Cell culture medium was supplemented with BMP7 (provided via a material transfer agreement with Creative Biomolecules) or EGF (Roche Applied Science) in the presence or absence of SB203580 (Calbiochem). After 48 h, gels were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and them imaged by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. The number of linear structures in an area of standard dimensions was determined in four randomly selected positions of the gel for each treatment condition by an observer blinded to the treatment condition. Data were analyzed using the Statview statistical analysis program (version 4.01; Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). The mean difference between treatment groups and control was analyzed by Student's t test (two-tailed).

The HA tag region encodes a unique NheI restriction site. A double-stranded DNA linker encoding a FLAG tag flanked by 5′ NheI and 3′ BamHI restriction sites was synthesized: 5′-CGGTCTAGCTAGCGATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTAAGGATCCGCGG-3′. The NheI/BamHI-digested linker was ligated to NheI/BamHI-digested pCMV5-Alk2WT-HA or pCMV5-Alk2Q207D-HA generating a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag. Each insert was then excised from the pCMV vector with KpnI and SmaI and ligated to KpnI/EcoRV-digested pTRACER-SV40. Sequences of pTRACER-SV40-Alk2WT-HA-FLAG and pTRACER-SV40-A Alk2Q207D-HA-FLAG were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Lines and Transfection—mIMCD-3 cells were transfected with pTRACER-SV40-Alk2WT-HA-FLAG or pTRACER-SV40-Alk2Q207D-HA-FLAG using a calcium phosphate transfection method. Zeocin (500 μg/ml)-resistant clones that stably expressed wild-type or mutant forms of ALK2 were identified by screening protein lysates by immunoblotting. Tagged ALK2 was detected in immunoblots using a mouse monoclonal antibody to FLAG (Sigma, 1:2000 dilution) and chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences). The spatial expression of tagged ALK2 was determined in cultured mIMCD-3 clones using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) and confocal imaging as described previously (8Gupta I.R.

Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar). Ureteric bud-derived structures were identified in whole mount kidney specimens with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (20 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) as described. Ureteric bud branch points were defined as the intersection between two connected branches (15Grisaru S. Cano-Gauci D. Tee J. Filmus J. Rosenblum N.D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 31-46Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). BMP7 Activates p38MAPK in a Dose-dependent Manner—We investigated the role of p38MAPK and its downstream target, ATF2, during BMP7 signaling in collecting duct cells. Like BMP7, p38MAPK stimulates cell survival and proliferation in the embryonic kidney (12Omori S. Hida M. Ishikura K. Kuramochi S. Awazu M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The observation that p38MAPK is activated by BMPs in nonrenal cells (11Kimura N. Matsuo R. Shibuya H. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17647-17652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) suggested that p38MAPK may be an effector in the BMP7 stimulatory pathway during renal branching morphogenesis. Previous findings that ATF2 is activated via phosphorylation by p38MAPK during the response to altered pH in the mature kidney (16Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F381-F390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and during signaling by ALK receptors (17Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) suggested ATF2 as a candidate transcriptional target of p38MAPK-dependent BMP7 signaling. We measured p38MAPK activity and the levels of endogenous ATF2 in collecting duct (mIMCD-3) cells treated for 1 h with low (stimulatory) or high (inhibitory) doses of BMP7 (Fig. 1). p38MAPK was immunoprecipitated from the protein lysates of BMP7-treated cells and then used in an assay of ATF2 phosphorylation using exogenous ATF2 substrate. Compared with untreated cells, a stimulatory dose of BMP7 increased p38MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 1.5-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, an inhibitory dose of BMP7 exerted no such effect. In fact, 10 nm BMP7 inhibited p38MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 1.6-fold compared with control and 2.4-fold compared with 0.25 nm BMP7 (p38MAPK activity (densitometric units), control versus 0.25 nm BMP7, 52 ± 20 versus 80 ± 16, p = 0.008; control versus 10 nm BMP7, 52 ± 20 versus 33 ± 12, p = 0.048). Analysis of the total quantity of immunoprecipitated p38MAPK and ATF2 added to each assay demonstrated that changes in phospho-ATF2 were not attributable to variation in the quantity of these proteins. Consistent with the dose-dependent stimulatory and inhibitory effects of BMP7 on p38MAPK activity, a stimulatory dose of BMP7 increased phosphorylation of p38MAPK 1.6-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, an inhibitory dose (10 nm) of BMP7 inhibited phosphorylation of p38MAPK 1.7-fold compared with control and 2.9-fold compared with 0.25 nm BMP7 (P-p38MAPK (densitometric units), control versus 0.25 nm BMP7, 48 ± 7 versus 78 ± 7, p < 0.0001; control versus 10 nm BMP7, 48 ± 7 versus 27 ± 5, p < 0.0001). Taken together, these results indicate that BMP7 modulates p38MAPK activity in a biphasic dose-dependent manner. Next, we determined whether BMP7 modulates the activity of endogenous ATF2. By using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated (activated) form of ATF2 and both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated (total) forms of ATF2, we detected endogenous phosphorylated and total ATF2 in immunoblots of cellular proteins isolated after treatment with recombinant BMP7. A stimulatory dose (0.25 nm) of BMP7 increased the quantity of phospho-ATF2 2-fold (Fig. 1, C and D) (endogenous P-ATF2 (densitometric units), untreated versus 0.25 nm BMP7, 109 ± 17 versus 213 ± 23, p < 0.0001). In contrast, an inhibitory dose (10 nm) of BMP7 had no significant effect on phospho-ATF2 levels (Fig. 1, C and D) (endogenous P-ATF2 (densitometric units), untreated versus 10 nm BMP7, 109 ± 17 versus 83 ± 18, p = 0.09). Analysis of total ATF2 in each treatment group demonstrated that these results were not due to an effect of BMP7 on the total amount of ATF2 expressed in mIMCD-3 cells. To determine whether BMP7 activates ATF2 via p38MAPK, we measured the cellular levels of phospho-ATF2 in the presence or absence of SB203580, a pharmacologic p38MAPK inhibitor (18Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Treatment with SB303580 decreased the basal levels of endogenous P-ATF2 2.3-fold and abrogated the increase in P-ATF2 observed after treatment with low dose (0.25 nm) BMP7 (Fig. 1, E and F, P-ATF2/T-ATF2 (densitometric units), vehicle versus SB203580, 37 ± 12 versus 16 ± 8, p = 0.01; 0.25 nm BMP7 versus 0.25 nm BMP7 and SB203580, 60 ± 10 versus 18 ± 3, p < 0.01). Taken together, these results demonstrate that low doses of BMP7 stimulate phosphorylation of ATF2 in a p38MAPK-dependent manner. BMP7 Does Not Control SAPK/JNK and ERK Activity in Collecting Duct Cells—To determine whether the effects of BMP7 are specific to the p38 branch of the MAPK family, we measured SAPK/JNK and ERK1/2 activation in the presence of low and high doses of BMP7. A possible role for these kinases in BMP7 signaling is suggested by the previous findings that JNK and ERK are activated by BMPs in nonrenal cells (19Lai C.F. Cheng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15514-15522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and that ERK acts downstream of non-BMP growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor and EGF to control epithelial morphogenesis (20Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated (active) forms of SAPK/JNK, phospho-p54 and phospho-p46, and ERK, phospho-p44 and phospho-p42, and both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (total) of these proteins, we detected endogenous proteins in immunoblots of cellular proteins after treatment with low or high doses of BMP7 (Fig. 2, A and B). Our results indicate no significant effect of BMP7 on SAPK/JNK or ERK activation, thus demonstrating a specific effect of BMP7 on p38MAPK. Inhibition of p38MAPK Blocks BMP7-mediated Stimulation of Collecting Duct Cell Morphogenesis—By having determined that BMP7 stimulates and inhibits p38MAPK in a dose-dependent manner reminiscent of its actions during epithelial morphogenesis, we analyzed p38MAPK function by inhibiting p38 pharmacologically in the mIMCD-3 culture model of collecting duct cell morphogenesis. We have used mIMCD-3 cells, which are derived from the terminal inner medullary collecting duct of the SV40 transgenic mouse, to determine the effects of BMP7 on cellular morphogenesis and proliferation (4Piscione T.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26305-26314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). mIMCD-3 cells were seeded in type I collagen, cultured for 48 h in the presence of a wide range of BMP7 doses with or without SB203580, and then imaged by DIC microscopy (Fig. 3A). Because we observed an effect on the number of tubular progenitors, observed in this assay as linear structures, we quantitated the number of these structures in different treatment groups (Fig. 3, B and C). Consistent with our previously published results, BMP7 increased the number of linear structures in a dose-dependent manner demonstrating maximal stimulation of 1.6-fold at a dose of 0.25 nm. This BMP7-dependent stimulatory effect was ∼3-fold less potent that that observed after treatment with EGF. The greater potency of EGF may due to its property of stimulating both ERK and p38MAPK (21Yamanaka Y. Hayashi K. Komurasaki T. Morimoto S. Ogihara T. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Neve R.M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In contrast, BMP7, at doses greater than 1 nm, inhibited with a maximal inhibitory effect of 1.5-fold at a dose of 20 nm (Fig. 3, A and B). Remarkably, SB203580 totally abrogated the stimulatory effects of BMP7 on mIMCD-3 cell morphogenesis but did not interfere with the inhibitory effects of BMP7 (Fig. 3C). The lack of any BMP7-dependent stimulatory response in the presence of SB203580 demonstrates that p38MAPK is required for the stimulatory effects of BMP7. In addition to the inhibitory effect of SB203580 on BMP7-dependent stimulation of mIMCD-3 cell morphogenesis, we observed a 25% decrease in the number of linear structures formed in the presence of SB203580 alone (Fig. 3, B versus C, 100 versus 78 tubule progenitors) and a diminished morphogenetic response to EGF in the presence of SB203580 (Fig. 3, B versus C, 480 versus 340 tubule progenitors). Although the observation that p38MAPK is activated by EGF in nonrenal cells (22Neve R.M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) may explain the decreased morphogenetic activity of mIMCD-3 cells cultured in the presence of SB203580, our data do not eliminate the possibility that SB203580 exerts a more general toxic effect on cellular function impacting negatively on mIMCD-3 cell morphogenesis. ALK2 Inhibits Collecting Duct Cell Morphogenesis in a Ligand-independent Manner—Doses of BMP7 >1 nm exert a dominant inhibitory effect on p38MAPK activation and collecting duct cell morphogenesis (see above and Ref. 5Piscione T.D. Phan T. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F19-F33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this dominance may be explained by negative regulation of p38MAPK activity by Smad1 because high doses, but not low doses of BMP7, act via Smad1 (5Piscione T.D. Phan T. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F19-F33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study interactions between Smad and p38MAPK signaling, we generated a ligand-independent model of ALK signaling designed to avoid potentially confounding effects of BMP7 signaling via both pathways. The ALK receptor, ALK2, binds BMP7 and activates Smad1 signaling (23Macías-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). A mutant ALK2 allele, Alk2Q207D, is characterized by a point mutation in its cytoplasmic GS domain and constitutively activates Smad1 in a ligand-independent manner (24Carcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated stably transfected mIMCD-3 cell lines expressing tagged versions of wild-type ALK2 and ALK2Q207D, both of which were detected as a 68-kDa band by Western analysis using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4A). Several different clones were isolated. Clones expressing high levels of ALK2WT (clone 42) or ALK2Q207D (clone 26) were analyzed further first by examining the subcellular distribution of ALK3-HA-FLAG using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B). In contrast to untransfected mIMCD-3 cells, we observed a punctate pattern of expression along the border of 81% of cells stably expressing ALK2WT and 86% of cells stably expressing ALK2Q207D. This pattern was consistent with localization of the transfected ALK2 to the peripheral cell membranes. Next, we determined the functional effects of ALK2Q207D expression on Smad signaling by using an assay of Smad1-Smad4 molecular complex formation (Fig. 4C). Smad1-Smad4 molecular complexes were detected at very low levels under basal conditions in ALK2WT-expressing cells. In contrast, these complexes were undetectable in unstimulated mIMCD-3 cells. This difference is consistent with the prior observation that overexpression of wild-type type I BMP receptors can lead to autoactivation of receptors on the cell surface (14Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massague J. Wrana J. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Treatment of ALK2WT-expressing cells with 20 nm BMP7 resulted in the formation of Smad1-Smad4 molecular complexes as observed in mIMCD-3 cells. In ALK2Q207D-expressing cells, we detected high levels of Smad1-Smad4 molecular complexes under basal conditions (no ligand). This result was consistent with constitutive signaling by the mutant ALK2 receptor. The amount of Smad4 detected in association"

Whereas heterodimerization between GABAB receptor GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits is essential for functional expression, how neurons coordinate the assembly of these critical receptors remains to be established. Here we have identified Marlin-1, a novel GABAB receptor-binding protein that associates specifically with the GABABR1 subunit in yeast, tissue culture cells, and neurons. Marlin-1 is expressed in the brain and exhibits a granular distribution in cultured hippocampal neurons. Marlin-1 binds different RNA species including the 3′-untranslated regions of both the GABABR1 and GABABR2 mRNAs in vitro and also associates with RNA in cultured neurons. Inhibition of Marlin-1 expression via small RNA interference technology results in enhanced intracellular levels of the GABABR2 receptor subunit without affecting the level of GABABR1. Together our results suggest that Marlin-1 functions to regulate the cellular levels of GABAB R2 subunits, which may have significant effects on the production of functional GABAB receptor heterodimers. Therefore, our observations provide an added level of regulation for the control of GABAB receptor expression and for the efficacy of inhibitory synaptic transmission.

It has become widely accepted that protein-protein interactions are responsible for the formation and maintenance of the signaling platforms that organize local transduction units (1Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Google Scholar). Protein associations have also been shown to modulate the synthesis, targeting, and stabilization of membrane receptors (2Grant S.G. Husi H. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: S49-S54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The study of the spatial and temporal compartmentalization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CCR, coiled-coil region; GST, glutathione S-transferase; UTR, untranslated region; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; contig, group of overlapping clones; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; SCG, superior cervical ganglion; sRNAi, small RNA interference. is essential to understand the mechanisms for neuronal integration of multiple stimuli. The identification of signaling partners has been well documented for ion channels (3Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat.

Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Google Scholar, 7El Far O. Betz H. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 329-336Google Scholar). GABAB receptors mediate the slow and prolonged phase of synaptic inhibition (8Mott D.D. Lewis D.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 36: 97-223Google Scholar) and, unlike other GPCRs, they require the formation of a heterodimer between GABABR1 and GABABR2 (9Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 274-286Google Scholar). These two subunits display high homology to metabotropic glutamate, Ca2+-sensing, vomeronasal, and putative pheromone receptors, and recombinant GABABR1/GABABR2 receptors mimic the effector-coupling and pharmacological properties of native receptors (10Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 16: 296-312Google Scholar). Clinically, GABAB receptors have been implicated in depression, neuroprotection, and cognition, and the production of GABABR1 knock-out mice has confirmed their role in epilepsy and pain (11Prosser H.M.

Furthermore, recent studies indicate that their activation may be beneficial in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms from addictive drugs (13Roberts D.C. Andrews M.M. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1997; 131: 271-277Google Scholar). Given their critical role in synaptic transmission and their potential therapeutic implications, it is fundamental to understand all aspects of GABAB receptor signaling. The modulation of neuronal GABAB receptors is likely to occur at multiple levels ranging from transcriptional/translational control and RNA metabolism to receptor targeting, post-translational modifications, and membrane stabilization. The roles of heterodimer assembly and GABABR2 phosphorylation have been documented previously (14Couve A. Filippov A.K. Connolly C.N. Bettler B. Brown D.A. Moss S.J. J. Biol.

In addition, the identification of 14-3-3, ATF4/CREB2, and Mupp1 as GABAB-associated proteins has started to reveal the macromolecular complexity of GABAB receptor signaling (20Couve A. Kittler J.T.

Recently, the local metabolism of mRNAs has been identified as a key element in the organization of synaptic sites (25Palacios I.M. St. Johnston D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 569-614Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence yet for the role of RNA metabolism in the regulation of GABAB receptor targeting and stability. Here we report the identification of Marlin-1, a novel brain-specific GABAB-binding protein that associates specifically with the GABABR1 subunit. We demonstrate that Marlin-1 also associates with RNA and that its interaction with the receptor and RNA occurs selectively through discrete coiled-coil regions. Moreover, we show that a decrease in Marlin-1 expression results in an abnormal accumulation of the GABABR2 receptor protein consistent with a role in RNA metabolism. The regulation of receptor biology through RNA metabolism widens significantly the modulatory levels of GABAB receptor function. Materials—Syto14 was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). RNA polymers (poly(I)-poly(C) and poly(C)) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmids—The plasmid pEGFP-C1 was purchased from Clontech. The plasmid containing the carboxyl-terminal domain of GABABR1 in the yeast two-hybrid vector pPC97 (pPC97-CR1), and the MYC-GABABR1 and FLAG-GABABR2 expression vectors have been described previously (14Couve A.

The series of plasmids containing deletions in the GABAB carboxyl-terminal domain have also been described else-where (20Couve A. Kittler J.T. Uren J.M. Calver A.R. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 317-328Google Scholar). Marlin-1 was subcloned into the pRK5 vector, and the FLAG epitope tag was inserted immediately before methionine at position 1. The cDNA fragments of the carboxyl-terminal domains of the β2-adrenergic and mGluR2 receptors were obtained by PCR from mGluR2 and β2-adrenergic plasmids (kindly provided by J. Pitcher) and inserted into pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein vectors pGEX-β2 (GST-β2) and pGEX-mGluR2 (GST-mGluR2). The series of plasmids containing different fragments of Marlin-1 were produced by PCR and inserted in frame in the vector pGEX-4T2 to produce pGEX-Marlin-1–626, pGEX-Marlin-343–626, pGEX-Marlin-442–626, pGEX-Marlin-257–447 and pGEX-Marlin-1–374. All DNA manipulations and fidelity of DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screens—Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed as described previously (20Couve A. Kittler J.T. Uren J.M. Calver A.R. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 317-328Google Scholar). The bait plasmid containing the sequence corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of GABABR1 (pPC97-CR1) was transformed into the yeast strain Y190. A rat striatum cDNA library in the complementary yeast vector pPC86 was used to screen for specific interactions. Potential interactions were analyzed by growth on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. In addition, the clones were cross-selected using β-galactosidase assays. All positive interactions were confirmed by retransformation into the Y190 strain. Antibodies—Monoclonal anti-FLAG and anti-MYC antibodies were obtained from Sigma and a 9E10 hybridoma, respectively. The polyclonal anti-MYC antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GABABR1 and anti-GABABR2 antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International (Harrow, UK). The fusion proteins pGEX-Marlin-1–374 (amino acids 1–374) and pGEX-Marlin-343–626 (amino acids 343–626) were used as antigens to raise and purify rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cocalico Biologicals). Antibodies to EEA1 and GM130 were obtained as part of the Organelle Sampler Kit (BD Transduction Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The secondary anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-guinea pig antibodies conjugated to Cy5, Texas Red, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), horseradish peroxidase and a rabbit anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The secondary antirabbit antibody conjugated to 125I was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Northern Blot Analysis—A rat Multi-Tissue Northern blot membrane (BD Biosciences) was hybridized with the 1-kb SalI-NotI fragment obtained from the yeast two-hybrid pPC86-Marlin plasmid. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with a human β-actin cDNA control probe (BD Biosciences). Cell Culture and cDNA Expression—COS cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (14Couve A. Filippov A.K. Connolly C.N. Bettler B. Brown D.A. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26361-26367Google Scholar). Superior Cervical Ganglion (SCG), Cortical, and Hippocampal Neuron Primary Cultures—SCG and embryonic cortical and hippocampal neurons were obtained and microinjected as described previously (14Couve A. Filippov A.K. Connolly C.N. Bettler B. Brown D.A. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26361-26367Google Scholar, 26Filippov A.K. Couve A. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Brown D.A. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2867-2874Google Scholar, 27Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Google Scholar). SCG neurons were microinjected 24–48 h after plating. Cortical and hippocampal neurons were obtained from embryonic day 18 rats and microinjected 18 days after plating. Alternatively, cortical and hippocampal neurons were transfected the day of dissection using the Nucleofection apparatus (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) and maintained for 5–21 days in vitro. Brain Fractionation—Brains from adult rats (∼10 g) were homogenized in 10 volumes of 0.32 m sucrose using 50 strokes in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved (S1.1). The pellet was homogenized again in the same buffer and centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 min (S1.2). The resulting supernatants were pooled (S1) and centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 10 min to obtain a crude membrane preparation (P16) and a soluble fraction (S16). The membrane fraction (P16) was washed three times in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml antipain and resuspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The soluble fraction was spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant (S100) was saved, and the pellet (P100) was resuspended in an equivalent volume of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblots of brain membranes, transfected cells, and cultured neurons were performed as described previously (19Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 415-424Google Scholar). Reactions were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For quantitative immunoblotting, an anti-rabbit 125I-conjugated secondary antibody was used, the immunoblots were scanned in a Bio-Rad FX scanner, and radioactive bands were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Immunohistochemistry—Male Sprague-Dawley rats of ∼250 g were terminal anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with 4% paraformaldeyde in PBS as described by Charles et al. (28Charles K.J. Deuchars J. Davies C.H. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 24: 214-223Google Scholar). Animals were decapitated, the brains were removed, and the fixed tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Tissue was then stored at -80 °C. 35-μm sections were then cut using a Lecia Jung cryostat. For immunohistichemistry, tissue sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS as described previously (28Charles K.J. Deuchars J. Davies C.H. Pangalos M.N. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 24: 214-223Google Scholar). Tissue was then incubated over-night with affinity-purified antibodies followed by incubation with the respective fluoresecent secondary antibodies. Images from stained sections were then recorded by confocal microscopy. Imaging—Transfected or nucleofected cells were plated onto 6-cm dishes containing 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated 13-mm coverslips. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and blocked for 10 min in immunofluorescence solution (0.25% bovine serum albumin, 10% horse serum in PBS). Cells were permeabilized in immunofluorescence solution containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at room temperature and blocked for another 10 min in immunofluorescence solution containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature in blocking solution. For Syto14 labeling, cells were incubated with 1 μm Syto14 in culture media for 15 min at 37 °C and washed twice in PBS prior to fixation. Coverslips were examined using a confocal microscope (MRC1000; Bio-Rad). Membrane Overlay Assays, Immunoprecipitations, and Solid Matrix Affinity Association Assays—Membrane overlay assays and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (19Couve A. Thomas P. Calver A.R. Hirst W.D. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Moss S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 415-424Google Scholar, 20Couve A. Kittler J.T. Uren J.M. Calver A.R. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 317-328Google Scholar). For solid matrix affinity association assays, proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine using the in vitro TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Southhampton, UK). Labeled samples were incubated with 25 μg of GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C min in association buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml antipain). Samples were washed three times, eluted in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to a Phosphor-Imager screen. The images were scanned in a Bio-Rad FX scanner, and quantification of radioactive bands was performed using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). RNA Association Assays—20 pmol of fusion proteins were spotted onto Hybond-C in triplicate. Hybond-C membranes were blocked in RNA binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated in RNA binding buffer containing labeled synthetic probes (0.5 μg/ml) or 3′-UTR probes (2 × 104 cpm) for 2 h at room temperature. The synthetic RNA polymer poly(I)-poly(C) was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and the T4 polynucleotide kinase. The DNA fragments corresponding to the 3′-UTR regions of GABABR1 and GABABR2 were produced by PCR, and the [α-32P]CTP-labeled RNA was obtained using the Riboprobe in vitro transcription system (Promega, Southhampton, UK). Membranes were washed three times in RNA binding buffer and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The images were scanned in a Bio-Rad FX scanner and quantified using Quantity One software (BioRad). sRNAi Analysis—Three pairs of oligonucleotides flanked by SalI and XbaI restriction sites were synthesized in vitro (MWG-Biotech, Milton Keynes, UK). The oligonucleotides were synthesized to three evolutionary conserved sequences, each complementary to a different region of the Marlin-1 cDNA. The regions corresponded to the following nucleotides: Marlin-1-sRNAi-1, residues 270–295; Marlin-1-sRNAi-2, residues 1327–1352; Marlin-1-sRNAi-3, residues 1770–1795. Each oligonucleotide consisted of 26 sense bp followed by an 8-bp noncomplementary loop containing the HindII site for screening purposes and the 26-bp antisense sequence, which contained five thimidines in its 3′-end. The complementary strand for each oligonucleotide was also synthesized. The oligonucleotide pairs were incorporated into a linearized pGEM plasmid containing the human U6 RNA pol III promoter (kindly provided by S. Wilson and P. Kellam). pol III transcription from these plasmids generates a hairpin RNA, which anneals to the target Marlin-1 mRNA through the antisense sequence and causes its specific degradation. 2 μg of each sRNAi plasmid were transfected into COS cells or nucleofected into hippocampal neurons together with 1 μg of pEGFP-C1 (2:1 ratio to ensure maximal cotransfection). Isolation and Sequence Analysis of Marlin-1, a Novel GABAB-interacting Protein—To identify novel partners of the GABAB receptor, the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain of the GABABR1 subunit was used to screen a rat striatal cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Approximately 20 groups of β-galactosidase-positive clones were identified based on unique restriction patterns. To confirm the specificity of the interactions, a representative of each group was retransformed into the yeast strain Y190 harboring different GPCRs. Among the positive and specific clones isolated, we obtained three independent fragments sharing overlapping sequences of the same gene. BLAST analysis indicated that this sequence was most similar to a closely related group of putative vertebrate proteins present in public data bases. The assembly of the full-length rat sequence from Rat Genome Resources was error-prone due to the shortness of the available contigs and the lack of coverage. Therefore, using the information of the annotated human sequence a clone encoding the full-length human sequence was isolated from a human brain cDNA library. The human sequence consists of 626 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 73 kDa. Further analysis of the available sequences based on the human template predicted that human, mouse, and rat orthologs share 95–99% identity (Fig. 1a). This novel GABAB-interacting protein has been named Marlin-1 (multiple alpha helices and RNA-linker protein, GenBank™ accession number AY382340). Detailed sequence analysis indicates that Marlin-1 contains three overall coiled-coil regions (CCRs), two of which include predicted leucine zipper motifs (Fig. 1b). All the yeast two-hybrid fragments obtained in the screen included overlapping sequences containing amino acids 329–626. Distribution of Marlin-1 mRNA and Protein—To examine the distribution of the Marlin-1 transcript in different tissues a Northern blot analysis was performed. A single and abundant 2.4-kb Marlin-1 mRNA species was expressed in the rat brain (Fig. 2a, lane 2). In addition, moderate levels of three mRNA species were observed in testis (Fig. 2a, lane 8). The significance of these low abundance transcripts was not explored further. To determine the protein distribution of Marlin-1, two GST fusion proteins encoding the amino-terminal (amino acids 1–374) and carboxyl-terminal domains (amino acids 343–626) of Marlin-1 were used as antigens to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies (UCL65 and UCL97, respectively). Immunoblot analysis from purified rat brain membranes showed the existence of a specific doublet band of ∼75 kDa (Fig. 2b, lane 5, double arrows). To confirm the specificity of the immunoreactivity, the human Marlin-1 cDNA was incorporated into a cytomegalovirus-based mammalian expression vector and tagged at the amino terminus with the FLAG epitope. FLAG-Marlin-1 was transfected into COS cells, and lysates were prepared for immunoblots. A single band of ∼80 kDa was detected with anti-FLAG antibodies in transfected cell lysates and was absent from lysates derived from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2b, lanes 1 and 2). The same band was detected with Marlin-1 antibodies (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 4, arrowhead). The altered migration of the recombinant species can be explained by the insertion of the FLAG epitope into the Marlin-1 sequence. The nature of the doublet visible in the brain preparation has not been explored further. The distribution of the Marlin-1 protein was then examined by immunoblots in samples derived from rat tissues. Significant levels of the tight ∼75-kDa doublet were predominantly observed in the brain (Fig. 2c, top panel, lanes 1–7, double arrows). These results indicate that Marlin-1 mRNA and protein are expressed in the rat central nervous system consistent with a role in GABAB receptor modulation. Association of GABAB Receptors and Marlin-1—The specific interaction of GABAB receptors and Marlin-1 was examined biochemically using a number of complementary assays. First, the interaction was analyzed through a gel overlay assay using Marlin-1 expressed as a GST fusion protein. GST or increasing amounts of GST-Marlin-1 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-C membrane. The membrane was incubated with the carboxyl-terminal domain of GABABR1 radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP. A strong interaction was detected between GABABR1 and Marlin-1 (Fig. 3a, lanes 2–5) but not between GABABR1 and control GST (Fig. 3a, lane 1). Next, the association was investigated using solid matrix affinity association assays. [35S]Marlin-1 was produced in vitro (Fig. 3b, lane 6) and incubated in the presence of control GST or the carboxyl-terminal domains of the GABABR1 (CR1), GABABR2 (CR2), metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (CmG2), and β2-adrenergic receptors (Cβ2). Marlin-1 interacted strongly with GABABR1 (Fig. 3b, lane 2) but not with GST (Fig. 3b, lane 1) or the other receptor constructs used as controls (Fig. 3b, lanes 3–5). These results confirm the yeast two-hybrid findings and indicate that the interaction between the GABABR1 receptor and Marlin-1 is direct and robust. The association between GABAB receptors and Marlin-1 was further explored by immunoprecipitation using transient transfection of recombinant proteins in tissue culture cells. COS cells were mock-transfected or transfected with MYC-GABABR1, FLAG-Marlin-1, or both plasmids simultaneously. Immunoblots of samples before immunoprecipitation indicated that MYC-GABABR1 and FLAG-Marlin-1 were expressed abundantly following transient tranfection (Fig. 3c, middle and bottom panels). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-MYC antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies. FLAG-Marlin-1 coimmunoprecipitated with MYC-GABABR1 (Fig. 3c, top, lanes 4) and was absent from control lanes (Fig. 3c, top, lanes 1–3). These results demonstrate that full-length GABABR1 and Marlin-1 associate in a cellular context. Finally, the solid matrix affinity association assay was used to determine the site of interaction of GABABR1 on Marlin-1. Different regions of Marlin-1 were subcloned into a cytomegalovirus-based mammalian expression vector and produced in vitro using a reticulocyte system in the presence of [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled proteins were incubated in the presence of control GST or CR1 fusion proteins. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were scanned and quantified in a PhosphorImager. The results of multiple experiments indicate that full-length Marlin-1 (Fig. 3d, amino acids 1–626), the yeast two-hybrid fragment (Fig. 3d, amino acids 343–626), and the third coiled-coil region (Fig. 3d, amino acids 442–626) but not the second coiled-coil region (Fig. 3d, amino acids 257–447) or the amino-terminal region of Marlin-1 (Fig. 3d, amino acids 1–374) interact directly with the GABABR1 subunit. These findings confirm the yeast two-hybrid observations and demonstrate that the different coiled-coil domains of Marlin-1 display a high degree of selectivity. Co-localization of Marlin-1 and GABAB Receptors—The cellular distribution of GABAB receptors and Marlin-1 was studied in slices derived from adult rat brains using GABABR1- and Marlin-1-specific antibodies. A significant overlap in the expression pattern of the two proteins was observed in different brain regions. For example, a strong reactivity of GABABR1 and Marlin-1 was observed in the cell body of a subpopulation of neurons in the cortex and the hippocampus (Fig. 4). To confirm their spatial association, the subcellular distribution of GABAB receptors and Marlin-1 was studied in transiently transfected COS cells. Cells were transfected with MYC-GABABR1 and FLAG-Marlin-1, and double immunofluorescence was performed with polyclonal anti-MYC and monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies. MYC-GABABR1 displayed an endoplasmic reticulum distribution, the characteristic pattern for this subunit (14Couve A. Filippov A.K. Connolly C.N. Bettler B. Brown D.A. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26361-26367Google Scholar) (Fig. 5a, white arrow). The distribution of MYC-GABABR1 was altered by coexpression of Marlin-1, and both proteins co-localized in a tubule-granular compartment (Fig. 5a, arrowheads). As a control, the distribution of actin did not display significant overlap with Marlin-1 (Fig. 5b). Next, the subcellular distribution of endogenous Marlin-1 was investigated by immunofluorescence in mature hippocampal neurons in culture. The staining obtained with both purified Marlin-1 antibodies was identical and revealed abundant levels of Marlin-1 in the cell body and neurites of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5c). High magnification imaging revealed an irregular and granular pattern of expression that was more prominent in the central region of the cell body and in the proximal segments of neuronal projections (Fig. 5c, inset). The nucleolar-like staining shown in Fig. 5 did not appear consistently and was not explored in any further detail. Immunofluorescence using antigen-absorbed antibodies produced no si"
https://openalex.org/W1996270996,"Leishmania parasites synthesize a range of mannose-containing glycoconjugates thought to be essential for virulence in the mammalian host and sandfly vector. A prerequisite for the synthesis of these molecules is the availability of the activated mannose donor, GDP-Man, the product of the catalysis of mannose-1-phosphate and GTP by GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GDP-MP). In contrast to the lethal phenotype in fungi, the deletion of the gene in Leishmania mexicana did not affect parasite viability but led to a total loss of virulence, making GDP-MP an ideal target for anti-Leishmania drug development. We show by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation that GDP-MP is a cytoplasmic protein, and we describe a colorimetric activity assay suitable for the high throughput screening of small molecule inhibitors. We expressed recombinant GDP-MP as a fusion with maltose-binding protein and separated the enzyme from maltose-binding protein by thrombin cleavage, ion-exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation studies demonstrate that GDP-MP self-associates to form an enzymatically active and stable hexamer. However, sedimentation studies show that the GDP-MP hexamer dissociates to trimers and monomers in a time-dependent manner, at low protein concentrations, at low ionic strength, and at alkaline pH. Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals that GDP-MP is comprised of mixed α/β structure, similar to its closest related homologue, N-acetyl-glucoseamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (Glmu) from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our studies provide insight into the structure of a novel target for the development of anti-Leishmania drugs.

Our studies provide insight into the structure of a novel target for the development of anti-Leishmania drugs. The eukaryotic protozoa of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of several human diseases referred to as leishmaniases. Symptoms range from self-healing cutaneous lesions to the fatal visceral form of the disease. Leishmaniasis occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with an estimated 12 million people infected and 350 million at risk of infection (1WHO/CTD Leishmaniasis Control: Burden and Trends. 1998; : 1-4Google Scholar, 2Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Attempts to produce an effective vaccine have so far failed, and treatment of the disease in regions other than northeast India still relies primarily on the use of pentavalent antimonials, drugs first introduced in the 1930s (2Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 3Yardley V. Croft S.L. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2000; 13: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, drug resistance has become an increasing problem in the treatment of leishmaniasis (4Ouellette M. Borst P. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Croft S.L. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1999; 94: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is clear that there is an urgent need for new and specific drugs to combat the disease. With a view to developing such drugs, parasite-specific biochemical and biosynthetic pathways involved in virulence are beginning to be targeted (reviewed in Davis et al. (28Davis A.J. Murray H.W. Handman E. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). Leishmania synthesize a number of unique mannose-containing glycoconjugates that are secreted or that form a thick glycocalyx on the surface of the parasite (6Ilgoutz S.C. McConville M.J. Int. J.

Glycotechn. 1999; 11: 1-19Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are virulence factors mediating host-parasite interactions in both the sandfly vector and the mammalian macrophage (11Handman E. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 5: 133-155Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As is the case in all eukaryotes, Man is a key monosaccharide for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. The activated donor for the mannosylation of the various mannose-containing biomolecules is GDP-Man. This nucleoside diphosphate sugar is formed by the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate by phosphomannose isomerase, and its subsequent conversion to GDP-Man by the enzyme GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, abbreviated here as GDP-MP (EC 2.7.7.13) (Fig. 1). GDP-Man is transported to the Golgi, where it is incorporated into phosphoglycans, and is also converted to Dol-P-Man, by Dol-P-Man synthase, which is incorporated into N-glycans, glycoinositol phospholipid anchors of proteins and polysaccharides, and in Leishmania, into GIPLs and LPG. GDP-MP is a member of the nucleotidyl transferase family of enzymes. The use of gene deletion mutants lacking enzymes in the Leishmania mannose biosynthetic pathway has indicated that this pathway provides two particularly attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics. Phosphomanno-mutase (12Garami A. Mehlert A. Ilg T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8168-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and GDP-MP (13Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) knock-out parasites were shown to be viable in culture but unable to establish infection in macrophages in vitro or in mice. Here we report the cloning and expression of GDP-MP in Escherichia coli and the characterization of the solution properties of the enzyme. Analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy indicate that the enzyme is a hexamer and has a mix of α/β structure similar to that of Glmu, an uridyltransferase from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Parasite and Bacterial Cultures—Leishmania mexicana promastigotes were grown at 26 °C in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA manipulations were performed in E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene), and overexpression was performed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene). All E. coli strains were cultured in LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics. Subcloning of the GDP-mannose Pyrophosphorylase Gene for Expression—The GDP-MP gene (AJ292039) was amplified by PCR with the primers EcoRI-GMP-F (5′-CCGGAATTCATGTCTGCATCCGATGGCCAG-3′) and SalI-GMP-R (5′-ACGCGTCGACTTACATGATGATCCCAGCCTG-3′) under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. The primers were engineered with EcoRI and SalI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, for cloning into the expression vector pMALc2T, a modified version of the pMALc2 vector (New England Biolabs) containing a thrombin cleavage site introduced between the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and GDP-MP. Expression of Recombinant GDP-mannose Pyrophosphorylase—A 20-ml culture of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells containing the GDP-MP construct incubated at 37 °C overnight was used to inoculate 1.6 liters of LB broth supplemented with 35 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol, 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin, and 0.2% (w/v) glucose. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h before harvesting the cells by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min. The cells were resuspended in 80 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The cells were thawed and then sonicated on ice in 1-min bursts for a total of 3 min, and the soluble lysate obtained after centrifugation at 9000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C was used to purify the recombinant enzyme. Purification of Recombinant GDP-mannose Pyrophosphorylase—The MBP·GDP·MP fusion protein was purified from the bacterial lysate by affinity chromatography on amylose resin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Fractions containing protein were pooled, dialyzed against thrombin hydrolysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm DTT), and digested with thrombin for 1 h at 37 °C to remove the MBP fusion partner. The sample was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against three changes of 100 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm DTT prior to further purification using ion-exchange chromatography. The protein solution was loaded onto a HiTrap Q Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.02 to 1.0 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 over 90 min, and eluted fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and immunoblotting to identify the fractions containing GDP-MP. The enzyme-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against three changes of 100 volumes of storage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm DTT). Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—Following ion-exchange chromatography, purified GDP-MP was dialyzed against three changes of 100 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Analytical SEC was performed on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1. To estimate the relative molar mass of GDP-MP, the SEC column was calibrated with globular protein standards (Bio-Rad), and the relationship between molar mass and retention time was established by linear regression (Fig. 5, inset). Preparative SEC was performed on a Sephadex 200 HR 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) using the buffer and flow conditions described above. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation experiments of GDP-MP (0.1-1.0 mg ml-1) dissolved in Tris-buffered solutions were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge. SEC-purified samples were loaded into a conventional double sector quartz cell and mounted in a Beckman An-60 Ti rotor. For sedimentation velocity experiments, 380 μl of sample and 400 μl of reference solution were used, and data were collected at a single wavelength (235 or 280 nm) in continuous mode, at a temperature of 20 °C, rotor velocity of 40,000 rpm, using a time interval of 300 s and a step size of 0.003 cm without averaging. For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, 110 μl of sample and 120 μl of reference were employed, and the data were collected at a wavelength of 280 nm, temperature of 20 °C, rotor velocity of 10,000 rpm or 18,000 rpm, using a step-size of 0.001 cm with five averages until sedimentation equilibrium was obtained (12-16 h). To estimate the signal due to non-sedimenting contaminants, high-speed depletion was performed at 40,000 rpm for at least 4 h, and the resulting baseline offset (E) was calculated by averaging the absorbance over a radial range of 0.1 cm in the solution plateau adjacent to the sample meniscus. For all samples, the values for E represented ≤5% of the initial optical density, indicating the presence of only minor amounts of low molar mass contaminants. The partial specific volume of GDP-MP ( ν¯=0.74 ml g-1 at 20 °C), hydration (0.39 g g-1), solvent densities, and viscosities were computed using the program SEDENTERP (14Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity data at multiple time points were fitted to a non-interacting discrete species model of up to three components, self-associating models, or a continuous size distribution model (15Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar) using the program SEDFIT (available at www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com). Sedimentation equilibrium data at multiple speeds was fitted globally to a discrete species model of up to three components or a monomer-trimer-hexamer self-associating model with and without the sedimentation velocity data by employing the program SEDPHAT (also available at www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com). In addition, sedimentation equilibrium data at multiple speeds and protein concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg ml-1 were fitted assuming a single species according to Equation 1 as follows. c(r)=c(r0)expω22RTMeq(1-ν¯ρ)(r2-r02)+E(Eq. 1) where, c(r) is the concentration at radius r, c(r0) is the concentration at the reference radius r0, ω is the rotor angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, Meq is the equivalent molar mass assuming a single species, ν¯ is the partial specific volume of the solute, ρ is the solvent density, and E is the baseline offset. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD spectra of purified GDP-MP in 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, were recorded on an Aviv 62DS CD spectrophotometer between the wavelengths of 195-250 nm using a slit bandwidth of 1.5 nm. Spectra were collected at a temperature of 20 °C, with a step size of 0.5 nm using a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette. Signal averaging time was 2.0 s, and ellipticities were reported as Δϵ (m-1 cm-1). The concentration of GDP-MP samples employed in the CD studies (0.13-0.89 mg ml-1) were determined by absorption spectroscopy on a Cary 5 UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm ( ε280nmM-1cm-1=38,370 (16Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar), and CD spectra were fitted using the program CDPRO, which is available at lamar.colostate.edu/~sreeram/CDPro/. Triton X-114 Detergent Phase Separation—2 × 108 L. mexicana parasites washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were solubilized in 1.0 ml of PBS, pH 7.3, containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-114 (TX-114) and 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (10 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 80 μm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, 4 mm bestatin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, 1.4 mm E-64 (Sigma)). The lysate was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to remove insoluble material, and the proteins were fractionated into a hydrophilic water fraction and a hydrophobic detergent fraction, as described (17Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Native GDP-MP—Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed twice with TBS-Triton (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and dispensed into 20-μl aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes. 30 μl of either normal rabbit serum or rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant GDP-MP was added to 20 μl of beads and incubated on ice for 2 h. L. mexicana lysate was prepared by solubilizing parasites in TBS-Triton. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. 120 μl of parasite lysate, representing 1.5 × 107 parasites, was added to 20 μl of antibody-coated beads and incubated on ice for 2 h. The beads were washed three times in TBS prior to the bound enzyme being either assayed for activity or analyzed by Western blotting. Mouse antibodies against recombinant GDP-MP were used to detect duplicate samples by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Parasite and bacterial lysates, as well as enzyme-containing fractions, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using rabbit antibodies to histidine-tagged GDP-MP followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon). Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence following the manufacturers' instructions (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Analysis—L. mexicana promastigotes in PBS were allowed to settle onto poly-l-lysine coated slides for 2 min and fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde, 2% (w/v) glucose in PBS. After permeabilization with 0.05% saponin in 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS, GDP-MP was detected with rabbit antibodies raised to the recombinant protein followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig secondary antibody (Silenus). GDP-mannose Pyrophosphorylase Activity Assay—Enzyme activity was determined using a colorimetric assay coupled with inorganic pyrophosphatase (19Ohta A. Chibana H. Arisawa M. Sudoh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1475: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in a 100-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GTP, 100 μm mannose 1-phosphate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 units ml-1 inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), and 0.1 μg of recombinant GDP-MP. For detection, 100 μl of 0.03% (w/v) malachite green, 0.2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 in HCl were added, and the reaction was incubated for a further 5 min at 30 °C. The inorganic pyrophosphate generated in the reaction is immediately converted to inorganic phosphate by an excess of inorganic pyrophosphatase. The increase in the concentration of inorganic phosphate, representing GDP-MP activity, was determined by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm. Activity was expressed as change in OD650/0.1 μg of enzyme/30 min. Expression and Purification of Recombinant L. mexicana GDP-mannose Pyrophosphorylase—The L. mexicana gene encoding GDP-MP was subcloned into the expression vector pMALc2T, containing an N-terminal MBP tag, and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant fusion protein was initially purified on amylose resin, and the MBP tag was subsequently removed by hydrolysis with thrombin. GDP-MP was separated from the MBP by ion-exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). The purification resulted in a single protein band with the relative molecular mass of 41.9 kDa, equivalent to a monomer when electrophoresed in the absence of reducing agent (Fig. 2A). This was confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies to GDP-MP, which recognized both the recombinant fusion protein and the purified enzyme (Fig. 2B). In contrast, antibodies to the MBP tag recognized the fusion protein but not the purified enzyme (Fig. 2B). Enzymatic Activity of Recombinant GDP-MP—The enzymatic activity of recombinant GDP-MP was determined in a colorimetric assay coupled to inorganic pyrophosphatase. The activity of the recombinant enzyme was assayed prior to, and following, the removal of MBP by thrombin hydrolysis and ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme activity of chimeric GDP-MP fused to MBP was determined to be 1.762 OD650/0.1 μg of enzyme/30 min. The pyrophosphorylase activity following the removal of the MBP moiety and further purification of the GDP-MP by size exclusion chromatography (see below) was calculated to be 1.842 OD650/0.1 μg of enzyme/30 min, very similar to that of the fusion protein. The activity of the recombinant enzyme was similar to that obtained for the native enzyme immunoprecipitated from parasite lysates (Fig. 3). Cellular localization of GDP-MP—Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the enzyme suggested that the protein is water-soluble. We set out to confirm the solubility properties of GDP-MP and determine the cellular localization of the enzyme. We examined the presence of the enzyme in wild type L. mexicana promastigotes and as a specificity control in the null mutants ΔGDP-MP. Western blotting analysis of the proteins in the Triton X-114 detergent and aqueous fractions after detergent phase separation showed that the enzyme is present in the water phase (Fig. 4A). No protein was detected in the null ΔGDP-MP parasites or in the Triton X-114 phase of the wild type parasites. The cytoplasmic localization of the protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence, with the anti-GDP-MP antibodies showing that the protein was distributed throughout the parasite cytosol, with no staining in any organelle or on any membranes (Fig. 4B). As expected, no signal was detected in the ΔGDP-MP parasites stained with the same antibodies. Characterization of GDP-MP by Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography and Sedimentation Velocity—When subjected to analytical size exclusion chromatography in the presence of reducing agent, GDP-MP elutes as a major peak with a relative mass of 207 kDa calculated from a four-point standard curve (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that GDP-MP exists primarily as a non-covalently associated pentamer or hexamer in aqueous solution. Sedimentation velocity analysis of the peak fraction after size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5, t ∼52 min) confirmed that GDP-MP exists as a hexamer, with a molar mass calculated from the ordinate maximum of the c(M) distribution of 246 kDa (Fig. 6B). This is in good agreement with the theoretical molar mass for the hexameric form of GDP-MP (Table I). In addition, the data shown in Fig. 6A were also fitted to a continuous sedimentation coefficient, c(s), distribution (15Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Based on the c(s) distribution best-fit (Fig. 7A, solid line), the hexamer has a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 9.5 S with an axial ratio assuming an ellipsoidal structure of ∼5.2, indicating that this oligomer is asymmetric in structure (Table I). However, Fig. 5 shows that the sample also contains higher molar mass aggregates, as well as material corresponding in size to monomers and trimers. Accordingly, the quaternary structure of GDP-MP was further characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation in varying solution conditions.Table IHydrodynamic properties of recombinant GDP-MPOligomerMraMolar mass based on amino acid sequences20,ωbTaken from the ordinate maximum of the corresponding peak in the continuous-size distribution best-fit (Fig. 6A) (15)a/bcAxial ratio (a/b) calculated using the ν̄nu; method (14)kDaSvedbergMonomer41.92.58.0Trimer1265.76.1Hexamer2519.55.2a Molar mass based on amino acid sequenceb Taken from the ordinate maximum of the corresponding peak in the continuous-size distribution best-fit (Fig. 6A) (15Schuck P.

Continuous size distributions were calculated at a resolution of 200 sedimentation coefficients between 0.5 and 12.0 S, at p = 0.95 and f/f0 = 1.45 using the program SEDFIT (15Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. for all fits was ≤0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stability of GDP-MP in Aqueous Solution—To examine the stability of hexameric GDP-MP, we determined the effect of time, pH, initial protein concentration, and ionic strength on the propensity of GDP-MP to self-associate in aqueous solution. The data are summarized in Fig. 7 and Table II. Fig. 7A shows the c(s) distributions for GDP-MP at t = 0 and t = 5 days. It is evident that a slow dissociation of the hexamer to species with apparent sedimentation coefficients of ∼2.5 and ∼5.7 S occurs with time. Similarly, the hexamer is shown to dissociate at low ionic strength (Fig. 7B, dash-dot-dot line), and in particular, in aqueous solution buffered at pH 10.0 (Fig. 7C, dash-dot line). Attempts were also made to study the quaternary structure of GDP-MP at pH 3.0, but the recombinant protein (pI ∼ 5.45) precipitated following exhaustive dialysis into 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0. To determine the oligomeric identities of the heterogeneous species observed at low ionic strength, sedimentation equilibrium data at multiple speeds were globally fitted with sedimentation velocity data to rapid or slow self-associating equilibrium models using the program SEDPHAT. 2J. Vistica, J. Dan, A. Balbo, E. Yikilmaz, R. A. Marivzza, T. A. Rouault, and P. Schuck, submitted. The non-linear best-fit was obtained to a mixture of monomer-trimer-hexamer in a molar ratio of 0.26:0.07:0.67 (Fig. 8), confirming that GDP-MP hexamer dissociates to trimers and monomers. The hydrodynamic properties of each oligomer are summarized in Table I. The hexamerization of GDP-MP was also shown to be concentration-dependent with apparent molar masses calculated assuming a single species increasing with initial protein concentration (Table II).Table IIConcentration-dependent self-association of GDP-MPProtein concentrationMeqaEquivalent molar mass (Meq) calculated from Equation 1r.m.s.d.br.m.s.d. for nonlinear global best-fit to sedimentation equilibrium data at 10,000 and 18,000 rpm according to Equation 1mg ml-1kDa0.1222 ± 0.340.00410.3233 ± 0.290.00611.0236 ± 1.210.0071a Equivalent molar mass (Meq) calculated from Equation 1b r.m.s.d. for nonlinear global best-fit to sedimentation equilibrium data at 10,000 and 18,000 rpm according to Equation 1 Open table in a new tab To estimate the degree of secondary structure of GDP-MP, CD spectrometry was employed in a Tris-buffered solution at pH 7.5. The CD spectrum measured at a protein concentration of 0.13 mg ml-1 is characteristic of a mixed α/β structure with a broad minimum between 210 and 220 nm (Fig. 9, open symbols). This was confirmed when the CD spectrum was fitted by non-linear regression using the program CONTINLL, included in the CDPRO software package, yielding a best-fit to a mixture of 29% helix, 26% β-structure, 25% random structure, and 20% turn (Fig. 9, solid line). Similar CD spectra were obtained at higher protein concentrations of 0.24, 0.50, and 0.89 mg ml-1 (data not shown). Until the deletion of the GDP-MP gene in L. mexicana (13Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it was generally assumed that the biosynthesis of mannose-containing glycoconjugates was of vital importance to all eukaryotic organisms (20Varki A. Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 57-68Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene in Candida and Saccharomyces cerevisiae is lethal (21Warit S. Zhang N. Short A. Walmsley R.M. Oliver S.G. Stateva L.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and no natural mutants have been observed in mammals including humans. Mannose is essential for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids, and the resultant glycoconjugates, such as protein N- and some O-glycans, glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein membrane anchors, and some glycolipids, have a variety of important functions. In L. mexicana, GDP-MP was shown to be essential for the formation of GDP-Man (13Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the activated mannose donor for all mannosylation reactions in Leishmania spp. These parasites lacked all mannose-containing glycoconjugates such as LPG, proteophosphoglycans, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, GIPLs, and N-glycans. Also lost was the newly discovered β1-2 mannan, considered important in protection from stress. It has been suggested that the failure of the GDP-MP mutants to accumulate β1-2 mannan may account to a large extent for their lack of survival in vivo (22Ralton J.E. Nederer T. Piraino H.L. Bashtanyk T.A. Callaghan J.M. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40757-40763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ΔGDP-MP parasites were viable in cell-free culture but were unable to survive in macrophages or mice, making it a very attractive target for anti-Leishmania drug design. In this study, the entire L. mexicana GDP-MP gene was cloned and expressed as a recombinant protein. The gene sequence and preliminary studies (13Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggested that the protein was water-soluble and most likely cytoplasmic. We used subcellular fractionation with Triton X-114 (17Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which showed that the enzyme partitioned into the water phase. Immunofluorescence confirmed the cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme. Furthermore, using an adaptation of a coupled colorimetric assay described for Candida, we show that the recombinant enzyme has enzymatic activity both as a fusion protein with the E. coli maltose-binding protein and after hydrolysis by thrombin. The specific activity is similar to that observed for the native protein and for the homologous enzyme in Candida albicans. Size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that GDP-MP self-associates to form a hexamer in the presence of reducing agent (DTT) and is stable under physiological conditions. The early study of the GDP-MP deletion mutants showed that the enzyme activity in the parasite lysate was detected in the size range of 240-300 kDa, supporting the idea that the enzyme is a hexamer. Although the hexamer is shown to dissociate to trimers and monomers slowly over time, in low ionic strength, and particularly, at alkaline pH, the hexamerization of GDP-MP is stabilized at high protein concentrations (Table II) more similar to the crowded intracellular environment in the parasite (23Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Hexamerization was also stabilized with the addition of high salt (1.0 m). These observations suggest that the self-association of GDP-MP is driven by electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and hydrophobic interactions and not dominated by any one type. Furthermore, based on sedimentation velocity experiments conducted at low ionic strength, GDP-MP is likely to self-associate from asymmetric monomers (a/b = 8.0) to more symmetrical higher order oligomers, namely trimer (a/b = 6.1) and hexamer (a/b = 5.2) (Table I). A search of the domain data base, Pfam (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam), indicates that in addition to the nucleotidyl transferase domain at the N terminus, GDP-MP contains four hexapeptide domains in the C-terminal region of the protein. Tandem repeats of hexapeptide domains have been shown to form a left-handed β helix in bacterial transferases (24Raetz C.R. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). By inference, it may be postulated that GDP-MP may also exhibit left-handed β helix structure in the C-terminal domain of the protein. Using the fugue server (www.cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~fugue/) to find structural homologues of GDP-MP, Z scores in excess of 30 were found for several related UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine pyrophosphorylases. The preferred alignment of GDP-MP was with the pyrophosphorylase domain of the bifunctional bacterial enzyme N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (Glmu) from S. pneumoniae (25Sulzenbacher G. Gal L. Peneff C. Fassy F. Bourne Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and E. coli (26Olsen L.R. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Glmu molecule, which self-associates as a trimer, consists of a globular pyrophosphorylase domain and a left-handed β helix (LβH) domain connected by an α-helical linker. The trimeric subunit interface of Glmu is formed by three copies of the LβH domain and is thought to contribute to the stabilization of the molecule, in addition to forming the acetyl CoA binding site (25Sulzenbacher G. Gal L. Peneff C. Fassy F. Bourne Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Olsen L.R. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, there is no bifunctional equivalent of Glmu, and the activities of the acetyltransferase and pyrophosphorylase domains are accomplished by two distinct enzymes (25Sulzenbacher G. Gal L. Peneff C. Fassy F. Bourne Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In GDP-MP, the LβH domain may therefore play a role in the stabilization of the quaternary structure of the enzyme without conferring an additional enzymatic activity upon the molecule. In the crystal structure of Glmu from E. coli (26Olsen L.R. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the C-terminal domains were reported to pack base-to-base to form a hexameric aggregate. Based on these considerations, and on our data showing that the GDP-MP hexamer dissociates to trimers at low ionic concentration, one can propose that the GDP-MP hexamer is composed of a dimer of trimers driven by non-covalent interactions. The Leishmania Golgi GDP-Man transporter, LPG2, which transports GDP-Man from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the Golgi, has also been shown to form hexameric complexes (27Hong K. Ma D. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), indicating that hexamerization occurs in more than one protein involved in glycosylation in these organisms. Since Leishmania parasites lacking the enzyme are totally avirulent, inhibition of this enzyme activity provides an attractive target for anti-Leishmania drug design. Given that the stability of the GDP-MP hexamer is compromised at low ionic strength and at high pH, we propose that new drug candidates can be designed to inhibit the active hexameric form of this enzyme. The availability of the recombinant protein and the enzyme assay described here, which is suitable for high throughput screening for small molecule inhibitors, should facilitate the drug discovery process. We thank Geoff Howlett and Peter Colman for input throughout this study and for critically reviewing this manuscript, Peter Schuck for providing technical support for the analysis of sedimentation data with SEDPHAT, and Jim Goding for providing the modified pMalc2T vector, which made the production of the recombinant protein possible."
https://openalex.org/W2056800134,"Participation of multiple kinases in regulation of the binding of lamin B receptor (LBR) to chromatin was suggested previously (Takano, M., Takeuchi, M., Ito, H., Furukawa, K., Sugimoto, K., Omata, S., and Horigome, T. (2002) Eur. J. Biochem. 269, 943-953). To identify these kinases, regulation of the binding of the nucleoplasmic region (NK, amino acid residues 1-211) of LBR to sperm chromatin was studied using a cell cycle-dependent Xenopus egg extract in vitro. The binding was stimulated on specific phosphorylation of the NK fragment by an S-phase egg extract. Protein depletion with beads bearing SF2/ASF, which binds SR protein kinases, abolished this stimulation, suggesting that an SR protein kinase(s) is responsible for the activation of LBR. This was confirmed by direct phosphorylation and activation with recombinant SR protein-specific kinase 1. The binding of the NK fragment to chromatin pretreated with an S-phase extract was suppressed by incubation with an M-phase extract. Enzyme inhibitor experiments revealed that multiple kinases participate in the suppression. One of these kinases was shown to be cdc2 kinase using a specific inhibitor, roscovitine, and protein depletion with beads bearing p13, which specifically binds cdc2 kinase. Experiments involving a mutant NK fragment showed that the phosphorylation of serine 71 by cdc2 kinase is responsible for the suppression. Participation of multiple kinases in regulation of the binding of lamin B receptor (LBR) to chromatin was suggested previously (Takano, M., Takeuchi, M., Ito, H., Furukawa, K., Sugimoto, K., Omata, S., and Horigome, T.

The nuclear envelope separates the nucleoplasm from the cytoplasm and thereby organizes the nuclear architecture. The nuclear envelope consists of two lipid bilayers (inner and outer), nuclear pore complexes, and the nuclear lamina and undergoes repeated dynamic assembly and disassembly in every cell cycle in higher eukaryotes. Studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying nuclear envelope assembly and disassembly are important to understand the mechanisms underlying cell division and prenucleus formation. Studies on the organization of the nuclear architecture by the nuclear envelope during the cell cycle are also important to understand how mutants of nuclear envelope proteins, i.e. lamin A/C (1Sullivan T.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The assembly and disassembly of the nuclear envelope in the cell cycle accompany association and dissociation of the inner nuclear membrane with and from chromatin, respectively. All major inner nuclear membrane proteins, such as the lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) family, LBR, and emerin, are known to bind to chromatin in vitro (5Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and to accumulate on the surface of chromatin during the anaphase-telophase transition in vivo (7Haraguchi T. Koujin T.

Therefore, the binding of these proteins to chromatin is thought to support the binding of the inner nuclear membrane to chromatin. Indeed, LBR and LAP2 have been demonstrated to play functional roles in the interaction of the nuclear envelope and chromatin through in vitro experiments as follows. Depletion of LBR from nuclear envelope precursor vesicles suppresses nuclear assembly (8Pyrpasopoulou A. Meier J. Maison C. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7108-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), neutralization of LBR by antibodies in a sea urchin cell-free system inhibits targeting of nuclear envelope precursor vesicles to the surface of chromatin (9Collas P. Courvalin J.-C. Poccia D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the addition of an amino-terminal fragment of LAP2 inhibits nuclear envelope formation (10Shumaker D.K. Lee K.K. Tanhehco Y.C. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The binding of these proteins to chromatin has to be regulated precisely throughout the cell cycle. The binding of LAP2 to chromatin was shown to be regulated by phosphorylation using HeLa cell extracts (5Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). LAP2β is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) (11Dreger M. Otto H. Neubauer G. Mann M. Hucho F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2426-2434Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the binding of LBR to chromatin is regulated by phosphorylation of LBR in the nucleoplasmic region by cell cycle-specific Xenopus egg cytosol fractions (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is also known that LBR is phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase (12Kawahire S. Tachibana T. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Imai N. Saito M. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Nikolakaki E. Meier J. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol.

Horigome T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and casein kinase II (12Kawahire S. Tachibana T. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Imai N. Saito M. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, in the cases of all inner nuclear membrane proteins, the protein kinase responsible for the regulation of the binding to chromatin has not yet been identified. In this study, we analyzed kinases responsible for regulation of the binding of LBR to chromatin using cell cycle-specific Xenopus egg cytosol fractions. It was shown that the stimulation of the binding of LBR to chromatin by an S-phase cytosol fraction (SC) was caused by phosphorylation by SRPK. On the other hand, suppression of the binding of LBR to chromatin by an M-phase cytosol fraction (MC) was caused by multiple kinases, one of which was identified as cdc2 kinase. Based on these findings and others, regulation of the binding of LBR to chromatin is discussed. Materials—Okadaic acid and a phosphatase inhibitor, I-2, were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan) and Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. Protein kinase inhibitors, i.e. A3, K252b, and calphostin C, were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. A protein kinase A inhibitor (P0300), apyrase, staurosporine, 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP), and DNA-cellulose (double-stranded) were from Sigma. cdc2 kinase was affinity-purified from a Xenopus egg extract using p13 resin (15Kusubata M. Tokui T. Matsuoka Y. Okumura E. Tachibana K. Hisanaga S. Kishimoto T. Yasuda H. Kamijo M. Ohba Y. Tsujimura K. Yatani R. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20937-20942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. PKC, trypsin, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), Promega Co. (Madison, WI), and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Buffer—The extraction buffer comprised 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.7), 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2; and the PP1 reaction buffer comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Preparation of Demembranated Xenopus Sperm Chromatin and Xenopus Egg Cytosol Fractions—S-phase and M-phase Xenopus egg cytosol fractions and demembranated Xenopus sperm chromatin were prepared as described previously (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Chromatin Binding Assay—The nucleoplasmic region of human LBR (NK, amino acid residues 1-211) and the arginine-serine repeat-containing region within NK (RS, amino acid residues 53-89) were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and then bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In some experiments, a mutant GST-NK, GST-NK(S71A), was used. In this mutant, serine 71 is substituted by alanine. Using the thus prepared beads, the chromatin binding assay was carried out as described previously (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, Xenopus sperm chromatin, which was demembranated with lysolecithin and subsequently decondensed with heated Xenopus egg cytosol (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in 20 μl of extraction buffer (7500/μl) was added to 4 μg of GST-fused protein bound to 2 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads suspended in 10 μl of extraction buffer. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, the binding reaction was stopped by pipetting 15-μl samples onto glass slides spotted with 12 μl of a fixing solution (3% formaldehyde, 6 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33342, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, and 15 mm Pipes, pH 7.2). The fixed samples were observed by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. 100-200 beads were observed for every sample, and “the percentage of beads with bound chromatin” was calculated. This value was used as an index of the affinity of beads bearing LBR fragments and chromatin. The values in the figures are shown after subtraction of a blank value. The blank value was determined in each experiment using Sepharose beads bound with GST instead of GST·LBR fragments. In the preceding study (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we compared this method and an established in vitro binding method involving soluble protein and chromatin and showed that this bead method gives the same results as the established method. Therefore, we used this method to determine the affinity of protein fragments to chromatin in this study. Assaying of Cell Cycle-dependent Binding of LBR Fragments to Sperm Chromatin—GST-fused proteins attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads (4 μg of protein, 2 μl of beads) were pretreated with 20 μl of either SC or MC at 23 °C for 1 h. After washing twice with extraction buffer, the beads were used for the chromatin binding assay. The addition of 1 m NaCl to the washing buffer to remove possible bound proteins from the gel beads had no effect on the binding of chromatin to the beads. In some experiments, protein kinase inhibitors and other reagents were added to SC and MC prior to the addition of GST-fused protein beads. Pretreatment of a cytosol fraction with apyrase was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. For DNA binding assaying and phosphopeptide mapping, beads bearing GST-fused proteins were pretreated by the same procedures. Depletion of SRPK and cdc2 Kinase from Xenopus Egg Extracts—Depletion of SRPK from SC was carried out with GST-SF2/ASF beads according to the procedure reported previously (16Koizumi J. Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11125-11131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GST-SF2/ASF was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and then bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The thus prepared beads were pretreated with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min to reduce nonspecific adsorption. To deplete SRPK from SC, 5 μl of SF2/ASF-bearing beads (0.5 μg of GST-SF2/ASF/μl of beads) was added to 20 μl of SC, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifugation at 740 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was used as SRPK-depleted SC. To deplete cdc2 kinase from MC, p13 beads, which specifically bind cdc2 kinase (15Kusubata M. Tokui T. Matsuoka Y. Okumura E. Tachibana K. Hisanaga S. Kishimoto T. Yasuda H. Kamijo M. Ohba Y. Tsujimura K. Yatani R. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20937-20942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used as follows. Plasmid pRK172, containing the fission yeast suc1+ gene (kindly provided by Dr. T. Kishimoto, Tokyo Institute of Technology), was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The p13suc1 protein was expressed, purified, and immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as described by Kusubata et al. (15Kusubata M. Tokui T. Matsuoka Y. Okumura E. Tachibana K. Hisanaga S. Kishimoto T. Yasuda H. Kamijo M. Ohba Y. Tsujimura K. Yatani R. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20937-20942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thus prepared beads were pretreated with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min to reduce nonspecific adsorption. To deplete cdc2 kinase from MC, 5 μl of p13-bearing beads (5 μg of p13suc1/μl of beads) was added to 20 μl of MC, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifugation at 740 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was used as cdc2 kinase-depleted MC. Analysis of LBR Phosphorylation—Phosphopeptide mapping was performed essentially as described previously (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-NK and GST-NK(S71A) phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP in vitro were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The protein bands were excised, soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 (Wako) in 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed five times with water and two times with 50 mm NH4HCO3. These proteins were digested with trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 15 h. The released peptides were loaded onto a cellulose thin layer chromatography plate of 20 cm × 20 cm (Funacell; Funakoshi Co., Tokyo, Japan). Electrophoresis in the first dimension was performed at pH 8.9 (1% ammonium carbonate) for 20 min at 1000 V, and ascending chromatography in the second dimension was performed using a solvent system of 37.5% 1-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid in water (v/v). The dried plate was exposed to Fuji x-ray film with intensifying screens. Binding Assay of LBR Fragments to DNA-cellulose—The purified GST and GST-fused LBR fragments (2 μg of proteins) were incubated with 30 μl of a 10% suspension of double-stranded DNA-cellulose in 500 μl of DNA-binding buffer, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 0.2 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml BSA, at 4 °C for 6 h with rotation. Then, the DNA-cellulose was washed three times with the binding buffer and once with the binding buffer without BSA. LBR fragments bound to the cellulose were eluted with a 2% SDS solution, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against GST as described previously (17Furukawa K. Glass C. Kondo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The significance of the pretreatment of beads bearing LBR fragments with various reagents in the chromatin binding assay was evaluated by means of Student's t test (n = 3). We showed previously that the binding of GST-NK to chromatin is stimulated by phosphorylation of GST-NK in the RS region by a Xenopus egg S-phase cytosol fraction (Fig. 1) (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To identify the kinase responsible for this stimulation, we first examined protein kinase A and showed that it could cause the stimulation (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, an inhibitor specific for the kinase could not suppress the stimulation by the cytosol (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Then we examined cdc2 kinase, calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and casein kinase II, which have been shown to phosphorylate LBR (12Kawahire S. Tachibana T. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Imai N. Saito M. Ichimura T. Omata S. Horigome T. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, they did not stimulate the binding (data not shown). It has been reported that a nuclear envelope-associated protein kinase phosphorylates LBR (18Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and that its substrate specificity is identical to that of SR protein-specific kinase 1 (14Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Giannakouros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Then, we treated GST-NK (amino acid residues 1-211 of LBR) with SRPK1 and found that the enzyme clearly stimulates the binding of GST-NK to chromatin (Fig. 1, column 6). Stimulation of the binding by pretreatment with SC and SRPK1 was similarly inhibited by kinase inhibitors having broad specificities such as A3, K232b (Fig. 1), and staurosporine (data not shown). The 50% inhibition value for both stimulating kinases, i.e. the kinase in SC and SRPK1, with A3 was 0.1 mm (data not shown). These results suggested that the kinase responsible for the stimulation of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin by SC is SRPK. When GST-RS (amino acid residues 53-89 of LBR) was used instead of GST-NK to narrow the phosphorylation site, similar stimulation on treatment with SC and SRPK1 was observed (Fig. 1, columns 10-13). These results suggested that the stimulation is caused by phosphorylation of residues in the RS region. To verify the participation of SRPK in SC in the stimulation, affinity-depletion experiments on SRPK were carried out. When SC was affinity-depleted of SRPK using SF2/ASF beads, the SC lost the ability to stimulate the binding of GST-NK to chromatin (Fig. 2, column 5). Subsequent addition of purified SRPK1 to the SRPK-depleted SC restored its ability to stimulate the binding (Fig. 2, column 6). These data clearly indicate that the stimulation of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin is caused by SRPK in SC. The phosphorylation sites of GST-NK treated with SC, SC depleted of SRPK, and SRPK1 itself were compared by phosphopeptide mapping. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the two maps obtained for GST-NK treated with SC and SRPK1 were very similar to each other. Moreover, all spots except spot 1 disappeared on depletion of SRPK from SC (Fig. 3, Dep.SC). A part of the complex patterns of the phosphopeptide maps of SC and SRPK was possibly caused by alternative phosphorylation of serines within RS motifs (arginine-serine repeats), as suggested previously for chicken LBR (Fig. 3) (13Nikolakaki E. Meier J. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6208-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Incomplete digestion by trypsin may also have been involved. GST itself was not phosphorylated at all (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that SRPK in SC phosphorylates GST-NK and stimulates the binding to chromatin.Fig. 2Effect of affinity depletion of SRPK from SC on its ability to stimulate the binding of GST-NK to chromatin. To remove SRPK from SC, 20 μl of SC was pretreated with 5 μl of SF2 beads at 4 °C for 1 h. GST-NK beads were incubated with extraction buffer (1), SC (2), SC diluted with extraction buffer 1.25-fold (3), SC pretreated with blank GST beads (4) or SF2 beads (5), and SC pretreated with SF2 beads and subsequently mixed with 0.1 μg of SRPK1 (6). Then, the binding of chromatin was examined as in Fig. 1. Each column shows the mean ± S.D. (vertical bar) for three experiments. * indicates a significant difference from the respective control (p < 0.05). Dep., depleted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of GST-NK treated with SC, SC depleted of SRPK, and SRPK1. Beads bearing 20 μg of GST-NK were incubated with 20 μl of SC (SC), SC depleted of SRPK (Dep.SC), or 0.1 μg of SRPK1 in extraction buffer (SRPK1) supplemented with 2 μl of 3.3 μm [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol) at 23 °C for 1 h. The thus treated proteins were subjected to phosphopeptide mapping as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptides were separated by electrophoresis (horizontal direction, cathode to the left) and by ascending chromatography. The points of sample application are near the bottom left corners.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the next step, we examined the change in the binding affinity of LBR to chromatin on the transition from the S-phase to the M-phase. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the stimulated binding of GST-NK to chromatin on treatment with SC was suppressed by subsequent treatment with MC (compare columns 2 and 3 in Fig. 4). We suggested previously that the suppression is caused by phosphorylation (6Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid had no effect on the suppression (data not shown). To clarify the kinase(s) participating in the suppression, we examined various kinase inhibitors. The kinase(s) responsible for the suppression was sensitive to inhibitors with broad specificity, i.e. staurosporine and DMAP (Fig. 4, columns 4 and 5). The 50% inhibition value for the suppression by staurosporine was 5 ± 2 nm (n = 3, data not shown). Complete depletion of ATP from the reaction mixture by pretreatment with apyrase also inhibited the suppression (data not shown). When specific inhibitors of cdc2 kinase, protein kinase A, and PKC were examined, a cdc2 kinase inhibitor, roscovitine, showed partial inhibition of the suppression, although the other inhibitors had no effect (Fig. 4, columns 6-8). An inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, i.e. EGTA, had no effect on the suppression (data not shown). These results suggested that multiple kinases including cdc2 kinase participate in the suppression. Then, to further clarify the participation of cdc2 kinase in the suppression, a mutant GST-NK, GST-NK(S71A), of which the major phosphorylation site serine for cdc2 kinase (13Nikolakaki E. Meier J. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6208-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was substituted by alanine, was used instead of wild-type GST-NK. As can be seen in Fig. 4, columns 9-12, the binding of mutant protein GST-NK(S71A) was partially suppressed by MC treatment, and the suppression was insensitive to roscovitine (compare columns 11 and 12 in Fig. 4). These results supported the idea that phosphorylation of serine 71 by cdc2 kinase participates in the suppression of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin. To verify the participation of cdc2 kinase, affinity-depletion experiments on cdc2 kinase were carried out. As can be seen in Fig. 5, when MC was affinity-depleted of cdc2 kinase using p13 beads, the SC partially lost the ability to suppress the binding of GST-NK to chromatin (compare columns 3 and 6 in Fig. 5A). Subsequent addition of authentic cdc2 kinase to the cdc2 kinase-depleted MC restored its ability to suppress the binding (Fig. 5A, column 7). These results clearly indicate that cdc2 kinase is responsible for a part of the suppression of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin.Fig. 5Effect of treatment with cdc2 kinase-depleted MC on the chromatin binding of GST-NK pretreated with SC. A, GST-NK beads were pretreated with extraction buffer (1) or SC (2-7). These beads were subsequently treated with extraction buffer (1), SC (2), MC (3), MC + 1 mm roscovitine (Rosco.) (4), MC treated with blank beads (5), MC treated with p13 beads to deplete cdc2 kinase (6), and MC treated with p13 beads and subsequently mixed with cdc2 kinase (7). Then, the binding to chromatin was examined as in Fig. 1. Each column shows the mean ± S.D. (vertical bar) for three experiments. * indicates a significant difference from the respective control (p < 0.05). dep., depleted. B, confirmation of depletion of cdc2 kinase from MC with p13 beads. MC was treated with p13 beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then, the proteins bound to beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (First, p13). The p13 bead treatment was repeated once more for the thus treated MC, and then the proteins bound to beads were analyzed (Second, p13). For mock treatment, blank Sepharose beads were used instead of p13 beads (First, Mock and Second, Mock). The cdc2 kinase band was identified by co-electrophoresis of authentic cdc2 kinase. These results show that the cdc2 kinase in MC was fully removed by the first treatment with p13 beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphopeptide mapping was carried out to compare the phosphorylation sites of GST-NK after treatment with SC, MC, SC followed by MC, cdc2 kinase, and PKC (Fig. 6). When GST-NK was treated with cdc2 kinase (Fig. 6, cdc2), two major spots (c and e) and three minor ones (a, b, and d) were observed. On the other hand, when GST-NK(S71A) was phosphorylated with cdc2 kinase (Fig. 6, cdc2/S71A), the two major spots observed for cdc2 disappeared. Therefore, the two major spots that disappeared should represent tryptic peptides containing serine 71, and the serine should be phosphorylated. Based on the amino acid sequence of LBR, the relative positions of spots c and e (Fig. 6), and the substrate specificity of trypsin, spots c and e could be considered to be peptides phosphorylated at serine 71 comprising amino acid residues 65-75, GGSTSSSPSRR, and residues 65-74, GGSTSSSPSR, of LBR, respectively. Furthermore, when autoradiography films of cdc2 and MC (Fig. 6) obtained on the same day were superposed, spots a, b, c, d, and e completely coincided with spots 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that these matching spots contain the same phosphopeptides. The phosphopeptide map of GST-NK treated with PKC (Fig. 6, PKC) showed a single spot, f, which overlapped spot 6 in Fig. 6 (MC). Phosphopeptide maps obtained for GST-NK treated with MC (Fig. 6, MC) and with SC and subsequently MC (SC-MC) were very similar to each other, although the patterns were very complicated. Spot 7 (Fig. 6) appeared irregular. When the patterns of SC-MC and SC (Fig. 6) were compared, spots 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12 seemed to be relatively enhanced by the treatment with MC. For SC-MC (Fig. 6), spots 4 and 8, which correspond to spots c and e for cdc2, indeed incorporated a little more 32P than in the case of SC. Moreover, when MC and SC-MC were compared with SC (Fig. 6), MC and SC-MC treatments were seen to clearly stimulate 32P incorporation into spots 12 and 10. When GST-NK was treated with MC in the presence of a specific inhibitor of cdc2 kinase (Fig. 6, MC+Rosco.), spots 12 and 10 disappeared. Moreover, when GST-NK(S71A) was treated with MC (Fig. 6, MC/S71A), spot 12 disappeared, and 32P incorporation into spot 10 decreased to the level in SC. These results suggested that the peptides corresponding to spots 12 and 10 (Fig. 6) contained serine 71 and were phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase in MC. The differences in the positions of major phosphopeptides observed on treatment with authentic cdc2 kinase, i.e. spots c and e for cdc2 (Fig. 6), compared with those obtained with cdc2 kinase on MC treatment, i.e. spots 12 and 10 for MC and SC-MC, could be explained as follows. The peptides in spots c and e (Fig. 6), which contained phosphorylated serine 71, incorporated a second phosphate group, and thus these peptides shifted to spots 12 and 10, respectively. From the results of the above experiments involving protein kinase inhibitors and mutant GST-NK, it was suggested that SRPK in SC and cdc2 kinase in MC participate in the stimulation and suppression of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin, respectively. Then we verified these results by reconstitution of the regulation system with the purified enzymes (Fig. 7). When GST-NK was treated with purified SRPK1 instead of SC, a similar increase in the chromatin binding was observed (compare columns 2 and 3 in Fig. 7). On the other hand, when GST-NK pretreated with SC and SRPK1 was subsequently treated with purified cdc2 kinase, a similar decrease in the chromatin binding was observed (compare columns 5 and 6 in Fig. 7). These results clearly show that the stimulation and a part of the suppression of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin by SC and SC-MC can be reproduced with purified SRPK1 and cdc2 kinase, respectively. We showed previously that LBR binds to the DNA moiety of chromatin. Then, we examined whether the binding of LBR to DNA is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner or not by the DNA-cellulose method (Fig. 8). Pretreatment of GST-NK with SC had little effect on the binding to DNA-cellulose (compare Fig. 8, A1 and A2). The results may show that the stimulation of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin by pretreatment with SC (Figs. 1 and 7) depends on a specific configuration of DNA, as in chromatin (discussed in more detail below). On the other hand, the DNA binding of GST-NK was completely suppressed by SC-MC treatment, as in the case of chromatin binding (compare Fig. 8, A3 and A4). The results obtained in experiments involving a cdc2 kinase inhibitor, i.e. roscovitine, suggested that cdc2 kinase is responsible for a part of the suppression of the binding of GST-NK to DNA-cellulose (Fig. 8, A5-A9). Calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, had no effect on the binding (compare Fig. 8, A4 and A8). Similar results were obtained using GST-RS (amino acid residues 53-89) instead of GST-NK (amino acid residues 1-211) (compare Fig. 8, A and B). These results suggested that the binding of NK to DNA through the RS region was regulated by MC treatment. When GST-NK(S71A) was used instead of wild-type GST-NK, SC-MC treatment did not cause complete suppression of the binding to DNA-cellulose (Fig. 8, C4). All these results are consistent with the idea that the phosphorylation of serine 71 by cdc2 kinase in MC is responsible for a part of the suppression of the binding of GST-NK to DNA-cellulose. It was suggested in this study that SRPK in SC is responsible for the stimulation of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin, as judged with affinity depletion of SRPK from SC (Fig. 2), the addition of authentic SRPK to the SRPK-depleted SC (Fig. 2), and kinase inhibitors (Fig. 1). A specific inhibitor of SRPK also suppressed the stimulation of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin and the incorporation of 32P into GST-NK on treatment with SC. 2M. Takano, Y. Koyama, H. Ito, S. Hoshino, H. Onogi, M. Hagiwara, K. Furukawa, and T. Horigome, unpublished observations. Phosphorylation of GST-NK by SC and authentic SRPK caused similar stimulation of the binding and gave similar phosphopeptide maps (Figs. 1, 3, and 7). From these results we concluded that the kinase in SC responsible for the stimulation of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin is SRPK. When the chicken LBR amino-terminal region (cGST-wtNt), which corresponds to the human GST-NK used in this study, was treated with either SRPK1 or an SR protein kinase, a very similar phosphopeptide map to that of GST-NK treated with SC or SRPK1 was obtained (14Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Giannakouros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cGST-wtNt by SRPK1 and the SR protein kinase was completely suppressed when the RS repeat motifs in cGST-wtNt, which correspond to amino acid residues 79-86 (RSRSRSRS) of human LBR, were deleted (14Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Giannakouros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was suggested that serine residues within the repeat motifs in cGST-wtNt were alternatively phosphorylated by the SR protein kinase (18Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, in human LBR, the most possible site of phosphorylation by RS protein kinase in a cytosol fraction and SRPK1 is Ser-80, Ser-82, Ser-84, or Ser-86, and the phosphorylation of any of these residues may cause stimulation of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin. It was shown in this study that the phosphorylation of the RS region (amino acid residues 53-89) of LBR by SRPK in SC stimulates the binding of LBR to chromatin (Fig. 1). However, the binding to DNA-cellulose was not stimulated by the phosphorylation (Fig. 8). It is known that the amino-terminal domain of LBR recognizes DNA curvature and supercoiling and binds to the structures with enhanced affinity (19Duband-Goulet I. Courvalin J.-C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6483-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, a specific configuration of DNA, as in chromatin, may be required for the stimulated binding of SC-treated GST-NK. However, the participation of the protein moieties of chromatin directly in the enhanced binding cannot be excluded. It has been reported that in vivo phosphorylation of splicing factors having SR repeats by SRPK in HeLa cells is cell cycle-dependent and that these factors were phosphorylated 3- to 5-fold more in M-phase than in I-phase cells (20Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the RS protein, LBR, in chicken hepatoma cells, DU249, the level of phosphorylation was similar in I-phase and M-phase cells in vivo (13Nikolakaki E. Meier J. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6208-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In our cell-free system involving Xenopus egg cytosol fractions, the level of phosphorylation of LBR by SRPK was similar in S-phase and M-phase extracts (data not shown). Therefore, in the case of LBR, stimulation of the binding to chromatin by SRPK seemed to be cell cycle-independent. It has been shown that overexpression of SRPK in mammalian cells causes disassembly of nuclear speckles (21Kuroyanagi N. Onogi H. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is also known that the formation of a complex between an SR protein, SF2/ASF, and SRPK, which is influenced by the phosphorylation state of SF2/ASF, plays regulatory roles in the assembly and localization of the splicing factor (16Koizumi J. Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11125-11131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Wang H.-Y. Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the case of LBR, phosphorylation of LBR by an LBR-associated RS kinase in turkey erythrocyte nuclear envelopes abolishes the binding of p32/p34 (18Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation by a similar SRPK in a Xenopus egg extract stimulated the binding of LBR to chromatin (Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, phosphorylation of LBR by SRPK may regulate or maintain interactions in vivo among components in the LBR complex containing chromatin. Phosphorylation of GST-NK by cdc2 kinase in MC caused partial suppression of the binding to chromatin (Figs. 4 and 5). Direct phosphorylation of serine 71 in LBR by cdc2 kinase in MC could be explained by the phosphopeptide maps, although the patterns were complicated (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of GST-NK by SRPK in MC was also observed (compare Figs. 3 and 6). Suppression of the binding of LBR to chromatin on treatment with MC could not be fully explained by cdc2 kinase, suggesting the presence of another kinase(s) that participates in the suppression (Figs. 4 and 5). Which spot in the phosphopeptide maps in Fig. 6 corresponds to the phosphorylation by the kinase is not clear. However, one possible explanation is as follows; spots 10 and 12 (Fig. 6) contain peptides having two molar phosphate groups/molar peptide, and their phosphate groups are transferred by cdc2 kinase and the other kinase. The kinase of interest is sensitive to staurosporine and DMAP (Fig. 4). Pfaller and Newport (23Pfaller R. Newport J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19066-19072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that both cdc2 kinase and “membrane release kinase” are necessary to release nuclear membrane vesicles from the chromatin surface in a Xenopus egg extract system. They partially purified the kinase (23Pfaller R. Newport J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19066-19072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The membrane release kinase phosphorylates an approximately 60-kDa protein in a Xenopus egg membrane fraction (23Pfaller R. Newport J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19066-19072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The kinase is inhibited by DMAP but not by specific inhibitors for known kinases such as protein kinase A, PKC, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (23Pfaller R. Newport J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19066-19072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All these characteristics are the same as those of our kinase, that is, our kinase phosphorylates 60-kDa nuclear envelope protein LBR and is inhibited by DMAP (Fig. 4) but not by specific inhibitors for protein kinase A, PKC, and calmodulin-dependent kinase (Fig. 4). Moreover, the membrane release kinase acts with cdc2 kinase in vesicle release (23Pfaller R. Newport J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19066-19072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and our kinase suppresses the binding of GST-NK to chromatin with cdc2 kinase. Therefore, the kinase working with cdc2 kinase for suppression of the binding of GST-NK to chromatin is very likely the same enzyme as this membrane release kinase. In living cells, LBR, LAP2, emerin, and other inner nuclear membrane proteins have to dissociate from chromatin in the prometaphase to early anaphase of the cell cycle. It was suggested in this study that the binding of LBR to chromatin is suppressed by the phosphorylation of serine 71 by cdc2 kinase and some other residue by a kinase similar to membrane release kinase in MC. However, the kinases responsible for the regulation of the binding of other inner nuclear membrane proteins to chromatin are not yet known. Identification of these kinases is very important for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying nuclear envelope disassembly."

Overexpression of P450s in yeast and cultured cells produces a similar response. The signals mediating this process are not known but probably involve signal transduction pathways involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) or the ER overload response (EOR). We have examined the temporal response of specific genes in these pathways and genes globally to overexpression of P450 in cultured cells. Activity of NFκB, an EOR component, was substantially increased by overexpression of full-length P450 2C2 or a chimera with the 28-amino acid signal anchor sequence of P450 2C2 in HepG2 cells, and the activation correlated temporally with the accumulation of P450 in the cells. In the UPR pathway, activation of the transcription factor XBP1 by IRE1 also correlated with the accumulation of P450 in the cells, and in contrast, maximum activation of the BiP/grp78 promoter preceded the accumulation. Differential effects of expression of P450 on apoptosis were observed in nonhepatic COS1 and hepatic HepG2 cells. In COS1 cells, apoptosis was induced, and this correlated with sustained activation of the pro-apoptotic JNK pathway, induction of CHOP, and an absence of the increased NFκB activity. In HepG2 cells, JNK was only transiently activated, and CHOP expression was not induced. As assessed by DNA microarray analysis, up-regulation of signaling genes was predominant including those involved in anti-apoptosis and ER stress. These results suggest that both the EOR and UPR pathways are involved in the cellular response to induction of P450 expression and that in hepatic cells genes are also induced to block apoptosis, which may be a physiologically relevant response to prevent cell death during xenobiotic induced expression of P450 in the liver.

Conditions that affect ER homeostasis, or ER stress, may have dire consequences for the survival of cells and may induce one of several signal transduction pathways. Accumulation of misfolded proteins, increased secretory load, glucose deprivation, or perturbations of calcium homeostasis activates an intracellular signaling pathway referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Google Scholar, 2Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Google Scholar, 3Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Google Scholar). Although different stress inducers use diverse pathways to activate selected target genes, there is considerable cross-talk between the pathways. Common targets include molecular chaperones, folding enzymes, and genes with promoters that contain a cis-acting element known as the ER stress-response element (ERSE) (1Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Google Scholar, 2Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, ER stress-activated signal transduction is mediated by three ER transmembrane proteins as follows: 1) transcriptional activator ATF6, which upon ER stress is proteolytically released from the membrane and up-regulates ERSE-containing promoters; 2) translation initiation factor 2 kinase, PERK, which mainly attenuates translation, slowing down the accumulation of ER proteins and allowing the ER to accommodate its cargo load; and 3) the transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1 (4Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Google Scholar, 5Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Google Scholar, 6Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J.

Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Google Scholar). The luminal domain of IRE1 is the proximal sensor of misfolded protein accumulation, which induces activation of IRE1 via oligomerization and autophosphorylation (2Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Google Scholar). Activation of IRE1 up-regulates molecular chaperones, but under severe stress it also activates the c-JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK), part of the apoptotic pathway (9Urano F. Wang X.Z. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). Similarly to its yeast analog, the cytosolic domain of activated IRE1 acts also as an endonuclease/ligase, splicing the mRNA of the transcriptionally inactive protein XBP1 (x box-binding protein), leading to the formation of a potent bZIP transcriptional activator (7Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Google Scholar, 8Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J.

Although in yeast, IRE1 and its spliced product HAC play a central role in UPR, in mammalian cells its role in ER stress response is less clear, because in IRE1 null cells unimpaired UPR and up-regulation of chaperones occur (8Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Google Scholar, 9Urano F. Wang X.Z. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P.

Overexpression of certain membrane proteins, like hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, induces smooth ER proliferation without UPR activation (15Larson L.L. Parrish M.L. Koning A.J. Wright R.L. Yeasts. 2002; 19: 373-393Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of cytochrome P450 in yeast does induce UPR and activation of chaperones (16Menzel R. Kargel E. Vogel F. Bottcher C. Schunck W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 97-109Google Scholar, 17Menzel R. Vogel F. Kargel E. Schunck W.H. Yeasts. 1997; 13: 1211-1229Google Scholar, 18Takewaka T. Zimmer T. Hirata A. Takagi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 507-514Google Scholar). EOR has been shown to activate the transcription factor NFκB (19Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Google Scholar, 20Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar, 21Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Google Scholar); however, the mechanism connecting the ER overload detection to the transcriptional activation in the nucleus is not understood, and both reactive oxygen species and ER-released calcium have been suggested as mediators connecting ER stress with the NFκB activation (1Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Google Scholar, 19Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Google Scholar, 20Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar).Because NFκB plays a major role in inflammatory and immune responses, EOR caused by accumulation of viral proteins may represent an antiviral immune response (19Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Google Scholar). Pathological ER accumulation of non-viral proteins, which occurs in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's, or hereditary emphysema, is often associated with inflammation (21Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Google Scholar). The inflammation may be related to activation of NFκB and its role in inflammatory responses. However, it is not known whether NFκB activation plays a role in ER-nucleus signal transduction leading to an expansion of the ER in response to physiological stimuli, such as increased secretory activity or induction of microsomal enzymes.Microsomal cytochromes P450 (P450) are highly inducible enzymes, whose ER accumulation results in extensive proliferation of smooth ER membranes (16Menzel R. Kargel E. Vogel F. Bottcher C. Schunck W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 97-109Google Scholar, 17Menzel R. Vogel F. Kargel E. Schunck W.H.

Biol. 1991; 55: 336-345Google Scholar), but the mechanism and signals involved in this process are not known. It is conceivable that ER accumulation of P450s activates not only EOR, but also a general ER stress response, like the UPR. If so, then changes might be expected in expression of genes enhancing ER folding capacity or in ER-nucleus signal transduction pathway genes that are responsible for membrane biosynthesis, cell survival, and adaptation to the changing size and content of the ER.In the current study we have undertaken several approaches to analyze the cellular response, and the signals involved, to the accumulation of P450 2C2 in transiently transfected cells. Based on our biochemical studies and DNA microarray analysis, we conclude that there is a time-dependent switch from the early activation of ER stress-inducible chaperones and the JNK pathway followed by a delayed activation of NFκB in HepG2 cells. NFκB may have a role in regulating apoptosis-related genes to allow cell survival. The kinetics of splicing and up-regulation of transcription factor XBP1 parallels that of the NFκB activation and is correlated with the kinetics of P450 accumulation, consistent with its possible involvement in sustained ER expansion. Furthermore, by using DNA microarray analysis, we show that a significant number of the P450 up-regulated genes contain in their promoters potential binding sites for NFκB and XBP1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Tissue culture materials were purchased from Invitrogen. The enhanced GFP vector was from Clontech. The pNFκB-luciferase reporter plasmid, which contains five copies of the NFκB-binding site, was from Stratagene. The pBiP-luciferase reporter plasmid (6Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Google Scholar, 24Chang S.C. Wooden S.K. Nakaki T. Kim Y.K. Lin A.Y. Kung L. Attenello J.W. Lee A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 680-684Google Scholar) contains the rat grp78 (BiP) promoter region -457 to -39. Construction of all the P450 chimeras was described previously (25Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45009-45014Google Scholar). The phRK-TK reporter vector and dual luciferase reporter activity assay kit were from Promega. PJNK antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.RT-PCR—RNA was prepared from transfected cells cultured on 6-well plates with the Qiagen RNeasy kit and used in RT-PCR performed with the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). The following sets of primers were used for the PCR amplifications: for BiP, 5′-ATCACGCCGTCCTATGTCGC-3′ and 5′-TCTCCCCCTCCCTCTTATCC-3′; for actin, 5′-TCCTCACCCTGAAGTACCCC-3′ and 5′-CTCTTGCTCGAAGTCCAGGG-3′; for CHOP, 5′-AGTCATTGCCTTTCTCTTCG-3′ and 5′-GGTGCAGATTCACCATTCGG-3′; and for xbp1, 5′-CCTTGTAGTTGAGAACCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGCTTGGTATATATGTGG-3′.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—COS1 and HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and transfected with Lipofectamine, as described previously (26Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Google Scholar, 27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45009-45014Google Scholar). For luciferase reporter assays, cells were transfected on 24-well plates with the amounts of DNA indicated in the figures legends. For mock transfections and to compensate for the differences in the total DNA used, pCMV5 vector DNA was added. The assays were performed using the dual-luciferase reporter 1000 assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Relative luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity.JNK Activation Assay—Cells transfected on 6-well plates were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer, and the lysates were clarified by 10 min of centrifugation. The protein concentration was measured with Micro-BCA reagents (Pierce). Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blots probed with anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody and the horseradish peroxidase SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce).Fluorescent Protein Concentration Assay—To measure the concentration of C2/GFP chimera in transfected cells, cells cultured in 6-well plates were washed with PBS, scraped, and collected by brief centrifugation. After additional washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and used for spectrofluorimetry, as described (28Szczesna-Skorupa E. Mallah B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31269-31276Google Scholar).Analysis of Cell Viability—Apoptosis in transfected cells was analyzed by assaying plasma membrane permeability to Hoechst 33342 dye and flow cytometry (29Dive C. Gregory C.D. Phipps D.J. Evans D.L. Milner A.E. Wyllie A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1133: 275-282Google Scholar). Transfected cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and, after adding Hoechst 33342 solution to a final concentration of 0.9 μg/ml, were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, after which propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 0.6 μg/ml, and the incubation was continued for 5 min on ice. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with UV excitation at 351 nm, emission band pass filter 450/65, for Hoechst 33342 detection and 488 nm, 630/30 filter, for propidium iodide detection.cDNA Microarray Analysis—Total RNA from transfected HepG2 cells was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized with 5–8 μg of total RNA using the T7-oligo(dT) primer (Genset Oligos, Boulder, CO) and the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers' protocols. Precipitated double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for cRNA synthesis with the BioArray RNA transcript labeling kit with Bio-11-CTP and Bio-16-UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). Biotin-labeled cRNA was then purified (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), fragmented, and hybridized to the HumU133A oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Fluorescence intensities were measured with the GeneArray scanner. Affymetrix chip data (HG-U133A) were generated from two mock- and two P450-transfected samples from two different transfections. Gene expression ratios of P450- versus mock-transfected samples for each set were measured by the PFOLD algorithm (30Theilhaber J. Bushnell S. Jackson A. Fuchs R. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 585-614Google Scholar) that is derived from a Bayesian estimation scheme for estimating the fold change of gene expression.Searching for the Transcription Factors-binding Sites in the Promoter Sequences—Putative promoters of human transcripts were retrieved from Ensembl (www.ensembl.org) based on their transcript and protein annotation. A putative promoter sequence is defined as a 1.5-kb upstream sequence including start codon ATG when the ATG is within the first exon. A total of 22,867 putative promoter sequences were searched for XBP1 and NFκB-binding sites using a pattern matching program written in Perl. 2H. Liu, unpublished data. RESULTSActivation of NFκB in HepG2 Cells—P450 2C2 is inserted into the ER membranes via its amino-terminal signal-anchor sequence, which also mediates its direct ER retention, leaving the major catalytic domain of the protein on the cytosolic side of the membrane (31Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Google Scholar). By using transiently transfected cells and immunomicroscopy, we have observed that increasing levels of this protein in the ER membranes induce significant expansion of this compartment (not shown). Because this process most likely induces EOR, we first wanted to establish whether in analogy with previously studied ER retained proteins (19Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Google Scholar, 20Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar, 21Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Google Scholar), P450 accumulation also activates transcription factor NFκB.To analyze activation of NFκB in cells expressing P450 2C2, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with plasmid encoding a firefly luciferase reporter gene fused to five NFκB recognition sites in the promoter region. We have shown before, using chimeras of different P450 domains and GFP, that although full-length C2/GFP and C1–28/GFP (containing the amino-terminal 28- amino acid signal-anchor transmembrane region) are directly retained in the ER (excluded from the transport vesicles), C1–21/GFP, with the short juxtamembrane linker region deleted, recycles through the retrieval pathway (26Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Google Scholar). We thus also tested whether these P450-GFP chimeras induce NFκB to the same level.As Fig. 1 shows, 24 h after transfection, transcriptional activity of NFκB in transfected HepG2 cells was strongly enhanced in a DNA concentration-dependent manner. The level of the activation in cells expressing full-length C2/GFP was the same as in the cells expressing C2 (amino acids 1–490) without the GFP tag, encoded by plasmid C2/CMV5 (31Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Google Scholar), so that GFP was not responsible for NFκB activation. Although all three of the chimeras activated NFκB, activation was lowest in cells expressing C1–21/GFP. This suggests that either the juxtamembrane linker (amino acids 22–28) contributes to the response or that EOR is weaker when proteins accumulating in the ER undergo transport to the intermediate compartment. Consistent with the second possibility, we have also observed that activation of NFκB in cells expressing P450 2E1, which unlike P450 2C2 can be packaged into the transport vesicles and enters the retrieval pathway (32Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.-D. Kemper B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 128-136Google Scholar), is about half of that observed with 2C2 (not shown).The importance of ER retention for NFκB activation is demonstrated by only marginal up-regulation of NFκB in cells expressing the chimera EGC (Fig. 1). This chimera consists of the ER-targeting secretory signal sequence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), followed by GFP, and has the 2C2 TM-(1–28) at its carboxyl terminus (25Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Google Scholar). We have shown previously that this protein is not retained in the ER but is transported to the cell surface, because the ER retention signal of the C2 TM-(1–28) is not functional in the carboxyl-terminal location (25Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Google Scholar, 27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45009-45014Google Scholar, 31Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Google Scholar). These results establish that whereas ER retention is required for the activation of NFκB, activation is not dependent on the expression of the full-length enzymatically active P450, as similar up-regulation is observed with chimera containing only C2 TM-(1–28), nor on the presence of the TM-(1–28), which is present in EGC. Furthermore, the lack of NFκB activation by the EGC protein, which is transported to the cell surface, is consistent with the up-regulation of NFκBby the accumulation of an integral ER membrane protein, rather than by an increase in the load of the secretory pathway.Time Course of NFκB and BiP Activation in Transfected HepG2 Cells—To establish if activation of NFκB represents an early ER stress response similar to UPR-activated factors, we analyzed the time course of NFκB activation in HepG2 cells transfected with the full-length P450 2C2. Activation of NFκB was minimal at the early time points (7 h after transfection) but continuously increased after that, reaching a maximum between 24 and 48 h after transfection (Fig. 2). In contrast, activation of the ERSE-containing BiP/grp78 promoter (promoter of the rat grp78 gene attached to the luciferase reporter) was already 20% of its maximum at 7 h after transfection, reached a peak by 16 h, and subsequently slightly decreased to about 50% of its peak by 48 h (Fig. 2). Induction of the BiP/grp78 promoter is a general response to ER stress, part of the UPR pathway, and is mostly mediated by the transcription factor ATF6 (5Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Google Scholar). ATF6 is activated via proteolysis, which permits a rapid response to ER stress. This suggests that unlike the rapid induction of UPR, activation of NFκB is delayed and more closely parallels the increase of P450 levels (Fig. 2), so that it is probably triggered by a pronounced accumulation of P450 in the ER, as might be expected for an EOR.Fig. 2Time course of the transcriptional activation of BiP/grp78 and NFκB promoters and of C2/GFP accumulation in transfected HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with phRK-Tk (0.1 ng), 25 ng of either NFκB/luciferase vector DNA or BiP/luciferase vector DNA, and 100 ng of C2/GFP vector DNA for luciferase activity assays, or with 100 ng of C2/GFP vector DNA only for fluorescent protein quantification (bottom panel). At the indicated times after transfection, luciferase activity was measured and presented as in Fig. 1, and the fluorescence of C2/GFP in transfected cells was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Black and gray bars indicate P450- or mock-transfected cells, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activation of CHOP and JNK Pathway in HepG2 and COS1 Cells—Continuous stress to cells can trigger apoptosis presumably to protect the organism from the deleterious effects of damaged cells. Apoptosis in response to the expansion of ER membrane as a result of accumulation of pathological proteins, for example, could be beneficial. In the case of P450 induction, however, a normal protein is accumulated in the ER that is part of a cellular defense against toxic chemicals in the body. In this case, apoptosis would be counterproductive. NFκB has been shown to play a role in the regulation of the programmed cell death pathway (apoptosis) (33May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Google Scholar), so it seemed possible that its activation in cells overexpressing P450 contributes to the survival of these cells. Preliminary studies using immunoelectron microscopy showed that although the expression of P450 in both HepG2 and COS1 cells induces strong ER proliferation, COS1 cells, but not HepG2 cells, even within 18 h after transfection, showed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (data not shown). Further analysis by flow cytometry of transfected COS1 cells in which nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye and propidium iodide demonstrated apoptosis in about 30–35% of P450-expressing COS1 cells 24 h after transfection. We thus considered the possibility that this effect may be related to a potential difference in NFκB activation in the two cell lines, if a function of NFκB in the EOR is antiapoptotic (33May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Google Scholar). Indeed, there was no detectable activation of the NFκB promoter in COS1 cells transfected with P450 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a dose-dependent activation of the BiP promoter in transfected COS1 cells was similar to that in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, transfected COS1 cells mount a UPR but are unable to activate NFκB, which is correlated with increased apoptosis.Fig. 3The effect of P450 2C2 overexpression in COS1 cells on the transactivation of NFκB (A) and BiP/grp78 (B). COS1 cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of C2/GFP vector DNA and the appropriate reporter vector DNA, as in Fig. 1. 24 h after transfection luciferase activity assays were performed and are presented as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)During the ER stress response, cells can activate death pathways by activating an ER-localized caspase 12, by activating the JNK signaling pathway, or by inducing the gene for the transcription factor CHOP (also known as GADD153), which is mediated by ATF6 and PERK (1Kaufman R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2036005982,"Dimorphecolic acid (9-OH-18:2Δ10trans,12trans) is the major fatty acid of seeds of Dimorphotheca species. This fatty acid contains structural features that are not typically found in plant fatty acids, including a C-9 hydroxyl group, Δ10,Δ12-conjugated double bonds, and trans-Δ12 unsaturation. Expressed sequence tag analysis was conducted to determine the biosynthetic origin of dimorphecolic acid. cDNAs for two divergent forms of Δ12-oleic acid desaturase, designated DsFAD2-1 and Ds-FAD2-2, were identified among expressed sequence tags generated from developing Dimorphotheca sinuata seeds. Expression of DsFAD2-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and soybean somatic embryos resulted in the accumulation of the trans-Δ12 isomer of linoleic acid (18: 2Δ9cis,12trans) rather than the more typical cis-Δ12 isomer. When co-expressed with DsFAD2-1 in soybean embryos or yeast, DsFAD2-2 converted 18:2Δ9cis,12trans into dimorphecolic acid. When DsFAD2-2 was expressed alone in soybean embryos or together with a typical cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturase in yeast, trace amounts of the cis-Δ12 isomer of dimorphecolic acid (9-OH-18:2Δ9cis,12cis) were formed from DsFAD2-2 activity with cis-Δ12-linoleic acid. These results indicate that DsFAD2-2 catalyzes the conversion of the Δ9 double bond of linoleic acid into a C-9 hydroxyl group and Δ10trans double bond and displays a substrate preference for the trans-Δ12, rather than the cis-Δ12, isomer of linoleic acid. Overall these data are consistent with a biosynthetic pathway of dimorphecolic acid involving the concerted activities of DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2. The evolution of two divergent Δ12-oleic acid desaturases for the biosynthesis of an unusual fatty acid is unprecedented in plants.

Dimorphecolic acid (9-OH-18:2Δ10trans,12trans) 1Fatty acid nomenclature: X:Y indicates that the fatty acid contains X number of carbon atoms and Y number of double bonds. Δz indicates that a double bond is located at the zth carbon atom relative to the carboxyl end of the fatty acid. is an unusual C18 fatty acid that can comprise more than 60% of the seed oil of Dimorphotheca species (1Smith Jr., C.R. Wilson T.L. Melvin E.H. Wolff I.A. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 1417-1421Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This fatty acid has received attention because of its potential value for industrial applications. For example, the chemical functionalities resulting from its C-9 hydroxyl group and conjugated Δ10,Δ12 double bonds make dimorphecolic acid useful in the manufacture of paints, inks, lubricants, plastics, and nylon (2Hof L. Janick J. Progress in New Crops. American Society of Horticultural Science Press, Arlington, VA1996: 372-377Google Scholar, 3Muuse B.G. Cuperus F.P. Derksen J.T.P. Ind. Crops Prod. 1992; 1: 57-65Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathway of dimorphecolic acid has not been previously determined. This fatty acid would appear to be of complex biosynthetic origin given the presence of three structural features that are not typically found in plant fatty acids: (i) a C-9 hydroxyl group, (ii) conjugated Δ10,Δ12 double bonds, and (iii) a trans-Δ12 double bond. With regard to the trans-Δ12 double bond, Morris and Marshall (4Morris L.J. Marshall M.O. Chem. Ind. August 27. 1966; : 1493-1494Google Scholar) reported nearly 40 years ago that the unusual Δ9cis,12trans isomer of linoleic acid (18:2) comprises more than 1% of the fatty acids of Dimorphotheca sinuata seeds. Based on this finding, these researchers proposed that 18:2Δ9cis,12trans is the precursor of dimorphecolic acid rather than the more commonly occurring 18:2Δ9cis,12cis. This initial step in the synthesis of dimorphecolic acid would therefore require an unusual enzymatic activity that generates a trans-Δ12 double bond instead of the cis-Δ12 double bond that is normally formed by the Δ12-oleic acid desaturase (FAD2) 2The abbreviations used are: FAD2, Δ12-oleic acid desaturase; EST, expressed sequence tag; TMS, trimethylsilyl; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. in plants. When considering the possible biosynthetic origin of the C-9 hydroxyl group and the Δ10 double bond of dimorphecolic acid, it should be noted that the Dimorphotheca genus is taxonomically closely related to the Calendula genus in the plant kingdom. Both genera are members of the Calendulae tribe of the Asteraceae family. Seeds of Calendula sp. produce large amounts of calendic acid (18:3Δ8trans,10trans,12cis), an unusual conjugated fatty acid that has some structural similarity to dimorphecolic acid (5McClean J. Clark A.H. J. Chem. Soc. 1956; 1956: 777-778Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that calendic acid is formed by the conversion of Δ9 double bond of linoleic acid to conjugated Δ8,Δ10 double bonds by the activity of a divergent form of FAD2 (6Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Qiu X. Reed D.W. Hong H. MacKensie S.L. Covello P.S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This enzyme, which has been termed a “Δ9-fatty acid conjugase,” is believed to catalyze the removal of hydrogen atoms from the C-8 and C-11 atoms that flank the Δ9 double bond of linoleic acid (8Reed D.W. Savile C.K. Qiu X. Buist P.H. Covello P.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5024-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given the close taxonomic relation of the Calendula and Dimorphotheca genera, it can be speculated that the C-9 hydroxyl group and trans-Δ10 double bond of dimorphecolic acid arise from modification of the Δ9 double bond of 18:2Δ9cis,12trans by the activity of an enzyme that is structurally and functionally related to the Calendula Δ9-fatty acid conjugase. Based on this line of reasoning, the biosynthetic pathway of dimorphecolic acid would involve two specialized enzymes: (i) an enzyme that initially generates the trans-Δ12 double bond of 18:2Δ9cis,12trans and (ii) an enzyme that subsequently converts the Δ9 double bond of 18:2Δ9cis,12trans into a C-9 hydroxyl group and Δ10trans double bond to form dimorphecolic acid. In this study, an expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of developing D. sinuata seeds was conducted to provide direct evidence for the biosynthetic origin of dimorphecolic acid. This functional genomic approach has proven to be a powerful method for the identification of enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of unusual fatty acids in plants, including Δ9- and Δ12-fatty acid conjugases (6Cahoon E.B.

As described here, EST analysis revealed the occurrence of two structurally divergent forms of FAD2 in D. sinuata seeds that were designated DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2.

The GenBank™ accession numbers for the DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 cDNAs are AY494986 and AY494985, respectively. Expression of DsFAD2-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—A full-length cDNA for DsFAD2-1 from the EST analysis above was linked as an EcoRI/XhoI fragment to the GAL1 promoter of the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid and the pYES2 vector lacking cDNA insert were introduced into S. cerevisiae YPH499 cells by lithium acetate-mediated transformation (13Geitz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnston J.A. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: Practical Approaches. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 121-134Google Scholar). Transformed cells were selected for their ability to grow on medium lacking uracil. Single colonies from the transformed cells were grown for 2 days at 28 °C in medium consisting of 0.08% (w/v) complete supplement mixture without uracil (CSM-URA, BIO101), 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 5% glycerol, and 0.5% dextrose. Cells were then washed twice in the same medium except that the glycerol and dextrose were replaced with galactose, which was added at a final concentration of 2% (w/v). The cells were diluted to A600 ≈ 0.2 in the galactose-containing medium and grown with shaking (310 rpm) for 24 h at 28 °C and then shifted to 22 °C until the cells reached A600 ≈ 4. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared from the cell pellets as described below. As a control for these experiments, a cDNA for a cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturase from Euphorbia lagascae (GenBank™ accession number AY486148) was expressed in S. cerevisiae under the growth conditions described above. The E. lagascae cDNA was linked to the GAL10 promoter of the expression vector pESC-URA (Stratagene) in the NotI/SacI restriction sites. DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 were co-expressed in S. cerevisiae by use of the pESC-HIS vector (Stratagene), which contains separate GAL1 and GAL10 promoters for expression of two genes. A full-length cDNA for DsFAD2-2 from the EST analysis was linked as a BamHI/XhoI fragment to the GAL1 promoter of pESC-HIS. The open reading frame of DsFAD2-1 was subsequently linked as a NotI fragment to the GAL10 promoter of the pESC-HIS plasmid containing the DsFAD2-2 cDNA. For this cloning step, the open reading frame of the DsFAD2-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a full-length cDNA identified in the EST study using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used for PCR were: 5′-TATGCGGCCGCAAATGGGAGCAGGAGGTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCATTACATCTTATTCTTGTACC-3′ (antisense). (Note that the underlined sequences correspond to the added NotI restriction sites.) The product was subcloned into the vector pCR-Script AMP SK(+) (Stratagene) prior to introduction in the yeast expression vector. A pESC-HIS-based plasmid was also constructed that contained the cDNA for the E. lagascae cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturase linked as a NotI-SacI fragment to the GAL10 promoter and the Ds-FAD2-2 cDNA linked as a BamHI/XhoI fragment to the GAL1 promoter. pESC-HIS-derived plasmids containing the DsFAD2-2 cDNA alone or in combination with the DsFAD2-1 cDNA or E. lagascae FAD2 cDNA were transformed into S. cerevisiae and grown as described. Expression of DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 in Soybean Somatic Embryos—For expression in somatic embryos of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill cv. Jack), the cDNAs for DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 were linked to promoter for the α′-subunit of β-conglycinin gene in the vector pKS67 (9Cahoon E.B. Carlson T.J. Ripp K.G. Schweiger B.J. Cook G.A. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12935-12940Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This promoter confers strong seed-specific expression of transgenes. The DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 cDNAs were introduced into pKS67 as NotI fragments following PCR amplification. The open reading frames of DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 were amplified by PCR from corresponding full-length cDNAs identified in the EST analysis described above. The open reading frame of DsFAd2-1 was amplified by use of the primers described above. The DsFAD2-2 open reading frame was amplified by using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGCGGCCGCAATGGGTGGAGGGATGGGAGCATCTGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAGCGGCCGCTGATTAATCAAGTCTTAG-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were subcloned into the intermediate vector pCR-Script AMP SK(+) (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DsFAD2-1- and DsFAD2-2-derived PCR products were then ligated as NotI fragments into the corresponding site of pKS67. In experiments involving the co-expression of Ds-FAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 in soybean somatic embryos, the DsFAD2-1-derived NotI fragment was linked to the promoter of the gene for the α′-subunit of β-conglycinin in the previously described vector pKS17 (14Cahoon E.B. Marillia E.-F. Stecca K.L. Hall S.E. Taylor D.C. Kinney A.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This soybean expression vector is identical to pKS67 except that it lacks a hygromycin resistance marker for selection of transgenic events. Gene fusions of the DsFAD2-1 or DsFAD2-2 cDNAs with the β-conglycinin promoter and phaseolin 3′ non-translated region in vector pKS67 were introduced into soybean somatic embryos by using particle bombardment (15Finer J.J. McMullen M.D. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 175-182Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Experiments were also conducted in which the DsFAD2-2 cDNA in pKS67 was co-transformed with the DsFAD2-1 cDNA in pKS17. In these experiments, the DsFAD2-1- and DsFAD2-2-containing plasmids were co-transformed at a molar ratio of 10:1 (Ds-FAD2-1:DsFAD2-2) of the two expression constructs. A similar cotransformation methodology has been reported previously (14Cahoon E.B. Marillia E.-F. Stecca K.L. Hall S.E. Taylor D.C. Kinney A.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Transgenic embryos were selected by hygromycin resistance conferred by the marker gene for hygromycin phosphotransferase in pKS67. Hygromycin-resistant embryos were propagated to maturity, and expression of the DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 transgenes was confirmed by using previously described protocols (6Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G.

Fatty Acid Analysis of S. cerevisiae and Soybean Somatic Embryos— Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared from S. cerevisiae cultures by direct transesterification of cell pellets in sodium methoxide/methanol (6Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The fatty acid methyl esters were then analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent 6890 chromatograph fitted with a DB-23 column (30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film; Agilent). The oven temperature was programmed from 185 °C (2-min hold) to 225 °C at 5 °C/min, and eluted fatty acid methyl esters were detected by flame ionization. The retention time of the 18:2 methyl ester produced by DsFAD2-1-expressing cells was compared with that of a standard mixture of cis-trans isomers of 18:2Δ9,12 methyl ester (Sigma). In addition, structural analysis of fatty acid methyl esters from yeast extracts was conducted by use of GC-mass spectrometry (MS) as described below for the analysis of soybean fatty acid methyl esters. The double bond positions of 16:2 and 18:2 isomers produced in S. cerevisiae were determined by GC-MS following conversion of fatty acids to diethylamide derivatives. Free fatty acids were initially prepared by saponification of cell pellets from S. cerevisiae cultures (grown as described above) in 1 ml of 0.6 n potassium hydroxide in methanol. Following a 1-h incubation at 70 °C, free fatty acids were extracted by partitioning the reaction with the addition of 0.9 ml of 1 n hydrochloric acid and 1 ml of chloroform. Fatty acids were recovered in the chloroform phase, dried under nitrogen, and then converted into diethylamide derivatives using the method described by Nilsson and Liljenberg (16Nilsson R. Liljenberg C. Phytochem. Anal. 1991; 2: 253-259Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The resulting fatty acid diethylamide derivatives were analyzed by GC-MS using an HP6890 interfaced with a HP5973 (Agilent) mass selective detector. Sample components were resolved with a DB-23 column, and the oven temperature was programmed from 185 °C (2-min hold) to 235 °C at 5 °C/min. Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared from soybean somatic embryos by transesterification in 1% (w/v) sodium methoxide in methanol as described previously (6Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Cahoon E.B. Carlson T.J. Ripp K.G. Schweiger B.J. Cook G.A. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12935-12940Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The recovered fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by GC with an Omegawax 320 column (30-m × 0.32-mm inner diameter; Supelco). The oven temperature was programmed from 185 °C (4-min hold) to 215 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and then to 240 °Cat 20 °C/min (1-min hold). Fatty acid methyl esters were also analyzed by GC-MS using the instrument described above fitted with an HP-INNO-Wax column. The oven temperature was programmed from 180 °C (3.5-min hold) to 215 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min (2-min hold) and then to 230 °C at 10 °C/min. For analyses of yeast cells and soybean embryos transformed with DsFAD2-2, the recovered fatty acid methyl esters were dried under nitrogen and reacted with 50–100 μl of the silylating reagent bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide:trimethylchlorosilane (99:1, v/v) (Supelco) to convert the hydroxyl group of dimorphecolic acid to a trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivative for GC and GC-MS analyses (11Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G. Hall S.E. McGonigle B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. The samples were then dried under nitrogen and resuspended in heptane for GC and GC-MS analyses as described above. Of note, our identification of cis-trans orientations of Δ12 double bonds of 16:2 and 18:2 methyl esters (as described under “Results”) was consistent with the known chromatographic properties of the different GC columns used in the analyses of S. cerevisiae and soybean extracts. For example, the trans isomer of a given fatty acid methyl ester elutes prior to the cis isomer on the 50% cyanopropyl, methylpolysiloxane phase of a DB-23 column (17Agilent Technologies Chromatography Supplies and Reference Guide 2002–2003. Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE2002: 391-392Google Scholar) as was observed in the analysis of S. cerevisiae extracts (see Fig. 2). Conversely a cis isomer elutes before the corresponding trans isomer on the polyethylene glycol phase of OmegaWax 320 and HP-INNOWax columns (17Agilent Technologies Chromatography Supplies and Reference Guide 2002–2003. Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE2002: 391-392Google Scholar) as was observed in the analysis of soybean extracts (see Fig. 3).Fig. 3Gas chromatographic analyses of fatty acid methyl esters prepared from non-transformed soybean somatic embryos (A), soybean somatic embryos expressing DsFAD2-1 (B), and developing D. sinuata seeds (C). Fatty acid methyl esters were resolved on an OmegaWax 320 GC column as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Two Divergent FAD2 Polypeptides in D. sinuata Seeds—The enzymes associated with the synthesis of dimorphecolic acid have not been previously identified, and little direct evidence has been presented for its biosynthetic pathway. To provide clues for the biosynthetic origin of dimorphecolic acid, an EST analysis of developing D. sinuata seeds was conducted. From the sequences of 2,669 randomly selected cDNAs, 12 ESTs for FAD2-like polypeptides were identified. This was of particular interest because divergent members of the FAD2 family catalyze the synthesis of a number of unusual fatty acids, including those that, like dimorphecolic acid, contain hydroxyl groups and conjugated double bonds (18Sperling P. Trernes P. Zank T.K. Heinz E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 68: 73-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The 12 D. sinuata ESTs included five ESTs that appeared to encode a functionally divergent form of FAD2, designated DsFAD2-1, and three ESTs that appeared to encode a second divergent form of FAD2, designated DsFAD2-2. The remaining four ESTs appeared to encode typical cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturases. The putative identification of D. sinuata FAD2 ESTs as functionally “typical” or “divergent” was based on properties of their deduced amino acid sequences. The primary structures of FAD2s contain three His-rich domains or “boxes” that are believed to coordinate active site diiron atoms (18Sperling P. Trernes P. Zank T.K. Heinz E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 68: 73-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of the first His box is HECGHH. In all members of the FAD2 family that function as cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturases, this box is preceded by Ala. However, all known enzymes of this family that contain Gly in this position catalyze alternative reactions such as fatty acid hydroxylation and epoxygenation (20van de Loo F.J. Broun P. Turner S. Somerville C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6743-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 21Broun P. Boddupalli S. Somerville C.

Green A. Stymne S. Science. 1998; 280: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of both DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 contain a Gly residue preceding the first His box. Based on this, we hypothesized that DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 do not function as typical cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturases. The other four D. sinuata ESTs identified as cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturases had Ala preceding the first His box and other sequence elements consistent with the cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturase functional class of FAD2 enzymes (23Dyer J.M. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.-C.W. Mullen R.T. Turner C. McKeon T.A. Pepperman A.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2027-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly the amino acid sequences of DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2 share only 48% identity. DsFAD2-1 is most closely related to a cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturase from Helianthus annuus and shares ∼60–75% amino acid sequence identity with all known cis-Δ12-oleic acid desaturases. This polypeptide also shares 63–67% identity with FAD2-type fatty acid hydroxylases and Δ12-fatty acid conjugases from Aleurites fordii (23Dyer J.M. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.-C.W. Mullen R.T. Turner C. McKeon T.A. Pepperman A.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 2027-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Punica granatum (24Hornung E. Pernstich C. Feussner I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but shares ≤55% identity with FAD2 epoxygenases, acetylenases, and Δ9-fatty acid conjugases. In addition, the amino acid sequence of DsFAD2-1 does not display a distinct phylogenetic relationship with those of any specific FAD2 functional class (Fig. 1). As a result, it was not possible to predict the enzymatic function of DsFAD2-1 from its primary structure alone. DsFAD2-2, by contrast, shares ≤55% identity with all members of the FAD2 family except the Δ9-fatty acid conjugases from Calendula officinalis (6Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Qiu X. Reed D.W. Hong H. MacKensie S.L. Covello P.S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DsFAD2-2 and the C. officinalis Δ9-fatty acid conjugases share ∼75% amino acid sequence identity, and these polypeptides display a close phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 1). The Δ9-fatty acid conjugases catalyze the conversion of the cis-Δ9 double bond of linoleic acid into trans-Δ8 and trans-Δ10 double bonds. The close relationship of the primary structures of Ds-FAD2-2 and the C. officinalis Δ9-fatty acid conjugases suggested that these enzymes have related functional properties. Functional Characterization of DsFAD2-1—Enzymes of the FAD2 family have typically proven recalcitrant to direct assay (19Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This is likely due, in part, to their association with membranes. The function of FAD2 enzymes instead has been determined by monitoring for novel fatty acid products that accumulate upon their expression in a heterologous host. S. cerevisiae has proven to be a useful system for the functional characterization of newly identified FAD2 enzymes (6Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of any apparent ER retention motif, Glc-6-Pase-β is also localized in the ER membrane (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although its orientation in the membrane is not known. The subcellular localization of the Glc-6-Pase-β active site is not known, although it is assumed to be similar to Glc-6-Pase-α. Both Glc-6-Pase-β and Glc-6-Pase-α couple with the Glc-6-P transporter to form an active Glc-6-Pase complex, and both share similar kinetic properties with respect to Glc-6-P hydrolysis (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The active site of Glc-6-Pase-α was originally identified by the presence of a conserved phosphatase signature motif found in lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and vanadium haloperoxidases (16Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This motif was shown to contribute to the active site of a vanadium chloroperoxidase by both x-ray crystal structure analysis (18Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and mutational studies (19Hemrika W. Renirie R. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Messerschmidt A. Wever R. J. Biol.

Hydrolysis of Glc-6-P to glucose and phosphate via a covalent phosphohistidine-Glc-6-Pase-α intermediate was first proposed by Nordlie and Lygre (23Nordlie R.C. Lygre D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3136-3141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on pH kinetic studies of Glc-6-Pase-α catalysis, which was confirmed by the identification of an enzyme-bound 32P-labeled histidine after incubating rat liver microsomes with [32P]Glc-6-P (24Parvin R. Smith R.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Feldman F. Butler L.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Critical residues for Glc-6-Pase-α catalysis in the active site motif include: Arg83, which donates hydrogen ions to the phosphate and stabilizes the transition state; His119, which provides a proton to liberate the glucose moiety; and His176, which undertakes a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate to form a covalently bound phosphoryl enzyme intermediate (21Ghosh A.

Med. 2001; 1: 25-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In Glc-6-Pase-α, all of these residues lie together on the lumenal side of the ER membrane (10Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

Given the sequence similarity between Glc-6-Pase-α and Glc-6-Pase-β, a similar active site structure would be anticipated. Sequence alignments predict that His167 is the residue that forms a covalent bond with phosphate to create a phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β intermediate, whereas Arg79 and His114 are the hydrogen donors. These alignments also suggest that Glc-6-Pase-β contains nine putative transmembrane helices and that Arg79, His114, and His167 lie inside the ER lumen. In an effort to understand the role of this ubiquitous Glc-6-Pase activity, we have undertaken a study of the active site of Glc-6-Pase-β and confirmed that it is similar to Glc-6-Pase-α. This information can now be used to design experiments that disrupt the activity of Glc-6-Pase-β and investigate the biological importance of a Glc-6-Pase activity that is not limited in expression to the liver, kidney, and intestine, the organs previously considered to be the only ones capable of contributing to interprandial glucose homeostasis (13Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). Construction of Glc-6-Pase-β Mutants—Mutants were constructed using the same general strategy used for Glc-6-Pase-α (22Shieh J.-J. Terizioglu M. Hiraiwa H. Marsh J. Pan C.-J. Chen L.-Y. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5047-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the human Glc-6-Pase-β cDNA was engineered to remove the internal SfiI site (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and then used as a template for PCR-based N-terminal epitope tagging using either the FLAG (DYKDDDDK) or His10 epitopes. The resulting PCR products were cloned directionally into the pSVL vector to generate pSVL-Glc-6-Pase-β-5FLAG and pSVL-Glc-6-Pase-β-His10. The human pSVL-Glc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG construct has been described by Shieh, et al. (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the protease protection assays, Glc-6-Pase-β constructs incorporating two cleavable factor Xa tetrapeptide (IEGR) (28Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) recognition motifs were constructed by PCR and cloned into the pSVL vector. To locate the factor Xa tetrapeptide recognition motifs between the N-terminal FLAG epitope and the Glc-6-Pase-β coding sequence, a 5′ primer containing an ATG initiation codon followed by the 24-bp FLAG coding sequence, two fXa recognition sequences (back to back) (ATCGAGGGTAGAATCGAGGGTAGA), and nucleotides 217–237 of Glc-6-Pase-β (GenBank™ accession number XM_045901) was used. The 3′ primer represented nucleotides 1237–1257 of human Glc-6-Pase-β. The resulting construct was named Glc-6-Pase-β-5fXaFLAG. To locate the factor Xa tetrapeptide recognition motifs between the Glc-6-Pase-β coding sequence and the C-terminal FLAG epitope, the 5′ primer represented nucleotides 217–237 of human Glc-6-Pase-β, whereas the 3′ primer contained human Glc-6-Pase-β nucleotides 1237–1257 followed by the 24-bp fXa recognition sequence, the 24-bp FLAG coding sequence, and a termination codon. This construct was named Glc-6-Pase-β-3fXaFLAG. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviral Glc-6-Pase-β Mutants—The recombinant adenovirus containing Glc-6-Pase-β-His10 was generated by the Cre-lox recombination system described by Hardy et al. (29Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-His10 virus was plaque-purified and amplified to produce viral stocks with titers of 5–10 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml. The C-terminal FLAG-tagged constructs, Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β, Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-R79A, Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-H114A, and Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-H167A, were described previously (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protease Protection Assays and Western Blot Analysis—COS-1 cells in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with 10 μg of Glc-6-Pase-β-5FLAG, Glc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG, Glc-6-Pase-β-5fXaFLAG, or Glc-6-Pase-β-3fX-aFLAG in the pSVL vector as described previously (10Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 days, cell homogenates in 100 μl of Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were treated with 250 μg/ml DNase I for 30 min at 30 °C. The cell homogenates from Glc-6-Pase-β-5FLAG or Glc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG transfected cells were then treated with trypsin (Type XIII, 500 μg/mg protein) for 30 min at room temperature followed by 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and trypsin inhibitor (6 mg/mg protein) to inactivate trypsin. The cell homogenates from Glc-6-Pase-β-5fXaFLAG or Glc-6-Pase-β-3fXaFLAG transfected cells were treated with 15 μg of factor Xa protease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 2 h at room temperature in a 75-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. The factor Xa was then inactivated by the addition of Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 10 μm. The resultant trypsin- or factor Xa-treated cell homogenates were diluted 100-fold to 10 ml with cold Buffer A and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the microsomes. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in Buffer A and used for Western blot analysis. The cell homogenates treated with 0.5% deoxycholate to disrupt the microsomes, followed by trypsin or factor Xa treatment, were used as controls. For Western blot analysis, COS-1 lysates were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Co.) and incubated first with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak) and then with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Kirkegarrd & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The immunocomplex was detected with the horseradish peroxidase-linked chemiluminescent system containing the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate obtained from Pierce. Identification of the [32P]Phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β Intermediate—32P-Labeled Glc-6-P was synthesized from glucose and 5′-[γ-32P]ATP by yeast hexokinase (Sigma) and partially purified by a Dowex Ag-1X-formate column as described previously (21Ghosh A.

Microsomes were prepared from COS-1 cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units/cell after incubation at 37 °C for 48 h as described previously (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For active site labeling, microsomes (100 μg) were pre-incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 40 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 100 μm glucose 1-phosphate and then radiolabeled by the addition of ∼8 × 106 cpm of [32P]Glc-6-P to a final volume of 130 μl. After incubation for 10 s at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The labeled proteins were then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with 100 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and once with 100 μl of cold water. The pellet was then finally solubilized in a triple lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.02% NaN3, and the complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The [32P]phosphoryl enzyme intermediate was isolated by immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody in conjunction with protein A-agarose (Sigma) and identified by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Purification of [32P]Phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β Intermediate—The 32P-labeled phosphoryl microsomal proteins from Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-His10-infected cells were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid as described above. The pellet was washed twice with 100 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and once with 100 μl of cold water and finally dissolved in 400 μl of Solution A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) containing the complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. The solubilized proteins were bound to a nickel chelate resin (His MicroSpin Purification Module, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with Solution A. The resin was washed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the bound protein was eluted with 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) at 46 °C for 30 min. The resulting proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β-His10 intermediate visualized by autoradiography. A gel slice containing the radiolabeled protein was excised, eluted with water by incubating the mashed gel slice in water at 50 °C for 1 h, lyophilized, and used for cyanogen bromide digestion. Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage of [32P]Phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β and Analyses of the Glc-6-Pase-β Peptides by Gel Electrophoresis and Isoelectric Focusing—The lyophilized [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β-His10 intermediate was resuspended in 400 μl of a solution containing 32 mg of cyanogen bromide/ml of 70% formic acid (30Coligan J.E.

Following digestion, the products were dialyzed against water at 4 °C using Slide-A-Lyzer 3.5K Dialysis Cassettes (Pierce), lyophilized, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, resolved by electrophoresis through a 10% NuPAGE bis-Tris gel, and visualized by autoradiography. A gel slice containing the 4.4-kDa 32P-labeled phosphoryl peptide was eluted with water, dialyzed against water at 4 °C overnight, and lyophilized. The resulting gel-purified 32P-labeled phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β peptide was then characterized by electrophoresis through a 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and by isoelectric focusing through a Novex pre-cast isoelectric focusing gel, pH 3–10 (Invitrogen). Membrane Topography of Glc-6-Pase-β —Glc-6-Pase-α is embedded in the ER membrane by nine-transmembrane domains (10Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21658-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) oriented with the N terminus in the ER lumen and the C terminus in the cytoplasm. Hydropathy analysis of the Glc-6-Pase-β amino acid sequence using the TMpred program (32Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166-170Google Scholar) predicts that Glc-6-Pase-β is also anchored in the ER by nine putative transmembrane helices (Fig. 1). If this is correct, the N and C termini of the protein will be on opposite sides of the ER membrane. To determine the subcellular localization of the termini of Glc-6-Pase-β, we undertook protease protection assays using N- and C-terminal FLAG-tagged Glc-6-Pase-β constructs. Intact microsomes from COS-1 cells transfected with Glc-6-Pase-β-5FLAG or Glc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG were digested with trypsin, and the protein fragments were analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Microsomes expressing Glc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG yielded no FLAG-tagged peptides upon digestion consistent with an exposed cytoplasmic C terminus. In contrast, microsomes expressing Glc-6-Pase-β-5FLAG were more resistant to digestion. However, the trypsin-resistant FLAG-tagged product is not full-length (35 kDa) but a 14-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2A). In control experiments using microsomes permeabilized by detergent, both N- and C-terminal FLAG tags are cleaved by trypsin (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Proteolytic digestion of N- and C-terminal epitope-tagged human Glc-6-Pase-β. A, intact microsomes isolated from Glc-6-Pase-β-5FLAG- or Glc-6-Pase-β-3FLAG-transfected COS-1 cells were subjected to digestion by trypsin in the absence or presence of deoxycholate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, intact microsomes isolated from Glc-6-Pase-β-5fXaFLAG- or Glc-6-Pase-β-3fX-aFLAG-transfected COS-1 cells were subjected to digestion by factor Xa protease in the absence or presence of deoxycholate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following electrophoretic fractionation and blotting, Glc-6-Pase-β polypeptides were visualized with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Each lane contained 20 μg of proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because there are 20 potential trypsin cleavage sites in Glc-6-Pase-β-FLAG (Fig. 1), we confirmed the topography of Glc-6-Pase-β by introducing a unique proteolytic cleavage site into our FLAG-tagged constructs. A duplicated factor Xa protease recognition motif (28Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was inserted between the Glc-6-Pase-β coding region and the FLAG tag to yield the Glc-6-Pase-β-5fXaFLAG and Glc-6-Pase-β-3fXaFLAG constructs. Consistent with the trypsin digestion experiments, factor Xa digestion of Glc-6-Pase-β-5fXaFLAG-expressing microsomes yielded a full-length FLAG-tagged protein, whereas digestion of Glc-6-Pase-β-3fXaFLAG-expressing microsomes led to loss of the FLAG epitope (Fig. 2B). Identification of the Phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β Intermediate—We have shown previously that during catalysis, His176 in Glc-6-Pase-α acts as a phosphate acceptor forming a covalently bound phosphoryl enzyme intermediate (21Ghosh A. Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Sun M.-S. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The kinetic and topographical similarities between Glc-6-Pase-β and Glc-6-Pase-α suggest that a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate is also formed during Glc-6-Pase-β catalysis. Microsomes isolated from C-terminal FLAG-tagged Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-, Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-R79A-, Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-H114A-, or Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-H167A-infected COS-1 cells were incubated with [32P]Glc-6-P, and the resulting [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β intermediate was isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As expected, a 35-kDa [32P]phosphoryl enzyme intermediate was identified in wild-type Glc-6-Pase-β-infected cells but not in R79A, H114A, or H167A active site mutant-infected cells (Fig. 3). His167 Is the Phosphate Acceptor in Glc-6-Pase-β—Based on the nine helical domain topography of Glc-6-Pase-β (Fig. 1), the active site residues, Arg79, His114, and His167, are predicted to lie inside the lumen of the ER. Sequence alignment predicts His167 is the phosphate acceptor in Glc-6-Pase-β. Human Glc-6-Pase-β contains nine methionine residues at positions, 1, 116, 126, 145, 186, 192, 207, 291, and 334 (Fig. 1), which can be cleaved by cyanogen bromide (30Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 11.5.1-11.5.10Google Scholar, 31Cordoba O.L. Linskens S.B. Dacci E. Santome J.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1997; 35: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After cleavage, the His167 is predicted to lie within a 4.4-kDa peptide (residues 146–186) with a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.6. To purify the [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β intermediate, we generated a Glc-6-Pase-β construct carrying a His10 tag at the N terminus (Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-His10). Microsomes from Ad-Glc-6-Pase-β-His10-infected COS-1 cells were labeled with [32P]Glc-6-P, and the [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β intermediate was enriched by affinity chromatography and further purified by electrophoresis through a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gelpurified [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β intermediate was then cleaved by cyanogen bromide, and the cleaved products were fractionated through a NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel. A major band with an apparent molecular mass of 4.4 kDa and minor bands with apparent molecular masses of 18, 16, and 10 kDa were identified (Fig. 4A). The 4.4-kDa peptide corresponds to the expected molecular weight of the His167-containing peptide of 41 amino acids (residues 146–186). To further demonstrate that the His167-containing peptide of 4.4-kDa carries the [32P]phosphoryl moiety, the 4.4-kDa band was eluted from the gel and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The purified 32P-labeled peptide migrated as a 4.4-kDa band through a 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Fig. 4B) with an isoelectric point above 8.3 (Fig. 4C). The results firmly established that in Glc-6-Pase-β, His167 is the amino acid that covalently binds the phosphoryl moiety during Glc-6-Pase-β catalysis. Blood glucose homeostasis between meals depends on gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In the terminal step common to both pathways, Glc-6-P is hydrolyzed to glucose by the Glc-6-Pase complex, which is composed of two functionally coupled proteins, the Glc-6-P transporter and a Glc-6-P phosphohydrolase (reviewed in Ref. 14Chou J.Y. Matern D. Mansfield B.C. Chen Y.-T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Until recently, only one functional Glc-6-Pase had been reported. This enzyme, previously called Glc-6-Pase, is expressed in the liver/kidney/intestine consistent with its role in glucose homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 13Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, a ubiquitously expressed Glc-6-Pase-related protein, which was previously called UGRP and thought to be inactive (5Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was demonstrated to be catalytically active (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a result, the proteins have been renamed Glc-6-Pase-α (liver/kidney/intestine Glc-6-Pase) and Glc-6-Pase-β (UGRP). Glc-6-Pase-α is well characterized, but little beyond the kinetic activity (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

As a first step to characterizing the biological relevance of Glc-6-Pase-β, we have sought to examine whether it is structurally similar to Glc-6-Pase-α, a hydrophobic protein embedded in the ER by nine-transmembrane helical domains (10Pan C.-J.

During catalysis, Glc-6-Pase-α forms a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate (23Nordlie R.C. Lygre D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3136-3141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Parvin R.

Pan C.-J. Sun M.-S. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Glc-6-Pase-β lacks any apparent ER transmembrane protein retention motif, but double immunofluorescence microscopy studies have shown that it is localized in the ER (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Theoretical modeling of the topography of Glc-6-Pase-β using the TMpred program (32Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166-170Google Scholar) predicts that Glc-6-Pase-β is anchored in the membrane by nine helical domains. Using epitope-tagged Glc-6-Pase-β constructs and a protease protection assay by limited trypsin digestion, we found that the C terminus of Glc-6-Pase-β is exposed to the cellular cytoplasm but that the N terminus appears protected. Cleavage of the N-terminally FLAG-tagged protein yielded a 14-kDa peptide fragment that is consistent with a nine-transmembrane domain topography. A prediction of tryptic cleavage sites in the FLAG-tagged Glc-6-Pase-β by the Ensembl (www.ensembl.org) Peptide Cutter server reveals 20 potential cleavage sites (Fig. 1). Cleavage between residues 136 and 137 (. .VAT(R/A)RSR..) would yield the closest theoretical fragment (15.5 kDa) to that observed. Given the increased electrophoretic mobility expected from the negatively charged FLAG epitope, this suggests that the FLAG epitope lies on a fragment representing the first 136 residues of Glc-6-Pase-β. Sequence alignment to the nine-transmembrane domain model of Glc-6-Pase-α (10Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21658-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) corresponds to the first cytoplasmically exposed cleavage site that lies in the putative second cytoplasmic loop (Fig. 1). There are five other trypsin sites between residues 1 and 136 in Glc-6-Pase-β, but by this model the first site is predicted to lie within the first transmembrane helix, the second site lies at the junction between cytoplasmic loop 1 and transmembrane helix 2, the next two sites lie within the second transmembrane helix, and the fifth site lies at the beginning of the first luminal loop. When the protease protection assays were repeated using constructs engineered to contain a unique protease cleavage site the results were consistent with a cytoplasmic C terminus and lumenal N terminus. Taken together, Glc-6-Pase-β has been shown to have an odd number of transmembrane domains, and proteolytic digests are consistent with the nine-transmembrane topography predicted both by hydropathy analysis (32Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166-170Google Scholar) and sequence alignment to Glc-6-Pase-α. In an earlier study, we showed that Glc-6-Pase-β couples with the Glc-6-P transporter to form an active Glc-6-Pase complex (6Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47098-47103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the nine-transmembrane domain model that puts the active site residues Arg79, His114, and His167 on the lumenal side of the membrane. The kinetic and structural similarity between Glc-6-Pase-α and Glc-6-Pase-β catalysis suggests that the mechanism of action of the active site is also similar. In the hydrolysis of Glc-6-P, Glc-6-Pase-α forms a covalently bound intermediate between His176 and the phosphate moiety (21Ghosh A. Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Sun M.-S. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The analogous residue in Glc-6-Pase-β is His167. Using 32P-labeled Glc-6-P we detected the [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β intermediate from microsomes expressing Glc-6-Pase-β. However the intermediate is not detectable in microsomes expressing the Glc-6-Pase-β active site mutants R79A, H114A, or H167A. To further identify His167 as the phosphate acceptor, we purified the [32P]phosphoryl-Glc-6-Pase-β intermediate by affinity chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Complete cleavage of the intermediate with cyanogen bromide is predicted to create 10 peptide fragments. The His167 is predicted to lie on a 4.4-kDa peptide with a theoretical pI of 8.6. When cleaved, the intermediate yielded a predominant fragment of 4.4 kDa having a pI above 8.3, which is consistent with His167 as the phosphate acceptor. In addition, several minor bands of 10, 16, and 18 kDa were also detected bound to the [32P]phosphoryl moiety. Complete cyanogen bromide digestion yielded no fragment greater than 13.2 kDa, whereas the next largest peptides were 9.2 and 5.0 kDa. The minor bands are, however, consistent with partial digests that contain His167. The 18-kDa band is consistent with the peptide containing amino acids 127–291, the 16-kDa band is consistent with the peptide containing amino acids 146–291, and the 10-kDa band is consistent with the peptide containing amino acids 127–192. Our results firmly established that His167 acts as the nucleophile forming the phosphohistidine enzyme intermediate during Glc-6-Pase-β catalysis. In summary, we showed that the ubiquitous Glc-6-Pase-β is anchored in the ER by nine-transmembrane helices oriented with its active site inside the lumen, like the liver/kidney/intestine Glc-6-Pase-α. The similarity between Glc-6-Pase-β and Glc-6-Pase-α also extended to the nature of the active site residues Arg79, His114, and His167 and the formation of a covalently bound phosphoryl enzyme intermediate during catalysis. We are now in a position to study the effect of inactivation of Glc-6-Pase-β and assess its importance to blood glucose homeostasis and metabolism in general. We thank Dr. Brian C. Mansfield for critical reading of the manuscript."

Substrate recognition depends on the N-substituent pattern of the heparan sulfate precursor polysaccharide and requires the adjacent glucosamine residue toward the non-reducing end to be N-sulfated. Epimerization of an appropriately N-sulfated substrate is freely reversible in a soluble system, with equilibrium favoring retention of d-gluco configuration (Hagner-McWhirter, Å., Lindahl, U., and Li, J.-P.

The label was incorporated with glucuronic acid units into the heparan sulfate precursor polysaccharide and was lost upon subsequent C5-epimerization to iduronic acid. However, analysis of oligosaccharides obtained by deaminative cleavage of the mature heparan sulfate chains indicated that all glucuronic acid units retained their C5-3H label, irrespective of whether they had occurred in sequences susceptible or resistant to the epimerase. All 3H-labels of the final products resisted incubation with epimerase in a soluble system, apparently due to blocking O-sulfate groups. These results indicate that glucuronic acid C5-epimerization is effectively irreversible in vivo and argue for a stringent organization of the biosynthetic machinery.

Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar). Their biological activities are generally ascribed to the binding of HS glycosaminoglycan chains to proteins (growth factors, receptors, enzymes and their inhibitors, matrix proteins, microbial proteins, etc.) in more or less specific fashion. HS-protein interactions are largely ionic, selectivity of binding being dictated by the distribution of negatively charged carboxylate and sulfate groups along the HS chain (2Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These features are largely established during HS biosynthesis, which appears to be regulated such that different types of cells, possibly also cells exposed to different stimuli, generate HS of different structures (3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 4Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Notably, however, further structural diversity may be introduced through endosulfatase action after completed biosynthesis (5Ai X. Do A.T. Lozynska O. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).HS biosynthesis, a Golgi process, is initiated by the generation of a linkage tetrasaccharide, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xyl-, onto a serine residue in the proteoglycan protein core (6Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues are then transferred from the corresponding UDP-sugars to the non-reducing ends of nascent polysaccharide chains, concomitant with further modification of these polymers (3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). N-Deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc units thus precede C5-epimerization of GlcA to l-iduronic acid (IdoA) residues, which, in turn, are followed by O-sulfation at different positions. Only a fraction of potential target units is attacked in each modification step, resulting in domain-type variability as well as more subtle structural diversity. The overall process is regulated in part by the substrate specificities of the various enzymes involved, all of which have now been cloned and expressed. However, additional regulatory mechanisms, still poorly understood, are required to explain the display of saccharide epitopes in HS chains. Our understanding of the regulation of HS biosynthesis has been hampered by the lack of information regarding the organization of the biosynthetic machinery. The enzymes involved are membrane-bound, with N-terminal transmembrane domains and C-terminal lumenal catalytic domains and are assumed to operate in a closely concerted mode. Still, little is known regarding their topological and functional interaction or the kinetics of the various steps of HS chain formation and modification. The process has been described in terms ranging from kinetically controlled competition between different enzymes for common polymer substrates (8Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) to more strictly molded assembly lines (9Lidholt K. Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The present work was undertaken to gain further insight into the biosynthetic process by exploiting the properties of a unique step, i.e. the C5-epimerization of GlcA to IdoA residues. Solubilized (or recombinant) epimerase catalyzes a freely reversible reaction involving abstraction of the C5-hydrogen of a target hexuronic acid (GlcA or IdoA) followed by reinsertion (presumably of a proton) to yield the alternative C5-configuration (Fig. 1). Incubation with epimerase of an appropriate polysaccharide substrate containing C5-3H-labeled hexuronic acid residues will release the label from GlcA as well as IdoA units; conversely, incubation of unlabeled substrate in 3H2O leads to incorporation of label into both epimers (10Hagner-Mcwhirter Å. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Is epimerization reversible also during HS biosynthesis in an intact cell? The answer to this question bears not only on the kinetics of epimerization in the Golgi, but may also provide clues to the overall organization of the HS biosynthetic apparatus. We have approached this problem by allowing cells to incorporate C5-3H-labeled GlcA residues into HS chains under formation, followed by analysis of the product with regard to residual label.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—d-[U-14C]Gal (293 mCi/mmol), d-[U-14C]GlcN hydrochloride (311 mCi/mmol), and NaB3H4 (55 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

A sample of 1 (2 mg dissolved in 40 μl water) was added to 10 ml of methanol together with 50 mCi NaB3H4, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After dropwise addition of 100 μlof1 m HCl to give pH 2–3 (in a fume hood), the mixture was incubated for another 30 min and was then heated to 55 °C and evaporated to dryness. The addition of 20 ml of methanol followed by evaporation to dryness as above was repeated 5 times. The reduction products were dissolved in 3 ml of water and then analyzed by paper chromatography on Whatman number 1 paper in butanol/ethanol/water (10:3:5 by volume), along with d-[U-14C]Gal as standard (running time 22 h). A major component (65% of total radioactivity) appeared at the migration position of Gal, whereas 19% migrated as altrose, another expected reaction product (l-enantiomer; Fig. 2). The yields of d-[5-3H]Gal in two separate preparations were 5.4 mCi and 4.6 mCi. The two batches were combined before use.Metabolic Labeling of Cells—Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax-II (Invitrogen) using standard procedures at 37 °C. The medium contained 4.5 g/liter glucose and was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. When cells seeded in six 175-cm2 flasks had reached ∼80% confluency, the medium was replaced with 15 ml of medium supplemented as above but containing only 1 g/liter glucose and, in addition, 100 μCi/ml [5-3H]Gal and 5 μCi/ml [U-14C]GlcN (five 175-cm2 flasks). Medium containing 100 μCi/ml [5-3H]Gal was added to the sixth 175-cm2 flask as above, but with 10 μCi/ml [U-14C]Gal substituted for the labeled GlcN. The cells were metabolically labeled for 48 h.Purification of Metabolically Radiolabeled HS—After labeling, the media were collected, and the cell layers were lysed by adding to each flask 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. All samples were kept on ice on a rocking plate for 1 h. Urea was added to a final concentration of 8 m to both the media and cell lysates, and the mixtures were boiled for 15 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 11,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants from media and cell lysates were mixed, and an equal volume of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4, was added. The samples were applied on DEAE-Sephacel columns (10 ml) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 2 m urea and 0.2 m NaCl, pH 4. After extensive washing (buffer as above), the columns were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–1 m NaCl in the same buffer (total volume 100 ml). Fractions containing proteoglycans eluted between 0.5 and 0.75 m NaCl were pooled, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized.The proteoglycans were further purified by gel chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column (1 × 90 cm) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The proteoglycans, excluded from the gel, were pooled and desalted by lyophilization. The samples were treated with 1 unit/ml of chondroitinase ABC. The HS chains were then released from proteoglycan core proteins by β-elimination in 0.5 m NaOH for 16 h at 4 °C followed by neutralization with 4 m acetic acid.The free HS chains were recovered by absorption to a 1-ml DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The columns were washed with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 followed by 0.25 m NaCl and 0.2 m NH4HCO3, and were finally eluted with 2 m NH4HCO3. This purification procedure yielded pure HS as it was quantitatively degraded by treatment with heparitinase I (not shown).HS Structural Analysis—Metabolically labeled HS chains (generally 400 × 103 dpm of 3H) were cleaved at the sites of N-sulfated GlcN units by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 followed by reduction with NaBH4 (14Li J.-P.

Under these conditions, GlcNSO3 units are deaminated and converted to terminal 2,5-anhydromannitol residues, whereas Glc-NAc units remain intact (15Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Deamination mixtures were fractionated on a column (1.3 × 185 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10 eluted with 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Effluent fractions were analyzed for 3H and 14C. Fractions corresponding to di- and tetrasaccharides were pooled, desalted by lyophilization, and further analyzed separately. O-Sulfated disaccharides were separated by anion exchange HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm; Whatman), using a step gradient of KH2PO4 (0.012, 0.028, and 0.168 m) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. O-Sulfated disaccharides were first isolated by preparative high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 5.3 (0.083 m pyridine, 0.05 m acetic acid) and were then identified by paper chromatography (ethyl acetate/acetic acid/H2O, 3:1:1 by volume) (10Hagner-Mcwhirter Å. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Samples of [3H]Gal/14C[GlcN]-labeled and [3H]Gal/14C[Gal]-labeled tetrasaccharides (150 × 103 and 30 × 103 dpm 3H, respectively) obtained by Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography were digested with 10.4 units of β-glucuronidase in 200 μl of 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5, at 37 °C overnight. Test incubations with appropriate disaccharide standards ascertained that the enzyme preparation contained β-glucuronidase but no α-iduronidase activity (not shown). The digestion products were analyzed by Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography as described above.RESULTSThe course of hexuronyl (HexA)-C5-epimerization in relation to subsequent polymer modification (O-sulfation) reactions in HS biosynthesis was investigated by monitoring the fate of C5-3H atoms introduced with GlcA residues during the polymerization phase of the process. Incorporation of [5-3H]GlcA units was achieved by incubating HEK 293 cells with [5-3H]Gal (predicted to yield UDP-[5-3H]GlcA via conversion to [5-3H]Gal-1-phosphate and UDP-[5-3H]glucose (16Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Incubation of the resultant 3H-labeled HS with purified soluble epimerase (11Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) failed to release any significant label from the polysaccharide (data not shown), indicating that all residual [5-3H]GlcA residues in the mature HS were inaccessible to the enzyme. Previous studies have shown that epimerase action is blocked by 2-O-sulfation of potential target HexA units, as well as by 6-O-sulfation of adjacent GlcN residues (17Jacobsson I. Lindahl U. Jensen J.W. Rodén L. Prihar H. Feingold D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1056-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3H label thus could reside either in GlcA units never recognized as substrate by the epimerase or in substrate units blocked by O-sulfation. The latter alternative would apply only if such blocking is favored over reversible C5-epimerization, because a GlcA unit generated by “back epimerization” of IdoA would be devoid of C5-3H. Conversely, the occurrence of unlabeled GlcA units in primary epimerase target positions would point to a relatively looser organization of the biosynthetic process in which C5-epimerization would be allowed to revert to d-gluco configuration before onset of intervening O-sulfation (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Use of dual isotope labeling of cells to assess reversibility of GlcA C5-epimerization in HS biosynthesis. Cells are incubated with [5-3H]Gal (open circle) and [14C]GlcN (closed circle) to generate intracellular labeled UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively. Monosaccharide units are polymerized to N-acetylheparosan (catalyzed by the EXT1/EXT2 enzyme complex) and further modified through N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST), GlcA C5-epimerase (Epi), and O-sulfotransferase (OST) reactions (3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The aim of the study is to clarify whether IdoA units can be “back-epimerized” to GlcA residues that will be detected by their lack of C5-3H label. The scheme illustrates alternative pathways for a fully N-sulfated trisaccharide sequence that is arbitrarily 2-O- and 6-O-sulfated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Primary susceptibility of GlcA units in the HS precursor polysaccharide to enzymatic C5-epimerization is dictated by the adjacent N-substituent pattern. The GlcA residues in -Glc-NS-GlcA-GlcNS- and -GlcNS-GlcA-GlcNAc-sequences (reducing terminus to the right) thus are recognized as substrate by the epimerase, whereas those in -GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNAc- and -GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNS-sequences are not. These various structural constellations can be distinguished by deaminative cleavage of the polysaccharide with nitrous acid, which will attack N-sulfated GlcN units and break the corresponding glucosaminidic linkages, whereas N-acetylated GlcN residues are resistant (18Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). A HexA located between two GlcNS residues will thus be recovered in a disaccharide deamination product, whereas a -GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNAc-structure will form part of a larger oligosaccharide. Tetrasaccharides derived from sequences of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units are particularly instructive, because the nonreducing terminal HexA, but not the internal GlcA unit, represents a potential epimerase substrate in the intact parent polysaccharide chain (Fig. 4). We therefore attempted to determine the distribution of the 3H label between the variously sized deamination products. To enable such comparison, a 14C reference label was introduced through the addition to the incubation medium of either [U-14C]Gal or [U-14C]GlcN, along with the [5-3H]Gal.Fig. 4Relation between N-substituents and epimerase target units in HS precursor polysaccharide. Potential epimerase target units are indicated by arrows. Treatment with nitrous acid (HNO2) generates di- and oligosaccharides due to cleavage at GlcNS but not at GlcNAc units.

Labeled HS was isolated and cleaved at GlcNS residues by treatment with HNO2, and the resultant diand oligosaccharides were separated by gel chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-10 column. The internal GlcA residues of HexA- (GlcNAc-GlcA)n-aManR oligosaccharides correspond to units in the intact parent polymer that are not recognized as substrate by the epimerase, whereas the nonreducing-terminal HexA residues represent potential target units (Fig. 4) (17Jacobsson I.

Consistent loss of 3H from such target units would result in progressively decreasing 3H/14C ratios for oligosaccharides of decreasing size. The results shown in Fig. 5 conform to this prediction, irrespective of whether the 14C label was introduced through [14C]GlcN (Fig. 5A) or [14C]Gal (Fig. 5B). The largest (≥18-mer) fragments were expected to contain labeled Gal residues of the HS-protein linkage region and were therefore excluded from further calculations. Instead, the 3H/14C ratio of the 16-mer was applied as a reference approximating complete retention of 3H and used to calculate hypothetical ratios for the smaller oligosaccharides, assuming complete loss of nonreducing terminal 3H. Comparison with the experimentally found ratios indicated significant loss of 3H from all oligosaccharide species (Table I). We therefore proceeded to analyze whether this lack of 3H was restricted to IdoA units of the HS chain or also included GlcA units formed by back-epimerization of IdoA residues.Fig. 5Gel chromatography of metabolically labeled HS following treatment with nitrous acid. HEK 293 cells were incubated with [5-3H]Gal/[U-14C]-GlcN (A) or [5-3H]Gal/[U-14C]Gal (B).

Open table in a new tab Analysis of Epimerase HexA Target Units—Disaccharide deamination products are derived from HS sequences composed of consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units, hence containing HexA units that are initially all susceptible to epimerase attack (Fig. 4). The disaccharide fractions were separated by anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 6). As expected, all IdoA-containing species (Fig. 6, peaks 4, 5, and 6) had lost their C5-3H label. By contrast, the 3H/14C ratios for the GlcA-containing disaccharides, GlcA2S-aManR (peak 2) and GlcA-aManR6S (peak 3), were similar to that of the extended N-acetylated 16-mer reference structure, irrespective of whether the 14C was introduced through [14C]GlcN (Fig. 6A) or [14C]Gal (Fig. 6B), thus demonstrating essentially quantitative retention of C5-3H (Table II). Non-O-sulfated disaccharides (6.4% of total disaccharide units in N-sulfated domains) were isolated by paper electrophoresis and further separated into GlcA-aManR and IdoA-aManR species by paper chromatography (Fig. 7). Only the former component occurred in significant amounts, again with fully retained 3H label (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W1996195438,"Bone regeneration occurs as a series of events that requires temporal and spatial orchestration of numerous cell types guided by the transcriptional activity of thousands of genes, as recently demonstrated by our laboratory. Using the rat femoral fracture model, bioinformatics, cloning, expression assays, fusion proteins, and transfection, we report on the identification and characterization of one such differentially expressed gene, termed Mustang (musculoskeletal temporally activated novel gene). Mustang encodes for an 82 amino acid nuclear protein with no homology to any known protein family. However, other species homologues (mouse, human, cow) were identified within EST (expressed sequence tag) databases. Nuclear localization was confirmed using a GFP-Mustang fusion protein. Using in situ hybridization, Mustang expression was localized to differentiating periosteal osteogenic cells, proliferating chondrocytes, and osteoblasts of the fracture callus. Unlike adult tissues, developing embryos abundantly express Mustang, especially in mesenchymal condensations of limbs, vertebral perichondrium, and mesenchymal cells of the intervertebral discs. Although the precise function of Mustang is unknown, its unique pattern of expression during bone development and regeneration, absence in adult tissues (except skeletal muscle and tendon), and nuclear localization suggest that Mustang is involved in the development and regeneration of the mammalian musculoskeletal system."
https://openalex.org/W2020174312,"Many neuropeptide transmitters require the presence of a carboxy-terminal alpha-amide group for biological activity. Amidation requires conversion of a glycine-extended peptide intermediate into a C-terminally amidated product. This post-translational modification depends on the sequential action of two enzymes (peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase or PHM, and peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase or PAL) that in most eukaryotes are expressed as separate domains of a single protein (peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase or PAM). We identified a cDNA encoding PHM in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni. Transient expression of schistosome PHM (smPHM) revealed functional properties that are different from other PHM proteins; smPHM displays a lower pH-optimum and, when expressed in mammalian cells, is heavily N-glycosylated. In adult worms, PHM is found in the trans-Golgi network and secretory vesicles of both central and peripheral nerves. The widespread occurrence of PHM in the nervous system confirms the important role of amidated neuropeptides in these parasitic flatworms. The differences between schistosome and mammalian PHM suggest that it could be a target for new chemotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2027811363,"DSCR1(Adapt78) is a stress responsive gene that can be induced by multiple stresses. We have previously demonstrated that acute DSCR1(Adapt78) overexpression can transiently protect cells against oxidative stress and calcium-mediated stresses, while its chronic overexpression is associated with neurofibrillary tangles, Alzheimer disease, and Down's syndrome. It seems that a delicate balance of DSCR1(Adapt78) expression is maintained in cells, and this gene can have either protective or damaging effects, depending on both its level and duration of expression. The mechanisms by which DSCR1(Adapt78) can protect or harm cells are poorly understood. Here, we tried to identify pathways and targets affected by the DSCR1(Adapt78) gene using regulated expression of DSCR1(Adapt78) in PC-12 cells, followed by microarray analysis of mRNAs from these cells. We found that DSCR1(Adapt78) expression stimulates SOD1 (intracellular Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase) gene expression and increased sod 1 enzyme activity. Previous studies have indicated that sod 1 can either protect or damage cells, depending on its levels. Our findings suggest that sod 1 may also be involved in both the acute protective and the chronic damaging effects of DSCR1(Adapt78) expression. These data also have importance for our understanding of Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and other human pathologies."

The defensins form a family of small cationic antimicrobial peptides with six characteristic cysteine residues, whose pairing pattern in forming three intramolecular disulfide bonds defines the α- and β-defensin subfamilies.

Among the new β-defensins, nine of them form two groups of phylogenetically related sequences that were characterized in greater detail. Northern blot, reverse transcription PCR, and in situ hybridization analysis showed that expression of these genes is restricted to the epididymis, with a specific regional expression pattern. One of the new β-defensins (Defb38) was chemically synthesized; in in vitro assays on Gram-positive and -negative bacterial strains, Defb38 showed the characteristic salt-dependent antimicrobial activity of β-defensins.

Using a bioinformatic approach, we searched for new β-defensin genes in the Celera mouse genome data base. Searches based on known β-defensin sequences identified three contigs on chromosome 8 harboring potential new β-defensin genes. Exhaustive analysis of the sequences using six-cysteine patterns identified putative exons encoding the secreted form of 23 different β-defensins, including the eight members of this family characterized thus far. Two groups of phylogenetically related sequences were studied in detail. Transcripts for these sequences were detected in specific regions of the epididymis, and a cDNA encoding the entire protein was characterized for seven of them. As predicted for β-defensins, a chemically synthesized peptide reproducing the predicted mature protein encoded by one of the newly identified genes showed in vitro bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacterial strains. This study reveals a large number of murine β-defensins with a specific regional expression pattern within the epididymis, suggesting great complexity in the roles of these small proteins in host defense, as well as in other physiological processes within the male reproductive tract.

Downloaded genomic DNA sequences were searched using the FindPatterns program from Wisconsin package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Protein sequences were multialigned using the ClustalX program (8Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). β-Defensin mRNA Characterization and Expression—Total RNA from mouse organs was extracted with Tri-reagent (Sigma). For single-stranded cDNA synthesis, 5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and 100 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). DNA fragments corresponding to partial new β-defensin cDNAs were obtained by PCR amplification of murine cDNA (15 s at 94 °C and 60 s at 68 °C for 35 cycles). In Northern blots, 10 μg of RNA from mouse organs were electrophoresed on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto nylon Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization of the membranes and hybridization with 32P-labeled DNA fragments containing partial coding sequences of the putative new β-defensin genes were carried out in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the supplier. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the new β-defensin cDNA were isolated using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of β-defensin transcripts was performed essentially as described (10Carramolino L. Zaballos A.A. Kremer L. Villares R. Martin P. Ardavin C. Martinez A.C. Marquez G. Blood. 2001; 97: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was amplified with an ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems). When the full cDNA sequence was available, specific primers were designed to amplify sequences spanning different exons, except for the 28 S rRNA pair. Quantitative analyses using primer pairs that amplify genomic DNA were performed with DNase I-treated RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) prior to cDNA synthesis. Differences in cDNA loading were corrected for the amount of amplified 28 S rRNA. Messenger RNA expression was estimated as ΔCt values, which express the cycle threshold difference between the indicated primer pair and the 28 S rRNA pair, and relative expression was calculated using the 2ΔΔCt formula (11Higuchi R. Fockler C. Dollinger G. Watson R. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was performed on 10-μm-thick frozen sagittal epididymis sections using digoxigenin-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes for Defb12 and Defb38. RNA probes were synthesized with MAXIscript (Ambion) using PCR products as template.

Frozen sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, carboxymethylated in 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate and digested with 2 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). Prehybridization was performed at 58 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, and 40 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. RNA probes were denatured (5 min at 80 °C), diluted to ∼1 μg/ml in prehybridization mix, and hybridized (overnight at 58 °C). Stringent washes were done in 0.1× SSC. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate (Roche Applied Science) were used for detection. Chemical Synthesis of the Defb38 Gene Product—The predicted sequence of mature murine Defb38 protein was synthesized by Fmoc chemistry in a fully automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 430) according to standard protocols. Purity and composition of folded and unfolded polypeptides were confirmed by HPLC on a C-18 Nucleosil 120 analytical column (Tracer, Barcelona, Spain) by amino acid analysis using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) and by mass spectrometry using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer Reflex IV equipped with the SCOUT source in positive ion reflector mode with delayed extraction (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Folding and disulfide bridge formation of the HPLC products were carried out as described (12Clark-Lewis I. Vo L. Owen P. Anderson J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial Activity Assays—The colony count assay described by Harwig et al. (13Harwig S.S. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was followed with minor modifications. Mid-logarithmic phase Escherichia coli (ATCC 11303 strain), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1 strain) (14Latifi A. Foglino M. Tanaka K. Williams P. Lazdunski A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and Enterococcus faecium (CECT 4102 strain) were suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (15 mm sodium concentration), adjusted to a density of 5 × 108 colony-forming units/ml, and mixed with different amounts of β-defensin. Magainin was obtained from Sigma. When indicated, NaCl was added to increase the ionic strength of the mixture. After incubation (at 37 °C for 2 h), the mixtures were 10-fold serially diluted, spread on Luria-Bertani agar plates, and incubated (at 37 °C overnight). Where indicated, 20 μg of β-defensin were treated with 1 μg trypsin (at 37 °C for 1 h) in a final volume of 50 μl before assaying antimicrobial activity. Identification of New β-Defensin Genes in the Mouse Genome by Bioinformatics—The genomic structure of known β-defensin genes is composed of two coding exons, a 5′-exon encoding the signal peptide and a 3′-exon encoding most of the mature protein in which the six-cysteine motif is found. To search for potential new β-defensin genes in the mouse genome, TBLASTN was run on the murine Celera genomic data base using the mature protein sequence of known β-defensins as bait. We identified three contigs covering 500 kb in chromosome 8 that contained previously unidentified sequences similar to β-defensins. Because TBLASTN is not an exhaustive tool and, apart from the six cysteine residues, there are few similarities between the different β-defensins, the FindPatterns program was run on the downloaded contigs using the TGYN(18,18)TGYN(9,12)TGYN(27,27)TGYN(15,18)TGYTGY pattern, which corresponds to the reverse translation of the β-defensin six-cysteine motif. A total of 23 perfect matches were obtained, including the eight β-defensin molecules characterized to date (mBD1–mBD8). Fig. 1A shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences predicted by the nucleotide sequences identified, as well as their relative localization along mouse chromosome 8. The genes identified and characterized here are designated according to the official names given by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and Mouse Genomic Nomenclature Committee (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl). Based on this alignment (Fig. 1A), we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among the different β-defensins based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the second exon of the genes. The results showed a high degree of sequence similarity between some of the newly identified β-defensins, which were grouped into two separate branches of the dendrogram (Fig. 1B). One branch was formed by Defb37, Defb38, Defb39, and Defb40, and the other was formed by Defb12, Defb13, Defb15, Defb34, and Defb35. In each branch, β-defensin sequences are located in tandem in the chromosome. Given the lack of data about these β-defensin genes, we undertook a more detailed characterization. New β-Defensin Genes with Specific, Regionally Regulated Expression in Epididymis—We analyzed the new β-defensin sequences to determine whether they were bona fide genes by identifying the putative 5′-exons encoding the corresponding signal peptides, although TBLASTN with signal peptides from known β-defensins failed to identify potential candidates. Sequences upstream of each exon were then translated in the three possible reading frames and analyzed for the hydrophobic amino acid groups preceded by a methionine. The regions selected were then scanned for classical exon-intron boundaries, and potential 5′-exons were identified in all cases, except for Defb34 and Defb35. An additional criterion was mRNA expression analysis. To test whether the predicted new β-defensin sequences were transcribed, oligonucleotide pairing in both exons was designed and used to amplify cDNA from a variety of tissues by PCR. Bands of the predicted size were detected mainly in amplifications of epididymis cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of each product was determined, and the predicted exon structure was confirmed. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was then performed on both cDNA ends, except on Defb12, for which an expressed sequence tag encoding the entire protein existed (accession number AK020311), and the full coding sequences of Defb13, Defb15, Defb39, and Defb40 were determined. Northern blot using specific probes was used to study mRNA expression of the newly identified β-defensins. Analysis of a broad variety of tissues showed that all off the new β-defensins were expressed exclusively in the epididymis (not shown), a tubular male sex structure that lies on and around each testicle, connecting it with the vas deferens. Because the epididymis consists of three distinct regions forming the head (caput), body (corpus), and tail (cauda), a more detailed analysis was carried out of β-defensin mRNA expression in the epididymis regions, as well as in other organs of the male reproductive system such as whole testis, seminal vesicle, prostate, and coagulation gland. The results showed that, although always restricted to the epididymis, the putative new β-defensins had differential expression patterns (Fig. 2). Because of the similarity between their nucleotide sequences in the second exon in the case of the Defb15/Defb34 (87% identity) and Defb12/Defb35 (97%) pairs, the probes used were able to hybridize with transcripts corresponding to each member of the pair. Defb40 transcripts were not detectable by Northern blot analysis. Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to study the specific epididymis expression corresponding to Defb12, Def15, Defb34, Defb35, Defb39, and Defb40. Specific oligonucleotides pairing in the second exon were used to amplify cDNA from DNase I-treated RNA (Fig. 3); genomic DNA was also amplified and used as a reference to correct differences in amplification efficiency. Defb40 is expressed in the corpus at a level similar to that of Defb39; it is also detectable in the cauda and is at least 200 times less abundant than Defb39 in the caput (Table I). Quantitative analysis for Defb15/Defb34 and Defb12/Defb35 shows that all four sequences are transcribed, although Defb34 and Defb35 are less expressed in the corpus than their counterparts. Although both β-defensins have a similar expression pattern, Defb34 expression in the caput is at least 100 times lower than that of Defb15. The Defb35 expression level in the caput is ∼30 times lower than that of Defb12, although it is detected at a level similar to that of Defb12 in other epididymis regions. The PCR data indicate that the bands detected in Northern blot would correspond mainly to Defb12 and Defb15 transcripts. The expression analysis thus shows that transcripts for Defb12/Defb35, Defb15/Def34, and Defb13, whose proteins were phylogenetically grouped in one of the branches, were expressed mainly in the caput, although they were also detected by RT-PCR in the corpus and in the cauda. Defb37, Defb38, and Defb39 transcripts, all grouped in the second branch, were expressed maximally in the corpus, weakly in the cauda, and only in the case of Defb39 was the transcript clearly present in the caput.Table IReal time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of relative β-defensin expression on mouse epididymis x-fold expression was determined using the 2ΔΔCt formula, in which ΔΔCt = (Cta - Ctb)cDNA - (Cta - Ctb)gDNA, where Ct is a threshold cycle, a and b are a given pair of amplicons, and gDNA is genomic DNA.Defb39/Defb40Defb15/Defb34Defb12/Defb35Caput280.14136.2436.50Corpus0.9326.171.28Cauda0.2274.033.25 Open table in a new tab Specific regional β-defensin expression within the epididymis was confirmed by in situ hybridization analysis using Defb12- and Defb38-specific probes. Consistent with the results from the Northern blot analysis, Defb12 and Defb38 transcripts were detected in the caput and the corpus, respectively (Fig. 4). In the case of Defb12, mRNA expression was confined mainly to the distal part of the caput, proximal to the corpus, with a sharp border separating Defb12-expressing and non-expressing cells. The Newly Identified β-Defensin Defb38 Has Antimicrobial Activity in Vitro—The broad spectrum of in vitro antimicrobial activities shown by defensins (16Ganz T. Science. 1999; 286: 420-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), as well as the protection against salmonellosis observed in transgenic mice expressing a human intestinal defensin (17Salzman N.H. Ghosh D. Huttner K.M. Paterson Y. Bevins C.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), suggests that β-defensin expression in specific epididymis zones may have a role in preventing infection-mediated epididymitis, a pathology that can result in male infertility. To test the antimicrobial potential of the new murine β-defensins, we chemically synthesized a trial polypeptide corresponding to the predicted amino acid sequence of Defb38, a β-defensin with high corpus expression. The quality of the synthetic Defb38 was confirmed by HPLC and mass spectometry analysis (Fig. 5), as well as by amino acid composition (Table II) before assaying its antibacterial ability against several bacterial strains. Synthetic Defb38 killed both Gram-negative (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecium) (Fig. 6A) in a dose-dependent manner, as was also observed with magainin, a peptide with known antimicrobial activity (Fig. 6B). Some studies have demonstrated that the microbicidal activity of defensins can be blocked by increasing the ionic strength of the incubation medium (18Bals R. Wang X. Wu Z. Freeman T. Bafna V. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 19Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray Jr., P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Concurring with this, Defb38 antibacterial activity diminished progressively in the presence of increasing NaCl concentrations (Fig. 6C); the activity was also sensitive to trypsin treatment (Fig. 6D). These data indicate that Defb38 is a bona fide member of the β-defensin family and support its possible role in epididymis immune defense.Table IIAmino acid analysis of the chemically synthesized Defb38 peptideAmino acidExperimentalPredictedAsx2.052Thr1.62Ser0.951Glx33Gly4.44Ala0.91Val1.52Ile0.81Leu0.951Tyr4.95Phe0.851His1.21Lys6.56Arg1.52Pro1.82 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6Antimicrobial activity of synthetic Defb38.

Krause A. Schulz S. Forssmann W.G. Conejo-Garcia J.R. Schreeb R. Motzkus D. Genomics. 2003; 81: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because expression of these β-defensins was highest in the male genital tract, with a distribution in functionally different epididymal segments, a role in sperm maturation was suggested (20Rodriguez-Jimenez F.J. Krause A. Schulz S. Forssmann W.G. Conejo-Garcia J.R. Schreeb R. Motzkus D. Genomics. 2003; 81: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). According to sequence similarities and chromosomal localization (15Yamaguchi Y. Nagase T. Makita R. Fukuhara S. Tomita T. Tominaga T. Kurihara H. Ouchi Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21Schutte B.C. Mitros J.P. Bartlett J.A. Walters J.D. Jia H.P. Welsh M.J. Casavant T.L. McCray Jr., P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the β-defensins identified here are not the murine counterparts of those reported by Rodriguez-Jimenez et al (20Rodriguez-Jimenez F.J. Krause A. Schulz S. Forssmann W.G. Conejo-Garcia J.R. Schreeb R. Motzkus D. Genomics. 2003; 81: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The parallels in the expression pattern within the epididymis nonetheless allow speculation that these murine β-defensins might also have a role in the sperm maturation process. Bin1b is a rat β-defensin homologous to murine Ep2c (now called Defb45), and is expressed specifically in the epididymis caput (22Li P. Chan H.C. He B. So S.C. Chung Y.W. Shang Q. Zhang Y.D. Zhang Y.L. Science. 2001; 291: 1783-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition to its microbicidal activity, a role for Bin1b in epididymis function and fertility was proposed based on its regulated expression, which is maximal during the sexually mature period in rat (22Li P. Chan H.C. He B. So S.C. Chung Y.W. Shang Q. Zhang Y.D. Zhang Y.L. Science. 2001; 291: 1783-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We performed a preliminary analysis of β-defensin expression in 1-, 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old mouse epididymis using real time quantitative RT-PCR. Although some modulation was observed in Defb12, 13, 15, 38, and 39 expression, the data do not support a role for these murine β-defensins in epididymis function (not shown). Evolutionary Relationships between β-Defensins—The high degree of sequence conservation and shared specific expression in the epididymis suggest a common origin for the nine new β-defensin genes characterized here. Phylogenetic analysis based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the first exon of these genes showed their separation into two main branches, one with Defb12, Defb13, and Defb15, and the other with Defb37, Defb38, Defb39, and Defb40 (Fig. 7). This confirms the results obtained using the second exon-predicted sequence (Fig. 1B) and indicates that new defensin genes arose by genomic duplications that involved entire genes. After gene duplication, mutations affecting gene control regions could have led to the distinct constitutive expression levels observed. The paradigmatic example of this is the Defb37–Defb40 cluster. All members are expressed mainly in the corpus and are expressed differentially in other epididymis regions. The most similar expression patterns are those of β-defensins with similar sequences, as is the case for Defb38 and Defb40. The situation is slightly different in the other β-defensin phylogenetic branch analyzed. The sequence similarity between the DNA regions encompassing Defb15/Defb35 and Defb12/Defb34 indicates a relatively recent duplication event. As the Defb15 and Defb12 expression pattern is very similar, independent mutations in Defb35 and Defb34 must have occurred after duplication, reducing the expression level and disturbing the spatial control along the epididymis. Characterization of the promoter and control regions of these genes would aid to identify specific sequences and factors that direct epididymal and subepididymal expression. Despite the overall β-defensin genomic conservation between man and mouse, there seems to be no human counterpart for the murine Defb37–Defb40 cluster (21Schutte B.C. Mitros J.P. Bartlett J.A. Walters J.D. Jia H.P. Welsh M.J. Casavant T.L. McCray Jr., P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), whose members are expressed in the corpus and caput. In addition, there is only one orthologue cluster in man related to the murine Defb12/Defb34 and Defb15/Defb35 genes, indicating either that one cluster was lost in man after primate-rodent divergence, or that duplication occurred in rodents after this event. The high degree of sequence conservation among these murine clusters supports the latter hypothesis and makes unambiguous assignment of human gene homologues difficult. While this study was in progress, Schutte et al. reported new human and murine β-defensin genes, including the murine genes described here, although their data were based entirely on computational analysis and provided no experimental characterization (21Schutte B.C. Mitros J.P. Bartlett J.A. Walters J.D. Jia H.P. Welsh M.J. Casavant T.L. McCray Jr., P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Yamaguchi et al. also reported epididymis-specific expression of Defb12 and Defb15 (formerly Defb11) (15Yamaguchi Y. Nagase T. Makita R. Fukuhara S. Tomita T. Tominaga T. Kurihara H. Ouchi Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our work substantially increases the number of murine β-defensins identified with a specific regional expression pattern within epididymis, revealing further complexity in the role of these antimicrobial peptides in the innate and adaptive host defense of the male reproductive tract.

https://openalex.org/W2051163818,"Second only to skin cancer, cancer of the prostate gland (CaP) is the most commonly occurring cancer in American men. Existing treatment approaches and surgical intervention have been unable to effectively manage this dreaded cancer; therefore, efforts are ongoing to explore novel targets and strategies for the management of CaP. A complete understanding of the genetic control of the processes of cellular proliferation and programmed cell death, or ""apoptosis,"" may provide the basis for the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies against CaP. Key regulators for the mitotic progression in mammalian cells are the polo-like kinases (Plks). The activity of Plk1 is elevated in tissues and cells with a high mitotic index, including cancer cells. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the level of Plk1 expression has prognostic value for predicting outcomes in patients with some cancers such as lung cancer, squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, melanomas, and ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. However, the role of Plk1 in CaP is not known. Here, a hypothesis is put forward that Plk 1 plays a critical role in the development of prostate cancer; and the silencing of Plk1 will result in elimination of human CaP cells via an inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdc2)/cyclin B 1-mediated mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis. A corollary to this hypothesis is that Plk1 could serve as a target for the intervention of CaP in humans. Therefore, if the hypothesis is tested to be true, it is conceivable that gene therapeutic approaches aimed at Plk1 or the pharmacological inhibitors of Plk1 may be developed for the treatment/management of CaP."
https://openalex.org/W1995997074,"The short-lived enzyme S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase uses a covalently bound pyruvoyl cofactor to catalyze the formation of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, which then donates an aminopropyl group for polyamine biosynthesis. Here we demonstrate that S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome in vivo, a process that is accelerated by inactivation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by substrate-mediated transamination of its pyruvoyl cofactor. Proteasome inhibition in COS-7 cells prevents the degradation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase antigen; however, even brief inhibition of the 26 S proteasome caused substantial losses of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity despite accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase antigen. Levels of the enzyme's substrate (S-adenosylmethionine) increased rapidly after 26 S proteasome inhibition, and this increase in substrate level is consistent with the observed loss of activity arising from an increased rate of inactivation by substrate-mediated transamination. Evidence is also presented that this substrate-mediated transamination accelerates normal degradation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, as the rate of degradation of the enzyme was increased in the presence of AbeAdo (5′-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino]-5′-deoxyadenosine) (a substrate analogue that transaminates the enzyme); conversely, when the intracellular substrate level was reduced by methionine deprivation, the rate of degradation of the enzyme was decreased. Ubiquitination of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is demonstrated by isolation of His-tagged AdoMetDC (S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase) from COS-7 cells co-transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin and showing bands that were immunoreactive to both anti-AdoMetDC antibody and anti-hemagglutinin antibody. This is the first study to demonstrate that AdoMetDC is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, and substrate-mediated acceleration of degradation is a unique finding.

McCann P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). AdoMetDC catalyzes decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which then provides aminopropyl groups for either spermidine and spermine synthesis (3Stanley B.A. Casero Jr., R.A. Polyamines: Regulation and Molecular Interactions. R. G. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1995: 27-75Google Scholar). Spermidine synthase joins an aminopropyl group derived from decarboxylated AdoMet (dcAdoMet) with putrescine to produce spermidine. Similarly, an aminopropyl group from dcAdoMet is attached to spermidine by spermine synthase to generate spermine. Mammalian AdoMetDC is synthesized as a proenzyme (38 kDa) that autocatalytically cleaves to form the α (30.7 kDa) and β (7.7 kDa) subunits in a reaction that simultaneously forms the pyruvoyl cofactor from an existing internal serine residue at the amino terminus of the newly cleaved α subunit (4Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Holm I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21073-21079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mature catalytically active enzyme consists of a dimer (α2β2) of these subunits (5Pegg A.E. Xiong H. Feith D.J. Shantz L.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cellular AdoMetDC activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels: transcription of the AdoMetDC gene is repressed by spermidine, the translation of its mRNA is negatively regulated by spermine (6Shantz L.M. Holm I. Janne O.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the processing of the proenzyme and the catalytic activity of the final enzyme are stimulated by the spermidine precursor putrescine (7Pegg A.E.

It has been reported that the half-life of AdoMetDC is inversely related to the cellular content of spermidine and spermine (9Poso H. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In vivo the rapid degradation of AdoMetDC is inhibited by the binding of activity inhibitors such as methylglyoxal bis(guanyl)hydrazone, amino-guanidine, S-methyl-5′-methylthioadenosine, or 4-amidinoindan-1-one 2′-amidinohydrazone (5Pegg A.E.

The mechanisms for changes in AdoMetDC degradation rate in response to inhibitors or other stimuli are not understood. In addition to loss of AdoMetDC activity through degradation of the enzyme (loss of antigenic AdoMetDC), it is also known that AdoMetDC activity can be lost by permanent covalent inactivation of the enzyme in a process known as substrate-mediated transamination. Transamination transfers the amine group from the substrate AdoMet, converting the covalently linked pyruvoyl cofactor to an alanine (22Xiong H. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Anton D.L. Kutny R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6444-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The depletion of intracellular AdoMet by the presence of the AdoMet synthase inhibitor l-2-amino-4-methoxy-cis-but-3-enoic acid has been reported to lengthen the half-life of AdoMetDC activity loss 3-fold (15Kramer D.L. Sufrin J.R. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that the rate of this inactivation might be related to the intracellular concentrations of the substrate AdoMet, although direct stabilization effects of the l-cisAMB could not be completely ruled out in those experiments. The fact that the measured rate of AdoMetDC activity loss is often faster than the rate of antigen loss also suggests that it could be this inactive form of AdoMetDC that is recognized by intracellular degradation machinery, or at least that this inactive form may be preferentially degraded. There are multiple systems that can mediate the degradation of intracellular proteins; however, the ATP-dependent ubiquitin 26 S proteasome pathway is thought to account for the degradation of the great bulk of short-lived or abnormally folded intracellular proteins, as well as of long-lived proteins (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 25Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigate the proteolytic mechanisms responsible for the degradation of AdoMetDC in COS-7 cells in vivo and the effects of substrate levels and transamination on that degradation. Our results indicate that AdoMetDC is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Although antigenic protein was clearly stabilized following inhibition of the 26 S proteasome or following ATP depletion, the rapid disappearance of catalytic activity following cycloheximide administration was not inhibited by either of these treatments. In addition, we have obtained evidence that the inactive (transaminated) form of the AdoMetDC enzyme is more rapidly degraded than the active form.

MG-132, lactacystin, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, and calpain inhibitor II ALLM were from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and an MEM Select-Amine kit were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) was from HyClone (Logan, UT). Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was obtained from Osmonics (Westborough, MA). DNA isolation kits and Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (5% suspension) were purchased from Qiagen. [14COOH]AdoMet and Hyperfilm 3H were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [35S35S]methionine/cysteine protein labeling mix (1000 Ci/mmol), [4,5-3H(N)]leucine (40-60 Ci/mmol), Entensify solution (autoradiography enhancer), and Econofluor-2 were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. AbeAdo was obtained from Marion-Merrell-Dow (Strasbourg, France). All other chemicals were obtained from Fisher. Plasmids Used—The His-tagged human AdoMetDC cDNA portion of the previously produced bacterial expression construct pQE-HISSAMI (22Xiong H. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(-) (Invitrogen) using PstI and XhoI restriction enzyme cuts on both the vector and original construct. Equal amounts of the empty pcDNA3.1/Zeo(-) vector were used as a transfection control for the His-tagged AdoMetDC construct. The mammalian expression vector MT123 expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin cDNA was obtained as a gift from the Bohmann laboratory (26Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar); an empty vector control plasmid BSSK- was made from this construct by removing the HA-ubiquitin portion of the construct with EcoRI and NotI restriction enzymes and then treating the linearized vector with 10 units of mung bean nuclease in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnSO4 at 37 °C for 30 min to remove cohesive ends. The blunt-ended vector was then re-ligated overnight at 37 °C using 3 units of T4 DNA Ligase. This empty vector was used as a control whenever the parent plasmid MT123 was used. Cell Culture Maintenance—COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM (plus 4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. T84 cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and DMEM medium with 5% FCS, 1 mm glutamine, 62.5 μg/ml streptomycin, 62.5 units/ml penicillin, and 0.15 μg/ml amphotericin B in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. H4IIE cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS, 5% newborn calf serum, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Stock cultures were maintained in 75 cm2 Corning Glass flasks, and experimental cultures were grown in 10- or 6-cm Falcon plates. The cells were subcultured when they were 70-80% confluent. ATP Depletion and Measurement—COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. At t = -4.5 h, medium was replaced with glucose-free medium, and at t = -1.5 h 10 mm NaCN and 50 mm 2-deoxyglucose was added. Cycloheximide (0.4 mm) was added at time 0 to control and ATP-depleted cells, and at t = 0 and at various time points afterward cells were lysed by three liquid N2 freeze-thaw cycles and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Aliquots of the resulting supernatant were removed for immediate AdoMetDC activity assay, for protein determination by the Bio-Rad method, for AdoMetDC antigen disappearance measurement, and for ATP measurement. ATP levels were determined by the firefly luciferase assay measured in a Berthold LB-953 luminometer, and 4.5 h of growth in glucose-free medium and 1.5 h in the presence of 10 mm NaCN and 50 mm 2-deoxyglucose lowered ATP levels at t = 0 to 8-15% those of controls. Viability was 75-85% in all groups at t = 2 h, as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Pulse-Chase Experiments and Immunoprecipitations—COS-7 cells were grown in methionine- or leucine- and serum-free DMEM (prepared using MEM Select-Amine kit) for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were then pulse-labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine protein labeling mix or 150 μCi/ml [4,5-3H(N)]leucine for 60 min at 37 °C. After 60 min, non-incorporated radioactivity was removed by washing the cells in warm DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. After indicated “chase” times of growth in non-radioactive media, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold isotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described by Mann et al. (27Mann K. Hunter T. Walter G. Linke H. J. Virol. 1977; 24: 151-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. After incubation with preimmune serum for 1 h (preclearing step) and then protein-A (30-min incubation), the lysates were incubated with anti-AdoMetDC polyclonal antibody for 3 h at 4 °C and then protein A for 1 h. The complexes were precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times with washing buffer 1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and once with washing buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The immunoprecipitated complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed extensively with fixing solution (30% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid), dried, and exposed to an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager screen for [35S] detection. To detect [4,5-3H(N)]leucine, gels was treated with Entensify solution, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm 3H (Amersham Biosciences) for one month. Transient Transfections and Purification of His-tagged AdoMetDC by Ni-NTA Magnetic Agarose Beads—COS-7 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes at a density of ∼8 × 105 cells. After several days' growth, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). To investigate whether ubiquitin was conjugated to His-AdoMetDC, cells were transfected with 4.1 μg of the HA-ubiquitin-expressing plasmid MT123 plus 1.4 μg of His-AdoMetDC-expressing plasmid. Control cells were transfected with 1.4 μg of His-AdoMetDC plus 4.1 μg of empty BSSK- vector or 4.1 μg of HA-ubiquitin-expressing plasmid MT123 plus 1.4 μg of the empty pcDNA3.1/Zeo(-) vector. After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with 50 μm MG-132 to inhibit the 26 S proteasome or vehicle control (0.1% Me2SO) for 4 h. Cells were harvested in imidazole harvesting buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, pH 8.0) and lysed by three quick freeze-thaw cycles in liquid N2. His-AdoMetDC was then bound to Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). After binding, the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). His-AdoMetDC was then eluted from the beads by elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) followed by electrophoretic separation and Western blotting. Transfected human AdoMetDC or His-tagged human AdoMetDC had degradation rates in COS-7 cells 2 days after transfection that were almost identical to the degradation rate of endogenous COS-7 cell AdoMetDC (results not shown). Western Blotting—Amersham Bioscience's ECF detection system was utilized for Western blotting according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions in 0.1% SDS (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes at 30 V overnight at 4 °C in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol). The next morning, the voltage was raised to 90 V for an additional hour to complete the transfer. The blots were then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-AdoMetDC antiserum (1:500 dilution) overnight in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20). The blots were then extensively washed with TBS-T and incubated with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h. To detect HA-ubiquitin-AdoMetDC conjugates or HA-ubiquitin expression, blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) for 1 h. The blots were extensively washed with TBS-T and then incubated with anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution) for 1 h. Finally, the blots were developed with ECF substrate for 3-5 min. The fluorescence developed was scanned with an Amersham Bioscience FluorImager using a 570-nm filter, and specific bands were quantified using ImageQuant software. AdoMetDC and ODC Activity Assays—Cells were harvested in AdoMetDC harvest buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm putrescine, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by three quick freeze-thaw cycles using liquid N2. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 min, and after removing a small aliquot for protein determination, the remainder of the cleared supernatants were preserved at -80 °C until assay. Equal amounts of protein from supernatants were assayed for AdoMetDC activity by measuring the amount of [14COOH]AdoMet converted into 14CO2 over 1 h of shaking at 37 °C. The assay mix consisted of 1.25 mm DTT, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 2.0 mm putrescine, and 3.84 μm [14COOH]AdoMet (57 mCi/mmol) in a total volume of 0.25 ml. 14CO2 was trapped in 0.3 ml of hyamine hydroxide contained in a center well (Kontes) located above the reaction mix in the middle of sealed assay tubes; after 1 h of incubation, 0.5 ml of 5N H2SO4 was injected through the rubber seal to stop the reaction. After a further 20 min of shaking at 37 °C, the hyamine hydroxide-containing center well was placed into 10 ml of scintillation mixture and counted. The specific activity was calculated as the amount of substrate converted (pmols) per mg of cell extract protein in 1 h at 37 °C (29Shirahata A. Christman K.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4417-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ODC activity was similarly measured as the amount of [1-14C]ornithine converted into 14CO2 over a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. The ODC assay mix contained 50 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3.125 mm DTT, and 0.1 μCi of [1-14C]ornithine (40-60 mCi/mmol) in a total volume of 0.2 ml (30Janne J. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1725-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet Analysis—Cells were harvested in AdoMetDC harvest buffer and lysed by three quick freeze-thaw cycles in liquid N2. After being centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and saved at -80 °C until HPLC analysis. Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were adjusted to 0.2 n perchloric acid and centrifuged again at 11,000 rpm for 10 min to remove acid-insoluble proteins. The supernatant was then used for the determination of AdoMet concentration. The HPLC system consisted of a Waters 600E multisolvent delivery system equipped with a Waters 484 tunable absorbance detector and a 25-cm × 2.1-mm column (packed with PO-ROS R2 medium (10-μm diameter; Perseptive Biosystems)). A gradient system run at 1.3 ml/min was used to separate AdoMet from other UV-absorbing compounds. Mobile phase A (Solution A) consisted of 90 mm o-phosphoric acid and 10 mm SDS. Mobile phase B (Solution B) consisted of 30% acetonitrile and 70% 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 10 mm SDS solution. The column was equilibrated with 20% Solution B and 80% Solution A for 4 min and then sample was injected followed by a linear change of solvent composition to 50% Solution B and 50% Solution A over 2 min, to 60% Solution B and 40% Solution A over 2 min, to 75% Solution B and 25% Solution A over 3 min, to 100% Solution B over 7 min, and finally washed isocratically at 100% Solution A for 15 min at a flow rate during the wash only of 2.0 ml/min. AdoMet and other peaks were detected at 260 nm. A standard curve was obtained as a function of known concentration of AdoMet and the corresponding peak area using linear regression with Prism 3.0 software, and unknown AdoMet concentrations were calculated from their peak areas using the standard curve. Protein Determination—The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad dye binding microassay. Bovine serum albumin at 1-20 pmol/μl was used as standard (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Half-life Calculation—The half-life of AdoMetDC or ODC was determined by stopping de novo protein synthesis by cycloheximide (0.4 mm) or by following the disappearance of radioactivity incorporated into the protein for appropriate times after radioactive precursor amino acids were removed. The log values of the specific activities or of the amount of antigen remained (expressed as the percentage of amount present at time 0) was plotted against time. With Prism 3.0 software, a line providing the best fit was obtained by fitting the data to the one-phase exponential decay equation using what is called nonlinear regression in the software package; the slope of this line (the degradation rate constant) was used to calculate half-life using the following standard equation, Nt = N0·e-kt and t½ = ln(2)k, where Nt represents the amount at time t, N0 is the initial amount, k is the degradation rate constant, and t is the time in hours. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were carried out with Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) using Student's two-tailed t test. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. For determination of significance of differences in half-lives, the calculated degradation rate constants and their associated standard errors were used to calculate t values. When multiple conditions were compared, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if significant overall differences in sample means were found (F test value p < 0.05), the Bonferroni post-test was used to determine the significance of individual treatment differences from controls. We first examined the effects of depletion of intracellular ATP on the loss of AdoMetDC antigen and activity. COS-7 cells were depleted of ATP (to 8-15% of control levels, as determined by the firefly luciferase method) with glucose-free medium, NaCN, and 2-deoxyglucose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 1 h in NaCN and 2-deoxyglucose, de novo protein synthesis was stopped by the addition of cycloheximide to the cells, and remaining antigenic AdoMetDC and AdoMetDC enzymatic activity were measured at the time points after cycloheximide addition indicated in Fig. 1. As seen in panel A of Fig. 1, ATP depletion completely inhibited degradation of AdoMetDC antigen; however, as seen in panel B, ATP depletion had no significant stabilizing effect on AdoMetDC activity, which disappeared at the same rate in the presence of normal or reduced ATP. We then examined the effect of several proteasome inhibitors on AdoMetDC degradation. Exponentially growing COS-7 cells were treated at time 0 with the peptidyl aldehyde proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and cycloheximide, and disappearance of antigenic protein was then followed for 3 h. Control cells were treated with cycloheximide and Me2SO (vehicle control for the proteasome inhibitor), which did not change the half-life compared with cells treated with cycloheximide alone (results not shown). From each time point, equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). As plotted in Fig. 2B, a half-life of 1.9 h for AdoMetDC antigen disappearance was observed in control cells, whereas the enzyme was completely stable when the 26 S proteasome was inhibited by MG-132. The enzyme was also stabilized when the cells were treated with the highly specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin or its active metabolite clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (data not shown). In contrast, the results from additional experiments (Fig. 2C) demonstrate that treatment of cells with the calpain inhibitor II (ALLM) or the metalloprotease inhibitor (1,10-phenanthroline) did not inhibit the degradation of AdoMetDC, whereas MG-132 completely prevented degradation (the experiments shown in Fig. 2C measured disappearance of radiolabeled rather than Western-blotted AdoMetDC, but no differences in the measured degradation rates were observed between the two methods). Similarly, pretreatment of cells with the lysosomal protease inhibitor NH4Cl showed no effects on AdoMetDC degradation (results not shown). Thus, neither calpains nor metalloproteases nor lysosomal proteases appear to have a significant role in normal intracellular AdoMetDC degradation. Taken together, these results indicate that the 26 S proteasome is responsible for the normal turnover of AdoMetDC in COS-7 cells. We also investigated the loss of endogenous AdoMetDC catalytic activity following the treatm"

In Escherichia coli, the b2δ subunit complex comprises the stator, bound to subunit a in F0 and to the α3β3 hexagon of F1. To quantitatively characterize binding of b subunit to the F1 α3β3 hexagon, we developed fluorimetric assays in which wild-type F1, or F1 enzymes containing introduced Trp residues, were titrated with a soluble portion of the b subunit (bST34–156). With five different F1 enzymes, Kd(bST34–156) ranged from 91 to 157 nm. Binding was strongly Mg2+-dependent; in EDTA buffer, Kd(bST34–156) was increased to 1.25 μm. The addition of the cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit increases the affinity of binding of δ subunit to δ-depleted F1. The apparent Kd(bST34–156) for this effect was increased from 150 nm in Mg2+ buffer to 1.36 μm in EDTA buffer. This work demonstrates quantitatively how binding of the cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit directly to F1 contributes to stator resistance and emphasizes the importance of Mg2+ in stator interactions.

This work demonstrates quantitatively how binding of the cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit directly to F1 contributes to stator resistance and emphasizes the importance of Mg2+ in stator interactions. F1F0-ATP synthase is the enzyme responsible for ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria and for ATP-driven generation of proton or sodium gradients in bacteria. Even before the discovery that it acts a molecular rotary motor (1Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar), it was clear that this was a protein of considerable structural complexity. In Escherichia coli, the F1 moiety lies peripheral to the membrane, with the subunit composition α3β3γδϵ, and the F0 moiety, consisting of subunits ab2cn (where n is not established at time of writing), is intrinsic to the membrane. Subunit complements in higher organisms can be considerably more complex, and there is notable variation in the number of c subunits between species (2Nakamoto R.K. Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Noji H. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Until 1994, the consensus based on electron microscopy (for one example, see Ref. 6Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and biochemical studies (for one example, see Ref. 7Hazard A.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 418-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was that F1 was bound to F0 by a single “central stalk” presumed to contain γ, ϵ, δ, and b subunits. The x-ray crystallography studies of F1 by Walker and colleagues (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 9Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) changed that view by showing that the central stalk did contain γ and ϵ subunits, but contrary to previous ideas, could not accommodate δ and b subunits for lack of space. Subsequently, electron microscopy studies (10Wilkens S. Zhou J. Nakayama R. Dunn S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and biochemical studies (11Capaldi R.A. Schulenberg B. Murray J. Aggeler R. J. Exp.

Biomembr. 2000; 32: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have established that the δ and b subunits form a separate stalk structure, at the periphery of F1. With the emerging view of ATP synthase as a rotary motor, the central stalk is now referred to as the rotor (consisting of γ,ϵ and the ring of c subunits) and the peripheral stalk (consisting of δ and b subunits) as the stator.The role of the stator (b2δ) is to hold one portion of the enzyme static (α3β3a) while the other portion rotates (γϵcring), thus allowing the very efficient transfer of energy between the proton “channel” and the catalytic sites (15Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Rotary strain can amount to >50 kJ/mol (15Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K.

It is an interesting question whether the b subunit also interacts directly with F1 α and/or β subunits. There is evidence that this is the case. For example, cross-linking studies showed that Cys residues introduced at positions 92, 109, or 110 in b could be cross-linked to α and/or β subunits (27McLachlin D.T. Coveny A.M. Clark S.M.

W Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis studies of F1 and the cytoplasmic portion of b showed formation of a complex (24Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also, the addition of the cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit altered the conformation of the F1 catalytic sites as shown by spin-labeling studies (29Kersten M.V. Dunn S.D. Wise J.G. Vogel P.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3856-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these approaches could not quantitatively determine the strength of interaction between b and F1.In this report, we titrated soluble F1 containing introduced Trp residues in the α or β subunit with a soluble cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit. By following the changes in fluorescence, we ascertained the Kd for direct interaction between b and F1. We then studied the influence of Mg2+ cation and of the presence or absence of δ subunit on the b/F1 interaction. In related studies, we studied the effects of Mg2+ cation on the ability of the cytoplasmic portion of b subunit to promote binding of δ subunit to F1, and we introduced Trp residues into the b subunit at residues 92 and 109 to test the effects on interaction with F1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of F1, Purification of δ subunit, Preparation of δ-depleted F1, Purification of bST34–156, Competition Assay of Binding of bST34–156 to F1 Using ATP-driven Proton Pumping in Reconstituted Membrane Vesicles, Routine Procedures—These were all as described previously (21Weber J.

Excitation was at 295 nm. For measurement of binding of purified δ subunit to δ-depleted F1, the δ-depleted F1 was the βW107 F1 from strain pSWM86/DK8 as described previously (21Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). βW107 F1 contains only the native Trp at residue β-107, it has normal functional properties, and it has a low Trp background signal in the δ-binding assay. Binding of δ subunit was monitored by enhancement of fluorescence at 325 nm (21Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

For measurement of binding of bST34–156 1bST34–156, soluble cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit (34Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). to F1, a series of different F1 enzymes was used in which novel Trp residues had been inserted into otherwise Trp-free F1 (see below). The fluorescence signal at 335 nm was monitored. For most of the enzymes used, this was close to λmax. No significant shift (>3 nm) in λmax occurred upon the addition of bST34–156 to any F1. It was ascertained that the presence of EDTA or Mg2+ had no effect on F1 fluorescence spectra, nor did depletion of the δ subunit. F1 concentration in the cuvette was varied from 100 to 500 nm. bST34–156 was added incrementally, usually up to 1.5 μm concentration (equivalent to 0.75 μm b2 dimer) but higher when necessary to reach saturation. All of the enzymes are expected from previous work to have fully occupied noncatalytic sites. To be sure that the signal changes seen on the addition of bST34–156 were not due to changes in nucleotide occupancy of catalytic sites, we conducted experiments on enzyme that had been passed consecutively through two 1-ml Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns in Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, which removes all catalytic site nucleotide while leaving the noncatalytic sites fully occupied (30Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were not altered in any way by this precaution. All fluorescence values were routinely corrected for the small Trp contamination in purified bST34–156 (see “Results”). Kd values for binding of bST34–156 and δ to F1 were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (21Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

The template was M13mp19 containing the EcoRI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pJB3 (34Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which contains a synthetic gene encoding a Met-Ser-Thr leader sequence followed by residues 34–156 of subunit b. The oligonucleotide for bA92W was 5′-GGACGAAGCGAAATGGGAGGCTGAGCAGGAACGTAC-3′, in which the italicized bases encode the Trp mutation and the underlined bases introduce a BlpI site. The oligonucleotide for bI109W was 5′-GGCGCAGGCGGAATGGGAAGCCGAGCGTAAACGTGC-3′, in which the italicized bases encode the Trp mutation and the underlined base deletes a BlpI site. Mutant clones were identified by BlpI digestion, and the entire inserts were sequenced to verify the presence of introduced Trp residues and absence of unwanted base changes. Mutations were then moved into pJB3 on EcoRI-HindIII fragments, and the resultant plasmids pSWM128 (bA92WST34–156) and pSWM129 (bI109WST34–156) were transformed into strain DK8 (42Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for expression and purification of the mutant bST34–156.RESULTSFluorescence Titration of F1 with the Soluble Cytoplasmic Portion of the b Subunit—The cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit used here was bST34–156, as described in Ref. 34Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. It consists of residues 34 through 156 (C terminus) of the b subunit with an additional Ser-Thr- sequence at the N terminus. We had previously confirmed (22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that it yields a single band on SDS gels after purification in soluble form and that it is fully functional as determined by the assay of Dunn (32Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which binding of F1 to stripped E. coli membranes is competed for by added bST34–156. Although theoretically bST34–156 contains no Trp residue, we found from its fluorescence spectrum in 6 m guanidine chloride that Trp contamination was present, in the amount of 0.09 mol/mol, and we routinely corrected for this. Titrations were carried out in either 5 mm MgSO4- or 0.5 mm EDTA-containing buffer.The fluorophore in the titrations was either the native Trp residues in wild-type F1 or Trp inserted at a single residue position in otherwise Trp-free F1. Wild-type F1 contains nine native Trps, comprised of three in α, three in β, two in γ, and one in δ subunit. We found that there was fluorescence enhancement on the addition of bST34–156 of maximally 8.6% (average of six experiments). This allowed calculation of Kd values for binding of bST34–156. Since the fluorescence enhancement seen in the βW107 enzyme (below) was +5.3%, it appears that this residue contributes significantly to the fluorescence enhancement seen in wild-type F1.A series of F1 variants in which all the native Trp had been substituted (43Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and a novel Trp had been incorporated at a single residue position in the α or β subunit was also tested. In each case, we confirmed that an E. coli strain containing the mutant enzyme showed normal growth on succinate plates and normal growth yield in limiting glucose, to ensure that enzyme function was not impaired. None of these F1 enzymes showed a fluorescence quench. Several of the enzymes gave no change in fluorescence when titrated with bST34–156 at concentrations up to 3.0 μm and F1 concentration of 100 nm. These were: αF291W, αI346W, βF17W, βY297W, and βR398W. A further group gave a fluorescence enhancement of ≤6% at the highest bST34–156 concentration. These were: αF409W, βF148W, βY331W, and βW107 (the last contains just the single natural Trp at residue β-107, with the other natural Trp residues substituted (21Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). A third group of F1 enzymes gave larger fluorescence changes on the addition of bST34–156. These were αL55W (+14.5%), αF406W (+8.5%), βY26W (+16%), and βF410W (+24%) (average values for between 4 and 20 experiments). We decided to use this last group for determination of Kd values.Typical titration curves for binding of bST34–156 to wild-type, αL55W, αF406W, βY26W, and βF410W F1 in the presence of Mg2+ are shown in Fig. 1, A–E, filled symbols. Calculated Kd values are shown in Table I. There was good agreement among Kd calculated for all five F1 enzymes, with the values being ∼100–150 nm. One would not expect that the introduced Trp residues in the mutant F1 would themselves perturb Kd significantly since all of the enzymes used show normal oxidative phosphorylation in vivo as judged by growth tests.Table IKd values for binding of the soluble cytoplasmic portion of the b subunit (bST34–156) to soluble F1F1KdaValues given are ± standard deviation with number of experiments in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab Effect of δ Subunit on Binding of bST34–156 to F1—Two approaches were used to investigate the effect of δ subunit on binding of bST34–156 to F1. First, we prepared δ-depleted F1 following the procedure in Ref. 21Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. This was done for several of the enzymes including αL55W, αF406W, βY26W, βF410W, and wild type. In all cases, the absence of δ was checked on SDS gels. We then titrated the δ-depleted F1 with bST34–156 and found that the titration curves were essentially the same as for the corresponding intact F1, yielding similar Kd values. Typical titration curves are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, for the βF410W and βY26W enzymes, respectively. In a second approach, we added pure δ subunit containing the δW28L mutation at 500 nm concentration (i.e. 5-fold excess over F1) to either intact F1 or δ-depleted F1 and then carried out the bST34–156 titrations. Again, no change in the titration curve was seen (data not shown). Therefore, the presence or absence of δ did not affect the titration curves or the Kd values.Fig. 2Fluorescence titration of intact and δ-depleted F1. 100 nm F1 was titrated with bST34–156.

For all of the enzymes, the degree of fluorescence enhancement was much reduced in the presence of EDTA, although there was indication of residual binding, and it appeared that the Kd value was increased to ≥1 μm. Of the five enzymes shown in Fig. 1, open symbols, only the βF410W enzyme had a signal enhancement in EDTA that was large enough (∼5%, Fig. 1E) to enable us to attempt to determine a Kd value. By using higher concentrations of F1 and bST34–156, we determined a Kd value of 1.25 μm (average of four experiments using 250–500 nm F1, Kd value range was 870 nm to 1.71 μm). A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Fluorescence titration of higher concentration of βF410W F1 with bST34–156 in presence of EDTA. 250 nm F1 was titrated with bST34–156 in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of bST34–156 to Increase Affinity of Binding of Isolated δ Subunit to δ-depleted F1 in Presence of EDTA—We had previously shown that bST34–156 strongly promotes the binding of isolated δ subunit to δ-depleted F1 in the presence of Mg2+ (22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In that work, we had used a mutant δ subunit preparation (δY11W/W28L) that binds relatively weakly in the absence of added bST34–156 to see the effect. (With wild-type δ, the Kd is already so low without added bST34–156 that little effect is seen upon the addition of bST34–156 due to technical limitations of the assay.) The Kd for binding of δY11W/W28L δ was reduced from 0.5 μm in the absence to ≤5 nm in the presence of bST34–156. The same effect was seen with other weakly binding mutant δ preparations (22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we repeated those experiments in EDTA-containing buffer. The enhancement of fluorescence of the δ-Trp-11 residue upon binding of δY11W/W28L subunit to δ-depleted βW107 F1 was measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). It was first confirmed that the addition of bST34–156 to the δY11W/W28L subunit had no effect on δ-Trp-11 fluorescence in the absence of F1. It is apparent (Fig. 4) that in the presence of EDTA, the Y11W/W28L mutant δ preparation showed essentially no binding to F1 in the absence of bST34–156, but in the presence of bST34–156, there was measurable binding, and the calculated Kd value for binding of δ was 745 nm (mean of five experiments). We confirmed that bST34–156 had the same effect to increase the affinity of other weakly binding mutant δ preparations (δY11A, δV79W/W28L, δV79A; data not shown).Fig. 4Binding of δY11W/W28L δ subunit to δ-depleted F1 in presence of EDTA, effect of bST34–156. Binding of δ subunit to δ-depleted F1 (100 nm) was measured by following the enhancement of δ-Trp-11 fluorescence at 325 nm (expressed in arbitrary units). The buffer contained 0.5 mm EDTA. Filled symbols, in the presence of 4 μm bST34–156; open symbols, in the absence of bST34–156. In the absence of bST34–156, the fluorescence response was too small to allow the determination of Kd.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To calculate the apparent Kd for the effect of bST34–156 to increase the affinity of δ-binding in EDTA, we carried out titrations in which bST34–156 was added incrementally to δ-depleted F1 (500 nm) in the presence of constant Y11W/W28L mutant δ (1 μm). Control experiments showed that under these conditions, there was essentially no change in the fluorescence of F1 due to the addition of bST34–156 when added δ was absent. Fig. 5 shows a typical experiment. From three such experiments, an average Kd (apparent) for bST34–156 of 1.36 μm was calculated. We also varied the concentration of added δ from 1 to 5 μm; this did not significantly affect the result. Previously, in Mg2+-containing buffer, Kd (apparent) of 150 nm for bST34–156 was reported (22Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The effect of EDTA is therefore substantial, and we may conclude that binding of bST34–156 is much tighter in the presence of divalent cation.Fig. 5Determination of apparent Kd(bST34–156) for promotion of binding of δY11W/W28L δ subunit to δ-depleted F1 in presence of EDTA. δ subunit (1 μm) and δ-depleted F1 (500 nm) were present at fixed concentrations, and bST34–156 was added incrementally as shown. Binding of δ subunit to δ-depleted F1 was measured by following the enhancement of δ-Trp-11 fluorescence at 325 nm. The buffer contained 0.5 mm EDTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Insertion of Trp at Positions 92 and 109 of b Subunit— Previous work has shown that Cys residues, inserted at positions Ala-92 and Ile-109 of the b subunit, may be cross-linked by a photoactivated cross-linking reagent to residues in the α and/or β subunits of F1 (27McLachlin D.T.

SecA can also bind to the lipid surface, where it associates with acidic phospholipids (1Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Google Scholar, 3Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Google Scholar) and seems to insert into the fatty acid acyl phase of the membrane (1Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Google Scholar, 2Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Google Scholar). This process of lipid association occurs with low affinity and is inhibited by ATP (9Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Korte-Kool G. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1119-1124Google Scholar). The translocation of preproteins across the membrane involves several rounds of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by SecA (1Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Google Scholar, 10Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Google Scholar, 11Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Google Scholar). On the basis of mutational and functional studies and the use of photoactivatable nucleotide analogues (11Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Google Scholar, 12Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Google Scholar, 13Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 145-150Google Scholar), it was suggested that SecA contains a high and a low affinity nucleotide binding domain (NBD). 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide binding domain; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; MANT, 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); PMF, proton motive force; DOPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol; IMV, inner membrane vesicle. The high affinity NBD corresponds to the catalytic site, whereas the low affinity NBD may act as a regulatory site. The structures of the Bacillus subtilis (15Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Google Scholar) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis SecA (16Sharma V. Arockiasamy A. Ronning D.R. Savva C.G. Holzenburg A. Braunstein M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2243-2248Google Scholar), however, show no evidence of a second catalytic NBD (17van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Google Scholar). The low affinity NBD may correspond to a nonfunctional nucleotide binding domain (11Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Google Scholar, 18Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Boulias K. Repanas K. Kyrpides N. Politou A.S. Economou A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 961-970Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding characteristics of the soluble SecA protein have been studied extensively (13Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Google Scholar, 14den Blaauwen T. van der Wolk J.P. van der Does C. van Wely K.H. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 145-150Google Scholar, 19Kourtz L. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1342-1356Google Scholar) and used as a model to describe the conformational states of SecA when actively involved in preprotein translocation. The translocation active state of SecA may, however, not be reflected by those studies, since this requires binding of SecA to the SecYEG complex (3Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Google Scholar, 12Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Google Scholar). On the other hand, nucleotide binding experiments with the SecYEG-bound SecA using natural membranes or membranes containing overexpressed SecYEG complex are complicated by the presence of many unrelated ATPases. Whereas purification and reconstitution provide a suitable functional alternative, high affinity binding of SecA to the reconstituted SecYEG complex has never been demonstrated for the purified proteins. This has been attributed to the very high nonspecific binding of SecA to the lipid surface (20Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Google Scholar). We have investigated the binding of nucleotides to SecA when bound to the SecYEG complex. For that purpose, we have devised a method that efficiently separates the high and low affinity-bound SecA fractions to SecYEG proteoliposomes. This method was combined with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments that monitor the interaction between fluorescent ATP analogues as acceptors of the intrinsic SecA tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of a tryptophanless variant of the SecYEG complex. The data demonstrate that binding of SecA to the SecYEG complex stimulates nucleotide exchange at SecA. This defines a novel intermediate step in the activation of SecA for preprotein translocation. Materials—SecA, SecB, pro-OmpA, and SecYEG and the tryptophanless SecYEG mutant were purified as described (4Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Google Scholar). SecYEG was reconstituted into liposomes composed of Escherichia coli phospholipids or synthetic liposomes as described (21van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Google Scholar). Synthetic phospholipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Birmingham, AL) were mixed in a 60:40 (w/w) ratio, and liposomes were prepared as described (22van der Does C. Swaving J. van Klompenburg W. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2472-2478Google Scholar). 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) (MANT)-labeled nucleotides were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Leiden, The Netherlands). Binding of Nucleotides to SecA-SecYEG Proteoliposomes—Liposomes or SecYEG proteoliposomes (0.05 mg of SecYEG protein/ml) were incubated with 50 nm [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgAc2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with or without 250 nm SecA dimer. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, proteoliposomes were spun (Beckman Airfuge, 30 p.s.i., 5 min) through a 15% (w/v) glycerol cushion in buffer A. Bound nucleotides were extracted from the pellet fraction and visualized as described (23Scheffers D.J. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1211-1219Google Scholar). For a kinetic analysis of nucleotide binding to SecA, proteoliposomes (0.67 μm SecYEG) were first preincubated (15 min, room temperature) in buffer A with SecA (400 nm dimer) and spun through a 15% (w/v) glycerol cushion in buffer A (Airfuge, 30 p.s.i., 5 min). The SecA-SecYEG proteoliposomes were recovered from the pellet fraction, resuspended in buffer A (0.13 μm SecYEG), and incubated with [32P]ADP (0–2 μm) for 15 min at room temperature. When indicated, SecB and pro-OmpA were added (0.5 μm). To separate bound from free nucleotide, the proteoliposomes were once again spun through a 15% (w/v) glycerol cushion, and the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting. The binding data were analyzed by curve fitting (SigmaPlot 2000; SPSS Inc.) using nonlinear regression. Binding of SecA to SecYEG Proteoliposomes—[14C]SecA was prepared by reductive methylation (24van der Wolk J.P. Klose M. Breukink E. Demel R.A. de Kruijff B. Freudl R. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 31-42Google Scholar) and found to retain full in vitro translocation and translocation ATPase activity. Binding of [14C]SecA to SecYEG proteoliposomes was performed essentially as described for nucleotide binding. SecYEG proteoliposomes were incubated with 2.5–650 nm [14C]SecA in buffer A with or without 1 mm ADP. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, proteoliposomes were spun (Beckman Airfuge, 30 p.s.i., 5 min) through a 15% (w/v) glycerol cushion in buffer A. Bound and free SecA were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, and the data were analyzed by Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS Inc.) using nonlinear regression assuming biphasic binding kinetics. Construction of Tryptophanless SecYEG Complex—To construct a tryptophanless SecYEG (Trp-less SecYEG) complex, the tryptophan residues of the individual proteins (SecY, 4 residues; SecE, 3 residues; SecG, 1 residue) were mutated to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis of the respective genes using mismatch oligonucleotides as described in Table I. The PCR products were then exchanged with the corresponding fragments in pET610 (25Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Google Scholar) to obtain Trp-less His-tagged secYEG under control of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible trc promoter (7van der Does C. den Blaauwen T. de Wit J.G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis.Table IMismatch primers used for site-directed mutagenesis of the secYEG genesGeneAmino acid substitutionMismatch oligonucleotidesaThe resulting amino acids (underlined) are shownsecYW173F5′-TTCCTGATGTTCTTGGGCGAACW300F/W302F5′-GCGGTACTGGTTTCAACTTCCTGACAACAATTTCGCTGW293F5′-GGCGACCATCGCGTCATTCTTCGGGGGCGGTACCGGTTTCsecEW19F5′-GCGATGAAGTTCGTCGTTGTGGTGW84F5′-GTAAGGTCATTTTCCCGACTCGCCAGGW109F5′-CACTGATCCTGTTCGGACTGGATGGsecGW84F5′-CACTCAGATTTTCAAATTCGCTACCa The resulting amino acids (underlined) are shown Open table in a new tab Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—Tryptophan emission spectra were measured on a Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 350 nm and a slit width of 4 nm. Binding of Fluorescent Nucleotides by SecA—Binding of MANT nucleotides was followed by FRET measurements using a temperature-controlled SLM-Aminco 4800C spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) with Glan-Thompson polarizers. The slit widths for the excitation and emission beam were set open, the excitation beam polarizer was set to 90°, and the emission polarizer was set to 0° to reduce light scatter. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured in time at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 350 nm, respectively. FRET to MANT-ATP or MANT-ADP was measured in time at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 450 nm, respectively. To measure binding of MANT-nucleotide to free SecA or Trp-less SecYEG proteoliposome-bound SecA, 0.147 μm MANT-nucleotide was added to a solution containing 0.26 μm SecA dimer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (or 0.2 mg/ml 60% DOPG, 40% DOPG liposomes). Trp-less SecYEG proteoliposome-bound SecA was obtained by incubating the proteoliposomes (2.6 μm Trp-less SecYEG and 0.2 mg/ml of phospholipid) and 5.2 μm SecA dimer for 20 min at room temperature and spun (Beckman Airfuge, 30 p.s.i., 5 min) through a 15% (w/v) glycerol cushion in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, and the final proteoliposome-bound SecA concentration was equalized to 0.26 μm SecA dimer by comparative SDS-PAGE. Dissociation of the MANT-nucleotide from SecA was measured after 30 min of binding and initiated by the addition of nucleotides (0.6 mm). Data were corrected for background and fitted using nonlinear regression on single exponential curves (SigmaPlot 2000, SPSS Inc.). Kinetics of Fluorescent Nucleotide Binding of SecA—The kinetics of MANT-nucleotide binding and release was monitored over a wide range of nucleotide concentrations (0.01–2 μm). MANT-nucleotide was added to a solution containing either 0.165 μm SecA dimer or 0.07 μm SecA dimer bound to Trp-less SecYEG proteoliposomes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, and the observed association rate (kobs) was calculated from the progress curves. The dissociation rate (koff) was determined after the addition of 0.6 mm ATP or ADP. The kobs values obtained at various MANT-nucleotide concentrations were analyzed according to the following relationship (26Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1999: 143Google Scholar): kobs=koff+kon×[MANT-nucleotide](Eq. 1) Data were fitted by linear regression, whereby the line was forced through the y intercept, which equaled the experimentally determined koff of the reaction. The slope of the line was used to calculate the kon for MANT-nucleotide binding to SecA. Other Methods—In vitro translocation of pro-OmpA into Trp-less SecYEG proteoliposomes (27de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46059-46065Google Scholar) and pro-OmpA-stimulated translocation ATPase activity of SecA assays (12Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Google Scholar) were performed as described. SecA concentration was determined spectroscopically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 83,000 m-1 cm-1 for monomeric SecA. Protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Nucleotide Binding to SecA-SecYEG Proteoliposomes—Binding of nucleotides to SecA free in solution has been studied extensively (13Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Google Scholar, 14den Blaauwen T. van der Wolk J.P. van der Does C. van Wely K.H. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 145-150Google Scholar), but no information is available on nucleotides binding to SecA associated with SecYEG complex (28Schmidt M. Ding H. Ramamurthy V. Mukerji I. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15440-15448Google Scholar). Inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) of E. coli bind SecA with high affinity at the SecYEG complex (1Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Google Scholar), but since this system contains many other ATPases that interfere with an accurate analysis of nucleotide binding, it is unsuitable for the analysis of nucleotide binding to SecYEG-bound SecA. Therefore, we have performed nucleotide binding experiments with purified SecA and reconstituted SecYEG proteoliposomes. Although the functional reconstitution of SecYEG into proteoliposomes is well established (29Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Google Scholar, 30Hanada M. Nishiyama K.I. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Google Scholar), the high affinity SecA binding has never been demonstrated for this system. Such experiments are complicated by the high nonspecific binding of SecA to the lipid surface, which masks the specifically bound fraction (20Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Google Scholar). We have therefore devised a method that allows the detection of nucleotide binding to the high affinity SecYEG-bound SecA in proteoliposomes. For this purpose, liposomes and SecYEG proteoliposomes were incubated with [32P]ATP with and without SecA (Fig. 1). The specific binding of [32P]ATP to the (proteo)liposomes was determined after centrifugation through a glycerol instead of a sucrose cushion to separate the lipid-bound and free nucleotide fraction. In previous studies, sedimentation through a sucrose cushion was shown to be ineffective with SecYEG proteoliposomes due to the high nonspecific SecA association with the lipid surface (20Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Google Scholar). Glycerol has been reported to preserve the native state of SecA (31Weinkauf S. Hunt J.F. Scheuring J. Henry L. Fak J. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 559-565Google Scholar), and therefore, sedimentation to a glycerol cushion more likely minimizes denaturation of SecA at the lipid surface. When [32P]ATP was incubated with liposomes (Fig. 1, lane 3) or SecYEG proteoliposomes (lane 5) in the absence of SecA, no radiolabel was recovered in the pellet fraction after glycerol cushion centrifugation. In contrast, a high level of nucleotide binding was observed in the pellet fraction when SecYEG proteoliposomes were incubated with SecA (lane 6), whereas only a small amount of radiolabel was recovered when liposomes were incubated with SecA (lane 4; less than 10% of the control SecA-SecYEG proteoliposomes). During the incubation, even at 4 °C, all bound [32P]ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP. These data suggest that the glycerol cushion effectively reduces the nonspecific binding of SecA to the lipid surface. To determine the kinetic parameters of nucleotide binding to the SecYEG-bound SecA, SecYEG proteoliposomes were prepared with specifically bound SecA by the method described above. Subsequently, the SecA-SecYEG proteoliposomes were incubated with [32P]ADP, and the bound and free nucleotides were separated by a second glycerol cushion centrifugation step. Fig. 2A shows a plot of the free ADP versus the ADP bound to the SecA-SecYEG proteoliposomes. The Kd for ADP binding to SecYEG-bound SecA was 63 ± 9 nm. The presence of the preprotein pro-OmpA (and SecB) had a minor effect on the ADP binding affinity (Kd 107 ± 14 nm, whereas the Bmax remained unchanged (56 ± 3 and 53 ± 3 nm, respectively). The number of ADP binding sites determined after the second glycerol cushion centrifugation was independent of the SecA concentration, provided that SecA was present in sufficient amounts to saturate all SecYEG binding sites (300 nm SecA dimer). The binding reaction was linearly dependent on the concentration of SecYEG in the range of 5–20 μg/ml. To determine the number of nucleotide binding sites per SecA dimer bound to SecYEG, SecA binding experiments were performed with the SecYEG proteoliposomes. Since this assay involves only a single glycerol centrifugation step, biphasic SecA binding kinetics were observed (Fig. 2B) that can be attributed to a small fraction of remaining nonspecifically bound SecA. SecA binds SecYEG with a Kd of 31 ± 5 nm. This value is similar to the one reported for IMVs (32de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Swaving J. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 17-21Google Scholar). The background SecA binding appeared nonsaturable in the range tested. The Bmax of 24 ± 2 nm for specific SecA dimer binding corresponds to about half (0.43 ± 0.07) the number of high affinity ADP binding sites that were determined with SecYEG proteoliposomes. This is equivalent to 1.1 ± 0.1 mol of ADP/mol of monomeric SecA. Therefore, we conclude that each SecYEG-bound SecA dimer contains two high affinity nucleotide binding sites. Binding of Fluorescent Nucleotides by SecA—To analyze the kinetics of nucleotide binding to SecA, we employed fluorescence (MANT)-labeled nucleotides (33Jameson D.M. Eccleston J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 363-390Google Scholar) in a nucleotide exchange assay. MANT-ATP was found to support the in vitro pro-OmpA translocation into SecYEG proteoliposomes (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that it functionally interacts with SecA and that it can drive protein translocation (27de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46059-46065Google Scholar), albeit with an almost 3-fold lower efficiency as compared with ATP. Nucleotide binding and release of SecA can be monitored by changes in MANT-nucleotide anisotropy (19Kourtz L. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1342-1356Google Scholar). Although anisotropy is a fast and easy way to monitor the association and dissociation of MANT-nucleotide to SecA, the presence of liposomes or SecYEG proteoliposomes severely interfered with the measurements (data not shown). A fraction of the MANT-ATP or ADP appears to intercalate with the lipid bilayer, which results in a huge rise in anisotropy. To circumvent this problem, we shifted to FRET measurements (34Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 368Google Scholar). Herein, the intrinsic protein fluorescence of SecA is used as a donor for the excitation of the bound MANT-nucleotide. The Förster distance (R0) of tryptophan residues varies up to 40 Å (35Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Google Scholar), which lies within the dimensions of SecA (36Ding H. Hunt J.F. Mukerji I. Oliver D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8729-8738Google Scholar). This makes FRET measurements insensitive to nonspecific background binding of MANT-nucleotides to lipids. Upon excitation of the Trp residues of SecA at 295 nm in the presence of MANT-ATP, the Trp fluorescence at 350 nm is decreased (Fig. 3B) with a concomitant increase in MANT fluorescence at 450 nm (Fig. 3C). The FRET could be reversed by the addition of an excess of nonlabeled ATP that chases the MANT-ATP from the SecA bound state (Fig. 3C). This chase reaction was accompanied by an increase in the Trp fluorescence (Fig. 3B). This effect was not observed when SecA was absent from the reaction or when Mg2+ was excluded from the system. MANT-ATP binding is strictly dependent on the presence of Mg2+ with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd,Mg2+) of 40 μm (data not shown). Construction and Functional Characterization of a Tryptophanless SecYEG Complex—To use FRET for measurements of nucleotide binding to SecA in the presence of the SecYEG complex, a tryptophanless (Trp-less) variant was constructed. The SecYEG complex contains eight tryptophan residues: four in SecY (Trp173, Trp293, Trp300, and Trp302), three in SecE (Trp19, Trp84, and Trp109), and a single Trp in SecG (Trp84). All tryptophan residues were mutated to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Table I), and the Trp-less variant of SecYEG was cloned in an expression vector under the control of the trc promoter with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag on SecY. To check the overexpression and functionality of the Trp-less SecYEG complex, IMVs were isolated from the SecYEG-over-producing strain. The Trp-less SecYEG complex could be overexpressed to the same level as the wild-type SecYEG complex (Fig. 4A). This result was verified for the individual subunits by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Wild type and Trp-less SecYEG complex were purified by ion exchange and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and reconstituted into liposomes composed of synthetic lipids (DOPE/DOPG, 60: 40, w/w) (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). The Trp-less and wild type SecYEG complexes were equally active in supporting pro-OmpA translocation (Fig. 4B), SecA translocation ATPase activity (Fig. 4C), and SecA binding (27de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46059-46065Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that none of the Trp residues of the SecYEG complex are essential for activity. Fig. 4D shows the fluorescence emission spectra at an excitation at 295 nm of the purified and reconstituted wild type and Trp-less SecYEG complexes. As expected, the Trp-less SecYEG variant showed no significant fluorescence above that of liposomes, which makes the Trp-less SecYEG complex suitable for our FRET measurement. Binding of Fluorescent Nucleotides to the SecYEG-bound SecA—To measure the nucleotide binding characteristics of SecA bound to SecYEG, SecA was incubated with Trp-less SecYEG proteoliposomes, and the complex was recovered by sedimentation through a glycerol cushion (Fig. 4E). FRET measurements on nucleotide binding to SecYEG-bound SecA protein showed a very fast rate of MANT-ATP binding and release upon the addition of an excess of ATP (Fig. 5, dark line). No FRET was observed when the Trp-less SecYEG proteoliposomes were prepared in the absence of SecA (dark gray line). Moreover, the rate of MANT-nucleotide release was nearly identical when, instead of ATP (dark line), ADP was used for the chase (light gray line). Next, the kinetic parameters of MANT-ATP binding were determined for SecA associated with the Trp-less SecYEG complex and compared with soluble SecA and SecA bound to DOPE/DOPG liposomes. In the presence of DOPE/DOPG liposomes, SecA readily associates with the lipid surface, and the majority of the SecA co-sediments with the liposomes after ultracentrifugation (20Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Google Scholar) (data not shown). The kinetics of MANT-ATP binding and release with SecA in solution (Fig. 6, A and D) or in the presence of liposomes (Fig. 6, B and E) were indistinguishable within the experimental error. Remarkably, substantial higher rates of MANT-ATP binding and release were observed with SecA bound to SecYEG proteoliposomes (Fig. 6, C and F). The enhanced rate is in particular pronounced with the nucleotide release. Whereas free or lipid-bound SecA only slowly releases the nucleotide, a 6–7-fold increase in the nucleotide dissociation rate, koff, is observed with the SecYEG-bound"
https://openalex.org/W2160731222,"The heightened interest in the development of novel anti-cancer drugs that trigger apoptotic death in cancer cells stems from the fact that immediately upon execution of the death signal, the corpse is efficiently removed via specific recruitment of phagocytic cells. This prevents spilling of cellular contents and the associated inflammatory response, a likely scenario during necrotic death. Recent evidence has established that phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells is a function of ligand-receptor interaction, whereby the ligand(s) for the scavenger receptor(s) of phagocytic cells is/are specifically expressed on apoptosing cells. Therefore, by implication, enhancing this ligand-receptor interaction could be an alternate means for removing unwanted cells. Here we present a provocative hypothesis that circumvents the need for chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. According to our model, cancer cells need not die in order to be removed by scavenger cells, but could still be effectively phagocytosed provided the cell surface expression of specific molecules that strongly engage phagocytic cells is sufficiently enhanced. In other words, inducing the expression of ""eat me"" signals on cancer cells could be a novel approach to ""bury alive"" these unwanted cells without the untoward effects of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2056164078,"The cytoprotective effect of heat stress proteins on epithelial cell detachment, an important cause of acute, ischemic renal failure, was examined after ATP depletion by evaluating focal adhesion complex (FAC) integrity. The intracellular distribution of FAC proteins (paxillin, talin, and vinculin) was assessed by immunohistochemistry before, during, and after exposure of renal epithelial cells to metabolic inhibitors. The resulting ATP depletion caused reversible re-distribution of all three proteins from focal adhesions to the cytosol. Paxillin, a key adaptor protein, was selected as a surrogate marker for FAC integrity in subsequent studies. Prior heat stress increased hsp72, a molecular chaperone, in both the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble protein fractions. Compared with ATP depleted control, heat stress significantly decreased paxillin and hsp72 shift from the Triton X-100 soluble to the insoluble protein fraction (an established marker of denaturation and aggregation); increased paxillin-hsp72 interaction detected by co-immunoprecipitation; enhanced paxillin extractability from Triton X-100-insoluble precipitates, increased the reformation of focal adhesions, and improved cell attachment (p < 0.05). To determine whether hsp72 mediates protection afforded by heat stress, cells were infected with adenovirus containing human hsp72 or empty vector. Hsp72 overexpression increased its interaction with paxillin and improved focal adhesion reformation during recovery, mimicking the protective effects of heat stress. These data suggest that hsp72 facilitates the reassembly of focal adhesions and improves cell attachment by reducing paxillin denaturation and increasing its re-solubilization after ATP depletion.

Acute ischemic renal failure is characterized by detachment of proximal tubule epithelial cells from the substratum, permitting backleak of glomerular filtrate and intra-tubular obstruction (1Brady H.R.

ATP depletion, an in vitro model of ischemia, disrupts the cytoskeleton, causing filamentous actin to be replaced by macromolecular aggregates of short actin polymers (4Sogabe K. Roeser N.F.

Physiol. 1998; 25: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), viable cells that originate from the proximal tubule have been harvested after an ischemic insult, suggesting that cell death is not a prerequisite for detachment. The tri-partite structure composed of integrins, the cytoskeleton, and cell-cell contact sites permit epithelial cells to adhere to the extracellular matrix. Attachment is directly mediated by the interaction between α and β integrins, transmembrane proteins that reside on the basolateral surface, and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) residues of extracellular matrix proteins (8Simon E.E. Liu C.H. Das M. Nigam S. Broekelmann T.J. McDonald J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F612-F623PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion is stabilized by the actin cytoskeleton by anchoring to the cytosolic domain of integrins (9Jockusch B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl K. Kroemker M. Moschner J. Rothkegel M. Rudiger M. Schluter K. Stanke G. Winkler J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 379-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) as well as to cell-cell contact sites (10Martin-Bermudo M.D. Brown N.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cytoskeleton-integrin connection is formed and regulated by the focal adhesion complex, which is located at the basolateral region of the epithelial cell (11Mueller S.C. Kelly T. Dai M.Z.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This complex, comprised of talin, vinculin, paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, Src, and other proteins, is crucial for regulating cell attachment. Stress-induced alterations in the activity and/or intracellular distribution of focal adhesion complex proteins cause detachment (13Gailit J. Colflesh D. Rabiner I. Simone J. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F149-F157PubMed Google Scholar). During ischemia in vivo or ATP depletion in vitro, many cytoskeletal-associated component proteins are either denatured or form large macromolecular aggregates (5Borkan S.C. Wang Y.H. Lieberthal W.

Structural proteins that comprise the cytoskeleton or cell adhesion sites are likely to interact with molecular chaperones because: 1) disruption of these cellular sites is one of the earliest morphologic features of ischemia (24Van Why S.K.

Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F347-F355PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Experientia. 1993; 49: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Fish E.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F566-F572PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the pathologic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell contact sites that accompany ATP depletion, alterations in focal adhesion complex proteins are poorly characterized. Intracellular proteins that are denatured or aggregate during ATP depletion are likely targets for rescue by molecular chaperones (20Kabakov A.E. Budagova K.R. Latchman D.S. Kampinga H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C521-C534Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Rassow J. von Ahsen O. Bomer U. Pfanner N.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15710-15717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp72, a known cytoprotectant protein, is induced by renal ischemia in vivo (30Emami A. Schwartz J.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F479-F485PubMed Google Scholar) and acts as a molecular chaperone, binding and repairing non-native proteins (20Kabakov A.E. Budagova K.R. Latchman D.S. Kampinga H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C521-C534Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Beissinger M. Buchner J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hartl F.U. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although the chaperone function of hsp72 is well characterized, its role in protecting proteins involved in cell attachment has not been previously described. The present study evaluated the hypothesis that hsp72 protects cell attachment, at least in part, by interacting with proteins that comprise the focal adhesion complex. ATP depletion caused hsp72 and paxillin (an adaptor protein that localizes to the focal adhesion plaque) to shift from the Triton X-100-soluble protein fraction (containing primarily cytosolic proteins) to the Triton X-100-insoluble pool (containing cytoskeletal and other structural proteins). In addition, ATP depletion caused the reversible re-distribution of talin, vinculin, and paxillin from focal adhesion plaques into the cytosol. Loss of focal adhesion staining was associated with cell detachment. Prior heat stress prevented the loss of paxillin from the detergent-soluble protein pool, increased paxillin extractability from the detergent-insoluble pool, enhanced paxillin staining in focal adhesion plaques during recovery from ATP depletion, and increased cell attachment (p < 0.05). Both heat stress and ATP depletion increased the interaction between paxillin and hsp72, suggesting that protein repair facilitates the re-entry of paxillin into the focal adhesion plaque during recovery from ATP depletion. Selective overexpression of hsp72 also increased its interaction with paxillin and reproduced the protective effect of prior heat stress on the reformation of focal adhesion plaques. These studies suggest that hsp72 prevents focal adhesion protein denaturation and increases the release of focal adhesion components from detergent-insoluble protein aggregates. By preventing primary protein denaturation and secondarily, by increasing the content of functional proteins available for re-assembly of focal adhesions, hsp72 exerts cytoprotective effects on cell attachment. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Opossum kidney cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1840) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were used within 72 h of achieving confluence as assessed by visual inspection with a phase-contrast microscope. In opossum kidney cells, ATP content was reduced by exposure to 1 h of glucose-free medium (catalog 5030) containing sodium cyanide (5 mm) and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (5 mm). This maneuver causes equivalent reductions in ATP content to <10% of the baseline value within 10 min in both control and previously heated renal epithelial cells (32Wang Y.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1057-F1065PubMed Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm glucose without metabolic inhibitors was added to initiate recovery. Parallel medium changes were made in controls using glucose-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. To induce hsp72, opossum kidney cells were heated to 43 ± 0.5 °C for 45-60 min in a temperature-regulated incubator followed by incubation at 37 °C for 12-16 h (32Wang Y.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1057-F1065PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were co-infected with adenoviruses containing wild-type human hsp72 and green fluorescent protein (AdTR5/hsp70-GFP) expressed on separate cistrons and a tetracycline-regulated promoter (AdCMV/tTA) kindly provided by Dick Mosser (University of Guelph, Ontario Canada) as recently described (33Mao H.

Control cells were co-infected for 24 h at 37 °C with 3 × 107 plaque-forming units/35-mm2 Petri dish of AdTR5/GFP and AdCMV/tTA. Infection efficiency for both viruses was >95% as estimated by direct visualization of GFP. 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. After 24 h exposure to either adenovirus, cells were subjected to ATP depletion as described above. Whole Cell Lysate—Harvested cells were re-suspended in cell lysis buffer (described below) containing a protease mixture (10 units/ml). Cells were sonicated and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was designated as the whole cell lysate. Triton X-100 Extraction—Monolayers of cells in individual, 60-mm2 culture dishes were incubated for 30 min on a rocker at 4 °C with 0.4 ml of Triton X-containing CSK extraction buffer containing (in mm): NaCl, 50; sucrose, 300; PIPES, 10; MgCl2, 3; and Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) and protease inhibitor mixture (10 units/ml) at pH 7.40. After centrifugation (13,000 rpm × 15 min at 4 °C), the supernatant (the Triton X-soluble protein fraction) was harvested. The pellet (the Triton X-insoluble protein fraction) was sonicated at 4 °C in 0.1 ml of SDS immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing (in mm): Tris-HCl, 10; EDTA, 0.5; DTT, 0.5; with DNase, 0.1 mg/ml; RNase, 0.1 mg/ml), a protease inhibitor mixture (10 units/ml) and SDS (1%). Protein components of the focal adhesion plaque including paxillin (catalog number 05-417), talin, (catalog number 05-385), and vinculin (catalog number 05-386) were examined using commercially available antibodies (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY). Hsp72 (catalog number SPA-810, StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and hsp27 (Santa Cruz catalog number SC-1049) were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for these proteins. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-based enzyme-linked chemiluminescence system as previously described (33Mao H. Li F. Ruchalski K. Mosser D.D. Schwartz J.H. Wang Y.

Immunodetected protein bands were quantified using NIH Image Quant Software after scanning the blot with a densitometer (Hewlett-Packard, Desk Scan II). Species-specific Cy3-linked secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used for all immunohistochemical studies in cells fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde after permeabilization with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate as previously reported (5Borkan S.C. Wang Y.H. Lieberthal W. Burke P.R. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F347-F355PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported (33Mao H. Li F. Ruchalski K. Mosser D.D. Schwartz J.H. Wang Y.

Apyrase and EDTA prevent ATP and Mg-mediated release of potential binding partners from hsp72 (33Mao H. Li F. Ruchalski K. Mosser D.D. Schwartz J.H. Wang Y. Borkan S.C. J. Biol.

After centrifugation (14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), 250-500 μg of total protein of supernatant was “pre-cleared” for 1 h with non-immune serum (10 μl/mg protein) obtained from the same host species as the primary antibody. Supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-paxillin (Santa Cruz, catalog number SC-5574), anti-hsp27 (Stressgen, catalog number SPA-803), or anti-hsp72 (Stressgen, catalog number SPA-810) antibody titrated to permit equivalent yields of paxillin under each experimental condition (8 μg/mg of protein/ml of IP buffer). Immobilized protein G-agarose was added to the solution during the final 2 h of incubation. An agarose pellet was obtained by centrifugation and then washed for 5 min with high stringency buffer (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm DTT (“HS-B”)) with 1 m sucrose, pH 7.5. Samples were then washed in a high salt buffer (HS-B + 1 m NaCl) followed by a final wash in low salt buffer (2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Samples were mixed with 2× sample buffer in preparation for SDS-PAGE. Blots were then probed for paxillin, hsp27, and hsp72 as described above. Protein concentrations were determined from a colorometric dye binding assay (BCA Assay, Pierce, Rockford, IL) and expressed in milligrams of protein per milliliter. The mean number ± S.E. of cells containing at least 10 focal adhesion plaques was assessed in 4-7 random fields of ATP depleted in two separate experiments by an observer blinded to the experimental conditions. The mean number of detached cells was determined in at least three randomly selected fields of subconfluent monolayers (85-90% confluent) 30 min after 1 or 1.5 h of ATP depletion by an observer blinded to the experimental conditions. Minimal apoptosis (34Wang Y. Knowlton A.A. Christensen T.G. Shih T. Borkan S.C. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2224-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or necrosis (32Wang Y.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1057-F1065PubMed Google Scholar) have been observed at this time point in renal epithelial cells subjected to transient ATP depletion. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Experimental groups were compared using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Analysis was performed with standard statistical software (Excel, Microsoft Corp., Santa Monica, CA). Effect of ATP Depletion and Prior Heat Stress on Cell Attachment—After transient ATP depletion followed by 30 min recovery, numerous detached cells were visible by routine contrast microcopy. After 1 or 1.5 h of ATP depletion, ∼25 and 41% of cells, respectively, were detached (Fig. 1). Prior heat stress significantly reduced the number of detached cells to 9 and 13%, respectively, after both periods of injury (p < 0.05 versus control at each time point). In the absence of ATP depletion, only 4-5% of cells were detached in control or heat-stressed cells (data not shown; p > 0.05). Effect of ATP Depletion and Prior Heat Stress on Focal Adhesion Integrity—Several components of focal adhesion complex were examined by immunohistochemical analyses. ATP depletion caused a marked re-distribution of vinculin, talin, and paxillin from the adhesion plaque into the cytosol. In control, focal vinculin (Fig. 2A) and talin (Fig. 2B) staining in adhesion plaques were visualized. Immediately after ATP depletion, however, virtually no intact adhesion plaques (i.e. vinculin or talin staining) could be observed. After 30 min recovery, many adhesion plaques were again visualized. Similar results were obtained in control cells stained with antibody directed against paxillin, another protein that localizes to the focal adhesion (Fig. 3A). At baseline, both control and previously heat-stressed cells exhibited an identical pattern of paxillin staining in focal adhesions (Fig. 3A, left upper panel versus left lower panel). As described for both vinculin and talin, no focal adhesions were seen immediately after 1 or 1.5 h of ATP depletion in either control or heated cells (images not shown). After 30 min recovery from transient ATP depletion, paxillin staining was more abundant in heat-stressed cells (Fig. 3A, right lower versus right upper panels). To quantify this difference, the number of cells with at least 10 visible focal adhesion plaques was counted before, during, and after ATP depletion (Fig. 3B). At baseline, >10 focal adhesion plaques were observed in virtually all control and previously heated cells. Immediately after 1 h ATP depletion, no adhesion plaques were visible in either experimental group. After 15 or 30 min recovery, however, less than 5% of control cells exhibited ≥10 focal adhesion plaques. In contrast, >10 focal adhesions were visible in nearly 30% of previously heated cells (p < 0.05 versus control at both time points). Because all three focal adhesion proteins exhibited a similar pattern of re-distribution following ATP depletion, paxillin was selected as a marker of focal adhesion integrity in subsequent studies.Fig. 3Effect of prior heat stress on paxillin in focal adhesions following ATP depletion. A, control (upper panels) and previously heated (lower panels) cells were examined at baseline and after 1 h of ATP depletion followed by 30 min recovery. Focal adhesions were visualized using antibody directed against paxillin. B, the number of control (open bars) and previously heated (solid bars) cells with visible focal adhesion plaques was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open bars, data represent the mean ± S.E. Some S.E. bars are too small to be seen. *, p < 0.05 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Transient ATP Depletion on Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble Protein—In cells subjected to 1 h ATP depletion followed by 30 min recovery, a progressive, reciprocal shift in the relative amounts of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble total cell protein was observed (Fig. 4). At baseline, ∼28% of total cell protein was insoluble. Insoluble protein increased to 35% after 1.5 h ATP depletion and represented almost half (48%) of the total cell protein following 30 min recovery. These data demonstrate that the absence of ATP alters protein conformation and precipitates aggregate formation. Effect of Prior Heat Stress on the Triton X-100 Solubility of Paxillin—Compared with control, the relatively rapid recovery of paxillin staining suggested that heat stress exerted a cytoprotective effect on the re-assembly of focal adhesions. To evaluate this hypothesis, the detergent solubility of paxillin was examined. In control, ATP depletion resulted in the progressive shift of paxillin from the detergent-soluble to the -insoluble protein fraction (Fig. 5A). This shift was significantly reduced by heat stress (fig 5B; p < 0.05), suggesting that heat-inducible proteins protect paxillin from ATP depletion-mediated denaturation. In addition to preventing paxillin denaturation, prior heat stress could promote focal adhesion reassembly by enhancing paxillin release from the detergent-insoluble protein pool. To evaluate this hypothesis, the content of immunoreactive paxillin was serially assessed in Triton X-100-insoluble protein fractions obtained from control and previously heated cells subjected to ATP depletion as outlined (Fig. 6A). In this in vitro assay, various maneuvers were used to extract paxillin from the Triton X-100-insoluble protein fraction. The content of immunodetectable paxillin was used to estimate the amount of paxillin available to reassemble focal adhesions. In the absence of ATP (+ ayprase) or the presence of ATP and magnesium (“ATP + Mg”), virtually no paxillin could be detected at any time point before, during, or after ATP depletion in the detergent-insoluble protein fraction (Fig. 6B, upper portions of the top and middle panels). The combination of ATP, magnesium, high temperature (100 °C), and a reducing agent (DTT) resulted in modest paxillin release during recovery from ATP depletion (upper portion of panel C). The addition of prior heat stress to each of these maneuvers markedly increased paxillin release under all experimental conditions (lower portion of panels A-C). Heat stress was most effective for extracting paxillin from the detergent-insoluble protein fraction. Effect of ATP Depletion on the Triton X-100 Solubility of Hsp72—Because hsp72 has been reported to bind and repair non-native proteins, the detergent solubility of hsp72 was serially examined. At baseline, hsp72 was detected in both the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 7A). Prior heat stress markedly increased hsp72 content in both the detergent-soluble and -insoluble protein fractions. ATP depletion (1 h) and recovery (30 min) resulted in a marked, reciprocal shift in immunoreactive hsp72 from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble protein fraction (Fig."

Nha1p has a two-domain structure composed of integral membrane and hydrophilic tail regions. Overexpression of a peptide of ∼40 residues (C1+C2 domains) that is localized in the juxtamembrane area of its cytoplasmic tail caused cell growth retardation in highly saline conditions, possibly by decreasing Na+/H+ antiporter activity. A multicopy suppressor gene of this growth retardation was identified from a yeast genome library. The clone encodes a novel membrane protein denoted as COS3 in the genome data base. Overexpression or deletion of COS3 increases or decreases salinity-resistant cell growth, respectively. However, in nha1Δ cells, overexpression of COS3 alone did not suppress the growth retardation. Cos3p and a hydrophilic portion of Cos3p interact with the C1+C2 peptide in vitro, and Cos3p is co-precipitated with Nha1p from yeast cell extracts. Cos3p-GFP mainly resides at the vacuole, but overexpression of Nha1p caused a portion of the Cos3p-GFP proteins to shift to the cytoplasmic membrane. These observations suggest that Cos3p is a novel membrane protein that can enhance salinity-resistant cell growth by interacting with the C1+C2 domain of Nha1p and thereby possibly activating the antiporter activity of this protein.

However, the molecular details of these regulatory interactions remain to be determined. The yeast Na+/H+ antiporter SOD2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was originally discovered as a factor that makes the cell growth resistant to high NaCl levels in the medium (11Jia Z.P. McCullough N. Martel R. Hemmingsen S. Young P.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The SOD2 isoform denoted as NHA1 also exists in other yeasts (26Watanabe Y. Miwa S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to antiport Na+ for H+ (30Banuelos M.A. Sychrova H. Bleykasten-Grosshans C. Souciet J.L. Potier S.

As with the mammalian NHE family, the Nha1p family of proteins bear a highly conserved integral membrane region and a structurally diverse cytoplasmic tail region (28Kamauchi S. Mitsui K. Ujike S.

Nha1p-mediated export of Na+ is coupled to the proton motive force created by the H+-translocating ATPase on the cytoplasmic membrane (31Sychrova H. Ramirez J. Pena A. FEMS Microbiol.

Although the overall primary sequences of the cytoplasmic tail regions of the various Nha1p proteins vary among various yeast species, we have reported that this region bears six small but distinct conserved domains that we have denoted C1 to C6 (28Kamauchi S. Mitsui K. Ujike S. Haga M. Nakamura N. Inoue H. Sakajo S. Ueda M. Tanaka A. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have also shown that these conserved domains probably play similar functions in yeast and other fungi (28Kamauchi S. Mitsui K. Ujike S. Haga M. Nakamura N. Inoue H. Sakajo S. Ueda M. Tanaka A. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The C1, C2, and C3 domains consist of 16, 23, and 15 residues, respectively, and are located at the juxtamembrane area of the cytoplasmic tail region. Deletion of these domains decreases salinity-resistant growth, which suggests that these domains are important for growth during highly saline conditions, possibly because they influence the antiporter activity of Nha1p (28Kamauchi S. Mitsui K. Ujike S. Haga M. Nakamura N. Inoue H. Sakajo S. Ueda M. Tanaka A. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms by which these domains confer salinity resistance have not yet been clarified. In this study, we analyzed the role that these domains play in the high salinity-resistant growth of cells. We found that the C1+C2 domains bind to a novel membrane protein and that this binding event enhances salinity-resistant cell growth, possibly by increasing the antiporter activity of Nha1p.

These strains were routinely grown in rich medium (YPD) (37Sherman F.

Escherichia coli JM109 (38Messing J. Vieira J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) and BL21 were used to propagate the plasmids and to express various proteins. E. coli cells were cultured in L broth (39Kanazawa H. Miki T. Tamura F. Yura T. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Screening for a Multicopy Suppressor of Growth Retardation in Highly Saline Conditions—G19 cells transformed with a plasmid that expresses the C1+C2 domain peptide (pKT10-NHA1(C1+C2)) were further transfected by a multicopy genomic library (kindly provided by Drs. Yoh Wada and Masamitsu Futai, Osaka University) derived from YEp13 (40Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The transformed G19 cells were then plated on pH 5.5 SD plates that had been supplemented with 0.4 m NaCl and lacked Leu. After 4 days of incubation at 37 °C, leu+ cells that appeared on the selecting plate were isolated as candidate cells bearing a suppressor of high salinity-induced growth retardation. The restriction sites in the plasmids recovered from the candidate yeast cells were determined. The recovered plasmids were then reintroduced into the same genetic background. Plasmids—Plasmids 4-3-1 and 4-3-2 were constructed from the isolated library clone 4-3 as follows. A ClaI-SacI 6.2-kb fragment was isolated from 4-3 by digestion with ClaI and SacI, and this was ligated into pRS424 (41Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

The plasmids pKT10-NHA1(C1+C2)-GFP, pKT10-NHA1(C1)-GFP, and pKT10-NHA1(C2)-GFP contain DNA fragments encoding GFP-tagged parts of the hydrophilic domain (residues 434-523, 434-449, and 453-523, respectively) of Nha1p. pKT10-COS3Loop-FLAG and pKT10-Cos3pTail-FLAG contain DNA fragments encoding FLAG-tagged parts of the hydrophilic domain (residues 94-224 and 297-379, respectively) of Cos3p. All of these GFP- or FLAG-tagged plasmids were constructed by amplification by PCR with primer oligonucleotides (Table I, lines 3-10) and cosmid 2A16 (28Kamauchi S. Mitsui K. Ujike S. Haga M.

Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5539) Google Scholar), pRS316-COS3-GFP was constructed as follows. The ClaI-SacI 6.3-kb fragment of plasmid 4-3-1, which encodes the COS3 open reading frame (ORF), was cloned into the CEN plasmid pRS316 (41Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid thus created was named pRS316-COS3. Two DNA fragments containing the 0.5-kb 3′-UTR of COS3 or the COS3 ORF plus the 1.7-kb 5′-UTR were amplified with the appropriate primers shown in Table I (lines 11-14) and then digested with SphI and XhoI or XhoI and XbaI, respectively. The 2.8-kb SphI-XhoI and the 0.5-kb XhoI-XbaI fragments thus created were inserted together into the SphI and XbaI restriction sites of the pUC18 vector to generate the plasmid pUC18-COS3. The 0.7-kb DNA fragment encoding GFP that was amplified with primers containing an XhoI restriction site sequence (Table I, lines 15 and 16) was inserted into pUC18-COS3 after digestion with XhoI. The 4.2-kb SphI-XbaI fragment encoding the COS3-GFP fusion that was derived from the GFP-bearing pUC18-COS3 plasmid was used to replace a 3.5-kb XbaI-SphI fragment from pRS316-COS3 to construct pRS316-COS3-GFP. pKT10-COS3-GFP was created by amplification of the entire COS3 ORF with appropriate primers (Table I, lines 17 and 18), followed by digestion with EcoRI and SphI and insertion into the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pKT10 together with the 0.7-kb GFP fragment that had been amplified from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) with primers containing SphI and SalI sites (Table I, lines 19 and 20). Plasmids p520-NHA1 and the His6-tagged p520-NHA1-His were constructed to express the full-length NHA1 in yeast under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter in p520 (a kind gift from Dr. Yoshinobu Kaneko, Osaka University), which is a multicopy yeast expression vector that is trp+. DNA fragments encoding the full-length NHA1 protein were amplified with suitable primers (Table I, lines 21-23) using the cosmid 2A16 (28Kamauchi S. Mitsui K. Ujike S. Haga M. Nakamura N. Inoue H. Sakajo S. Ueda M. Tanaka A. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as the template and then digested with KpnI and SalI or KpnI and SphI. To construct p520-NHA1-His, the KpnI-SphI fragment was inserted together with the SphI-SalI His6 tag adaptor (Table I, lines 24 and 25) between the KpnI and SalI restriction sites of the p520 vector. To construct p520-NHA1, the KpnI-SalI fragment was inserted between the KpnI and SalI restriction sites of the p520 vector. Disruption of the COS3 Locus in the G19 Strain—The 1.8-kb SphI-BglII and the 2.2-kb HincII-SacI fragments that correspond to the upstream and downstream halves of the COS3 ORF, respectively, and that were derived from the 4-3 plasmid, were inserted between the unique SphI and BglII sites and SmaI and SacI sites, respectively, of the pJJ281 plasmid (44Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) that contains the TRP1 marker to create the targeting sequence of COS3 disruption. The 4.9-kb SphI-SacI targeting fragment thus created was introduced into the G19 strain, and TRP+ clones were selected by growth on SD plates lacking tryptophan. The replacement was verified by PCR analysis. Detection of Intracellular Localization of Cos3p-GFP by Fluorescence Microscopy—SK5 or G19 cells expressing Cos3p-GFP fusion proteins were grown in SD medium at 30 °C to the logarithmic growth phase and then examined by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51) with appropriate filter sets (narrow band 1B excitation cube). Fractionation of the Whole Cell Proteins and Immunoblot Analysis— Cells were grown to the logarithmic growth phase, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)), and then disrupted with glass beads at 4 °C. After removing unbroken cells and debris, the cleared cell extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to generate the pellet (P100) and supernatant (S100) fractions containing the membrane and soluble proteins, respectively. For the extraction experiments, the P100 fraction was incubated for 30 min on ice with 1 m NaCl or 1% Triton X-100 and then spun at 100,000 × g to give the supernatant and the pellet fractions. Each fraction was resuspended in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. The fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane filter (GVHP, Millipore) (45Miki J. Fujiwara K. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21567-21572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were treated with anti-GFP serum (Molecular Probes) or anti-Nha1p polyclonal antibody prepared as described below. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by means of the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences) (46Gillespie P.G. Hudspeth A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), as described previously (45Miki J. Fujiwara K. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21567-21572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation of Membranes by Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Fractionation of yeast cell extract by centrifugation through a sucrose step gradient was performed according to the procedure published previously (47Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 A600 units of mid-log phase cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and resuspended in 5 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 9.4, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of spheroplast medium (1 m sorbitol in SD medium). Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo,"
https://openalex.org/W2026194198,"A set of asymmetric hybrid tetramers of Escherichia coli d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH) have been made by gene co-expression and KSCN-induced dimer exchange. These tetramers contain varied numbers of active sites and effector binding sites arranged in different orientations within the tetramer. They reveal that PGDH displays half-of-the-sites activity with respect to its active sites and that the two sites that are active at any particular time lie in subunits on either side of the nucleotide binding domain interface. Half-of-the-sites functionality is also observed for the effector even though all four sites eventually bind effector. That is, only two effector sites need to be occupied for maximum inhibition. Binding of the last two effector molecules does not contribute functionally to inhibition of activity. Furthermore, positive cooperativity of inhibition of activity by the effector is completely dependent on the positive cooperativity of binding of the effector. Binding of the first effector molecule produces a conformational change that essentially completely inhibits the active site within the subunit to which it binds and produces an approximate 33% inhibition of the active site in the subunit to which it is not bound. Binding of the second effector at the opposite regulatory domain interface completes the inhibition of activity. This simple relationship defines the positional and quantitative influence of effector ligand binding on activity and can be used to predict the maximum level of inhibition of individual hybrid tetramers. In addition, the site-specific quantitative relationship of effector binding to individual active sites can be used to model the inhibition profile with relatively good agreement. These simple rules for the site to site interaction in PGDH provide significant new insight into the mechanism of allostery of this enzyme."

We report here the crystal structures at up to 2.0-Å resolution of YiaK alone and in complex with NAD-tartrate. YiaK has a new polypeptide backbone fold and a novel mode of recognizing the NAD cofactor. In addition, NAD is bound in an unusual conformation, at the interface of a dimer of the enzyme. The crystallographic analysis unexpectedly revealed the binding of tartrate in the active site. Enzyme kinetics studies confirm that tartrate and the related d-malate are inhibitors of YiaK.

The free enzyme conformation is incompatible with NAD binding. His44 is likely the catalytic residue of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli, yiaK is the first gene in a nine-gene operon (1Sofia H.J. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Plunkett G. Blattner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), yiaKLMNOPQRS (yiaK-S), that is believed to be required for the utilization of rare sugars for growth. Mutational deactivation of the regulator of this operon, yiaJ, located just prior to yiaK but in the opposite orientation, leads to the constitutive expression of all the proteins of the operon, which enables bacteria carrying this mutation to utilize the rare pentose l-lyxose (2Badia J. Ibanez E. Sabate M. Baldoma L. Aguilar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8376-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, not all of the genes of the operon are needed for the metabolism of this sugar. It is believed that l-lyxose is first converted to l-xylulose. Then the YiaP, YiaR, and YiaS proteins, encoded in the second half of the operon, can convert l-xylulose to d-xylulose 5-phosphate, which can in turn enter the pentose phosphate pathway (3Ibanez E. Gimenez R. Pedraza T. Baldoma L. Aguilar J. Badia J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4625-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that l-xylulose is only an intermediate from the action of the YiaK-S proteins on the genuine substrate(s) of this operon, which is currently still unknown (4Ibanez E. Campos E. Baldoma L. Aguilar J. Badia J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The YiaK protein catalyzes the reduction of 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate (DKG) 1The abbreviations used are: DKG, 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate; JK loop, loop linking helices αJ and αK. in the presence of NADH, and the product of the reduction is believed to be 3-keto-l-gulonate (see Fig. 1A) (5Yew W.S. Gerlt J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Volk W.A. Larsen J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2454-2457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DKG can be obtained from the hydrolysis of l-dehydroascorbate. Another operon in E. coli, yif-sga (now known as ula), is involved in the fermentation of l-ascorbate (5Yew W.S. Gerlt J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The yiaK-S operon may be involved in the utilization of l-dehydroascorbate. YiaK belongs to a large family of putative oxidoreductases that have members from bacteria and archaea, as well as eukaryotes (see Fig. 1B). There are four additional homologs of YiaK in E. coli, two of which are shown in Fig. 1B. Many members of this family are annotated as type 2 malate/lactate dehydrogenase in the various sequence data bases, although there is only minimal biochemical evidence supporting this classification. Moreover, members of this family do not share any recognizable sequence homology to other NAD(P)-binding proteins. For example, the YiaK proteins do not contain the GXGXX(G/A) dinucleotide binding signature motif (7Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, these proteins do not share any significant sequence homology with any other proteins that have known three-dimensional structures. To help understand the biochemical functions of these enzymes, we have determined the crystal structures of the free enzyme of YiaK and its complex with NAD-tartrate at up to a 2.0-Å resolution. The structures reveal a new polypeptide backbone fold for the enzyme as well as a novel mode of binding the NAD cofactor, establishing the YiaK enzymes as a new class of NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases. In addition, our crystallographic analysis unexpectedly showed the binding of tartrate in the active site. Enzyme kinetics studies confirm that tartrate and the related d-malate are competitive inhibitors of YiaK. Large conformational differences are observed between the free enzyme and the NAD-tartrate complex. In contrast to most other enzymes in which substrate binding produces a more closed conformation, the binding of NAD-tartrate to YiaK produces a more open active site. The conformation of the free enzyme of YiaK is incompatible with NAD binding. Expression and Purification of YiaK—The full-length yiaK gene from E. coli, Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium target ER82, was cloned into a pET21d (Novagen) derivative, generating plasmid pER82-21. The resulting recombinant protein contains eight non-native residues (LEHHHHHH) at the C terminus. The construct was sequence-verified by standard DNA sequence analysis. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pMGK cells, a rare codon-enhanced strain, were transformed with pER82-21. A single isolate was cultured in MJ minimal media (8Jansson M. Li Y.-C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione G.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) supplemented with selenomethionine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine for the production of selenomethionine-labeled YiaK (9Doublie S. Kapp U. Aberg A. Brown K. Strub K. Cusack S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Initial growth was carried out at 30 °C until the A600 of the culture reached 1.0 unit. The incubation temperature was then decreased to 17 °C, and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. Following overnight incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Selenomethionyl YiaK was purified by standard methods. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted by sonication. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and eluted in lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing partially purified YiaK were pooled and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences), and the running buffer contained 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The purified YiaK protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Sample purity (>97%) and molecular mass (37.6 kDa) were verified by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively. The yield of purified protein was ∼16 mg/liter. Crystallization of YiaK—The free enzyme of YiaK was crystallized at 29 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 19% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm lithium sulfate, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The crystals were transferred to paratone for cryoprotection and then flash-frozen in liquid propane for data collection at 100 K. The crystals belong to the space group P21, with cell parameters of a = 58.0 Å, b = 51.2 Å, c = 108.9 Å, and β = 103.8°. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of YiaK in complex with NAD were obtained with a reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm ammonium tartrate, and 20 mm NAD. The protein was pre-incubated with a 10 mm concentration of the substrate 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate (a kind gift from W. S. Yew and J. A. Gerlt). The crystals grew to full size in 3 days at 20 °C and were flash-frozen in liquid propane. They belong to the space group P1 with cell parameters of a = 75.5 Å, b = 81.3 Å, c = 113.2 Å, α = 79.6°, β = 77.2°, and γ = 82.0°. There are four dimers in the asymmetric unit. Structure Determination of YiaK-free Enzyme—Multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data sets on a crystal of the free enzyme of YiaK were collected at 100 K at the peak, edge, and remote absorption wavelengths of selenium to 1.8-Å resolution at the X12C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source. The diffraction images were processed with the HKL package (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). SOLVE was used for locating the selenium sites and for phasing and automated model building, which correctly placed 85% of the residues in the two monomers (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The remaining residues of the dimer were built with the program XtalView (12McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). A complete model, including the initiating selenomethionine of each monomer, was built during the refinement with crystallography NMR software (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The electron density also showed the binding of two sulfate ions to each monomer.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination of YiaK in Complex with NAD and Tartrate—An x-ray diffraction data set to 2.2 Å was collected on a crystal grown in the presence of NAD and DKG at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program COMO (14Jogl G. Tao X. Xu Y. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using the free enzyme dimer structure as the search model. Two of the monomers were fitted into the electron density map with little effort, whereas major conformational differences were noted in three regions (Met1-Gly59, Met177-Met221, and Gly304-Leu322) for the other six monomers. Clear electron density for NAD was observed for four of these monomers. Despite the inclusion of the substrate DKG, the electron density, surprisingly, showed the presence of tartrate in the active sites of the same four monomers. The crystallographic information is summarized in Table I. Kinetic Assays—The kinetic assays followed protocols described elsewhere (5Yew W.S. Gerlt J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 0.16 mm NADH, 2 mm DKG (near the Km of the enzyme), and 0.2 μm YiaK. The initial velocity of the enzyme in the presence of different concentrations of various compounds was determined by monitoring the disappearance of NADH (A340) at room temperature. Atomic Coordinates—Coordinates and structure factors of the YiaK-free enzyme and its complex with NAD-tartrate have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1NXU and 1S20). Structure Determination—The crystal structure of the free enzyme of E. coli YiaK (2,3-diketo-l-gulonate reductase) has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution by the selenomethionyl multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction method (15Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The positions of the selenium atoms and the phases of the reflections were determined with the program SOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). This protein is unusually enriched with Met residues, with 15 such residues of 332 amino acids in each monomer. Five of these Met residues (Met173, Met175, Met177, Met221, Met229) from each monomer are located in the dimer interface (Fig. 1B), giving rise to a close cluster of 10 Met residues. These residues are not conserved in other members of the family (Fig. 1B). The current atomic model for the free enzyme contains residues 1-332 for each monomer of the dimer, four sulfate ions, and 664 solvent water molecules. The model has low R values and excellent geometry (Table I). The crystal structure of YiaK in complex with NAD and tartrate has been determined at 2.2-Å resolution by the molecular replacement method (Table I) (14Jogl G. Tao X. Xu Y. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are four dimers of the enzyme in this triclinic unit cell, and the eight monomers are named A through H, resulting in AB, CD, EF, and GH dimers. Two of these dimers (AB and GH) have NAD and tartrate in their active sites. For the other two dimers, the active site of one monomer in each (D and F) has a weak electron density for NAD but good density for tartrate, whereas the active site of the other monomer in each (C and E) is empty. The six monomers with occupied active sites have similar conformations, and the root mean square distance between equivalent Cα atoms of any pair of these monomers is about 0.4 Å. The two monomers (C and E) with empty active sites have conformations that are similar to the free enzyme (see below). Overall Structure of the YiaK Monomer, a New Backbone Fold—The structure of the YiaK monomer contains 11 β-strands (named β1 through β11) and 12 α-helices (αA through αL) (Figs. 1B and 2A). The structure can be divided into approximately three domains, and this division is supported by the observation that the domains behave essentially as rigid bodies in the conformational transition that results from NAD(H) binding (see below). Domain I is made of residues from the N- and C-terminal segments of the protein (1-60, 318-332) and contains a four-helix bundle (Fig. 2A, αA, αB, αC, and αL). Strand β1, at the N terminus, and strand β11 form a small anti-parallel β-sheet that closes off one end of this bundle. The N-terminal initiator Met residue is part of strand β1 and has clear electron density. Domain II is the central component of the structure. It contains a seven-stranded mostly anti-parallel β-sheet, which is covered on one face by two helices (αD and αE) (Fig. 2A). In comparison, most of the other face of this β-sheet is exposed in the structure of the monomer with the two helices on this face of the β-sheet (αH and αJ) located at the two ends of the β-sheet (Fig. 2B). The αJ helix has few interactions with the rest of the monomer, suggesting this conformation of the monomer is unlikely to be stable on its own (Fig. 2A). This exposed surface of the β-sheet is highly hydrophobic in nature (Fig. 2C), and it mediates the formation of the dimer. Dimerization also stabilizes the αJ helix (see below). At the C terminus of this domain, a long loop links helices αJ and αK (Fig. 2A), and this JK loop is involved in binding the NAD cofactor as well as dimerization (see below). Searches in the Protein Data Bank with the program Dali (16Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) did not show any other structures with a similar backbone fold to that of domain II. This suggests that this domain of YiaK may represent a new fold for a seven-stranded mostly anti-parallel β-sheet. Domain III is an insertion on the surface of domain II, in the connection between strand β7 and helix αH (Fig. 2, A and B). This insertion covers residues 175-223, with two helices (αF and αG) and a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β8 and β9). A Tightly Associated Dimer—Crystallographic analyses reveal that YiaK exists as dimers in the crystals, with an extensive interface (Fig. 2D). About 3500 Å2 of the surface area of each monomer is buried at the dimer interface, suggesting that the dimers should be highly stable. The structural observations are corroborated by light scattering studies (data not shown), which show that YiaK exists as dimers in solution as well. Considering the facts that the conformation of the monomer is unlikely to be stable and that the NAD binding site is at the dimer interface (see below), it is likely that YiaK functions only as a dimer. The extensive interface between the two monomers is mediated by the exposed face of their central β-sheet in domain II and the two associated helices (αH and αJ) (Fig. 2D). Most of the helix αH is buried in the core of the dimer, packing against the surface of the β-sheet in the other monomer. Helix αJ helps to cap off the two edges of this interface, by interacting with αH and αI. The beginning of the JK loop in one monomer is located next to the β5-β6 loop of the other monomer. In comparison, domain III and especially domain I are located distal from the dimer interface (Fig. 2D). Residues in this interface are generally conserved among the members of this family of enzymes (Fig. 1B), suggesting that they may all function as dimers. A Novel Mode of NAD Binding—The NAD molecule in the AB and GH dimers has well defined electron density (Fig. 3A). The molecule is associated mostly with one monomer, and several residues from domain II of the other monomer help define the binding site for the ADP portion of the cofactor (Fig. 3, B and C). The adenine base resides in a narrow groove formed by the side chains of Arg301 (in the JK loop), Trp147′ (β5-β6 loop), and Trp224′ (αH, primed residue numbers indicate the other monomer), showing amino-aromatic and π-π interactions (Fig. 3B). However, these residues are poorly conserved among the YiaK family members (Fig. 1B). The ribose and the phosphates of the ADP portion of the cofactor are situated along strand β7 (residues 168-174) at the edge of the β-sheet in domain II (Figs. 2A and 3B). The 3′-hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain carbonyl of residue 170 and the main chain amide of 172. One of the oxygen molecules on the β-phosphate makes a hydrogen bond with the main chain amide of residue 174. The β-phosphate group also shows ionic interaction with the highly conserved Lys225′ residue (from αH of the other monomer). The 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide of Gly304 (JK loop) and the side chain of Glu306 (αK), suggesting that YiaK may prefer NAD over NADP as the cofactor (see below). The two hydroxyl groups on the ribose adjacent to the nicotinamide ring are hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Asp172 (β7), which is conserved among the YiaK family members (Fig. 1B). The nicotinamide ring is placed over the side chain of the invariant Pro158 in strand β6. With this binding mode, a hydride transfer can only occur on the B face of the nicotinamide ring. The observed interactions between NAD and YiaK appear to be unique to this family of enzymes. Many NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases contain a Rossmann fold that is for binding the dinucleotide cofactor (17Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), and the pyrophosphate group interacts with the GXGXX(G/A) fingerprint motif as well as the dipole of the helix immediately following this motif (7Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 18Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, the domain that binds NAD in YiaK (domain II) has a novel backbone fold, and the YiaK proteins do not contain the GXGXX(G/A) sequence motif. Instead, the pyrophosphate group interacts with a β-strand as well as the ammonium ion of a Lys residue from another monomer (Fig. 3B). Stabilization by interactions with the dipole of a helix is not observed in the YiaK-NAD complex either. The 2′-hydroxyl group on the ribose next to the adenine base is hydrogen-bonded to Glu306 (αK helix) in YiaK (Fig. 3B). This interaction may be functionally equivalent to that from an Asp/Glu residue at the end of the β2 strand of the Rossmann folds (7Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 19Carugo O. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 28: 10-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and suggests that the YiaK family members with a conserved Glu residue at this position may only be able to use NAD as the cofactor. However, several members of the family have a different residue at this position, suggesting they could favor NADP as the cofactor. The conformation of NAD in the YiaK complex is fully extended and is dramatically different from what is typically observed for NAD in complexes with enzymes containing a Rossmann fold (Fig. 3D). With the nicotinamide-ribose portions of the cofactors in superposition, the adenine bases are separated from each other by ∼8 Å in the two conformations (Fig. 3D). This conformational difference is because of a 140° rotation around the bond linking the α-phosphate and the bridging oxygen atom, as well as a rotation of 120° around the C-4′-C-5′ bond of the ribose. Interestingly, this NAD conformation has recently been observed in a complex with a mutant of nicotinamide-mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (20Saridakis V. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34356-34363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The conformation of NAD in complex with the wild type of this enzyme is, however, entirely different (Fig. 3D). A large number of conformations have been observed for the NAD(P) cofactor in complex with various enzymes (19Carugo O. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 28: 10-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Binding Mode of Tartrate—We included 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate (Fig. 1A) in the crystallization solution at 20 mm concentration in an attempt to determine the binding mode of this substrate to the enzyme. To our surprise, crystallographic analyses based on the x-ray diffraction data show that a tartrate molecule is bound in the active site instead, with clearly defined electron density (Fig. 4A). Tartrate is present in the reservoir solution at 200 mm concentration, and this compound was required for obtaining good quality crystals of the enzyme in the presence of NAD. Tartrate is situated over the nicotinamide ring in the active site (Fig. 4B), and its hydroxyl and carboxylate groups are hydrogen bonded to several highly conserved residues of the enzyme (Fig. 4C). One of the oxygen atoms of the C-1 carboxylate makes two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg48 and His116, whereas the other oxygen interacts with a solvent water molecule. His116 is strictly conserved among the YiaK family of enzymes, whereas Arg48 is mostly conserved (Fig. 1B). Arg48 also forms a hydrogen bond to the C-3 hydroxyl of tartrate (Fig. 4B). The C-4 carboxylate is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain amide nitrogens of Tyr180 and Gly181 at the beginning of helix αF, and it should also have favorable interactions with the dipole of this helix. The C-2 hydroxyl group of tartrate is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of His44, which is the likely catalytic base of the enzyme (see below). The structural information suggests that tartrate is likely an active site inhibitor of YiaK. Kinetic assays confirm that tartrate is a weak inhibitor of the enzyme. At 60 mm concentration this compound produced a 50% inhibition of the activity of YiaK. Interestingly, d-malate, which shares the same stereochemistry for the hydroxyl group at the C-2 position as tartrate (Fig. 1A), can also inhibit the enzyme with similar potency. On the other hand, l-malate, with the opposite stereochemistry (Fig. 1A), is a much poorer inhibitor of YiaK as compared with d-malate. None of these compounds can function as a substrate of the enzyme in the reduction of NAD to NADH. Conformational Changes upon NAD-Tartrate Binding Produce a More Open Active Site—Structural comparisons reveal a large conformational change in YiaK upon the binding of NAD and tartrate. With domain II as the reference, both domain I and domain III show differences in their relative positions and orientations between the free enzyme and the NAD-tartrate complex (Fig. 5A). The largest conformational change is observed in domain III, which moves away from domain II, creating a larger opening near the active site for the binding of NAD (Fig. 5B). Within domain II, helices αH and αJ and the JK loop also show significant differences between the free enzyme and the NAD-tartrate complex (Fig. 5A). As these residues are involved in NAD binding as well as dimer formation, there is also a change in the organization of the dimer upon NAD-tartrate binding (not shown). With one monomer of the dimer in the superposition, a rotation of 7.5° is needed to bring the second monomer into overlap. Interestingly, the conformational changes in YiaK occur in an unusual manner, as the active site region of the enzyme is more open in the complex with NAD and tartrate (Figs. 3C and 5, A and B). In comparison, most other enzymes assume a more closed conformation upon the binding of substrates and/or substrate-analog inhibitors, thereby shielding them from the solvent. In YiaK, however, one face of the tartrate molecule is completely exposed to the solvent (Fig. 4B). The nicotinamide ring of NAD is shielded from the solvent by tartrate, but the ADP portion has significant exposure to the solvent (Fig. 3C). Such a conformational change of the enzyme is necessary for the binding of NAD and tartrate, as the structure of the free enzyme is incompatible with the presence of these molecules in the active site (Fig. 5C). Specifically, the side chains of His44 and Asp172 in the free enzyme are in steric clash with the nicotinamide-ribose portion of the cofactor, whereas residues Tyr180-Gly181 block the binding of the C-4 carboxylate group of tartrate. In the crystal structure of the free enzyme, each monomer contains two sulfate ions in the active site. One of these sulfates superimposes with the β-phosphate of NAD, whereas the other sulfate is situated near the C-2 atom of tartrate (Fig. 5C). This second sulfate ion is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain amides of Tyr180 and Gly181, equivalent to the interactions from the C-4 carboxylate of tartrate. It is unlikely that the observed free enzyme conformation is stabilized by the binding of sulfate, because the two molecules in the crystal of the complex (monomers C and E) that have no NAD, tartrate, or sulfate bound to the active site assume conformations that are essentially the same as that observed in the free enzyme crystal. Catalytic Mechanism of the Enzyme—In the structure of the NAD-tartrate complex, the C-2 carbon of tartrate is located 3.6 Å from the C-4 atom of the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 4C). At the same time, the hydroxyl group on the C-2 atom is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of the strictly conserved His44 residue. Therefore, this binding mode may resemble that of the reduced product of the reaction. It is likely that His44 functions as the general base of the enzyme for the oxidation reaction. It extracts the proton from the hydroxyl group of the substrate, and this is coupled to the hydride transfer from the C-2 carbon to the cofactor NAD. For the reduction of DKG, this side chain in the protonated form could function as a general acid by polarizing the C-2 carbonyl and facilitating the hydride transfer from NADH to the substrate. However, the stereochemistries at the C-2 positions of tartrate and 3-keto-l-gulonate are opposite of each other (Fig. 1A). It is not clear whether this compound can assume a similar binding mode as tartrate. It may have to be bound in the opposite orientation to maintain similar interactions with the enzyme. In this orientation, the carboxylate of gulonate could interact with the main chain amides of Tyr180 and Gly181, although a slightly more closed conformation of domain III may be needed for these interactions. It is possible that His116 (Fig. 4C), in addition to His44, may also have a role in extracting the proton from the substrate for catalysis. Attempts at producing crystals of the YiaK-DKG complex in the absence of tartrate have so far not been successful. In summary, we have determined the crystal structures of the E. coli 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate reductase (YiaK), both alone and in complex with NAD and tartrate. The NAD molecule is bound to a domain with a novel polypeptide backbone fold, establishing the YiaK family of enzymes as a new class of oxidoreductases. Structural and solution studies show that YiaK functions as a tightly associated dimer. Conformational changes in domains I and III of the enzyme are required for the binding of the NAD cofactor. In contrast to most other enzymes, these changes in YiaK produce a more open active site. Tartrate and the related d-malate are weak inhibitors of the enzyme. His44 is likely the catalytic residue of the enzyme. We thank W. S. Yew and J. A. Gerlt for the gift of the 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate substrate of this enzyme and Randy Abramowitz and Xiaochun Yang for setting up the X4A beamline."
