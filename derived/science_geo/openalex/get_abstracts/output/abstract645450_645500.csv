https://openalex.org/W2992441602,"Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, inflammation, and oxidative stress contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and trigger complex pathogenesis. The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) is an endogenous metabolic intermediate that protects against stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The present study aims to elucidate the protective effects of BHBA in the early stage of AD model and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Three-and-half-month-old double-transgenic mice (5XFAD) overexpressing β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) were used as the AD model. The 5XFAD mice received 1.5 mmol/kg/d BHBA subcutaneously for 28 days. Morris water maze test, nest construction, and passive avoidance experiments were performed to assess the therapeutic effects on AD prevention in vivo, and brain pathology of 5XFAD mice including amyloid plaque deposition and microglia activation were assessed. Gene expression profiles in the cortexes of 5XFAD- and BHBA-treated 5XFAD mice were performed with high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Mouse HT22 cells were treated with 2 mM BHBA to explore its in vitro protective effects of BHBA on hippocampal neurons against Aβ oligomer toxicity, ATP production, ROS generation, and mitochondrial aerobic respiratory function. APP, BACE1, and neprilysin (NEP) expression levels were evaluated in HT22 cells following treatment with BHBA by measuring the presence or absence of G protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A). BHBA improved cognitive function of 5XFAD mice in Morris water maze test, nesting construction and passive avoidance experiments, and attenuated Aβ accumulation and microglia overactivation in the brain. BHBA also enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function of hippocampal neurons and protected it from Aβ toxicity. The enzymes, APP and NEP were regulated by BHBA via G-protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A). Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed that BHBA-regulated genes mainly annotated in aging, immune system, nervous system, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our data suggested that BHBA confers protection against the AD-like pathological events in the AD mouse model by targeting multiple aspects of AD and it may become a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of AD."

We investigated the therapeutic effects of MccJ25 on intestinal inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction and the underlying mechanism, using gentamicin for comparison. In a mouse model of intestinal inflammation, therapeutic administration of either MccJ25 or gentamicin after ETEC K88 infection attenuated clinical symptoms, reduced intestinal pathogen colonization, improved intestinal morphology, and decreased inflammatory pathologies and intestinal permeability, ultimately improving the hosts' health. MccJ25 also attenuated ETEC-induced mouse intestinal barrier dysfunction by enhancing tight junction proteins (TJPs). Using the human epithelial cell line Caco-2, we verified the epithelial barrier-strengthening and mucosal injury-alleviating effects of MccJ25 on ETEC infection: increased expression of TJPs by activating the p38/MAPK pathway, balancing the microbiota, and improving short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the cecum of ETEC-infected mice. Although gentamicin and MccJ25 had similar effects in the inflamed gut, MccJ25 was superior to gentamicin with regard to defending the host from ETEC infection. Overall, MccJ25 may be a promising therapeutic drug for treating enteric pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation diseases."

However, very little is currently known about its role in nociceptive modulation. Here, we found that the level of spinal m6A modification was significantly increased in a mouse model of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic inflammatory pain, which was accompanied with the augmentation of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) expression in the spinal cord. Knockdown of spinal METTL3 prevented and reversed CFA-induced pain behaviors and spinal neuronal sensitization. In contrast, overexpression of spinal METTL3 produced pain behaviors and neuronal sensitization in naive mice. Moreover, we found that METTL3 positively modulated the pri-miR-65-3p processing in a microprocessor protein DiGeorge critical region 8-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings reveal an important role of METTL3-mediated m6A modification in nociceptive sensitization and provide a novel perspective on m6A modification in the development of pathological pain."
https://openalex.org/W2992853161,"The natural product icariin (ICA) and its phosphorylated derivatives (pICA) have been shown to have outstanding anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study was to explore the protective effects of ICA and pICA on the intestinal epithelium of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)-induced piglet diarrhea and its underlying mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. ETEC K88 increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, activated oxidative stress and inhibited antioxidant enzyme activity, induced phosphorylated p38 MAPK gene and protein expression, disrupted intestinal barrier function, and led to diarrhea in piglets. Pretreatment with ICA and pICA effectively alleviated ETEC-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) significantly rescued the IPEC-J2 cells barrier function damaged by ETEC challenge. However, pretreatment with p38 MAPK activator (anisomycin) did not alleviated the IPEC-J2 cells barrier function damaged by ETEC challenge. Our data demonstrated that ICA and pICA regulate the inflammatory response and oxidative stress of intestinal epithelial cells by inhibiting the expression of p38 MAPK, thereby alleviating ETEC K88-induced disruption of intestinal barrier function and intestinal permeability. These findings provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of intestinal barrier dysfunction induced by ETEC K88."
https://openalex.org/W2999497689,"Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC50 of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1–5, ranged from 5–28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1–5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 μM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O6-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC50 values ≥25 μM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients."
https://openalex.org/W3013544468,"Metal clusters are exploited by numerous metalloenzymes for catalysis, but it is not common to utilize a metal cluster for substrate transport across membrane. The recent crystal structure of a prototypic Zrt-/Irt-like protein (ZIP) metal transporter from Bordetella bronchiseptica (BbZIP) revealed an unprecedented binuclear metal center (BMC) within the transport pathway. Here, through a combination of bioinformatics, biochemical and structural approaches, we concluded that the two physically associated metal-binding sites in the BMC of human ZIP4 (hZIP4) zinc transporter exert different functions: one conserved transition metal-binding site acts as the transport site essential for activity, whereas the variable metal-binding site is required for hZIP4's optimal activity presumably by serving as a secondary transport site and modulating the properties of the primary transport site. Sequential soaking experiments on BbZIP crystals clarified the process of metal release from the BMC to the bulky solvent. This work provides important insights into the transport mechanism of the ZIPs broadly involved in transition metal homeostasis and signaling, and also a paradigm on a novel function of metal cluster in metalloproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2997588540,"CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against viruses. During spacer adaptation, the Cas1-Cas2 complex selects fragments of foreign DNA, called prespacers, and integrates them into CRISPR arrays in an orientation that provides functional immunity. Cas4 is involved in both the trimming of prespacers and the cleavage of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in several type I CRISPR-Cas systems, but how the prespacers are processed in systems lacking Cas4, such as the type I-E and I-F systems, is not understood. In Escherichia coli, which has a type I-E system, Cas1-Cas2 preferentially selects prespacers with 3′ overhangs via specific recognition of a PAM, but how these prespacers are integrated in a functional orientation in the absence of Cas4 is not known. Using a biochemical approach with purified proteins, as well as integration, prespacer protection, sequencing, and quantitative PCR assays, we show here that the bacterial 3′–5′ exonucleases DnaQ and ExoT can trim long 3′ overhangs of prespacers and promote integration in the correct orientation. We found that trimming by these exonucleases results in an asymmetric intermediate, because Cas1-Cas2 protects the PAM sequence, which helps to define spacer orientation. Our findings implicate the E. coli host 3′–5′ exonucleases DnaQ and ExoT in spacer adaptation and reveal a mechanism by which spacer orientation is defined in E. coli.

https://openalex.org/W2990402582,"Over recent years several examples of randomly switching methyltransferases, associated with Type III restriction-modification (R-M) systems, have been described in pathogenic bacteria. In every case examined, changes in simple DNA sequence repeats result in variable methyltransferase expression and result in global changes in gene expression, and differentiation of the bacterial cell into distinct phenotypes. These epigenetic regulatory systems are called phasevarions, phase-variable regulons, and are widespread in bacteria, with 17.4% of Type III R-M system containing simple DNA sequence repeats. A distinct, recombination-driven random switching system has also been described in Streptococci in Type I R-M systems that also regulate gene expression. Here, we interrogate the most extensive and well-curated database of R-M systems, REBASE, by searching for all possible simple DNA sequence repeats in the hsdRMS genes that encode Type I R-M systems. We report that 7.9% of hsdS, 2% of hsdM, and of 4.3% of hsdR genes contain simple sequence repeats that are capable of mediating phase variation. Phase variation of both hsdM and hsdS genes will lead to differential methyltransferase expression or specificity, and thereby the potential to control phasevarions. These data suggest that in addition to well characterized phasevarions controlled by Type III mod genes, and the previously described Streptococcal Type I R-M systems that switch via recombination, approximately 10% of all Type I R-M systems surveyed herein have independently evolved the ability to randomly switch expression via simple DNA sequence repeats."
https://openalex.org/W2990446048,"Mitochondrial fusion and fission are essential for heart function. Abrogating mitochondrial dynamism leads to cardiomyopathy. Excessive mitochondrial fragmentation is involved in most heart diseases, thus enhancing mitochondrial fusion will be a potential therapeutic strategy. To understand the effects of promoting mitochondrial fusion in adult cardiac, we investigated mice hearts, and cultured murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in which mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) overexpressed or dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) was abrogated concomitantly forcing mitochondrial fusion. Parallel studies revealed that fission-defective Drp1 knockout hearts and MEFs evoked stronger mitochondrial enlargement, enhanced mitophagy with mitochondrial volume decrease and increased mitochondrial calcium uptake, superoxide production, and permeability transition pore opening, contributed to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Mfn2 overexpression in the adult heart is comparable with the control except for slight mitochondrial enlargement and mitochondrial volume increase, but without mitophagy induction. Moreover, Mfn2 overexpression increases mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion could protect against mitochondrial fragmentation and Drp1 deletion evoking mitophagy in MEFs. Our findings indicate that mitochondrial fusion provoked by fusion promotion and fission inhibition direct the different fate of heart, Mfn2 upregulation other than Drp1 downregulation well maintains heart mitochondrial function is a more safe strategy for correcting excessive mitochondrial fragmentation in hearts."
https://openalex.org/W2992048116,"Exposure to real or simulated microgravity is sensed as a stress by mammalian cells, which activate a complex adaptive response. In human primary endothelial cells, we have recently shown the sequential intervention of various stress proteins which are crucial to prevent apoptosis and maintain cell function. We here demonstrate that mitophagy contributes to endothelial adaptation to gravitational unloading. After 4 and 10 d of exposure to simulated microgravity in the rotating wall vessel, the amount of BCL2 interacting protein 3, a marker of mitophagy, is increased and, in parallel, mitochondrial content, oxygen consumption, and maximal respiratory capacity are reduced, suggesting the acquisition of a thrifty phenotype to meet the novel metabolic challenges generated by gravitational unloading. Moreover, we suggest that microgravity induced-disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton triggers mitophagy, thus creating a connection between cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial content upon gravitational unloading."
https://openalex.org/W2998684742,"Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells can increase their dependence on metabolic substrates such as glucose. As such, the vulnerability of cancer cells to glucose deprivation creates an attractive opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Because it is not possible to starve tumors of glucose in vivo , here we sought to identify the mechanisms in glucose deprivation–induced cancer cell death and then designed inhibitor combinations to mimic glucose deprivation–induced cell death. Using metabolomic profiling, we found that cells undergoing glucose deprivation–induced cell death exhibited dramatic accumulation of intracellular l -cysteine and its oxidized dimer, l -cystine, and depletion of the antioxidant GSH. Building on this observation, we show that glucose deprivation–induced cell death is driven not by the lack of glucose, but rather by l -cystine import. Following glucose deprivation, the import of l -cystine and its subsequent reduction to l -cysteine depleted both NADPH and GSH pools, thereby allowing toxic accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Consistent with this model, we found that the glutamate/cystine antiporter (xCT) is required for increased sensitivity to glucose deprivation. We searched for glycolytic enzymes whose expression is essential for the survival of cancer cells with high xCT expression and identified glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1). Testing a drug combination that co-targeted GLUT1 and GSH synthesis, we found that this combination induces synthetic lethal cell death in high xCT-expressing cell lines susceptible to glucose deprivation. These results indicate that co-targeting GLUT1 and GSH synthesis may offer a potential therapeutic approach for targeting tumors dependent on glucose for survival."
https://openalex.org/W2999120676,"The objective of this study was to identify the associations between trait energy and fatigue with state energy fatigue, as well as exploring if these relationships interacted with sex and/or sleep quality. The study population included a convenience sample of adults and college students (n ranges from 687 to 694). Key measures were state and trait mental and physical energy and fatigue scales, PSQI (a measure of sleep quality), and sex. Multiple regression models included age, polyphenol consumption, POMS scores, physical activity, mental load, and caffeine consumption as covariates. Analyses yielded a strong (r = .65) positive association between each trait and state variable. Overall, several statistically significant interactions were identified. First, the relationship between state and trait physical fatigue was particularly strong for women with high trait scores. There were also interactions with sleep quality. In the case of physical fatigue, poor sleep quality magnified the association between physical fatigue trait and state among those with low trait physical fatigue, while sleep quality did not make a difference for those with high trait physical fatigue. Conversely, in the case of physical energy and mental fatigue, good sleep quality was associated with both higher ""highs"" and lower ""lows"" of their respective traits; both interactions were present only among males. Our analyses suggest that sleep quality and sex could influence the effects of trait physical and mental energy and fatigue on state. Findings were more complex than initially assumed, suggesting that the interrelationship between trait and state may be modified by how males and females react and adapt to their trait."
https://openalex.org/W2992519604,"Cardiolipin (CL) is a hallmark phospholipid of mitochondria and plays a significant role in maintaining the mitochondrial structure and functions. Despite the physiological importance of CL, mutant organisms, yeast, Arabidopsis, C elegans, and Drosophila, which lack CL synthase (Crls1) gene and consequently are deprived of CL, are viable. Here we report conditional Crls1-deficient mice using targeted insertion of loxP sequences flanking the functional domain of CRLS1 enzyme. Homozygous null mutant mice exhibited early embryonic lethality at the peri-implantation stage. We generated neuron-specific Crls1 knockout (cKO) mice by crossing with Camk2α-Cre mice. Neuronal loss and gliosis were gradually manifested in the forebrains, where CL levels were significantly decreased. In the surviving neurons, malformed mitochondria with bubble-like or onion-like inner membrane structures were observed. We showed decreased supercomplex assembly and reduced enzymatic activities of electron transport chain complexes in the forebrain of cKO mice, resulting in affected mitochondrial calcium dynamics, a slower rate of Ca2+ uptake and a smaller calcium retention capacity. These observations clearly demonstrate indispensable roles of CL as well as of Crls1 gene in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2991303513,"The pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and heart failure (HF) includes fibrogenic remodeling associated with the loss of pulmonary arterial (PA) and cardiac compliance. We and others have previously identified transglutaminase 2 (TG2) as a participant in adverse fibrogenic remodeling. However, little is known about the biologic mechanisms that regulate TG2 function. We examined physiological mouse models of experimental PH, HF, and type 1 diabetes that are associated with altered glucose metabolism/glycolysis and report here that TG2 expression and activity are elevated in pulmonary and cardiac tissues under all these conditions. We additionally used PA adventitial fibroblasts to test the hypothesis that TG2 is an intermediary between enhanced tissue glycolysis and fibrogenesis. Our in vitro results show that glycolytic enzymes and TG2 are upregulated in fibroblasts exposed to high glucose, which stimulates cellular glycolysis as measured by Seahorse analysis. We examined the relationship of TG2 to a terminal glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and found that PKM2 regulates glucose-induced TG2 expression and activity as well as fibrogenesis. Our studies further show that TG2 inhibition blocks glucose-induced fibrogenesis and cell proliferation. Our findings support a novel role for glycolysis-mediated TG2 induction and tissue fibrosis associated with experimental PH, HF, and hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2991231849,"Upon overnutrition, adipocytes activate a homeostatic program to adjust anabolic pressure. An inflammatory response enables adipose tissue (AT) expansion with concomitant enlargement of its capillary network, and reduces energy storage by increasing insulin resistance. Galectin-12 (Gal-12), an endogenous lectin preferentially expressed in AT, plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation, lipolysis, and glucose homeostasis. Here, we reveal biochemical and biophysical determinants of Gal-12 structure, including its preferential recognition of 3-fucosylated structures, a unique feature among members of the galectin family. Furthermore, we identify a previously unanticipated role for this lectin in the regulation of angiogenesis within AT. Gal-12 showed preferential localization within the inner side of lipid droplets, and its expression was upregulated under hypoxic conditions. Through glycosylation-dependent binding to endothelial cells, Gal-12 promoted in vitro angiogenesis. Moreover, analysis of in vivo AT vasculature showed reduced vascular networks in Gal-12-deficient (Lgals12-/-) compared to wild-type mice, supporting a role for this lectin in AT angiogenesis. In conclusion, this study unveils biochemical, topological, and functional features of a hypoxia-regulated galectin in AT, which modulates endothelial cell function through recognition of 3-fucosylated glycans. Thus, glycosylation-dependent programs may control AT homeostasis by modulating endothelial cell biology with critical implications in metabolic disorders and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2997259560,"Production of reactive oxygen species caused by dysregulated endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activity is linked to vascular dysfunction. eNOS is a major target protein of the primary calcium-sensing protein calmodulin. Calmodulin is often modified by the main biomarker of nitroxidative stress, 3-nitrotyrosine (nitroTyr). Despite nitroTyr being an abundant post-translational modification on calmodulin, the mechanistic role of this modification in altering calmodulin function and eNOS activation has not been investigated. Here, using genetic code expansion to site-specifically nitrate calmodulin at its two tyrosine residues, we assessed the effects of these alterations on calcium binding by calmodulin and on binding and activation of eNOS. We found that nitroTyr–calmodulin retains affinity for eNOS under resting physiological calcium concentrations. Results from in vitro eNOS assays with calmodulin nitrated at Tyr-99 revealed that this nitration reduces nitric-oxide production and increases eNOS decoupling compared with WT calmodulin. In contrast, calmodulin nitrated at Tyr-138 produced more nitric oxide and did so more efficiently than WT calmodulin. These results indicate that the nitroTyr post-translational modification, like tyrosine phosphorylation, can impact calmodulin sensitivity for calcium and reveal Tyr site-specific gain or loss of functions for calmodulin-induced eNOS activation."
https://openalex.org/W2999505233,"Secreted R-spondin1-4 proteins (RSPO1-4) orchestrate stem cell renewal and tissue homeostasis by potentiating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. RSPOs induce the turnover of negative Wnt regulators RNF43 and ZNRF3 through a process that requires RSPO interactions with Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs), or through an LGR-independent mechanism that is enhanced by RSPO binding to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Here, we describe the engineering of ‘surrogate RSPOs’ that function independently of LGRs to potentiate Wnt signaling on cell types expressing a target surface marker. These bispecific proteins were generated by fusing an RNF43- or ZNRF3-specific single chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) to the immune cytokine IL-2. Surrogate RSPOs mimic the function of natural RSPOs by crosslinking the extracellular domain (ECD) of RNF43 or ZNRF3 to the ECD of the IL-2 receptor CD25, which sequesters the complex and results in highly selective amplification of Wnt signaling on CD25+ cells. Furthermore, surrogate RSPOs were able substitute for wild type RSPO in a colon organoid growth assay when intestinal stem cells were transduced to express CD25. Our results provide proof-of-concept for a technology that may be adapted for use on a broad range of cell- or tissue-types and will open new avenues for the development of Wnt-based therapeutics for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2993865720,"The Slack (KCNT1) gene encodes sodium-activated potassium channels that are abundantly expressed in the central nervous system. Human mutations alter the function of Slack channels, resulting in epilepsy and intellectual disability. Most of the disease-causing mutations are located in the extended cytoplasmic C-terminus of Slack channels and result in increased Slack current. Previous experiments have shown that the C-terminus of Slack channels binds a number of cytoplasmic signaling proteins. One of these is Phactr1, an actin-binding protein that recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to certain phosphoprotein substrates. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Phactr1 is required to link the channels to actin. Using patch clamp recordings, we found that co-expression of Phactr1 with wild-type Slack channels reduces the current amplitude but has no effect on Slack channels in which a conserved PKC phosphorylation site (S407) that regulates the current amplitude has been mutated. Furthermore, a Phactr1 mutant that disrupts the binding of PP1 but not that of actin fails to alter Slack currents. Our data suggest that Phactr1 regulates the Slack by linking PP1 to the channel. Targeting Slack-Phactr1 interactions may therefore be helpful in developing the novel therapies for brain disorders associated with the malfunction of Slack channels."

Comparisons with the structure of other FOX family members revealed that the FKH and FHL DNA sequences are bound in two distinct modes, with partially different registers for the protein DNA contacts. We identified a single alternative rotamer within the recognition helix itself as an important determinant of DNA specificity and found protein sequence features in the recognition helix that could be used to predict the specificity of other FOX family members.

https://openalex.org/W2990736599,"In mammalian cells, the catabolic activity of the dNTP triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 sets the balance and concentration of the four dNTPs. Deficiency of SAMHD1 leads to unequally increased pools and marked dNTP imbalance. Imbalanced dNTP pools increase mutation frequency in cancer cells, but it is not known if the SAMHD1-induced dNTP imbalance favors accumulation of somatic mutations in non-transformed cells. Here, we have investigated how fibroblasts from Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) patients with mutated SAMHD1 react to the constitutive pool imbalance characterized by a huge dGTP pool. We focused on the effects on dNTP pools, cell cycle progression, dynamics and fidelity of DNA replication, and efficiency of UV-induced DNA repair. AGS fibroblasts entered senescence prematurely or upregulated genes involved in G1/S transition and DNA replication. The normally growing AGS cells exhibited unchanged DNA replication dynamics and, when quiescent, faster rate of excision repair of UV-induced DNA damages. To investigate whether the lack of SAMHD1 affects DNA replication fidelity, we compared de novo mutations in AGS and WT cells by exome next-generation sequencing. Somatic variant analysis indicated a mutator phenotype suggesting that SAMHD1 is a caretaker gene whose deficiency is per se mutagenic, promoting genome instability in non-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2991102940,"Neuromedin U (NMU), a highly conserved peptide in mammals, is involved in a wide variety of physiological processes. NMU, which is synthesized in β-cells and co-localizes with insulin, directly acts on β-cells via NMU receptor 1 (NMUR1) to suppress glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The mechanism underlying this insulinostatic effect has yet to be elucidated. We observed that NMU caused mitochondrial dysfunction by impairing mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration, and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in β-cell-derived MIN6-K8 cells. NMU administration induced the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as reflected by the activation of ER stress signaling pathways involving ATF6, XBP-1s, and PERK-ATF4-CHOP. Nmu knockdown in MIN6-K8 cells increased the number of insulin granules and improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function. NMU was upregulated in both the islets of db/db mice and palmitate-treated MIN6-K8 cells. Our results highlight the crucial role of NMU in the maintenance of β-cell function and glucose metabolism through regulation of mitochondria dysfunction and ER stress. In pathological stages that develop into diabetes, upregulation of NMU could suppress the insulin secretion by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, which may contribute to subsequent β-cell dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2995734217,"The respiratory chain (RC) transports electrons to form a proton motive force that is required for ATP synthesis in the mitochondria. RC disorders cause mitochondrial diseases that have few effective treatments; therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are critically needed. We previously identified Higd1a as a positive regulator of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) in the RC. Here, we test that Higd1a has a beneficial effect by increasing CcO activity in the models of mitochondrial dysfunction. We first demonstrated the tissue-protective effects of Higd1a via in situ measurement of mitochondrial ATP concentrations ([ATP]mito) in a zebrafish hypoxia model. Heart-specific Higd1a overexpression mitigated the decline in [ATP]mito under hypoxia and preserved cardiac function in zebrafish. Based on the in vivo results, we examined the effects of exogenous HIGD1A on three cellular models of mitochondrial disease; notably, HIGD1A improved respiratory function that was coupled with increased ATP synthesis and demonstrated cellular protection in all three models. Finally, enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that Higd1a significantly increased the maximal velocity of the reaction between CcO and cytochrome c without changing the affinity between them, indicating that Higd1a is a positive modulator of CcO. These results corroborate that Higd1a, or its mimic, provides therapeutic options for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which the C-terminal cassette modulates the activities of the N-terminal unit remain elusive. Here, we show that N- and C-terminal cassettes adopt vastly different relative orientations in a crystal structure of BRR2 in complex with an activating domain of the spliceosomal Prp8 protein at 2.4 Å resolution compared with the crystal structure of BRR2 alone. Likewise, inspection of BRR2 structures within spliceosomal complexes revealed that the cassettes occupy different relative positions and engage in different intercassette contacts during different splicing stages. Engineered disulfide bridges that locked the cassettes in two different relative orientations had opposite effects on the RNA-unwinding activity of the N-terminal cassette, with one configuration enhancing and the other configuration inhibiting RNA unwinding compared with the unconstrained protein. Moreover, we found that differences in relative positioning of the cassettes strongly influence RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by the N-terminal cassette. Our results indicate that the inactive C-terminal cassette of BRR2 can both positively and negatively affect the activity of the N-terminal helicase unit from a distance. The RNA helicase bad response to refrigeration 2 homolog (BRR2) is required for the activation of the spliceosome before the first catalytic step of RNA splicing. BRR2 represents a distinct subgroup of Ski2-like nucleic acid helicases whose members comprise tandem helicase cassettes.

https://openalex.org/W2999677851,"Subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) is a diploid self-pollinated annual pasture legume native to the Mediterranean region and widely sown in southern Australia and other countries with Mediterranean-type climates. This study utilised a core collection of 97 lines, representing around 80% of the genetic diversity of the species, to examine morphological diversity within subterranean clover. A total of 23 quantitative agro-morphological and 13 semi-quantitative morphological marker traits were assayed on the core collection and 28 diverse Australian cultivars as spaced plants in a replicated common garden experiment. Relationships between these traits and 24 climatic and edaphic parameters at their sites of origin were also examined within the core collection. Significant diversity was present for all traits. The Australian cultivars had similar levels of diversity to the core collection for several traits. Among the agro-morphological traits, time to flowering, leaf size and petiole diameter in mid-winter, plant area in late winter, maximum stem length, content of the oestogenic isoflavone biochanin A and total isoflavone content, were correlated with seven or more environmental variables. These can be considered highly adaptive, being the result of strong environmental selection pressure over time. For the first time in a clover species, morphological markers, including leaf mark, anthocyanin pigmentation and pubescence traits, have been associated with rainfall and soil parameters. This suggests they either have an adaptive role or the genes controlling them may be linked to other genes controlling adaptive traits. This study demonstrated the value of core collections to examine diversity within much larger global collections. It also identified adaptive traits from wild plants that can be utilised to develop more productive and persistent subterranean clover cultivars. The high heritability of these traits indicates that selection gains can be readily made."
https://openalex.org/W2989988819,"Dysregulation of the adipo-osteogenic differentiation balance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are common progenitor cells of adipocytes and osteoblasts, has been associated with many pathophysiologic diseases, such as obesity, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Growing evidence suggests that lipid metabolism is crucial for maintaining stem cell homeostasis and cell differentiation; however, the detailed underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and its synthase, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), are key determinants of MSC differentiation into adipocytes or osteoblasts. GCS expression was increased during adipogenesis and decreased during osteogenesis. Targeting GCS using RNA interference or a chemical inhibitor enhanced osteogenesis and inhibited adipogenesis by controlling the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Treatment with GlcCer sufficiently rescued adipogenesis and inhibited osteogenesis in GCS knockdown MSCs. Mechanistically, GlcCer interacted directly with PPARγ through A/B domain and synergistically enhanced rosiglitazone-induced PPARγ activation without changing PPARγ expression, thereby treatment with exogenous GlcCer increased adipogenesis and inhibited osteogenesis. Animal studies demonstrated that inhibiting GCS reduced adipocyte formation in white adipose tissues under normal chow diet and high-fat diet feeding and accelerated bone repair in a calvarial defect model. Taken together, our findings identify a novel lipid metabolic regulator for the control of MSC differentiation and may have important therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2990366941,"Adipogenesis, a critical process that converts adipocyte precursors into adipocytes, is considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. Ezetimibe, a drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, is used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Recently, it was reported to ameliorate high fat diet-induced dyslipidemia in mice and reduce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes through the activation of AMPK. However, the anti-adipogenic effects of ezetimibe and the underlying molecular mechanism have not yet been elucidated. Here, we found that ezetimibe reduced lipid accumulation via activating AMPK during the early phase of adipogenesis. We also observed that ezetimibe inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, which is a major transcription factor of adipogenesis. Furthermore, ezetimibe-mediated AMPK activation reduced lipid accumulation by inhibiting mTORC1 signaling, leading to the downregulation of lipogenesis-related genes. Mitotic clonal expansion, required for adipogenesis, accelerates cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. We additionally observed that ezetimibe prevented the progression of mitotic clonal expansion by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, which was followed by the inhibition of cell proliferation. Collectively, ezetimibe-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis is dependent on the AMPK-mTORC1 pathway. Thus, we suggest that ezetimibe might be a promising drug for the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2993624231,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest group of membrane receptors in eukaryotic genomes and collectively they regulate nearly all cellular processes. Despite the widely recognized importance of this class of proteins, many GPCRs remain understudied. G protein-coupled receptor 27 (Gpr27) is an orphan GPCR that displays high conservation during vertebrate evolution. Although, GPR27 is known to be expressed in tissues that regulate metabolism including the pancreas, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, its functions are poorly characterized. Therefore, to investigate the potential roles of Gpr27 in energy metabolism, we generated a whole body gpr27 knockout zebrafish line. Loss of gpr27 potentiated the elevation in glucose levels induced by pharmacological or nutritional perturbations. We next leveraged a mass spectrometry metabolite profiling platform to identify other potential metabolic functions of Gpr27. Notably, genetic deletion of gpr27 elevated medium-chain acylcarnitines, in particular C6-hexanoylcarnitine, C8-octanoylcarnitine, C9-nonanoylcarnitine, and C10-decanoylcarnitine, lipid species known to be associated with insulin resistance in humans. Concordantly, gpr27 deletion in zebrafish abrogated insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation and glucose utilization. Finally, loss of gpr27 increased the expression of key enzymes in carnitine shuttle complex, in particular the homolog to the brain-specific isoform of CPT1C which functions as a hypothalamic energy senor. In summary, our findings shed light on the biochemical functions of Gpr27 by illuminating its role in lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2990534996,"A costimulatory signal from the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family molecule OX40 (CD134), which is induced on activated T cells, is important for T-cell immunity. Aberrant OX40 cosignaling has been implicated in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. However, the molecular mechanism by which the OX40 cosignaling regulates the T-cell response remains obscure. We found that OX40 associated with a scaffold protein, IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) after ligation by its ligand OX40L. Naïve CD4+ T cells from Iqgap1−/− mice displayed enhanced proliferation and cytokine secretion upon receiving OX40 cosignaling. A C-terminal IQGAP1 region was responsible for its association with OX40, and TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) bridged these two proteins. The enhanced cytokine response in Iqgap1−/− T cells was restored by the expression of the C-terminal IQGAP1. Thus, the IQGAP1 binding limits the OX40 cosignaling. Disease severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was significantly exacerbated in Iqgap1−/− mice as compared to wild-type mice. Additionally, recipient mice with Iqgap1−/− donor CD4+ T cells exhibited significantly higher EAE scores than those with their wild-type counterparts, and OX40 blockade led to a significant reduction in the EAE severity. Thus, our study defines an important component of the OX40 cosignaling that restricts inflammation driven by antigen-activated T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2991496970,"Beyond the study of its transcriptional target genes, the identification of the various interactors of a transcription factor (TF) is crucial to understand its diverse cellular roles. We focused on FOXL2, a winged-helix forkhead TF important for ovarian development and maintenance. FOXL2 has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, the control of cell cycle or the regulation of steroid hormone synthesis. To reliably identify partners of endogenous FOXL2, we performed a proteome-wide analysis using co-immunoprecipitation in the murine granulosa cell-derived AT29c and the pituitary-derived alpha-T3 cell lines, using three antibodies targeting different parts of the protein. Following a stringent selection of mass spectrometry data on the basis of identification reliability and protein enrichment, we identified a core set of 255 partners common to both cell lines. Their analysis showed that we could co-precipitate several complexes involved in mRNA processing, chromatin remodeling and DNA replication and repair. We further validated (direct and/or indirect) interactions with selected partners, suggesting an unexpected role for FOXL2 in those processes. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of the endogenous FOXL2 interactome sheds light on its numerous and diverse interactors and unconventional cellular roles."
https://openalex.org/W2996878602,"The genetic context in bacterial genomes and screening for potential substrates can help identify the biochemical functions of bacterial enzymes. The Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic bacterium Veillonella ratti possesses a gene cluster that appears to be related to l -fucose metabolism and contains a putative dihydrodipicolinate synthase/ N -acetylneuraminate lyase protein (FucH). Here, screening of a library of 2-keto-3-deoxysugar acids with this protein and biochemical characterization of neighboring genes revealed that this gene cluster encodes enzymes in a previously unknown “route I” nonphosphorylating l -fucose pathway. Previous studies of other aldolases in the dihydrodipicolinate synthase/ N -acetylneuraminate lyase protein superfamily used only limited numbers of compounds, and the approach reported here enabled elucidation of the substrate specificities and stereochemical selectivities of these aldolases and comparison of them with those of FucH. According to the aldol cleavage reaction, the aldolases were specific for ( R )- and ( S )-stereospecific groups at the C4 position of 2-keto-3-deoxysugar acid but had no structural specificity or preference of methyl groups at the C5 and C6 positions, respectively. This categorization corresponded to the ( Re )- or ( Si )-facial selectivity of the pyruvate enamine on the (glycer)aldehyde carbonyl in the aldol-condensation reaction. These properties are commonly determined by whether a serine or threonine residue is positioned at the equivalent position close to the active site(s), and site-directed mutagenesis markedly modified C4-OH preference and selective formation of a diastereomer. I propose that substrate specificity of 2-keto-3-deoxysugar acid aldolases was convergently acquired during evolution and report the discovery of another l -2-keto-3-deoxyfuconate aldolase involved in the same nonphosphorylating l -fucose pathway in Campylobacter jejuni ."
https://openalex.org/W2997235321,"A recently discovered ornithine-ammonia cycle (OAC) serves as a conduit in the nitrogen storage and remobilization machinery in cyanobacteria. The OAC involves an arginine catabolic reaction catalyzed by the arginine dihydrolase ArgZ whose catalytic mechanism is unknown. Here we determined the crystal structures at 1.2-3.0 Å of unliganded ArgZ from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and of ArgZ complexed with its substrate arginine, a covalently linked reaction intermediate, or the reaction product ornithine. The structures reveal that a key residue, Asn71, in the ArgZ active center functions as the determinant distinguishing ArgZ from other members of the guanidino group-modifying enzyme superfamily. The structures, along with biochemical evidence from enzymatic assays coupled with electrospray ionization MS techniques, further suggest that ArgZ-catalyzed conversion of arginine to ornithine, ammonia, and carbon dioxide consists of two successive cycles of amine hydrolysis. Finally, we show that arginine dihydrolases are broadly distributed among bacteria and metazoans, suggesting that the OAC may be frequently used for redistribution of nitrogen from arginine catabolism or nitrogen fixation."

The UFM1 cascade is a novel ubiquitin-like modification system. The mutations in UFM1, its E1 (UBA5) and E2 (UFC1), have been identified in patients with microcephaly. However, its pathological mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we observed the disruption of the UFM1 cascade in Drosophila neuroblasts (NBs) decreased the number of NBs, leading to a smaller brain size. The lack of ufmylation in NBs resulted in an increased mitotic index and an extended G2/M phase, indicating a defect in mitotic progression. In addition, live imaging of the embryos revealed an impaired E3 ligase (Ufl1) function resulted in premature entry into mitosis and failed cellularization. Even worse, the embryonic lethality occurred as early as within the first few mitotic cycles following the depletion of Ufm1. Knockdown of ufmylation in the fixed embryos exhibited severe phenotypes, including detached centrosomes, defective microtubules, and DNA bridge. Furthermore, we observed that the UFM1 cascade could alter the level of phosphorylation on tyrosine-15 of CDK1 (pY15-CDK1), which is a negative regulator of the G2 to M transition. These findings yield unambiguous evidence suggesting that the UFM1 cascade is a microcephaly-causing factor that regulates the progression of the cell cycle at mitosis phase entry."
https://openalex.org/W2996587336,"Human pancreatic islets engrafted into immunodeficient mice serve as an important model for in vivo human diabetes studies. Following engraftment, islet function can be monitored in vivo by measuring circulating glucose and human insulin; however, it will be important to recover viable cells for more complex graft analyses. Moreover, RNA analyses of dissected grafts have not distinguished which hormone-specific cell types contribute to gene expression. We developed a method for recovering live cells suitable for fluorescence-activated cell sorting from human islets engrafted in mice. Although yields of recovered islet cells were relatively low, the ratios of bulk-sorted β, α, and δ cells and their respective hormone-specific RNA-Seq transcriptomes are comparable pretransplant and posttransplant, suggesting that the cellular characteristics of islet grafts posttransplant closely mirror the original donor islets. Single-cell RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis confirms the presence of appropriate β, α, and δ cell subsets. In addition, ex vivo perifusion of recovered human islet grafts demonstrated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Viable cells suitable for patch-clamp analysis were recovered from transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived β cells. Together, our functional and hormone-specific transcriptome analyses document the broad applicability of this system for longitudinal examination of human islet cells undergoing developmental/metabolic/pharmacogenetic manipulation in vivo and may facilitate the discovery of treatments for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2990434586,"The stability and survival of germ cells are controlled by the germline-specific genes, however, such genes are less known in the avian species. Using a microarray-based the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, we found an unigene (Gga.9721) that upregulated in the chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs). The unigene showed 97% identities with an uncharacterized chicken cyclin F like gene. The predicted chicken cyclin F like gene was further characterized through expression and regulation in the chicken PGCs. The sequence analysis revealed that the gene shows identities with cyclin F gene and contains an F-box domain. The expression of chicken cyclin F like was detected specifically in the gonads, PGCs, and germline cells. The knockdown of cyclin F like gene resulted in DNA damage and apoptosis in the PGCs. The genes related to stemness and germness were downregulated, whereas, genes related to apoptosis and DNA damage response were increased in the PGCs after the knockdown of chicken cyclin F like. We further observed that the Nanog homeobox controlled the transcriptional activity of chicken cyclin F like gene in PGCs. Collectively, the chicken cyclin F like gene, which is not reported in any other species, is required for maintaining the genome stability of germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2990559984,"The liver plays a key role during fasting to maintain energy homeostasis and euglycemia via metabolic processes mainly orchestrated by the insulin/glucagon ratio. We report here that fasting or calorie restriction protocols in C57BL6 mice promote a marked decrease in the hepatic protein levels of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), an important negative modulator of both G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and insulin signaling. Such downregulation of GRK2 levels is liver-specific and can be rapidly reversed by refeeding. We find that autophagy, and not the proteasome, represents the main mechanism implicated in fasting-induced GRK2 degradation in the liver in vivo. Reducing GRK2 levels in murine primary hepatocytes facilitates glucagon-induced glucose production and enhances the expression of the key gluconeogenic enzyme Pck1. Conversely, preventing full downregulation of hepatic GRK2 during fasting using adenovirus-driven overexpression of this kinase in the liver leads to glycogen accumulation, decreased glycemia, and hampered glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis, thus preventing a proper and complete adaptation to nutrient deprivation. Overall, our data indicate that physiological fasting-induced downregulation of GRK2 in the liver is key for allowing complete glucagon-mediated responses and efficient metabolic adaptation to fasting in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2991182267,"Fas-apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2) is a member of the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing (TMBIM) family. TMBIM family is comprised of six anti-apoptotic proteins that suppress cell death by regulating endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ homeostasis. Recent studies have implicated two TMBIM proteins, GRINA and BAX Inhibitor-1, in mediating cytoprotection via autophagy. However, whether FAIM2 plays a role in autophagy has been unknown. Here we show that FAIM2 localizes to the lysosomes at basal state and facilitates autophagy through interaction with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 proteins in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. FAIM2 overexpression increased autophagy flux, while autophagy flux was impaired in shRNA-mediated knockdown (shFAIM2) cells, and the impairment was more evident in the presence of rapamycin. In shFAIM2 cells, autophagosome maturation through fusion with lysosomes was impaired, leading to accumulation of autophagosomes. A functional LC3-interacting region motif within FAIM2 was essential for the interaction with LC3 and rescue of autophagy flux in shFAIM2 cells while LC3-binding property of FAIM2 was dispensable for the anti-apoptotic function in response to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. Suppression of autophagosome maturation was also observed in a null mutant of Caenorhabditis elegans lacking xbx-6, the ortholog of FAIM2. Our study suggests that FAIM2 is a novel regulator of autophagy mediating autophagosome maturation through the interaction with LC3."
https://openalex.org/W2993722922,"Blood vessels are comprised of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Obtaining both types of cells from vessels of living donors is not possible without invasive surgery. To address this, we have devised a strategy whereby human endothelial and smooth muscle cells derived from blood progenitors from the same donor could be cultured with autologous leukocytes to generate a same donor “vessel in a dish” bioassay. Autologous sets of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs), smooth muscle cells (BO-SMCs), and leukocytes were obtained from four donors. Cells were treated in monoculture and cumulative coculture conditions. The endothelial specific mediator endothelin-1 along with interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α, and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 were measured under control culture conditions and after stimulation with cytokines. Cocultures remained viable throughout. The profile of individual mediators released from cells was consistent with what we know of endothelial and smooth muscle cells cultured from blood vessels. For the first time, we report a proof of concept study where autologous blood outgrowth “vascular” cells and leukocytes were studied alone and in coculture. This novel bioassay has usefulness in vascular biology research, patient phenotyping, drug testing, and tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2998962909,"The ecological environment of the Yellow River Delta is fragile, and the soil degradation in the region is serious. Therefore it is important to discern the status of the soil degradation in a timely manner for soil conservation and utilization. The study area of this study was Kenli County in the Yellow River Delta of China. First, physical and chemical data of the soil were obtained by field investigations and soil sample analyses, and the hyper-spectra of air-dried soil samples were obtained via spectrometer. Then, the soil degradation index (SDI) was constructed by the key indicators of soil degradation, including pH, SSC, OM, AN, AP, AK, and soil texture. Next, according to a cluster analysis, soil degradation was divided into the following three grades: light degradation, moderate degradation, and heavy degradation. Moreover, the spectral characteristics of soil degradation were analyzed, and an estimation model of SDI was established by multiple stepwise regression. The results showed that the overall level of reflectance spectra increased with increased degree of soil degradation, that both derivative transformation and waveband reorganization could enhance the spectral information of soil degradation, and that the correlation between SDI and the spectral parameter of (Rλ2+Rλ1)/(Rλ2-Rλ1) was the highest among all the spectral parameters studied. On this basis, the optimum estimation model of SDI was established with the correlation coefficient of 0.811. This study fully embodies the potential of hyper-spectral technology in the study of soil degradation and provides a technical reference for the rapid extraction of information from soil degradation. Additionally, the study area is typical and representative, and thus can indirectly reflect the soil degradation situation of the whole Yellow River Delta."
https://openalex.org/W2999030035,"Blockchain technology gains more and more attention in the past decades and has been applied in many areas. The main bottleneck for the development and application of blockchain is its limited scalability. Blockchain with directed acyclic graph structure (BlockDAG) is proposed in order to alleviate the scalability problem. One of the key technical problems in BlockDAG is the identification of honest blocks which are very important for establishing a stable and invulnerable total order of all the blocks. The stability and security of BlockDAG largely depends on the precision of honest block identification. This paper presents a novel universal framework based on graph theory, called MaxCord, for identifying the honest blocks in BlockDAG. By introducing the concept of discord, the honest block identification is modelled as a generalized maximum independent set problem. Several algorithms are developed, including exact, greedy and iterative filtering algorithms. The extensive comparisons between proposed algorithms and the existing method were conducted on the simulated BlockDAG data to show that the proposed iterative filtering algorithm identifies the honest blocks both efficiently and effectively. The proposed MaxCord framework and algorithms can set the solid foundation for the BlockDAG technology."
https://openalex.org/W2989729993,"This study was aimed at investigating the therapeutic effects of BITRAP, a bispecific fusion protein targeting TNF-α and IL-21, on the development of autoimmune arthritis in humans and mice. To verify the effects of BITRAP in human, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with BITRAP under IL-17-producing T (Th17) cell-polarizing conditions or osteoclast differentiation conditions. BITRAP treatment inhibited the production of IL-17 and vascular endothelial growth factor but increased the production of IL-10 in CD4+ T cells, as well as directly suppressed osteoclastogenesis. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) knockout mice were treated with BITRAP. Following injection in CIA mice, BITRAP rapidly migrated into the inflamed joints and remained there for 72 hours. Application of BITRAP attenuated the severity of autoimmune arthritis in CIA and IL-1Ra knockout mice by reducing the numbers of inflammatory cytokine-expressing cells and Th17 cells and antibody secretion. Finally, BITRAP suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation, as well as production of IL-17 and TNF-α, in murine splenic CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that BITRAP, a bispecific fusion protein targeting TNF-α and IL-21, may be an effective treatment to overcome the limitations of anti-TNF therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

To confirm pathogenicity of the previously identified causative mutation of spondylolysis and investigate the genetic etiology, we generate a new mouse line harboring D673V mutation in the Slc26a2 gene. D673V mutation induces delayed endochondral ossification characterized by transiently reduced chondrocyte proliferation in mice at the early postnatal stage. Adult D673V homozygotes exhibit dysplastic isthmus and reduced bone volume of the dorsal vertebra resembling the detached vertebral bony structure when spondylolysis occurs, including the postzygopophysis, vertebral arch, and spinous process, which causes biomechanical alterations around the isthmic region of L4-5 vertebrae indicated by finite element analysis. Consistently, partial ablation of Slc26a2 in vertebral skeletal cells using Col1a1-Cre; Slc26a2 fl/fl mouse line recapitulates a similar but worsened vertebral phenotype featured by lamellar isthmus. In addition, when reaching late adulthood, D673V homozygotes develop an evident bone-loss phenotype and show impaired osteogenesis. These findings support a multifactorial etiology, involving congenitally predisposed isthmic conditions, altered biomechanics, and age-dependent bone loss, which leads to SLC26A2-related spondylolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2990668579,"Translocator protein (TSPO, 18kDa), which was previously known as a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is associated with psychiatric disorders and acts as a neuroimaging biomarker. However, its function and mechanism in modulating behaviors are less well-known. Herein, we found that TSPO in migratory locusts shows conserved protein traits and is expressed at high levels in the brains. The expression levels of tspo mRNA and protein were higher in brains of solitary locusts than those in gregarious locusts, whereas the mRNA and protein expression levels remained stable during crowding and isolation, suggesting that the expression level of TSPO is potentially associated with behavioral phenotype of solitary locusts. Moreover, tspo RNAi knockdown in the brains of solitary locusts decreased their olfactory repulsion. After RNAi knockdown of tyramine receptor (TyR) in the brains of solitary locusts, RNA-seq analysis identified that a functional class of receptors, which included tspo, was downregulated significantly. Moreover, tspo mRNA and protein expression levels were downregulated and upregulated after TyR RNAi knockdown and activation, respectively. tspo RNAi knockdown in the brains of solitary locusts induced the attractive response and inhibited the function of tyramine (TA)-TyR in inducing olfactory repulsion. In gregarious locusts, tspo RNAi knockdown inhibited the function of TA-TyR inducing olfactory repulsion. This study confirms that TSPO acts as a crucial effector protein in TA-TyR signaling to modulate olfactory repulsion. Furthermore, this study provides a novel mechanism by which TSPO functionally connects a G-protein-coupled receptor and a mitochondria membrane protein in modulating olfactory repulsion."
