https://openalex.org/W2024702334,"""Excess lactate,"" an indicator of oxygen debt, has been studied as a metabolic index of severity of the shock state in human patients. The levels of excess lactate correspond to severity of circulatory failure, and an excess of more than 4 millimoles per liter prognosticates a fatal outcome. The validity of this index was confirmed by studies on experimental hemorrhagic shock in dogs. It provides a parameter for measurement of ""reversibility"" and serves as an objective clinical guide."
https://openalex.org/W2029782357,Difference spectra of the visual pigments have been measured in single rods and cones of a parafoveal region of the human retina. Rods display an absorption maximum (lambdamax) at about 505 mmicro associated with rhodopsin. Three kinds of cones were measured: a blue-sensitive cone with Amaxe about 450 mpf; two green-sensitive cones with Xmaa about 525 mumicro; and a red-sensitive cone with lambdamax about 555 mmicro These are presumably samples of the three types of cone responsible for human color vision.
https://openalex.org/W2056911832,The lethal effect of two x-ray doses can be considerably enhanced if cultured cells are exposed to actinomycin D between doses. Net survival can be modified by temperature as well as actinomycin treatment. These effects are related to repair of sublethal damage and to cell kinetics between doses.
https://openalex.org/W2012883755,"The injection of 100 μg of estradiol benzoate into female rats 96 hours after birth abolished sexual receptivity in adulthood, even with estrogen and progesterone replacement after ovariectomy. The administration of testosterone propionate to these animals in adulthood elicited the full pattern of male sexual behavior. The same dose of estrogen given to male rats 96 hours after birth produced adults which were unable to achieve intromission, although they mounted as frequently as normal animals. Testosterone replacement after castration in adulthood reproduced this abnormal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1991853651,"Pigeons were trained to discriminate between 580 mk (S+) and 540 mmicro (S-) by procedures which resulted in either a large amount of responding to S-or in little or no responding to S-. A shift in the peak of a postdiscrimination generalization gradient, away from S-, was obtained only if the discrimination was learned with a large amount of responding to S-."
https://openalex.org/W2054288509,"A strain of Aspergillus flavus produces, on foodstuffs, a substance which causes tremors and convulsions when administered to mice and certain other animals. The tremorgen, which differs from other recognized toxins attributed to this species, is associated with a distinct, dark spot on thin-layer chromatograms viewed under ultraviolet light."

https://openalex.org/W2080723992,"It is known that cells of Escherichia coli B exposed to 2537-Å ultraviolet radiation will show a higher survival (photoreactivation) if subsequently irradiated at 3650 Å, and that they will also show a higher survival (liquid holding recovery) if subsequently held in a liquid. We find that cells given an optimal recovery treatment of one type show no further recovery if also subjected to the other type of treatment. It is concluded that liquid holding treatment acts only upon photoreactivable damage."
https://openalex.org/W2086762859,"Action potentials of single cells, recorded by means of extracellular microelectrodes from the cat's cerebral cortex after topical application of penicillin, undergo characteristic changes in the course of seizure episodes. In individual neurons, these changes in spike configuration are fully reversible and are repeatedly observed with each of such episodes. Two alternative interpretations offered for these findings appear to be critically dependent upon the relationship between the position of the microelectrode and the cell itself: there might be a transitory failure of the spike to invade part of the neuronal membrane or transitory neuronal swelling."
https://openalex.org/W2054726355,"Liver slices from seven terrestrial and six aquatic animals studied ""activated"" parathion, converting it to paraoxon, a potent anticholinesterase. Although there are similarities between the liver systems which activate parathion and which degrade drugs such as aminopyrine and phenacetin, liver slices of aquatic vertebrates can activate parathion but cannot degrade such drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2029043098,Chronic ataxia associated with hypoplasia of the cerebellum was induced by intracerebral inoculation of newborn hamsters with various strains of rat virus. The condition usually became recognizable within 3 weeks of inoculation and remained static as the animals matured. Preliminary studies suggest that hypoplasia is induced by the rat virus acting on the outer germinal layer of the cerebellum at a critical time in its ontogenic development.
https://openalex.org/W1981163147,"With a new modification of the release and recapture technique in which day-flying male moths are artificially painted, released, and then lured by their females into traps, it has been possible to obtain differential recapture frequencies in natural areas of the Neotropics."
https://openalex.org/W2033429841,"Mice of the C3H and DBA strains thymectomized at birth showed a consistent and striking suppression of antibody production (hemolysin response) to sheep erythrocytes. When cell-tight Millipore diffusion chambers containing syngeneic thymic tissue were implanted intraperitoneally, the capacity of these neonatally thymectomized mice to respond to this antigen was restored. The pattern of response and the mean titer were similar to the pattern and mean titer observed in neonatally thymectomized mice bearing subcutaneous grafts of syngeneic thymic tissue. These data are consistent with the concept that thymic tissue within the chamber produced a specific diffusible factor that enabled the thymectomized animal to establish immunologic competence."
https://openalex.org/W2040530044,"Hexamethylphosphoramide and hexamethylmelamine are effective as male house fly chemosterilants. Both compounds are structurally similar to the two highly active sterilants tepa and tretamine, but they differ from the aziridinyl compounds in their low toxicity for mammals and in their lack of alkylating properties. This discovery of nonalkylating male sterilants of low toxicity should substantially increase the scope and practicality of the sterilemale control method."
https://openalex.org/W1981117227,"Courting males of Drosophila persimilis produce a pulsed ""vibration sound,"" with frequency of oscillation and pulse repetition rate markedly different from that of D. pseudoobscura. These differences probably contribute to reproductive isolation. Flight frequency is the same in both species. Brief ""preliminary sounds"" are common and the same in both species. Males with large parts of both wings removed produce nearly normal vibration sounds, and normal preliminary sounds."
https://openalex.org/W2066012005,"Rats learned to avoid a place where they were repeatedly given electroconvulsive shock treatments, but the learning was slow in comparison with that obtained with subconvulsive shock. Convulsive shock given 5 seconds after administration of subconvulsive shock retarded place-avoidance learning."
https://openalex.org/W2084939019,"The nonfunctional virus protein isolated from plants infected with the PM2 strain of tobacco mosaic virus aggregates to form elongated, two-stranded, open helical structures, in marked contrast with functional tobacco mosaic virus protein which aggregates into rods. This unique type of aggregation may explain why the PM2 protein is unable to combine with viral nucleic acid to form stable infectious virus particles."

https://openalex.org/W2043023421,Methemoglobin is easily formed during the deoxygenation of hemoglobin. It can be removed with methemoglobin reductase. The Soret spectrum of pure deoxyhemoglobin is reported. Comparison of these data with the published spectra shows that some of these are incorrect since they must represent mixtures of deoxy-and methemoglobin.
https://openalex.org/W2065203759,"Observation of six inbred strains of mice in a water escape test revealed that albino strains perform markedly slower than non-albino strains. Performances of F(1), F(2), and backcross offspring of selected crosses between these strains indicated that there is an association between the homozygous condition for albinism (cc) and slow performance in the water escape test."
https://openalex.org/W2056431086,"Studies of the eastern wood roach, Cryptocercus punctulatus, reveal that, under laboratory conditions, the mating chambers in rotten wood are inhabited by mated pairs, the male of which will usually defend the chamber successfully against intruding males by a form of fighting. In every staged contest in which the intruder won the fight, it also won the resident female. Females, as well as unmated males singly inhabiting a chamber, could not be induced to defend against an intruder of either sex."
https://openalex.org/W2047710628,A neutral volatile substance in ruminal contents from sheep suffering from acute indigestion due to overfeeding has been identified as ethanol. Ethanol was consistently observed in ruminal material from both cattle and sheep after they had been fed large amounts of readily fermentable carbohydrate.
https://openalex.org/W1996882866,"Large hypodermal cells with giant polytene chromosomes are present within the developing feet of Sarcophaga and other fly pupae. The cells secrete a large volume of cuticle; at this time there is extensive ""puffing"" of the chromosomes. Being hypodermal and superficially situated with permanent secretory products, the cells could be ideal experimental and genetical tools."
https://openalex.org/W2082849403,"Single-trial interhemispheric transfer of a discrimination task engram was studied by eliciting spreading depression unilaterally during acquisition of the discrimination. Complete transfer to the untrained side occurred after one trial with both hemispheres functional, if 10 minutes elapsed between this trial and the elicitation of spreading depression in the trained side. If depression was elicited 15 seconds after the trial no transfer occurred. correct response highly probable."
https://openalex.org/W2032134919,"Several species of a genus Cancer have a DNA that has a light buoyant density and that contains mainly deoxyadenylate and thymidylate. The presence of this polymer was demonstrated previously in testes and vas deferens. By a modified procedure for isolating DNA, the muscles, liver, and eggs of Cancer borealis are also shown to contain the deoxyadenylate-thymidylate-like polymer."
https://openalex.org/W2014962123,"Membrane properties of the giant muscle fiber of the barnacle Balanus nubilus were studied by controlling the ionic composition of the external and internal media. The resting potential decreases with increasing external K-concentration, [K(+)](out), and decreasing internal K-concentration, [K(+)](in), over a considerable range. Spike potentials are elicited when the internal calcium ions are removed, and the overshoot is determined by the ratio between [Ca(++)](out) and [K(+)](in) and not by the external or internal [Na(+)]."
https://openalex.org/W2081354958,"Three-dimensional structure of DNA from PBS2 bacteriophage, which contains uracil in place of the more usual thymine, is the same as that of ""normal"" DNA. The difference in secondary structure between DNA and RNA thus appears to be due to the 2'-hydroxyl group alone."
https://openalex.org/W2000748498,"The cervical epithelium from five patients with varying degrees of histologically proven intra-epithelial neoplasia can be grown successfully in tissue culture. After four or less successive transfers, the cells are diploid and have a normal karyotype."
https://openalex.org/W2010794653,"Mice genetically susceptible to alcohol orientation were allowed to develop a preference for 10 percent ethanol over tap water. A low dose (12 roentgens per hour for 4 hours) of whole-body gamma radiation was used as an unconditional stimulus to produce alcohol-avoidance behavior. A marked aversion to the alcohol solution occurred but was extinguished within 6 days, owing probably to the very high motivation of the animals to drink alcohol. The study extends the technique of radiation-produced avoidance conditioning to include alcohol consumption as a measure of response in genetically susceptible mice."
https://openalex.org/W2048928740,"Since the interstitial water of the central nervous system is in narrow channels between cells that have surface charge, electroosmotic flow of water should accompany current flow. Current density is high close to an excitatory postsynaptic membrane and the electroosmotic effect must be significant. Simultaneity relationships between action potentials in pre- and postsynaptic cells affect postsynaptic membrane current density and modulate the effect in a way which should produce ""learning."""
https://openalex.org/W2095396924,"The exposure of erythrocytes from the elasmobranch, Squalus acanthias, to solutions isosmotic with plasma (IM) but containing urea or hydroxyurea as the sole solute does not produce hemolysis. Exposure of these cells to IM methylurea, thiourea and acetamide does produce hemolysis. Low concentrations of urea, which are associated with hemolysis, protect dogfish red cells against hemolysis by methylurea and thiourea. Dogfish red cells exposed to mediums containing high concentrations of urea, or no urea, reach 95 percent of their equilibrium concentration in less than 5 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W1979702092,"The effects of extra stimulation during postnatal days 2 to 4 in rats are mitigated by the injection of either norepinephrine or chlorpromazine prior to the stimulation. Behavioral changes in locomotion and defecation occurred in the open field, and there were changes in speed and accuracy of learning a simple maze problem."
https://openalex.org/W2043417639,"alpha-Ketoglutaric semialdehyde has been obtained as a product of hydroxyproline through reactions catalyzed by purified enzymes from Pseudomonas. It has been characterized both by chemical and enzymatic derivatives and by comparison with the chemically synthesized compound. This reactive compound, not previously known as a product of biological reactions, may participate in other metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2060097997,"One day after oral ingestion of very small doses (about 0.01 microcurie) of an I(131)/I(135) mixture, the radioiodine content of the thyroid gland was similar in children and adults (about 20 percent of the dose ingested) as was the biological half-life of the iodine (about 90 days). Measurements were made in 15 minutes by means of a whole-body counter with a cylindrical sodium iodide (Tl) crystal, 20 cm in diameter and 10 cm thick."
https://openalex.org/W2064405977,"6-Aminopenicillanic acid, from which all the true penicillins are derived, inhibits the destruction of cephalosporin C by certain microorganisms. This inhibition is probably specific for ""cephalosporinase."" The enzymatic deacetylation of cephalosporin C is not affected by the acid."

https://openalex.org/W1976442651,Speech sequences in groups of three persons each were registered by throat microphones and voice relays. These and other automatic devices were used to program differential reinforcement of given speech sequences with a modified conditioning technique. The results show that the order of speakers in a discussion can be brought under partial experimental control with accompanying changes in the role behavior of individuals.
https://openalex.org/W2036513296,The action of heat on a mixture of amino acids was studied as a possible abiological pathway for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. Guanine was detected. This result is significant in the context of chemical evolution.
https://openalex.org/W2002137601,"Highly purified neuraminidase from influenza virus prevents embryonated eggs from infection by Lee-B influenza virus. The degree of prevention afforded is equal to that of neuraminidases from Vibrio cholerae and from Clostridium perfringens when assayed at the same enzyme activity. The preventive effect is much lower against PR-8 virus. The results support the concept that the intact ""receptor"" containing sialic acid is required for the binding and infection of cells by influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2016522431,"When the vagus nerves in the neck of the dog are cut and the ends toward the brain are stimulated, gastric contractions follow. These contractions are not abolished by section of the cervical spinal cord, section of anterior and posterior thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves, section of the splanchnic nerves, or paralysis or excision of the celiac plexus. Evidence for the existence of a humoral blood-borne substance originating in the brain was obtained by experiments with an isolated perfused head, by perfusion of isolated stomachs by donor dogs, by cross-perfusion between two dogs, and by plasmapheresis. stimulates the stomach."
https://openalex.org/W2090754691,"A captive 8-year-old dolphin, well adapted to contact with human beings, was tested by the discrimination method for underwater perception of visual forms or patterns. The animal successfully discriminated 21 of the 25 pairs of stimuli presented. After having learned a particular combination, the dolphin was immediately able to respond to different but related pairs which had been modified in various ways. The memory of the animal for discriminations previously made was excellent."
