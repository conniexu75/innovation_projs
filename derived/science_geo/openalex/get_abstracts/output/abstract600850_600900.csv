https://openalex.org/W2772641108,"The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to determine the presence and distribution of aquatic organisms has become an important tool to monitor and investigate freshwater communities. The successful application of this method in the field, however, is dependent on the effectiveness of positive DNA verification, which is influenced by site-specific environmental parameters. Factors affecting eDNA concentrations in aquatic ecosystems include flow conditions, and the presence of substances that possess DNA-binding properties or inhibitory effects. In this study we investigated the influence of different environmental parameters on the detection success of eDNA using the invasive goby Neogobius melanostomus. In a standardized laboratory setup, different conditions of flow, sediment-properties, and fish density were compared, as well as different potential natural inhibitors such as algae, humic substances, and suspended sediment particles. The presence of sediment was mainly responsible for lower eDNA detection in the water samples, regardless of flow-through or standing water conditions and a delayed release of eDNA was detected in the presence of sediment. Humic substances had the highest inhibitory effect on eDNA detection followed by algae and siliceous sediment particles. The results of our study highlight that a successful application of eDNA methods in field surveys strongly depends on site-specific conditions, such as water flow conditions, sediment composition, and suspended particles. All these factors should be carefully considered when sampling, analyzing, and interpreting eDNA detection results."
https://openalex.org/W2771546113,"Driver fatigue is an important contributor to road accidents, and fatigue detection has major implications for transportation safety. The aim of this research is to analyze the multiple entropy fusion method and evaluate several channel regions to effectively detect a driver's fatigue state based on electroencephalogram (EEG) records. First, we fused multiple entropies, i.e., spectral entropy, approximate entropy, sample entropy and fuzzy entropy, as features compared with autoregressive (AR) modeling by four classifiers. Second, we captured four significant channel regions according to weight-based electrodes via a simplified channel selection method. Finally, the evaluation model for detecting driver fatigue was established with four classifiers based on the EEG data from four channel regions. Twelve healthy subjects performed continuous simulated driving for 1–2 hours with EEG monitoring on a static simulator. The leave-one-out cross-validation approach obtained an accuracy of 98.3%, a sensitivity of 98.3% and a specificity of 98.2%. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, indicating that the multiple entropy fusion features are significant factors for inferring the fatigue state of a driver."
https://openalex.org/W2773312977,"Background and aims Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a bidirectional association with metabolic syndrome. It affects up to 30% of the general population, 70% of individuals with diabetes and 90% with obesity. The main histological hallmark of progressive NAFLD is fibrosis. There is a bidirectional epidemiological link between periodontitis and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD, periodontitis and diabetes share common risk factors, are characterised by inflammation and associated with changes in commensal bacteria. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that periodontitis is associated with NAFLD and with significant fibrosis in two study groups. Methods We analyzed data from a population-based survey and a patient-based study. NHANES III participants with abdominal ultrasound and sociodemographic, clinical, and oral examination data were extracted and appropriate weighting applied. In a separate patient-based study, consenting patients with biopsy-proved NAFLD (or with liver indices too mild to justify biopsy) underwent dental examination. Basic Periodontal Examination score was recorded. Results In NHANES, periodontitis was significantly associated with steatosis in 8172 adults even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. However, associations were fully explained after accounting for features of metabolic syndrome. In the patient-based study, periodontitis was significantly more common in patients with biopsy-proven NASH and any fibrosis (F0-F4) than without NASH (p = 0.009). Periodontitis was more common in patients with NASH and significant fibrosis (F2-4) than mild or no fibrosis (F0-1, p = 0.04). Conclusions Complementary evidence from an epidemiological survey and a clinical study show that NAFLD is associated with periodontitis and that the association is stronger with significant liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2774644059,"Platelets store a plethora of different molecules within their granules, modulating numerous pathways, not only in coagulation, but also in angiogenesis, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases. These molecules get rapidly released upon activation and therefore represent an easily accessible indirect marker for platelet activation. Accurate analysis of platelet-derived molecules in the plasma requires appropriate anticoagulation to avoid in vitro activation and subsequent degranulation of platelets, potentially causing artificially high levels and masking biologically relevant differences within translational research studies. However, there is still enormous heterogeneity among anticoagulants used to prevent unwanted platelet activation, so that plasma levels reported for platelet granule contents range over several orders of magnitude. To address this problem and to define the most robust method of plasma preparation to avoid in vitro platelet activation during processing, we compared plasma concentrations of the three platelet-stored factors thrombospondin (TSP-1), platelet factor 4 (PF4), and soluble P-selectin (sCD62P) between human blood samples anticoagulated with either citrate-theophylline-adenosine-dipyridamole (CTAD), acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD), citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or heparin. Additionally, we assessed the effect of storage temperature and time between blood drawing and sample processing within the differentially anticoagulated samples. Our data strongly support the use of CTAD as anticoagulant for determining plasma concentrations of platelet-stored molecules, as anticoagulation with heparin or EDTA led to a 12.4- or 8.3-fold increase in plasma levels of PF4, respectively. Whereas ACD was similar effective as CTAD, citrate only showed comparable PF4 plasma levels when plasma was kept at 4°C. Moreover, blood sampling with CTAD as anticoagulant resulted in the most reproducible values, even when samples were processed at ambient temperature or after storage over 6 hours. In the latter case, anticoagulation with heparin or EDTA led to artificially high plasma levels indicative of in vitro platelet activation. Therefore, we want to raise scientific awareness for choosing CTAD as optimal anticoagulant for the detection of platelet-stored molecules in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2771788271,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of pathobiological processes in various cancer. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-93 expression was significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with that in matched normal mucosal tissues. High expression of miR-93 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Functionally, ectopic expression of miR-93 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT phenotypes, and repressed apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in vitro, and promoted tumor formation in vivo. We further identified that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) was a direct target of miR-93 by using luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting assay. Furthermore, knockdown of TIMP2 with specific siRNA showed similar oncogenic effects in gastric cancer cells with that transfected with miR-93 mimics. Our findings indicated that miR-93 serves as a tumor promoter in human gastric carcinogenesis by targeting TIMP2, suggesting that miR-93 might be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for treatment of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2771861718,"Complement activation correlates to rheumatoid arthritis disease activity, and increased amounts of the complement split product C5a is observed in synovial fluids from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Blockade of C5a or its receptor (C5aR) is efficacious in several arthritis models. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of C5a and C5aR in human rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis-both with respect to expression and function. Synovial fluid, blood and synovial samples were obtained from rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis patients as a less inflammatory arthritis type, and blood from healthy subjects. Cells infiltrating synovial tissue were analysed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. SF and blood were analysed for biomarkers by flow cytometry or ELISA. The effect of a blocking anti-human C5aR mAb on leukocyte migration was determined using a Boyden chamber. Appropriate statistical tests were applied for comparisons. C5aR+ cells were detected in most rheumatoid arthritis, in all psoriatic arthritis, but not in non-inflammatory control synovia. C5aR+ cells were primarily neutrophils and macrophages. C5aR+ macrophages were mainly found in lymphoid aggregates in close contact with T cells. C5a levels were increased in both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis synovial fluid compared to osteoarthritis, and in blood from rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy subjects. Neutrophil and monocyte migration to rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid was significantly inhibited by anti-C5aR. The data support that the C5a-C5aR axis may be driving the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the synovial fluid and synovium in both rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, and suggest that C5a or C5aR may be a promising treatment target in both diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2773596292,"To describe the burden associated with different anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment strategies for wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) in a real-word setting in Japan.Single-center, cross-sectional survey of caregivers of patients with wAMD performed in a hospital in Mito-City, a rural area in Japan. Caregiver burden was evaluated using the Burden Index of Caregivers (BIC-11), and depressive symptoms were assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Retrospective medical chart review was conducted to monitor resource use and visual acuity outcomes in patients. The productivity loss of caregivers accompanying patients on hospital visits was estimated using the human capital method.Seventy-one patient-caregiver pairs were included. Most caregivers were female (74.6%), spouse/partner (54.9%), employed (46.5%), and the primary caregiver (85.9%). Patients received anti-VEGF treatment as follows: treat-and-extend (T&E; n = 42), switch (from as-needed [PRN] to T&E; n = 18), PRN (n = 10), and other (n = 1). Caregiver-related burden (total BIC-11 scores) were 4.29 (T&E) 4.60 (PRN), and 5.33 (switch) (p = NS). The mean number of hospital visits was lower with T&E than PRN (7.88 vs. 14.0 [p = 0.00674] in year 1 and 5.68 vs. 9.0 in year 2). For patients who switched from PRN to T&E, the mean number of hospital visits decreased from 13.21 to 7.43 (p<0.0001) in the first year after switch. The productivity loss associated with accompanying patients to the hospital was lower for caregivers of patients receiving T&E than PRN (mean differences: 74,456.04 JPY [p = 0.00284] in year 1 and 40843.14 JPY in year 2), and was also reduced for caregivers of patients who switched from PRN to T&E.wAMD treatment with anti-VEGF agents via T&E reduced hospital visits compared with PRN, where associated monitoring visits are necessary to provide good patient outcomes. T&E was associated with a reduction trend in caregiver burden, including time and costs."
https://openalex.org/W2773209794,"In cancer, glycolysis driving enzymes and their regulating microRNAs are one of the key focus of oncology research lately. The glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) is crucial for the Warburg effect in human glioma, the most common malignant brain tumor. In the present study, we studied the tumorigenic role of HK2 in glioma, and clarified the mechanism of miR-218 induced HK2 regulation in glioma development. The HK2 expression in patient derived glioma and non neoplastic brain tissue was quantified. The HK2 silenced U87 and U251 cell lines were assessed for their proliferation, migration and invasive potential in vitro, while the tumor forming potential of U87 cells was evaluated in vivo. The untreated cell lines served as control. The HK2 expression in (a) lentivirus-infected, miR-218 overexpressing and (b) shRNA mediated Bmi1 silenced U87 and U251 glioma cell lines were quantified. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR analysis and WB were employed as required. The HK2 expression was significantly increased in glioma tissues comparing with the non neoplastic brain tissues and was positively correlated with the glioma grade. Silencing HK2 in glioma cell lines significantly decreased their proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic abilities. Although, overexpression of miR-218 significantly downregulated the HK2 expression, luciferase reporter assay failed to show HK2 as the direct target of miR-218. A direct correlation, however, was observed between HK2 and Bmi-1, the direct target of miR-218. Taken together, our findings confirmed the tumorigenic activity of HK2 in glioma, and the involvement of the miR218/Bmi1 pathway in the regulation of its expression."
https://openalex.org/W2774359945,"Background A recent publication suggested molecular mimicry of a nucleoprotein (NP) sequence from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) strain, the backbone used in the construction of the reassortant strain X-179A that was used in Pandemrix® vaccine, and reported on anti-hypocretin (HCRT) receptor 2 (anti-HCRTR2) autoantibodies in narcolepsy, mostly in post Pandemrix® narcolepsy cases (17 of 20 sera). In this study, we re-examined this hypothesis through mass spectrometry (MS) characterization of Pandemrix®, and two other pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1)-2009 vaccines, Arepanrix® and Focetria®, and analyzed anti-HCRTR2 autoantibodies in narcolepsy patients and controls using three independent strategies. Methods MS characterization of Pandemrix® (2 batches), Arepanrix® (4 batches) and Focetria® (1 batch) was conducted with mapping of NP 116I or 116M spectrogram. Two sets of narcolepsy cases and controls were used: 40 post Pandemrix® narcolepsy (PP-N) cases and 18 age-matched post Pandemrix® controls (PP-C), and 48 recent (≤6 months) early onset narcolepsy (EO-N) cases and 70 age-matched other controls (O-C). Anti-HCRTR2 autoantibodies were detected using three strategies: (1) Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with transient expression of HCRTR2 were stained with human sera and then analyzed by flow cytometer; (2) In vitro translation of [35S]-radiolabelled HCRTR2 was incubated with human sera and immune complexes of autoantibody and [35S]-radiolabelled HCRTR2 were quantified using a radioligand-binding assay; (3) Optical density (OD) at 450 nm (OD450) of human serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to HCRTR2 stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cell line was measured using an in-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results NP 116M mutations were predominantly present in all batches of Pandemrix®, Arepanrix® and Focetria®. The wild-type NP109-123 (ILYDKEEIRRIWRQA), a mimic to HCRTR234-45 (YDDEEFLRYLWR), was not found to bind to DQ0602. Three or four subjects were found positive for anti-HCRTR2 autoantibodies using two strategies or the third one, respectively. None of the post Pandemrix® narcolepsy cases (0 of 40 sera) was found positive with all three strategies. Conclusion Anti-HCRTR2 autoantibody is not a significant biological feature of narcolepsy or of post Pandemrix® autoimmune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2774632723,"Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) infections are an ever-increasing global issue, especially in the Indian subcontinent. Here we report genetic insight into a blaOXA-181 harbouring Klebsiella pneumoniae, belonging to the pandemic lineage ST147, that represents an intermediate stage towards pan-drug resistance. The CR-KP isolate DA48896 was isolated from a patient from Pakistan and was susceptible only to tigecycline and colistin. It harboured blaOXA-181 and was assigned to sequence type ST147. Analysis from whole genome sequencing revealed a very high sequence similarity to the previously sequenced pan-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate MS6671 from the United Arab Emirates. The two isolates are very closely related with only 46 chromosomal nucleotide differences, 14 indels and differences in plasmid content. Both carry a substantial number of plasmid-borne and chromosomally encoded resistance determinants. Interestingly, the two differences in susceptibility between the isolates could be attributed to DA48896 lacking an insertion of blaOXA-181 into the mgrB gene that results in colistin resistance in MS6671 and SNPs affecting AcrAB efflux pump expression likely to result in tigecycline resistance. These differences between the otherwise very similar isolates indicate that strong selection has occurred for resistance towards these last-resort drugs and illustrates the trajectory of resistance evolution of OXA-181-producing versions of the ST147 international risk clone."
https://openalex.org/W2772395671,"The coastal marine ecosystem near the Elwha River was altered by a massive sediment influx-over 10 million tonnes-during the staged three-year removal of two hydropower dams. We used time series of bathymetry, substrate grain size, remotely sensed turbidity, scuba dive surveys, and towed video observations collected before and during dam removal to assess responses of the nearshore subtidal community (3 m to 17 m depth). Biological changes were primarily driven by sediment deposition and elevated suspended sediment concentrations. Macroalgae, predominantly kelp and foliose red algae, were abundant before dam removal with combined cover levels greater than 50%. Where persistent sediment deposits formed, macroalgae decreased greatly or were eliminated. In areas lacking deposition, macroalgae cover decreased inversely to suspended sediment concentration, suggesting impacts from light reduction or scour. Densities of most invertebrate and fish taxa decreased in areas with persistent sediment deposition; however, bivalve densities increased where mud deposited over sand, and flatfish and Pacific sand lance densities increased where sand deposited over gravel. In areas without sediment deposition, most invertebrate and fish taxa were unaffected by increased suspended sediment or the loss of algae cover associated with it; however, densities of tubeworms and flatfish, and primary cover of sessile invertebrates increased suggesting benefits of increased particulate matter or relaxed competition with macroalgae for space. As dam removal neared completion, we saw evidence of macroalgal recovery that likely owed to water column clearing, indicating that long-term recovery from dam removal effects may be starting. Our results are relevant to future dam removal projects in coastal areas and more generally to understanding effects of increased sedimentation on nearshore subtidal benthic communities."
https://openalex.org/W2775045947,"Objective To understand the predisposing factors that lead to the practice of self-medication and the factors associated with the use of medicines via self-medication in the adult population of Brazil. Methods The analyzed data are part of the National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines (PNAUM), a survey whose population consisted of individual residents permanently domiciled in urban areas in Brazil. In this work, the data references the 31 573 respondents aged 20 or higher (76.2% of the final PNAUM sample). Poisson regression models with robust variance were used for estimating the independent effect of each variable with medicine use via self-medication. Results Of the interviewees, 73.6% stated they had used some medication without medical recommendation if they had previously used the same product; 73.8% stated they had used non-prescribed medicine when the medicine was already present at home; and 35.5% stated they had used some non-prescribed medication when they knew someone who had already taken the same medication. The prevalence of self-medication was 18.3%. The variables associated with the highest probability of using medicine via self-medication were: geographic region within Brazil, gender, age group, per capita income, self-assessment of health, self-reported use of previously used non-prescribed medication, and self-reported use of non-prescribed medication when that medication was already present at home. Conclusions The use of medicines via self-medication in Brazil is relatively frequent and influenced by previous experience and familiarity with the medications, and is more common among women and individuals with low self-assessment of health."
https://openalex.org/W2771489262,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous, Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that can cause disease in various sites within the human body. This bacterium is a major source of nosocomial infections that are often difficult to treat due to high intrinsic antibiotic resistance and coordinated virulence factor production. P. aeruginosa utilizes three cell-to-cell signaling systems to regulate numerous genes in response to cell density. One of these systems utilizes the small molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (Pseudomonas quinolone signal [PQS]) as a signal that acts as a co-inducer for the transcriptional regulator PqsR. Quinolone signaling is required for virulence in multiple infection models, and PQS is produced during human infections, making this system an attractive target for potential drug development. In this study we have examined the role of a TetR-type transcriptional regulator, PsrA, in the regulation of PQS production by P. aeruginosa. Previous studies showed that PsrA regulates genes of the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, including PA0506, which encodes a FadE homolog. In this report, we show that deletion of psrA resulted in a large decrease in PQS production and that co-deletion of PA0506 allowed PQS production to be restored to a wild type level. We also found that PQS production could be restored to the psrA mutant by the addition of oleic or octanoic acid. Taken together, our data suggest that psrA positively affects PQS production by repressing the transcription of PA0506, which leads to a decrease in the conversion of acyl-CoA compounds to enoyl-CoA compounds, thereby allowing some octanoyl-CoA to escape the ß-oxidation pathway and serve as a PQS precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2772702255,"Background Treatment of advanced cutaneous melanoma remains challenging, and new data on melanoma biology are required. The most widely accepted criteria for the prognostic evaluation of melanoma are histopathological and clinical parameters, and the identification of additional tumor markers is thus of paramount importance. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI), an important tool in cancer research, is useful for unraveling the molecular profile of melanoma. Methodology/Principal findings In this report, we used the melanoma-bearing Libechov minipig (MeLiM), a unique animal model that allows observation of the complete spontaneous regression of invasive cutaneous melanoma, to investigate i) the differences between melanoma and healthy skin protein profiles and ii) the proteins potentially involved in spontaneous regression. The MeLiM tissues were cryosected, histologically characterized, analyzed by MALDI MSI, and immunohistologically stained. Multivariate statistical analyses of the MALDI MSI data revealed ten relevant m/z ions, of which the expression levels varied significantly among the studied MeLiM tissues. These ion peaks were used to create mass ion images/maps and visualize the differences between tumor and healthy skin specimens, as well as among histologically characterized tissue regions. Conclusions/Significance Protein profiles comprising ten statistically significant mass ion peaks useful for differentiating cutaneous melanoma and healthy skin tissues were determined. Peaks at m/z 3044, 6011, 6140 and 10180 were overexpressed in melanoma compared with healthy skin tissue. More specifically, m/z 6140 was expressed at significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels in normally growing melanoma regions than in regions with early and late spontaneous regression. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of MALDI MSI for the analysis of tissue cryosections at a molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2772649033,"Being pregnant and giving birth is a pivotal life event and one that a woman ordinarily remembers for most of her life. A negative childbirth experience can affect a woman's health well beyond the episode of the labour and birth itself. This study explored the meaning of a poor childbirth experience, as expressed by women who had given birth in Rwanda.In a cross-sectional household study conducted in Northern Province and in Kigali City, the capital of Rwanda, a structured questionnaire was answered by women who had given birth one to 13 months earlier. One question, answered by 898 women, asked them to rate their overall experience of childbirth from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very good). Of these, 28 women (3.1%) who had rated their childbirth experience as bad (≤ 4) were contacted for individual interviews. Seventeen of these women agreed to participate in individual in-depth interviews. The texts were analysed with a reflective lifeworld approach.The essential meaning of a ""poor"" childbirth experience was that the women had been exposed to disrespectful care, constituted by neglect, verbal or physical abuse, insufficient information, and denial of their husband as a companion. The actions of carers included abandonment, humiliation, shaming and insult, creating feelings of insecurity, fear and distrust in the women. Two of the women did not report any experience of poor care; their low rating was related to having suffered from medical complications.It is challenging that the main finding is that women are exposed to disrespectful care. In an effort to provide an equitable and high quality maternal health care system in Rwanda, there is a need to focus on activities to implement respectful, evidence-based care for all. One such activity is to develop and provide education programmes for midwives and nurses about professional behaviour when caring for and working with women during labour and birth."
https://openalex.org/W2773166071,"Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) is highly prevalent among adults and adolescents. Localized mechanical hyperalgesia around the knee and tibialis anterior have been observed in people with PFP, but limited knowledge of potential manifestations of central sensitisation exists. The aims of this study were to study conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and wide-spread hyperalgesia in adults with PFP. This assessor-blinded cross-sectional study design compared CPM and mechanical pressure pain thresholds (PPT) between 33 adults (23 females) diagnosed with PFP and 32 age and sex matched pain-free controls. The investigator taking the PPT measurements was blinded to which participants had PFP. PPTs were reliably measured using a Somedic hand-held pressure algometer at three sites: 1) The centre of the patella, 2) the tibialis anterior muscle and 3) a remote site on the lateral epicondyle. For the assessment of CPM, experimental pain was induced to the contralateral hand by immersion into a cold water bath (conditioning stimulus), and assessment of PPTs (the test stimulus) was performed before and immediately after the conditioning stimulation. On average, the CPM paradigm induced a significant increase in PPTs across the three sites (6.3-13.5%, P<0.05), however there was no difference in CPM between young adults with PFP compared to the control group, (F(1,189) = 0.39, P = 0.89). There was no difference in mechanical PPTs between the two groups (F(1,189) = 0.03, P = 0.86). Contrary to our a-priori hypothesis, we found no difference in CPM or PPT between young adults with PFP and age and sex matched pain-free controls."
https://openalex.org/W2774212220,"Task preparation involves multiple component processes, including a general evaluative process that signals the need for adjustments in control, and the engagement of task-specific control settings. Here we examined the dynamics of these different mechanisms in preparing the attentional control system for visual search. We explored preparatory activity using pupil dilation, a well-established measure of task demands and effortful processing. In an initial exploratory experiment, participants were cued at the start of each trial to search for either a salient color singleton target (an easy search task) or a low-salience shape singleton target (a difficult search task). Pupil dilation was measured during the preparation period from cue onset to search display onset. Mean dilation was larger in preparation for the difficult shape target than the easy color target. In two additional experiments, we sought to vary effects of evaluative processing and task-specific preparation separately. Experiment 2 showed that when the color and shape search tasks were matched for difficulty, the shape target no longer evoked larger dilations, and the pattern of results was in fact reversed. In Experiment 3, we manipulated difficulty within a single feature dimension, and found that the difficult search task evoked larger dilations. These results suggest that pupil dilation reflects expectations of difficulty in preparation for a search task, consistent with the activity of an evaluative mechanism. We did not find consistent evidence for relationship between pupil dilation and search performance (accuracy and response timing), suggesting that pupil dilation during search preparation may not be strongly linked to ongoing task-specific preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2771591219,"The electric vehicle (EV) is considered a premium solution to global warming and various types of pollution. Nonetheless, a key concern is the recharging of EV batteries. Therefore, this study proposes a novel approach that considers the costs of transportation loss, buildup, and substation energy loss and that incorporates harmonic power loss into optimal rapid charging station (RCS) planning. A novel optimization technique, called binary lightning search algorithm (BLSA), is proposed to solve the optimization problem. BLSA is also applied to a conventional RCS planning method. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the two RCS planning methods by using the IEEE 34-bus test system as the power grid. The comparative studies show that the proposed BLSA is better than other optimization techniques. The daily total cost in RCS planning of the proposed method, including harmonic power loss, decreases by 10% compared with that of the conventional method."
https://openalex.org/W2774761688,"Although bone is one of the most studied living materials, many questions about the manner in which bones form remain unresolved, including fine details of the skeletal structure during development. In this study, we monitored skeleton development of zebrafish larvae, using calcein fluorescence, high-resolution micro-CT 3D images and FIB-SEM in the block surface serial imaging mode. We compared calcein staining of the skeletons of the wild type and nacre mutants, which are transparent zebrafish, with micro-CT for the first 30 days post fertilization embryos, and identified significant differences. We quantified the bone volumes and mineral contents of bones, including otoliths, during development, and showed that such developmental differences, including otolith development, could be helpful in identifying phenotypes. In addition, high-resolution imaging revealed the presence of mineralized aggregates in the notochord, before the formation of the first bone in the axial skeleton. These structures might play a role in the storage of the mineral. Our results highlight the potential of these high-resolution 3D approaches to characterize the zebrafish skeleton, which in turn could prove invaluable information for better understanding the development and the characterization of skeletal phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2772130199,"In the search for novel anticancer drugs, the potassium channel KV10.1 has emerged as an interesting cancer target. Here, we report a new group of KV10.1 inhibitors, namely the purpurealidin analogs. These alkaloids are produced by the Verongida sponges and are known for their wide variety of bioactivities. In this study, we describe the synthesis and characterization of 27 purpurealidin analogs. Structurally, bromine substituents at the central phenyl ring and a methoxy group at the distal phenyl ring seem to enhance the activity on KV10.1. The mechanism of action of the most potent analog 5 was investigated. A shift of the activation curve to more negative potentials and an apparent inactivation was observed. Since KV10.1 inhibitors can be interesting anticancer drug lead compounds, the effect of 5 was evaluated on cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines. Compound 5 showed to be cytotoxic and appeared to induce apoptosis in all the evaluated cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2772316472,"The cerebral hypoperfusion caused by chronic progressive stenosis or occlusion of intracranial arteries in moyamoya disease can be treated by direct bypass or indirect revascularization procedures. The extent of collaterals from the external carotid artery (ECA) after indirect revascularization surgery is the key point of angiographic follow-up, and the invasiveness of angiography impelled us to investigate the role of ultrasonography in the evaluation of collaterals. We hypothesized that the collaterals shown on angiography might produce corresponding hemodynamic changes in color Doppler ultrasonography. We prospectively recruited moyamoya patients who underwent indirect revascularization surgery and received both preoperative and postoperative angiography and color Doppler ultrasound studies. The collaterals on angiography were graded according to Matsushima method. A total of 21 patients (age, 17 ± 10.2 years) with 24 operated hemispheres were enrolled. Patients who showed better collateral establishment by angiography had higher end-diastolic velocity (EDV), lower resistance index (RI), and larger flow volume in the superficial temporal artery (STA) and ECA (all p < 0.05). In STA, increase of EDV greater than 13.5 cm/sec or reduction of RI greater than 0.19 after operation corresponded to 94% of Matsushima grade A+B. In ECA, post-operative EDV greater than 22 cm/sec or increase of EDV greater than 6.4 cm/sec also corresponded to 94% of Matsushima grade A+B. Our findings revealed potential roles of color Doppler ultrasonography in identifying patients with poor collaterals after indirect revascularization procedures."

A total of 2689 industrial workers from one textile factory of east China were recruited to participate in the current research. Venous blood was collected, questionnaire and pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was conducted by specialist physicians. Then, we performed genotyping of three selected SNPs (rs2802292, rs10457180, and rs12206094) in FOXO3 gene in 566 NIHL patients and 566 controls. Subsequently, the main effects of genotype and its interactions were evaluated. Our results revealed that individuals with the G allele of rs2802292, G allele of rs10457180, T allele of rs12206094 (OR = 1.43, 1.43, and 1.31 respectively) and the haplotype GAC and others (TGT/GGT/GGC/GAT) (rs2802292-rs10457180-rs12206094) (OR = 1.49 and 2.09 respectively) are associated with an increased risk of NIHL in a Chinese population. Stratified analysis showed that an increased NIHL risk was found in the subjects who exposed to noise >16 years with rs2802292 GG/GT and rs10457180 AG/GG genotype with an OR of 1.62 and 1.66 respectively. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis indicated that rs10457180, rs2802292, and rs12206094 have interactions and are related to increased NIHL risk (OR = 1.53). The genetic polymorphism rs2802292, rs10457180, and rs12206094 within FOXO3 gene are associated with an increased risk of NIHL in a Chinese population and have potential to be biomarkers for noise exposed workers."
https://openalex.org/W2773348969,"CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are pro-tumorigenic, pro-angiogenic and are associated with decreased survival rates in patients with cancer, including breast cancer. Non-specific models of macrophage ablation reduce the number of TAMs and limit the development of mammary tumors. However, the lack of specificity and side effects associated with these models compromise their reliability. We hypothesized that specific and controlled macrophage depletion would provide precise data on the effects of reducing TAM numbers on tumor development. In this study, the MacLow mouse model of doxycycline-inducible and selective CD68+ macrophage depletion was crossed with the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT) mouse model of spontaneous ductal breast adenocarcinoma to generate the PyMT-MacLow line. In doxycycline-treated PyMT-MacLow mice, macrophage numbers were decreased in areas surrounding tumors by 43%. Reducing the number of macrophages by this level delayed tumor progression, generated less proliferative tumors, decreased the vascularization of carcinomas and down-regulated the expression of many pro-angiogenic genes. These results demonstrate that depleting CD68+ macrophages in an inducible and selective manner delays the development of mammary tumors and that the PyMT-MacLow model is a useful and unique tool for studying the role of TAMs in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2774536022,"Bladder cancer (BC) is a common malignancy of the urinary tract that has a higher frequency in men than in women. Cytostatic resistance and metastasis formation are significant risk factors in BC therapy; therefore, there is great interest in overcoming drug resistance and in initiating research for novel chemotherapeutic approaches. Here, we suggest that desethylamiodarone (DEA)-a metabolite of amiodarone-may have cytostatic potential. DEA activates the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (detected by JC-1 fluorescence), and induces cell death in T24 human transitional-cell bladder carcinoma cell line at physiologically achievable concentrations. DEA induces cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which may contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation, and shifts the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio to initiate apoptosis, induce AIF nuclear translocation, and activate PARP-1 cleavage and caspase-3 activation. The major cytoprotective kinases-ERK and Akt-are inhibited by DEA, which may contribute to its cell death-inducing effects. DEA also inhibits the expression of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) and reduces colony formation of T24 bladder carcinoma cells, indicating its possible inhibitory effect on metastatic potential. These data show that DEA is a novel anti-cancer candidate of multiple cell death-inducing effects and metastatic potential. Our findings recommend further evaluation of its effects in clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2774985386,"This study examines how the relationship between urbanization (measured as the percentage of total population living in urban areas) and the carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB) (measured as a ratio of carbon dioxide emissions and life expectancy) in most nations from 1960–2013 varies based on the economic context and whereabouts of a substantial portion of a nation’s urban population. To accomplish this, we use the United Nations’ (UN) definition of slum households to identify developing countries that have substantial slum populations, and estimate a Prais-Winsten regression model with panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE), allowing for disturbances that are heteroskedastic and contemporaneously correlated across panels. Our findings indicate that the rate of increase in CIWB for countries without substantial slum populations begins to slow down at higher levels of urbanization, however, the association between urbanization and CIWB is much smaller in countries with substantial slum populations. Overall, while urbanization is associated with increases in CIWB, the relationship between urban development and CIWB is vastly different in developed nations without slums than in under-developed nations with slums."
https://openalex.org/W2775694727,"Mesozoic bird fossils from the Pacific Coast of North America are rare, but small numbers are known from the Late Cretaceous aged sediments of Hornby Island, British Columbia. Most are unassociated fragments that offer little information, but additional preparation of a large coracoid has revealed more details of its structure, as well as three associated wing bones. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Maaqwi cascadensis, gen. et sp. nov. represents a derived crown or near-crown member of Ornithurae, and specifically suggests affinities with Vegaviidae. M. cascadensis is characterized by large size, and regressions based on dimensions of the coracoid suggest a large bird, with an estimated body mass of approximately 1.5 kilograms. The bones are robust, with thick walls, suggesting that M. cascadensis was a bird adapted for diving, similar to modern loons and grebes. The wings are short, while the coracoid is unusually short and broad, similar to modern loons. Along with the Ichthyornithes and Hesperornithes, M. cascadensis and Vegaviidae appear to represent a third clade of bird that evolved to exploit marine habitats in the Late Cretaceous, one specialized for foot-propelled diving and rapid cruising flight over water."
https://openalex.org/W2773740976,"Bone tissue at nanoscale is a composite mainly made of apatite crystals, collagen molecules and water. This work is aimed to study the diffusion within bone nanostructure through Monte-Carlo simulations. To this purpose, an idealized geometric model of the apatite-collagen structure was developed. Gaussian probability distribution functions were employed to design the orientation of the apatite crystals with respect to the axes (length L, width W and thickness T) of a plate-like trabecula. We performed numerical simulations considering the influence of the mineral arrangement on the effective diffusion coefficient of water. To represent the hindrance of the impermeable apatite crystals on the water diffusion process, the effective diffusion coefficient was scaled with the tortuosity, the constrictivity and the porosity factors of the structure. The diffusion phenomenon was investigated in the three main directions of the single trabecula and the introduction of apatite preferential orientation allowed the creation of an anisotropic medium. Thus, different diffusivities values were observed along the axes of the single trabecula. We found good agreement with previous experimental results computed by means of a genetic algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2774333413,"Flowering is crucial for reproductive success in flowering plant. The CCT domain-containing genes widely participate in the regulation of flowering process in various plant species. So far, the CCT family in common wheat is largely unknown. Here, we characterized the structure, organization, molecular evolution and expression of the CCT genes in Aegilops tauschii, which is the D genome donor of hexaploid wheat. Twenty-six CCT genes (AetCCT) were identified from the full genome of A. tauschii and these genes were distributed on all 7 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis classified these AetCCT genes into 10 subgroups. Thirteen AetCCT members in group A, C, H and G achieved rapid evolution based on evolutionary rate analysis. The AetCCT genes respond to different exogenous hormones and abiotic treatments, the expression of AetCCT4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 21 and 22 showed a significant 24 h rhythm. This study may provide a reference for common wheat's evolution, domestication and evolvement rules, and also help us to understand the ecological adaptability of A. tauschii."
https://openalex.org/W2771642245,"Bone mineral accrual during puberty is important, especially in girls, because it is related to reduced risks of osteoporosis in adulthood. Previous research has shown that jumping or plyometric exercises may be effective in increasing bone mineral density in adolescents. Rope skipping is a form of activity that involves jumping, thus regular skipping may also increase bone mineral density in pubertal girls. To this end, we conducted a quasi-experimental to examine the effects of rope skipping on girls' bone mineral density and cardiovascular fitness. 176 Hong Kong girls (age = 12.23 ± 1.80 years at baseline) were recruited to take part in the study. Bone density at their forearms and calcanei were measured twice over two academic years (mean time between visits was 10.3 months). Using multilevel modeling analyses and adjusting for participants' height and physical activity, we found that girls who participated in weekly rope skipping activities, compared to those who did not, had higher levels of bone density at the calcanei (B = 0.023, p < .01). However, no differences were found for bone density at forearms or participants' cardiovascular fitness. The rates of change of these variables across time were also not significantly different. Results suggest that regular rope skipping may increase girls' bone density at the lower extremities, irrespective of the amount of self-report physical activity. However, further research is required to examine the potential dose-response relation between skipping behaviors and the measured outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2771807081,"The molecular mechanisms of strain-specific probiotic effects and the impact of the oral administration of probiotic strains on the host’s gene expression are not yet well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the strain-specific effects of probiotic strain intake on gene expression in the murine small intestine. Two distinct strains of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (GG) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C59 (C59), were orally administered to BALB/c mice, daily for 2 weeks. The total RNA was isolated from the upper (including the duodenum) and lower (the terminal ileum) small intestine, and gene expression was assessed by microarray analysis. The data revealed (1) oral administration of C59 and GG markedly down-regulated the expression of genes encoding fibrinogen subunits and plasminogen in the upper small intestine; (2) administration of more than 1 × 107 CFU/day of GG changed the gene expression of the host ileum. (3) strain- and dose-related effects on various GO biological processes; and (4) enrichment for B cell-related Gene Ontology terms among up-regulated genes in the terminal ileum of mice administered the 1 × 109 CFU/day of GG. The distinct effects of GG and C59 on gene expression in the intact small intestine provide clues to understand how the health beneficial effects of specific strains of probiotic bacteria are mediated by interactions with intestinal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2772049787,"The leaf shape is an important taxonomic character. Compared to the classic morphological leaf features such as veins, margin indentations, sinuses, etc., the shape is simpler to obtain by using the 'magic wand' or other contouring tools that are available in most of imaging applications. The only exception is when leaves develop large lobes that get in touch or overlap each other, as the presence of hidden or closed portions of the leaf border precludes the application of automatic methods and forces the leaf contour to be traced manually. This is a time consuming and relatively accurate operation that, nevertheless, can not be avoided, as overlapping lobes are characteristic features of the leaves of several plant species and varieties. The method described in the paper overcomes this problem as it allows the leaf contour to be achieved even in the presence of touching or overlapping lobes. The method involves three steps: (1) the acquisition of leaf images using a transilluminator, (2) a two-level image segmentation that allows all leaf components (blade, overlapping lobes and closed sinuses) to be represented in a single binary image, and (3) the contouring and concatenation of all binary outlines in a single, self-intersecting closed contour that reproduces accurately the leaf shape. The method can be extended to acquire the shape of leaves of herbarium specimens, that are often overlapped but can not be easily handled and repositioned because of their extreme fragility and relevant taxonomic value."
https://openalex.org/W2774583282,"Serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors and dopamine D2 receptors are intimately related to the physiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. A large number of studies have reported the effectiveness of psychotropic agents targeting 5-HT2A and D2 receptors in these disorders. In addition to the individual functions of these receptors, the interaction between the two neurotransmitter systems has been studied in the living brain. However, little is known about their regional relationship in individual human brains. We investigated regional relationships between 5-HT2A and D2 receptors using positron emission tomography (PET) and a bicluster analysis of the correlation matrix of individual variation in the two receptor densities to identify groups of distinctive regional correlations between the two receptors. Methods Seven healthy volunteers underwent PET scans with [18F]altanserin and [11C]FLB 457 for 5-HT2A and D2 receptors, respectively. As a measure of receptor density, a binding potential (BP) was calculated from PET data for 76 cerebral cortical regions. A correlation matrix was calculated between the binding potentials of [18F]altanserin and [11C]FLB 457 for those regions. The regional relationships were investigated using a bicluster analysis of the correlation matrix with an iterative signature algorithm. Results We identified two clusters of regions. The first cluster identified a distinct profile of correlation coefficients between 5-HT2A and D2 receptors, with the former in regions related to sensorimotor integration (supplementary motor area, superior parietal gyrus, and paracentral lobule) and the latter in most cortical regions. The second cluster identified another distinct profile of correlation coefficients between 5-HT2A receptors in the bilateral hippocampi and D2 receptors in most cortical regions. Conclusions The observation of two distinct clusters in the correlation matrix suggests regional interactions between 5-HT2A and D2 receptors in sensorimotor integration and hippocampal function. A bicluster analysis of the correlation matrix of these neuroreceptors may be beneficial in understanding molecular networks in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2774756965,"The availability of a wide range of reporter proteins, which can easily be quantitated, has had a major impact on many fields of biomedical research. In some experiments with tissue culture cells, it is necessary to control for differences in transfection efficiency and in other expression parameters. This requirement has been very conveniently met with the popular dual luciferase assay. Its disadvantages are the requirement for cell lysis, the inability to analyze the same cells repeatedly, and the cost, at least in its most commonly used commercial format. Here we describe a novel dual reporter assay with the naturally secreted luciferase from Gaussia princeps as the main reporter protein and a secreted version of the red fluorescent protein mCherry as internal standard. After first measuring mCherry fluorescence in the medium, an enzyme buffer with coelenterazine as substrate is added to the same sample to trigger a glow-type luminescence of the luciferase. The simple and cheap assay can easily be adapted to a variety of experimental situations. As a case in point, we have developed a panel of Gaussia luciferase reporter genes for transcriptional activation assays with estrogen and glucocorticoid response elements, and with response elements for fusion proteins with the Gal4 DNA binding domain for use in mammalian cells. Our secreted dual reporter assay should be an attractive alternative to the currently available commercial kits."
https://openalex.org/W2775683821,"Prion diseases have been linked to impaired copper homeostasis and copper induced-oxidative damage to the brain. Divalent metal ions, such as Cu2+ and Zn2+, bind to cellular prion protein (PrPC) at octapeptide repeat (OR) and non-OR sites within the N-terminal half of the protein but information on the impact of such binding on conversion to the misfolded isoform often derives from studies using either OR and non-OR peptides or bacterially-expressed recombinant PrP. Here we created new transgenic mouse lines expressing PrP with disrupted copper binding sites within all four histidine-containing OR's (sites 1-4, H60G, H68G, H76G, H84G, ""TetraH>G"" allele) or at site 5 (composed of residues His-95 and His-110; ""H95G"" allele) and monitored the formation of misfolded PrP in vivo. Novel transgenic mice expressing PrP(TetraH>G) at levels comparable to wild-type (wt) controls were susceptible to mouse-adapted scrapie strain RML but showed significantly prolonged incubation times. In contrast, amino acid replacement at residue 95 accelerated disease progression in corresponding PrP(H95G) mice. Neuropathological lesions in terminally ill transgenic mice were similar to scrapie-infected wt controls, but less severe. The pattern of PrPSc deposition, however, was not synaptic as seen in wt animals, but instead dense globular plaque-like accumulations of PrPSc in TgPrP(TetraH>G) mice and diffuse PrPSc deposition in (TgPrP(H95G) mice), were observed throughout all brain sections. We conclude that OR and site 5 histidine substitutions have divergent phenotypic impacts and that cis interactions between the OR region and the site 5 region modulate pathogenic outcomes by affecting the PrP globular domain."
https://openalex.org/W2771696627,"Many groups developed the methods to quantitatively analyze low attenuation area (LAA) on chest CT in patients with cystic lung diseases. Especially in COPD, it was reported that the cumulative size distribution of LAA clusters follows a power law characterized by the exponent D, which reflect the fractal dimension of terminal airspace geometry. We hypoyhesized that the quantitative charateristics of LAA clusters including fractal property might indicate the different features of the progression of cysts in cystic lung diseases. The aim of this study was to apply the CT image-based method of characterizing the size distribution of LAA clusters for lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) to disclose their features of the progression of pulmonary cysts. 40 patients with COPD, 52 patients with LAM, and 18 patients with BHDS who had undergone CT scans at our institute between January 2002 and August 2009 were included. Differences among these diseases in the quantitative characteristics of LAA clusters {i.e., extent, number, size, fractal property, and the relationship between these quantitatives} were assessed. The Chi-sqsuare test, unpaired t-test, and one-way analyses of variance with Tukey post-hoc tests were used to compare groups, spline model with an interaction terms were used to assess the relationship between extent and number, and exponential regression model was used to assess the relationship between extent and size. Statistically significant differences separated the three diseases in extent and number (P < 0.001). Number was significantly correlated with extent in COPD (P < 0.001), but was not so in LAM and BHDS when extent exceeded 11.5% and 20.8%, respectively. Size was significantly correlated with extent in COPD and LAM (P < 0.001), but was not so in BHDS. The percentage of CT images with fractal property was higher in COPD than that in LAM and BHDS (95.8%, 92.9% and 63.0%, respectively). In conclusion, our study has demonstrated for the first time the different characteristics of the size distribution of LAA clusters among COPD, LAM and BHDS, and indicated that this method is useful for exploration of the pathophysiology in cystic lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2771751729,"Detached leaves at top canopy structures always experience higher solar irradiance and leaf temperature under natural conditions. The ability of tolerance to high temperature represents thermotolerance potential of whole-plants, but was less of concern. In this study, we used a heat-tolerant (B76) and a heat-susceptible (B106) maize inbred line to assess the possible mitigation of sudden heat shock (SHS) effects on photosynthesis (PN) and C4 assimilation pathway by elevated [CO2]. Two maize lines were grown in field-based open top chambers (OTCs) at ambient and elevated (+180 ppm) [CO2]. Top-expanded leaves for 30 days after emergence were suddenly exposed to a 45°C SHS for 2 hours in midday during measurements. Analysis on thermostability of cellular membrane showed there was 20% greater electrolyte leakage in response to the SHS in B106 compared to B76, in agreement with prior studies. Elevated [CO2] protected PN from SHS in B76 but not B106. The responses of PN to SHS among the two lines and grown CO2 treatments were closely correlated with measured decreases of NADP-ME enzyme activity and also to its reduced transcript abundance. The SHS treatments induced starch depletion, the accumulation of hexoses and also disrupted the TCA cycle as well as the C4 assimilation pathway in the both lines. Elevated [CO2] reversed SHS effects on citrate and related TCA cycle metabolites in B106 but the effects of elevated [CO2] were small in B76. These findings suggested that heat stress tolerance is a complex trait, and it is difficult to identify biochemical, physiological or molecular markers that accurately and consistently predict heat stress tolerance."

Nonetheless, a lack of clarity persists regarding the most appropriate indicators to monitor rights concerns in these efforts. The objective of this work was to develop a systematic methodology for use in determining the extent to which indicators commonly used in public health capture human rights concerns, using contraceptive services and programmes as a case study.The approach used to identify, evaluate, select and review indicators for their human rights sensitivity built on processes undertaken in previous work led by the World Health Organization (WHO). With advice from an expert advisory group, an analytic framework was developed to identify and evaluate quantitative, qualitative, and policy indicators in relation to contraception for their sensitivity to human rights. To test the framework's validity, indicators were reviewed to determine their feasibility to provide human rights analysis with attention to specific rights principles and standards.This exercise resulted in the identification of indicators that could be used to monitor human rights concerns as well as key gaps where additional indicators are required. While indicators generally used to monitor contraception programmes have some degree of sensitivity to human rights, breadth and depth are lacking.The proposed methodology can be useful to practitioners, researchers, and policy makers working in any area of health who are interested in monitoring and evaluating attention to human rights in commonly used health indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2772942535,"Background Stigma and discrimination ontinue to undermine the effectiveness of the HIV response. Despite a growing body of evidence of the negative relationship between stigma and HIV outcomes, there is a paucity of data available on the prevalence of stigma and its impact. We present a probabilistic cascade model to estimate the magnitude of impact stigma has on mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT). Methods The model was parameterized using 2010 data from Johannesburg, South Africa, from which loss-to-care at each stage of the antenatal cascade were available. Three scenarios were compared to assess the individual contributions of stigma, non-stigma related barriers, and drug ineffectiveness on the overall number of infant infections. Uncertainty analysis was used to estimate plausible ranges. The model follows the guidelines in place in 2010 when the data were extracted (WHO Option A), and compares this with model results had Option B+ been implemented at the time. Results The model estimated under Option A, 35% of infant infections being attributed to stigma. This compares to 51% of total infections had Option B+ been implemented in 2010. Under Option B+, the model estimated fewer infections than Option A, due to the availability of more effective drugs. Only 8% (Option A) and 9% (Option B+) of infant infections were attributed to drug ineffectiveness, with the trade-off in the proportion of infections being between stigma and non-stigma-related barriers. Conclusions The model demonstrates that while the effect of stigma on retention of women at any given stage along the cascade can be relatively small, the cumulative effect can be large. Reducing stigma may be critical in reaching MTCT elimination targets, because as countries improve supply-side factors, the relative impact of stigma becomes greater. The cumulative nature of the PMTCT cascade results in stigma having a large effect, this feature may be harnessed for efficiency in investment by prioritizing interventions that can affect multiple stages of the cascade simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W2774094238,"DNA mimicry is a direct and effective strategy by which the mimic competes with DNA for the DNA binding sites on other proteins. Until now, only about a dozen proteins have been shown to function via this strategy, including the DNA mimic protein DMP19 from Neisseria meningitides. We have shown previously that DMP19 dimer prevents the operator DNA from binding to the transcription factor NHTF. Here, we provide new evidence that DMP19 monomer can also interact with the Neisseria nucleoid-associated protein HU. Using BS3 crosslinking, gel filtration and isothermal titration calorimetry assays, we found that DMP19 uses its monomeric form to interact with the Neisseria HU dimer. Crosslinking conjugated mass spectrometry was used to investigate the binding mode of DMP19 monomer and HU dimer. Finally, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed that the DNA binding affinity of HU is affected by DMP19. These results showed that DMP19 is bifunctional in the gene regulation of Neisseria through its variable oligomeric forms."

Recovery of near full-length HIV-1 genomes from a plasma source coupled with advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and development of universal methods for amplifying whole genomes of HIV-1 circulating in a target geography or population provides the opportunity for a detailed analysis of HIV-1 strain identification, evolution and dynamics. Here we describe the development and implementation of approaches for HIV-1 NGS analysis in a southern Indian cohort. Plasma samples (n = 20) were obtained from HIV-1-confirmed individuals living in and around the city of Bengaluru. Near full-length genome recovery was obtained for 9 Indian HIV-1 patients, with recovery of full-length gag and env genes for 10 and 2 additional subjects, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses indicate the majority of sequences to be represented by subtype C viruses branching within a monophyletic clade, comprising viruses from India, Nepal, Myanmar and China and closely related to a southern African cluster, with a low prevalence of the A1C recombinant form also present. Development of algorithms for bespoke recovery and analysis at a local level will further aid clinical management of HIV-1 infected Indian subjects and delineate the progress of the HIV-1 pandemic in this and other geographical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2775392411,"Background Characteristics of high and low prescribers of antibiotics in German primary care were analysed using population data. We aimed to evaluate differences in prescribing rates and factors being associated with high prescribing, and whether high prescribers made the diagnosis of perceived bacterial infections more often. Methods Routine data were provided by the Bavarian Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians. Routine data are delivered by primary care practices on a quarterly basis. We analysed data from 2011 and 2012. Patients older than 15 years with respiratory tract infections consulting a primary care physician were selected (6.647 primary care practices). Patient and physician characteristics associated with high prescribing were identified using stepwise logistic regression. Results Mean prescribing rate of antibiotics was 24.9%. Prescribing rate for high prescribers was 43.5% compared to 8.5% for low prescribers. High prescribers made the diagnosis of perceived bacterial infections more often (Mhigh = 64.5%, Mlow = 45.2%). In the adjusted regression model, perceived bacterial infections were strongly associated with high prescribing (OR = 13.9, 95% CI [10.2, 18.8]). Treating patients with comorbidities was associated with lower prescribing of antibiotics (OR = 0.6, 95% CI [0.4, 0.8]). High prescribers had a higher practice volume, a higher degree of prescribing dominance, and were situated more often in deprived areas and in rural settings. Interpretation Compared to findings of studies in other European countries, prescribing rates were low. There was a considerable difference between prescribing rates of high and low prescribers. Diagnostic labelling was the best predictor for high prescribing. Current guidelines recommend considering antibiotic treatment for patients with co-morbidities. In our study, treating a large number of high-risk patients was not associated with high prescribing."
https://openalex.org/W2771992242,"Human involvement influences traditional service quality evaluations, which triggers an evaluation's low accuracy, poor reliability and less impressive predictability. This paper proposes a method by employing a support vector machine (SVM) and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to evaluate the service quality of a production process by handling a high number of input features with a low sampling data set, which is called SVMs-DS. Features that can affect production quality are extracted by a large number of sensors. Preprocessing steps such as feature simplification and normalization are reduced. Based on three individual SVM models, the basic probability assignments (BPAs) are constructed, which can help the evaluation in a qualitative and quantitative way. The process service quality evaluation results are validated by the Dempster rules; the decision threshold to resolve conflicting results is generated from three SVM models. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVMs-DS method."
https://openalex.org/W2772614658,"Free radicals and an oxidant/antioxidant imbalance have been involved in the schizophrenia pathophysiology. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) is a measure of the antioxidant capacity of a system. Day/night changes are a biological characteristic of hormones such as melatonin or cortisol. There is little information about TAC day/night changes in schizophrenia patients. The aim of this research is to study if there are day/night changes in serum TAC levels of schizophrenia patients. Thirty-two DSM-IV schizophrenia paranoid patients were studied. Blood was sampled at 12:00 and 00:00 h at admission, discharge and three months after hospital discharge (TMAHD). TAC results are expressed as mmol of Trolox/L. Patients did not have day/night TAC differences at admission (12:00: 0.67±0.12 vs. 00:00: 0.61±0.14, p>0.14) or discharge (12:00: 0.65±0.15 vs. 00:00: 0.65±0.12, p>0.99). At TMHD, patients had significantly higher TAC levels at midday than midnight (12:00: 0.83±0.10 vs. 00:00: 0.74±0.12, p<0.006) as it has been reported in healthy subjects. There were no significant TAC differences at 12.00 and 00:00 between admission and discharge. At TMAHD, patients had significantly higher TAC levels than at admission and discharge, both at 12:00 and 00:00 h. In conclusion, the absence of day/night serum TAC changes when clinically relapsed and the normalization of day/night serum TAC changes at TMHD can be considered as a biological marker of schizophrenia evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2773768628,"Honest signaling is generally taken to be a necessary pre-condition for a stable signaling system, because deceptive signaling at a high enough rate should cause receivers to ignore the signal, which in turn undermines the utility of sending signals. Deception is normally thought to occur because of benefits it has to the deceiver. This raises the question of why signaling systems should exist and persist over time, especially in cases in which the interests of the senders and receivers are not well aligned. Punishment has been seen as a way of imposing costs on deceptive signalers. We investigate the effects of opportunistic-that is, non-altruistic punishment-on the evolution of an honest signaling system. Our model is based on research done on social insects. We model a society of agents, divided into three castes differing in aggressiveness. Under severe punishment deception is indeed asymptotically eliminated. Under somewhat less severe punishment, deception persists and the rates of deception correlate with social structure. We find that social structure robustly mediates the level of deception under regimes of punishment and that this is evident except in the most stringent of punishment regimes."

This study involved two experiments-in part I, the authors examined the effect of CSGB by ethanol injection on long-term blood flow to the orofacial region; part II involved evaluation of the effect of CSGB by ethanol injection on inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) repair using polyglycolic acid-collagen tubes. In part I, seven Beagles were administered left CSGB by injection of 99.5% ethanol under direct visualization by means of thoracotomy, and changes in oral mucosal blood flow in the mental region and nasal skin temperature were evaluated. The increase in blood flow on the left side lasted for 7 weeks, while the increase in average skin temperature lasted 10 weeks on the left side and 3 weeks on the right. In part II, fourteen Beagles were each implanted with a polyglycolic acid-collagen tube across a 10-mm gap in the left IAN. A week after surgery, seven of these dogs were administered CSGB by injection of ethanol. Electrophysiological findings at 3 months after surgery revealed significantly higher sensory nerve conduction velocity and recovery index (ratio of left and right IAN peak amplitudes) after nerve regeneration in the reconstruction+CSGB group than in the reconstruction-only group. Myelinated axons in the reconstruction+CSGB group were greater in diameter than those in the reconstruction-only group. Administration of CSGB with ethanol resulted in improved nerve regeneration in some IAN defects. However, CSGB has several physiological effects, one of which could possibly be the long-term increase in adjacent blood flow."
https://openalex.org/W2774771223,"In this work we show how global self-organized patterns can come out of a disordered ensemble of point oscillators, as a result of a deterministic, and not of a random, cooperative process. The resulting system dynamics has many characteristics of classical thermodynamics. To this end, a modified Kuramoto model is introduced, by including Euclidean degrees of freedom and particle polarity. The standard deviation of the frequency distribution is the disorder parameter, diversity, acting as temperature, which is both a source of motion and of disorder. For zero and low diversity, robust static phase-synchronized patterns (crystals) appear, and the problem reverts to a generic dissipative many-body problem. From small to moderate diversity crystals display vibrations followed by structure disintegration in a competition of smaller dynamic patterns, internally synchronized, each of which is capable to manage its internal diversity. In this process a huge variety of self-organized dynamic shapes is formed. Such patterns can be seen again as (more complex) oscillators, where the same description can be applied in turn, renormalizing the problem to a bigger scale, opening the possibility of pattern evolution. The interaction functions are kept local because our idea is to build a system able to produce global patterns when its constituents only interact at the bond scale. By further increasing the oscillator diversity, the dynamics becomes erratic, dynamic patterns show short lifetime, and finally disappear for high diversity. Results are neither qualitatively dependent on the specific choice of the interaction functions nor on the shape of the probability function assumed for the frequencies. The system shows a phase transition and a critical behaviour for a specific value of diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2772771422,"Organisms generate a variety of noise types, including neural noise, sensory noise, and noise resulting from fluctuations associated with movement. Sensory and neural noises are known to induce stochastic resonance (SR), which improves information transfer to the subjects control systems, including the brain. As a consequence, sensory and neural noise provide behavioral benefits, such as stabilization of posture and enhancement of feeding efficiency. In contrast, the benefits of fluctuations in the movements of a biological system remain largely unclear. Here, we describe a novel type of noise-induced order (NIO) that is realized by actively exploiting the motion fluctuations of an embodied system. In particular, we describe the theoretical analysis of a feedback-controlled embodied agent system that has a geometric end-effector. Furthermore, through several numerical simulations we demonstrate that the ratio of successful reaches to goal positions and capture of moving targets are improved by the exploitation of motion fluctuations. We report that reaching success rate improvement (RSRI) is based on the interaction of the geometric size of an end-effector, the agents motion fluctuations, and the desired motion frequency. Therefore, RSRI is a geometrically induced SR-like phenomenon. We also report an interesting result obtained through numerical simulations indicating that the agents neural and motion noise must be optimized to match the prey's motion noise in order to maximize the capture rate. Our study provides a new understanding of body motion fluctuations, as they were found to be the active noise sources for a behavioral NIO."
https://openalex.org/W2774757255,"Male circumcision (MC) for sexually active, HIV-negative men reduces HIV transmission and averts HIV infections. Excluding HIV-positive men from MC decreases access to additional health and hygiene benefits. In settings where HIV-testing is, or is perceived to be, required for MC, testing may reduce MC uptake. Reducing promotion of HIV testing within MC settings and promoting device-based MC may speed MC scale-up. To assess safety and efficacy of PrePex MC device among HIV-positive men, we conducted a one-arm, open-label, prospective study in otherwise healthy HIV-positive men in Zimbabwe. Methods We aimed to determine if the adverse event (AE) rate was non-inferior to an AE rate of 2%, a rate considered the global standard of MC safety. Study procedures, AE definitions, and study staff were unchanged from previous PrePex Zimbabwe trials. After PrePex placement and removal, weekly visits assessed wound healing. Men returned on Day 90. Safety was defined as occurrence of moderate and serious clinical AEs. Efficacy was defined as ability to reach the endpoint of complete circumcision. Results Among 400 healthy, HIV-positive, consenting adults, median age was 40 years (IQR: 34, 46); 79.5% in WHO stage 2; median CD4 was 336.5c/μl (IQR: 232, 459); 337 (85%) on anti-retroviral therapy. Among 385 (96%) observed completely healed, median days to complete healing was 42 (IQR: 35–49). There was no association between time to healing and CD4 (p = 0.66). Four study-related severe AEs and no moderate AEs were reported: severe/moderate AE rate of 1.0% (95% CI: 0.27% to 2.5). This was non-inferior to 2% AEs (p = 0.0003). All AEs were device displacements resulting in surgical MC and, subsequently, complete healing. Conclusion Male circumcision among healthy, HIV-positive men using PrePex is safe and effective. Reducing the barrier of HIV testing while improving counseling for safer sex practices among all MC clients could increase MC uptake and avert more HIV infections."
