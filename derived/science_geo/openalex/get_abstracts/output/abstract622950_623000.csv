https://openalex.org/W2902736776,"Survivors of the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic have been reported to suffer high levels of stigmatization after return to their communities. We sought to characterize the stigma encountered by a cohort of Ebola survivors in Liberia over time.Ebola-related stigma was assessed from June 2015 to August 2017 in 299 adolescent and adult Liberian Ebola Survivor Cohort participants at three month intervals using adapted HIV stigma scales scored from 0 to 10 according to the proportion of answers indicating stigmatization.The median time from Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) to study entry was 393 days (IQR 336-492). Participants (43% female) had a median age of 31 (IQR 25-40) years. Mean self-reported stigma levels were greater at baseline (6.28 ± 0.15 [IQR: 4.38-8.75]) compared to the first post-baseline visit (0.60 ± 0.10 [IQR: 0-0]; p<0.0001). During follow-up, stigma levels were stable. Baseline stigma significantly increased during enrollment and following clusters of Ebola re-emergence in Liberia. Survivors encountered primarily enacted and perceived external stigma rather than internalized stigma.Ebola-related stigma was prevalent among Liberian survivors more than a year after EVD recovery. Self-reported stigma was greater in the period before cohort enrollment; however, some degree of stigmatization persisted years after EVD. Transient rises in stigma were observed following episodic Ebola re-emergence of EVD in Liberia. During future EVD outbreaks, enhanced public health interventions designed to prevent and mitigate Ebola-related stigma that is enacted and external should be implemented to support survivor recovery and community re-integration."
https://openalex.org/W2902480702,"People with knowledge of the benefits of physical activity tend to be more active; however, such knowledge is typically operationalized as a basic understanding that physical activity is ‘good’ for health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether there are differences in how detailed a person’s knowledge is about the benefits of physical activity. Participants (N = 615) completed an online survey to measure their current physical activity behaviour, as well as their level of knowledge of the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity. The majority of participants (99.6%) strongly agreed that physical activity is good for health, however on average, participants only identified 13.8 out of 22 diseases associated with physical inactivity and over half of participants (55.6%) could not identify how much physical activity is recommended for health benefits. Furthermore, 45% of the participants overestimated, 9% underestimated and 27% did not know the increased risk of disease resulting from inactivity as indicated by the Australian Department of Health. Participants were significantly more active when they correctly identified more diseases associated with physical inactivity and when they overestimated the risks associated with inactivity. Therefore, health promotion initiatives should increase knowledge of the types of diseases associated with inactivity. Low knowledge of physical activity guidelines suggest they should be promoted more, as this knowledge provides guidance on frequency, types and duration of physical activity needed for health."
https://openalex.org/W2903054306,"ROR family of nuclear receptor transcription factors forms nodes connecting metabolic and inflammatory signaling pathways. The RORα members of the family have intrinsic transcriptional activity and they are involved in both activation and repression of a wide range of genes. The role of RORα in control of inflammation has been extensively studied using animal models but its function in human cells is not as well understood. To address this shortcoming, we analyzed how RORα is shaping the inflammatory state of human macrophages. Using CRISPR-Cas9 system, we deleted RORA in THP-1 human monocytic cell line. In mutant cells we observed a dramatic increase in basal expression of a subset of NF-κB regulated genes, including TNF, IL-1β and IL-6, at both transcriptional and translational levels. Furthermore, RORA-deletion cells produced notable amounts of pro-IL-1β even in the absence of LPS stimulation. Subsequent LPS stimulation induced cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature form. Our RNAseq analysis further confirmed the key role of RORA in setting the inflammatory state of macrophages and defined the set of differentially regulated genes. Overall, our data provides evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory function of RORα in human macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2901987561,"Zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio) are among the most used model species to test biological effects of different substances in biomedical research, neuroscience and ecotoxicology. Most tests are based on changes in swimming activity of zebrafish larvae by using commercially available high-throughput screening systems. These systems record and analyse behaviour patterns using visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) light sources, to simulate day (VIS) and night (NIR) phases, which allow continuous recording of the behaviour using a NIR sensitive camera. So far, however, the sensitivity of zebrafish larvae to NIR has never been tested experimentally, although being a critical piece of information for interpreting their behaviour under experimental conditions. Here, we investigated the swimming activity of 96 hpf (hours post fertilization) and 120 hpf zebrafish larvae under light sources of NIR at 860 nm and at 960 nm wavelength and under VIS light. A thermal source was simultaneously presented opposite to one of the light sources as control. We found that zebrafish larvae of both larval stages showed a clear negative phototactic response towards 860 nm NIR light and to VIS light, but not to 960 nm NIR light. Our results demonstrated that zebrafish larvae are able to perceive NIR at 860 nm, which is almost identical to the most commonly used light source in commercial screening systems (NIR at 850 nm) to create a dark environment. These tests, however, are not performed in the dark from the zebrafish´s point of view. We recommend testing sensitivity of the used test organism before assuming no interaction with the applied light source of commonly used biosensor test systems. Previous studies on biological effects of substances to zebrafish larvae should be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2902770855,"The primate foveola, with its high cone density and magnified cortical representation, is exquisitely specialized for high-resolution spatial vision. However, uncovering the wiring of retinal circuitry responsible for this performance has been challenging due to the difficulty in recording receptive fields of foveal retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vivo. In this study, we use adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to image the calcium responses of RGCs in the living primate, with a stable, high precision visual stimulus that allowed us to localize the receptive fields of hundreds of foveal ganglion cells. This approach revealed a precisely radial organization of foveal RGCs, despite the many distortions possible during the extended developmental migration of foveal cells. By back projecting the line connecting RGC somas to their receptive fields, we have been able to define the ‘physiological center’ of the foveola, locating the vertical meridian separating left and right hemifields in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2902644496,"Gorgonopsia is one of the major clades of non-mammalian synapsids, and includes an array of large-bodied carnivores that were the top terrestrial predators of the late Permian. Most research on the clade has focused on these largest members; small-bodied gorgonopsians are relatively little-studied. Here, we redescribe a small gorgonopsian skull (MB.R.999) from the late Permian (Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone) of South Africa on the basis of neutron and synchrotron CT reconstructions, which yield new data on internal cranial morphology in Gorgonopsia. Because of the largely undistorted nature of MB.R.999, we were also able to reconstruct unossified areas such as the brain endocast and the otic labyrinth. MB.R.999 can be referred to the taxon Cynariops robustus based on its general skull proportions, postcanine tooth count, preparietal morphology, and vomerine morphology. We refer additional small gorgonopsian specimens from the Victoria West area to Cynariops robustus, and consider Cynarioides grimbeeki and Cynarioides laticeps to be synonymous with C. robustus. Inclusion of Cynariops in a phylogenetic analysis of Gorgonopsia recovers it within a large clade of African taxa, more closely related to Lycaenops and rubidgeines than Eriphostoma or Gorgonops."
https://openalex.org/W2902929087,"With main purpose of developing a coherent baseline information of timberline forests of Sikkim, Eastern Himalaya, we investigated, (i) forest structure and composition, (ii) regeneration status of dominant timberline tree species between timberline and treeline, (iii) influence of environmental variables in species composition, and (iv) relationship between environmental variables and ecological attributes. The study was conducted along the timberline stretch of Dzongri landscape nested within the Khangchendzonga National Park (UNESCO’s World Heritage Site, 2016), a core zone of Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve (in UNESCO WNBRs, 2018), Sikkim, India. We employed quadrat method to sample 9 contiguous sites to capture all possible variations in timberline composition. Transect method was used to study the regeneration of woody taxa between timberline to treeline. In total, 20 woody species belonging to 10 genera and 6 families were recorded. Among these, Abies densa, Rhododendron lanatum and Sorbus microphylla exhibited higher dominance, comprising of 50% of the total importance value index (IVI) weightage. Betula utilis the common treeline species in much of the western and central parts of Himalaya was absent here. Tree density in studied timberline was significantly higher than its western Himalayan counterparts of Indian Himalayan region. Environmental variables viz., elevation, slope, and humus were observed determinants of species composition across the study area. The species dominance correlated negatively (p<0.01; n = 9) with species diversity and richness. We observed an irregular spatial pattern of timberline across the 9 study sites, and the extent of timberline elements (seedling; sapling; live tree or dead tree) ranged between 5.3m to 187.7m higher than the current timberline at different sites. The present trends suggest that upslope advancement is unlikely to occur in near future, while treeline densification is anticipated. Further investigations are suggested to develop a holistic understating of these timberline patterns across the Indian Himalayan region."
https://openalex.org/W2903560294,"Pathological features of pulmonary fibrosis include accumulation of myofibroblasts and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in lung tissue. Contractile α–smooth muscle actin (α–SMA)–expressing myofibroblasts that produce and secrete ECM are key effector cells of the disease and therefore represent a viable target for potential novel anti–fibrotic treatments. We used primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) in two novel high–throughput screening assays to discover molecules that inhibit or revert fibroblast–to–myofibroblast differentiation. A phenotypic high–content assay (HCA) quantified the degree of myofibroblast differentiation, whereas an impedance–based assay, multiplexed with MS / MS quantification of α–SMA and collagen 1 alpha 1 (COL1) protein, provided a measure of contractility and ECM formation. The synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) alprostadil, which very effectively and potently attenuated and even reversed TGF–β1–induced myofibroblast differentiation, was identified by screening a library of approved drugs. In TGF–β1–induced myofibroblasts the effect of alprostadil was attributed to activation of prostanoid receptor 2 and 4 (EP2 and EP4, respectively). However, selective activation of the EP2 or the EP4 receptor was already sufficient to prevent or reverse TGF–β1–induced NHLF myofibroblast transition. Our high–throughput assays identified chemical structures with potent anti–fibrotic properties acting through potentially novel mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2902356725,"Background Anthrax is a zoonotic disease primarily of herbivores, caused by Bacillus anthracis, a bacterium with diverse geographical and global distribution. Globally, livestock outbreaks have declined but in Africa significant outbreaks continue to occur with most countries still categorized as enzootic, hyper endemic or sporadic. Uganda experiences sporadic human and livestock cases. Severe large-scale outbreaks occur periodically in hippos (Hippopotamus amphibious) at Queen Elizabeth Protected Area, where in 2004/2005 and 2010 anthrax killed 437 hippos. Ecological drivers of these outbreaks and potential of hippos to maintain anthrax in the ecosystem remain unknown. This study aimed to describe spatio-temporal patterns of anthrax among hippos; examine significant trends associated with case distributions; and generate hypotheses for investigation of ecological drivers of anthrax. Methods Spatio-temporal patterns of 317 hippo cases in 2004/5 and 137 in 2010 were analyzed. QGIS was used to examine case distributions; Spearman’s nonparametric tests to determine correlations between cases and at-risk hippo populations; permutation models of the spatial scan statistics to examine spatio-temporal clustering of cases; directional tests to determine directionality in epidemic movements; and standard epidemic curves to determine patterns of epidemic propagation. Key findings Results showed hippopotamus cases extensively distributed along water shorelines with strong positive correlations (p<0.01) between cases and at-risk populations. Significant (p<0.001) spatio-temporal clustering of cases occurred throughout the epidemics, pointing towards a defined source. Significant directional epidemic spread was detected along water flow gradient (206.6°) in 2004/5 and against flow gradient (20.4°) in 2010. Temporal distributions showed clustered pulsed epidemic waves. Conclusion These findings suggest mixed point-source propagated pattern of epidemic spread amongst hippos and points to likelihood of indirect spread of anthrax spores between hippos mediated by their social behaviour, forces of water flow, and persistent presence of infectious carcasses amidst schools. This information sheds light on the epidemiology of anthrax in highly social wildlife, can help drive insight into disease control, wildlife conservation, and tourism management, but highlights the need for analytical and longitudinal studies aimed at clarifying the hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2903469243,"Knee replacement is a common preference sensitive quality-of-life procedure that can reduce pain and improve function for people with advanced knee arthritis. While most patients improve, knee replacement surgery has the potential for serious complications. Prosthetic knee infection is an uncommon but serious complication. This study explored the impact of cases of prosthetic knee infection on surgeons’ personal and professional wellbeing. Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with consultant orthopaedic surgeons who treated patients for prosthetic knee infection in one of six high-volume NHS orthopaedic departments. Data was audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Eleven surgeons took part. Analysis identified three overarching themes: (i) At some point infection is inevitable but surgeons still feel accountable; (ii) A profound emotional impact and (iii) Supporting each other. The occurrence of prosthetic joint infection has a significant emotional impact on surgeons who report a collective sense of devastation and personal ownership, even though prosthetic joint infection cannot be fully controlled for. Surgeons stressed the importance of openly discussing the management of prosthetic joint infection with a supportive multidisciplinary team and this has implications for the ways in which orthopaedic surgeons may be best supported to manage this complication. This article also acknowledges that surgeons are not alone in experiencing personal impact when patients have infection."
https://openalex.org/W2903478959,"Insects such as locusts and grasshoppers can reduce the effectiveness of pathogens and parasites by adopting different defense strategies. We investigated the behavioral thermopreference of Locusta migratoria manilensis (Meyen) (Orthoptera: Acrididae) induced by the fungus Beauveria bassiana, and the impact this behavior had on the fungal mycosis under laboratory conditions. By basking in higher temperature locations, infected nymphs elevated their thoracic temperature to 30–32.6 °C, which is higher than the optimum temperature (25°C) for B. bassiana conidial germination and hyphal development. A minimum thermoregulation period of 3 h/day increased survival of infected locusts by 43.34%. The therapeutic effect decreased when thermoregulation was delayed after initial infection. The fungus grew and overcame the locusts as soon as the thermoregulation was interrupted, indicating that thermoregulation helped the insects to cope with infection but did not completely rid them of the fungus. A significant enhancement in the number of haemocytes was observed in infected thermoregulating locusts, reaching levels that were even higher than those observed in the controls. In contrast, haemocyte concentration was severely reduced in infected insects that did not thermoregulate. In infected non-thermoregulating locusts, the reduction in haemocyte number was accompanied by an increase in fungal blastospore concentration that was obvious in the haemolymph by day four. In contrast, no circulating blastospores were found in the haemolymph of infected thermoregulating locusts three days post-inoculation. We also examined the phagocytic activity of infected insects in vivo by using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled silica beads. The proportion of beads that was engulfed by haemocytes in infected, thermoregulating insects was similar to that in the controls throughout the experiment, whereas the rate of phagocytosis in infected, non-thermoregulating insects progressively decreased after infection. These findings demonstrated that behavioural thermoregulation can adversely affect B. bassiana mycosis in infected L. migratoria manilensis, thereby limiting the development of lethal entomopathogenic fungi in locusts. This is apparently accomplished through an increase in the levels of haemocytes, leading to greater phagocytic activity under certain environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2902192884,"Objective To investigate whether staffing levels of maternity units affect prelabor urgent, elective, and intrapartum cesarean delivery rates. Methods This population-based retrospective cohort study covers the deliveries of the 11 hospitals of a French perinatal network in 2008–2014 (N = 102 236). The independent variables were women’s demographic and medical characteristics as well as the type, organization, and staffing levels for obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and midwives of each maternity unit. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted with multilevel logistic models. Results Overall, 23.9% of the women had cesarean deliveries (2.4% urgent before labor, 10% elective, and 11.5% intrapartum). Independently of individual- and hospital-level factors, the level of obstetricians, measured by the number of full-time equivalent persons (i.e., 35 working hours per week) per 100 deliveries, was negatively associated with intrapartum cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 0.55, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.36–0.83, P-value = 0.005), and the level of midwives negatively associated with elective cesarean delivery (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90, P-value < 0.001). Accordingly, a 10% increase in obstetrician and midwife staff levels, respectively, would have been associated with a decrease in the likelihood of intrapartum cesarean delivery by 2.5 percentage points and that of elective cesarean delivery by 3.4 percentage points. These changes represent decreases in intrapartum and elective cesarean delivery rates of 19% (from 13.1% to 10.6%) and 33% (from 10.3% to 6.9%), respectively. Conclusion Staffing levels of maternity units affect the use of cesarean deliveries. High staffing levels for obstetricians and midwives are associated with lower cesarean rates."
https://openalex.org/W2902327877,"A major component of cognitive control is the ability to act flexibly in the environment by either behaving automatically or inhibiting an automatic behaviour. The interleaved pro/anti-saccade task measures cognitive control because the task relies on one’s abilities to switch flexibly between pro and anti-saccades, and inhibit automatic saccades during anti-saccade trials. Decline in cognitive control occurs during aging or neurological illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), and indicates decline in other cognitive abilities, such as memory. However, little is known about the relationship between cognitive control and other cognitive processes. Here we investigated whether anti-saccade performance can predict decision-making, visual memory, and pop-out and serial visual search performance. We tested 34 younger adults, 22 older adults, and 20 PD patients on four tasks: an interleaved pro/anti-saccade, a spatial visual memory, a decision-making and two types of visual search (pop-out and serial) tasks. Anti-saccade performance was a good predictor of decision-making and visual memory abilities for both older adults and PD patients, while it predicted visual search performance to a larger extent in PD patients. Our results thus demonstrate the suitability of the interleaved pro/anti-saccade task as a cognitive marker of cognitive control in aging and PD populations."
https://openalex.org/W2903407956,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of many cellular processes, including the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts, and therefore, of bone turnover. MiR-320a is overexpressed in osteoporotic bone tissue but its role in osteoblast function is unknown. In the present study, functional assays were performed with the aim to elucidate the mechanism of miR-320a action in osteoblastic cells. MiR-320a was either overexpressed or inhibited in human primary osteoblasts (hOB) and gene expression changes were evaluated through microarray analysis. In addition, the effect of miR-320a on cell proliferation, viability, and oxidative stress in hOB was evaluated. Finally, matrix mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activity were assessed in order to evaluate osteoblast functionality. Microarray results showed miR-320a regulation of a number of key osteoblast genes and of genes involved in oxidative stress. Regulation of osteoblast differentiation and ossification appeared as the best significant biological processes (PANTHER P value = 3.74E-05; and P value = 3.06E-04, respectively). The other enriched pathway was that of the cellular response to cadmium and zinc ions, mostly by the overexpression of metallothioneins. In hOBs, overexpression of miR-320a increased cell proliferation and oxidative stress levels whereas mineralization capacity was reduced. In conclusion, overexpression of miR-320a increased stress oxidation levels and was associated with reduced osteoblast differentiation and functionality, which could trigger an osteoporotic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2902694436,"With the advent of neurogenetic methods, the neural basis of behavior is presently being analyzed in more and more detail. This is particularly true for visually driven behavior of Drosophila melanogaster where cell-specific driver lines exist that, depending on the combination with appropriate effector genes, allow for targeted recording, silencing and optogenetic stimulation of individual cell-types. Together with detailed connectomic data of large parts of the fly optic lobe, this has recently led to much progress in our understanding of the neural circuits underlying local motion detection. However, how such local information is combined by optic flow sensitive large-field neurons is still incompletely understood. Here, we aim to fill this gap by a dense reconstruction of lobula plate tangential cells of the fly lobula plate. These neurons collect input from many hundreds of local motion-sensing T4/T5 neurons and connect them to descending neurons or central brain areas. We confirm all basic features of HS and VS cells as published previously from light microscopy. In addition, we identified the dorsal and the ventral centrifugal horizontal, dCH and vCH cell, as well as three VSlike cells, including their distinct dendritic and axonal projection area."
https://openalex.org/W2903085698,"Fluctuations in mood states are driven by unpredictable outcomes in daily life but also appear to drive consequential behaviors such as risk-taking. However, our understanding of the relationships between unexpected outcomes, mood, and risk-taking behavior has relied primarily upon constrained and artificial laboratory settings. Here we examine, using naturalistic datasets, how real-world unexpected outcomes predict mood state changes observable at the level of a city, in turn predicting changes in gambling behavior. By analyzing day-to-day mood language extracted from 5.2 million location-specific and public Twitter posts or ‘tweets’, we examine how real-world ‘prediction errors’—local outcomes that deviate positively from expectations—predict day-to-day mood states observable at the level of a city. These mood states in turn predicted increased per-person lottery gambling rates, revealing how interplay between prediction errors, moods, and risky decision-making unfolds in the real world. Our results underscore how social media and naturalistic datasets can uniquely allow us to understand consequential psychological phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2902287878,"Over the last decade, the γ–H2AX focus assay, which exploits the phosphorylation of the H2AX histone following DNA double–strand–breaks, has made considerable progress towards acceptance as a reliable biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation. While the existing literature has convincingly demonstrated a dose–response effect, and also presented approaches to dose estimation based on appropriately defined calibration curves, a more widespread practical use is still hampered by a certain lack of discussion and agreement on the specific dose–response modelling and uncertainty quantification strategies, as well as by the unavailability of implementations. This manuscript intends to fill these gaps, by stating explicitly the statistical models and techniques required for calibration curve estimation and subsequent dose estimation. Accompanying this article, a web applet has been produced which implements the discussed methods."
https://openalex.org/W2902363020,"Current biodiversity loss is mostly caused by anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and resource exploitation. Measuring the balance of species loss and gain in remaining fragmented landscapes throughout time entails a central research challenge. We resurveyed in 2013 plant species richness in the same plots of a previous sampling conducted in 2003 across 18 forest fragments of different sizes of the Chaco Serrano forest in Argentina. While the area of these forest remnants was kept constant, their surrounding forest cover changed over this time period. We compared plant species richness of both sampling years and calculated the proportion of species loss and gain at forest edges and interiors. As in 2003, we found a positive relationship between fragment area and plant richness in 2013 and both years showed a similar slope. However, we detected a net decrease of 24% of species' richness across all forest fragments, implying an unprecedentedly high rate and magnitude of species loss driven mainly by non-woody, short-lived species. There was a higher proportion of lost and gained species at forest edges than in forest interiors. Importantly, fragment area interacted with percent change in surrounding forest cover to explain the proportion of species lost. Small forest fragments showed a relatively constant proportion of species loss regardless of any changes in surrounding forest cover, whereas in larger fragments the proportion of species lost increased when surrounding forest cover decreased. We show that despite preserving fragment area, habitat quality and availability in the surroundings is of fundamental importance in shaping extinction and immigration dynamics of plant species at any given forest remnant. Because the Chaco Serrano forest has already lost 94% of its original cover, we argue that plant extinctions will continue through the coming decades unless active management actions are taken to increase native forest areas."
https://openalex.org/W2902755525,"Purpose 
The coupling between neural activity and blood flow is a physiological key principle of ocular blood flow regulation. The current study was performed to investigate whether Laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG), a commercially available technique for measuring blood flow, is capable to assess flicker-induced haemodynamic changes in the retinal and optic nerve head (ONH) circulation.


Methods 
Twenty healthy subjects were included in this cross sectional study. A commercial LSFG instrument was used to measure blood flow at the ONH as well as in retinal vessels before and during stimulation with flickering light. Mean blur rate (MBR), a measure of relative blood flow velocity, was obtained for the ONH and relative flow volume (RFV) a measure of relative blood flow of the respective retinal vessels.


Results 
Stimulation with flicker light increased ONH MBR by +17.5%±6.6% (p<0.01). In retinal arteries, flicker stimulation led an increase of +23.8±10.0% (p<0.05) in total RFV. For retinal veins, an increase of +23.1%±11.0 (p<0.05) in total RFV was observed during stimulation. A higher response was observed in nasal RFV compared to temporal RFV in retinal arteries (nasal: +28.9%±20.0%; temporal: +20.4%±17.6%, p<0.05) and veins (nasal: +28.3%±19.6%; temporal +17.8%±18.9%, p<0.05).


Conclusion 
As shown previously with other techniques, flicker stimulation leads to an increase in retinal and optic nerve head blood flow. Our results indicate that LSFG is an appropriate method for the quantification of retinal and ONH blood flow during visual stimulation and may be used as a non-invasive, easy to use tool to assess neuro-vascular coupling in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2903198296,"The aerodynamic mechanisms of bat flight have been studied using a numerical approach. Kinematic data acquired using a high resolution motion capture system was employed to simulate the unsteady air flow around a bat’s wings. A flapping bat wing contains many degrees of freedom, which make 3D motion tracking challenging. In order to overcome this challenge, an optical motion capture system of 21 cameras was used to reduce wing self-occlusion. Over the course of a meter-long flight, 108 discrete marker points on the bat’s wings (Pratt’s roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pratti) were tracked. The time evolution of the surface of each wing was computationally reconstructed in 3D space. The resulting kinematic model was interfaced with an unsteady incompressible flow solver using the immersed boundary method (IBM) and large eddy simulation (LES). Verification and validation of the flow simulation were conducted to establish accuracy. The aerodynamic forces calculated from the simulation compared well to the forces theoretically needed to sustain the observed flight trajectory. The transient flow field generated by the simulation allowed for the direct calculation of lift, drag, and power output of the bat during flight. The mean lift coefficient was found to be 3.21, and the flap cycle averaged aerodynamic power output was 1.05 W. Throughout the flap cycle, the planform area of the wings varied up to 46% between the largest and smallest values. During the upstroke, wing rotation was found to mitigate negative lift thereby improving overall flight efficiency. The high resolution motion capture and flow simulation framework presented here has the potential to facilitate the understanding of complex bat flight aerodynamics for both straight and maneuvering flight modes."
https://openalex.org/W2903348404,"Recent research has demonstrated that there is considerable inter-individual variation in the response to aerobic training, and that this variation is partially mediated by genetic factors. As such, we aimed to investigate if a genetic based algorithm successfully predicted the magnitude of improvements following eight-weeks of aerobic training in youth soccer players. A genetic test was utilised to examine five single nucleotide polymorphisms (VEGF rs2010963, ADRB2 rs1042713 and rs1042714, CRP rs1205 & PPARGC1A rs8192678), whose occurrence is believed to impact aerobic training adaptations. 42 male soccer players (17.0 ± 1y, 176 ± 6 cm, 69 ± 9 kg) were tested and stratified into three different Total Genotype Score groups; “low”, “medium”and “high”, based on the possession of favourable polymorphisms. Subjects underwent two Yo-Yo tests separated by eight-weeks of sports-specific aerobic training. Overall, there were no significant differences between the genotype groups in pre-training Yo-Yo performance, but evident between-group response differentials emerged in post-training Yo-Yo test performance. Subjects in the “high” group saw much larger improvements (58%) than those in the ‘medium” (35%) and “low” (7%) groups. There were significant (p<0.05) differences between the groups in the magnitude of improvement, with athletes in the “high” and medium group having larger improvements than the “low” group (d = 2.59 “high” vs “low”; d = 1.32 “medium” vs “low”). In conclusion, the magnitude of improvements in aerobic fitness following a training intervention were associated with a genetic algorithm comprised of five single nucleotide polymorphisms. This information could lead to the development of more individualised aerobic training designs, targeting optimal fitness adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W2903376263,"Background Recent researches have suggested that the complex three-dimensional structures caused by structural remodeling play a key role in atrial fibrillation (AF) substrates. Here we aimed to investigate this hypothesis using a multi-layer model representing intramural microstructural features. Methods The proposed multi-layer model was composed of the endocardium, connection wall, and epicardium. In the connection wall, intramural fibrosis was simulated using fibrotic patches randomly scattered in the myocardial tissue of fibrotic layers, while endo-epicardial dissociation was simulated using myocardial patches randomly scattered in the fibrotic tissue of isolation layers. Multiple simulation groups were generated to quantitatively analyze the effects of endo-epicardial dissociation and intramural fibrosis on AF stability, including a stochastic group, interrelated groups, fibrosis-degree-controlled groups, and dissociation-degree-controlled groups. Results 1. Stable intramural re-entries were observed to move along complete re-entrant circuits inside the transmural wall in four of 65 simulations in the stochastic group. 2. About 21 of 23 stable simulations in the stochastic group were distributed in the areas with high endo-epicardial dissociation and intramural fibrosis. 3. The difference between fibrosis-degree-controlled groups and dissociation-degree-controlled groups suggested that some distributions of connection areas may affect AF episodes despite low intramural fibrosis and endo-epicardial dissociation. 4. The overview of tracking phase singularities revealed that endo-epicardial dissociation played a visible role in AF substrates. Conclusion The complex intramural microstructure is positively correlated with critical components of AF maintenance mechanisms. The occurrence of intramural re-entry further indicates the complexity of AF wave-dynamics."

Overall, hydrological change can significantly influence the riparian environment and shift the riparian vegetation. Although numerous studies have investigated the short-term responses of riparian plants to water level fluctuation in this zone, few have addressed long-term effects. In this study, four permanent plots in the WLFZ of the canyon landform area were chosen to evaluate the long-term responses of riparian plants to water level fluctuation from 2008 to 2015 and to screen candidate plants for ecological restoration. We recorded 146 species in 2008, 110 species in 2009, 68 species in 2012 and 69 species in 2015, indicating a conspicuous loss in riparian plants. Most of the remnant plants were annual and perennial herbs. Of the native species present in 2008, 82, 22 and 8 had disappeared in 2009, 2012 and 2015, respectively. Simultaneously, 45, 15 and 11 non-native species were first found, respectively. Additionally, over half of the native and the non-native species were not found after being subjected to a water level fluctuation. From 2008 to 2015, only 27 native species always presented; however, not all of them were chosen as candidates for ecological restoration because of their decreased importance values. In contrast, the importance value of Cynodon dactylon increased over time, suggesting its high tolerance to long-term winter flooding. We concluded that riparian plants' composition of the canyon landform area dramatically declined after long-term water level fluctuation and their presence was determined by the novel hydrological condition. Our results also suggested that Cynodon dactylon or its combination with other species (i.e. Digitaria chrysoblephara, Setaria glauca, Setaria viridis) is a better candidate for ecological restoration in the WLFZ."

In this study, we observed that knockout (KO) of CCN5, which encodes a matricellular protein, caused mild obesity in mice. The CCN5 KO mice also exhibited mild diabetes characterized by high fasting glucose levels and impaired insulin and glucose tolerances. Cardiac hypertrophy, ectopic lipid accumulation, and impaired lipid metabolism in hearts were observed in the CCN5 KO mice, as determined using histology, quantitative RT-PCR, and western blotting. Fibrosis was significantly greater in hearts from the CCN5 KO mice both in interstitial and perivascular regions, which was accompanied by higher expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Both systolic and diastolic functions were significantly impaired in hearts from the CCN5 KO mice, as assessed using echocardiography. Taken together, these results indicate that CCN5 KO leads to lipotoxic cardiomyopathy with mild obesity and diabetes in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2903368739,"Primates have evolved to rapidly detect and respond to danger in their environment. However, the mechanisms involved in attending to threatening stimuli are not fully understood. The dot-probe task is one of the most widely used experimental paradigms to investigate these mechanisms in humans. However, to date, few studies have been conducted in non-human primates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the dot-probe task can measure attentional biases towards threatening faces in chimpanzees. Eight adult chimpanzees participated in a series of touch screen dot-probe tasks. We predicted faster response times towards chimpanzee threatening faces relative to neutral faces and faster response times towards faces of high threat intensity (scream) than low threat intensity (bared teeth). Contrary to prediction, response times for chimpanzee threatening faces relative to neutral faces did not differ. In addition, we found no difference in response times for faces of high and low threat intensity. In conclusion, we found no evidence that the touch screen dot-probe task can measure attentional biases specifically towards threatening faces in our chimpanzees. Methodological limitations of using the task to measure emotional attention in human and non-human primates, including stimulus threat intensity, emotional state, stimulus presentation duration and manual responding are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2903518831,"Feathers act as vibrotactile sensors that can detect mechanical stimuli during avian flight and tactile navigation, suggesting that they may also detect stimuli during social displays. In this study, we present the first measurements of the biomechanical properties of the feather crests found on the heads of birds, with an emphasis on those from the Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus). We show that in peafowl these crest feathers are coupled to filoplumes, small feathers known to function as mechanosensors. We also determined that airborne stimuli with the frequencies used during peafowl courtship and social displays couple efficiently via resonance to the vibrational response of their feather crests. Specifically, vibrational measurements showed that although different types of feathers have a wide range of fundamental resonant frequencies, peafowl crests are driven near-optimally by the shaking frequencies used by peacocks performing train-rattling displays. Peafowl crests were also driven to vibrate near resonance in a playback experiment that mimicked the effect of these mechanical sounds in the acoustic very near-field, reproducing the way peafowl displays are experienced at distances ≤ 1.5m in vivo. When peacock wing-shaking courtship behaviour was simulated in the laboratory, the resulting airflow excited measurable vibrations of crest feathers. These results demonstrate that peafowl crests have mechanical properties that allow them to respond to airborne stimuli at the frequencies typical of this species’ social displays. This suggests a new hypothesis that mechanosensory stimuli could complement acoustic and visual perception and/or proprioception of social displays in peafowl and other bird species. We suggest behavioral studies to explore these ideas and their functional implications."
https://openalex.org/W2902407721,"This present research investigates the money demand function of Saudi Arabia using a long period 1968–2016. In addition, the asymmetrical effects of real exchange rate changes have also been explored in the estimated money demand function. Our empirical results suggest that income and inflation have positive and negative effects on money demand respectively. Further, a real appreciation of US dollar has a positive effect but a real depreciation has a negative effect on the money demand. Furthermore, income and price homogeneity hypotheses do not hold for the estimated elasticities. Moreover, the estimated model is found stable with the theoretically expected effects of money demand’s determinants. Therefore, we are suggesting money supply as a monetary policy instrument to the economy of Saudi Arabia."
https://openalex.org/W2902262532,"Laboulbeniales are highly specific ectoparasitic fungi of arthropods (insects, millipedes, and arachnids). The first Laboulbeniales parasitizing the millipede order Chordeumatida (Diplopoda) were discovered and described as a new dioecious genus of Laboulbeniales, Thaxterimyces, to accommodate the new species T. baliensis. Also the millipede host is a new species and is described as Metopidiothrix sheari. This is the first time Laboulbeniales fungus and its millipede host are described as new together. Males of Metopidiothrix have the most extensive secondary sexual modifications in the entire class Diplopoda. Although nothing is known about the function of these modifications, the unique pattern of Laboulbeniales infection in the new millipede species is obviously related to host sexual behavior. Rotational Scanning Electron Micrographs (rSEM) are used to create a 3D comprehensive model to examine the fungal-host interaction, a more advanced visualization of the ectoparasitic fungus on its host. Laboulbeniales diversity on millipedes is still understudied, and a consistent effort is needed to unveil and understand the extent and diversity of this biological interaction. Due to their minute size and apparently non-detrimental effect on their hosts, Laboulbeniales in general have been largely ignored by mycologists and neglected by generations of entomologists. As a result a significant component of global biodiversity has been strongly underestimated, and a wealth of new discoveries is still to be made both in the field and in existing museum collections."
https://openalex.org/W2903058453,"This paper investigates the relationship between candidates’ online popularity and election results, as a step towards creating a model to forecast the results of Taiwanese elections even in the absence of reliable opinion polls on a district-by-district level. 253 of 354 legislative candidates of single-member districts in Taiwan’s 2016 general election had active public Facebook pages during the election period. Hypothesizing that the relative popularity of candidates’ Facebook posts will be positively related to their election results, I calculated each candidate’s Like Ratio (i.e. proportions of all likes on Facebook posts obtained by candidates in their district). In order to have a measure of online interest without the influence of subjective positivity, I similarly calculated the proportion of daily average page views for each candidate’s Wikipedia page. I ran a regression analysis, incorporating data on results of previous elections and available opinion poll data. I found the models could describe the result of the election well and reject the null hypothesis. My models successfully predicted 80% of winners in single-member districts and were effective in districts without local opinion polls with a predictive power approaching that of traditional opinion polls. The models also showed good accuracy when run on data for the 2014 Taiwanese municipal mayors election."
https://openalex.org/W2903366246,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component and etiology characterized by chronic inflammation and autoantibody production. The purpose of this study was to ascertain copy number variation (CNV) in SLE using a case-control design in an admixed Brazilian population. The whole-genome detection of CNV was performed using Cytoscan HD array in SLE patients and healthy controls. The best CNV candidates were then evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in a larger cohort or validated using droplet digital PCR. Logistic regression models adjusted for sex and ancestry covariates was applied to evaluate the association between CNV with SLE susceptibility. The data showed a synergistic effect between the FCGR3B and ADAM3A loci with the presence of deletions in both loci significantly increasing the risk to SLE (5.9-fold) compared to the deletion in the single FCGR3B locus (3.6-fold). In addition, duplications in these genes were indeed more frequent in healthy subjects, suggesting that high FCGR3B/ADAM3A gene copy numbers are protective factors against to disease development. Overall, 21 rare CNVs were identified in SLE patients using a four-step pipeline created for identification of rare variants. Furthermore, heterozygous deletions overlapping the CFHR4, CFHR5 and HLA-DPB2 genes were described for the first time in SLE patients. Here we present the first genome-wide CNV study of SLE patients in a tri-hybrid population. The results show that novel susceptibility loci to SLE can be found once the distribution of structural variants is analyzed throughout the whole genome."
https://openalex.org/W2902048657,"Habitat demands and species mobility strongly determine the occurrence of species. Sedentary species with specific habitat requirements are assumed to occur more patchy than mobile habitat generalist species, and thus suffer stronger under habitat fragmentation and habitat deterioration. In this study we measured dispersal and habitat preference of three selected butterfly species using mark-release-recapture technique. We used data on species abundance to calculate Species Distribution Models based on high-resolution aerial photographs taken using RGB / NIR cameras mounted on a UAV. We found that microhabitats for species with specific habitat requirements occur spatially restricted. In contrast, suitable habitats are more interconnected and widespread for mobile habitat generalists. Our models indicate that even managed grassland sites have comparatively little habitat quality, while road verges provide high quality micro-habitats. In addition, dispersal was more restricted for specialist butterfly species, and higher for the two other butterfly species with less ecological specialisation. This study shows synergies arising when combining ecological data with high precision aerial pictures and Species Distribution Models, to identify micro-habitats for butterflies. This approach might be suitable to identify and conserve high quality habitats, and to improve nature conservation at the ground."

We have focused on how the accessibility criteria used for students with visual impairments might affect non-disabled students. For this, we reviewed applicable Universal Design principles as well as best practices in multimedia learning. We took into account the roles, procedures, tools and standards involved in the multimedia lifecycle. We then undertook an experiment consisting of producing two videos about prime numbers with the same pedagogical contents; one video was accessible for students with visual impairments and the other one was not accessible to them. We conducted a trial in real world school settings with 228 non-disabled children, who were randomly assigned a version, either accessible or not accessible, and were then asked to take a test to measure objective aspects of their learning concerning retention and transfer as well as several subjective aspects, including the attractiveness of the videos. Results indicate that there were no significant differences in the scores obtained by students using either video, although the group who watched the accessible video obtained higher score medians in the retention questions. Moreover, students found the accessible video significantly more attractive (p = 0.042). Our study provides recommendations for different stakeholders and stages within the process of producing multimedia mathematics materials that are accessible to primary students with visual impairments, as well as evidence demonstrating that everybody can benefit from the recommendations for developing good quality, accessible multimedia material."
https://openalex.org/W2902769454,"The genus Streptomyces is the best-known source of therapeutic secondary metabolites, especially antibiotics with pharmaceutical applications. Here, we performed a comparative study based on the time-resolved metabolic disparity in S. coelicolor A3(2) subjected to fermentative cultivation in two different types of media (R2YE and RSM3) in order to investigate secondary metabolite production pathways. The relative abundance of secondary metabolites, such as prodiginines, indoles, germicidins, and selected diketopiperazines, was increased in S. coelicolor A3(2) cultivated in R2YE medium compared to that in RSM3 medium, variably at the late-log and stationary phases of fermentative growth. Correlation analysis indicated that “antibiotic prodiginines” contributed maximally to the absorption maxima (A530) of culture supernatants, indicating their optimal production at 96 hours in R2YE medium. A higher abundance of L-proline (48–72 hours) followed by prodiginines (96 hours) was evident, substantiating the intertwined links between precursor and activated prodiginines pathway. Similarly, the higher abundance of indoles was concurrent with tryptophan levels in the shikimate pathway, whereas diketopiperazines were synchronously abundant along with the levels of phenylalanine, leucine, and proline. Additionally, acetyl-CoA induced the acetate pathway, resulting in the production of germicidins. Thus, our results demonstrate that S. coelicolor A3(2) produces specific secondary metabolites by enhancing the dedicated metabolic pathway responsible for their production. In conclusion, our results from this study provide insight into the metabolic pathways of S. coelicolor A3(2), and can be applied to further optimize the production of prodiginines."

Methods This retrospective study included 53 consecutive eyes of 27 patients with POAG and 64 normal eyes of 32 controls. Both glaucomatous and control groups were divided into 2 subgroups according to age: <60 age (glaucomatous and control group 1) and 61–90 age (glaucomatous and control group 2). Results The ONSAS was significantly lower in all glaucomatous eyes (3.54 ± 0.38) versus normal eyes (3.87 ± 0.32) (p = 0.001). Significant reduction of ONSAS was showed in control group 2 (3.63 mm ± 0.37) compared to control group 1 (3.87 mm ± 0.32) (p = 0.014) and between glaucoma group 1 (3.54 mm ± 0.38) and control group 1 (p = 0.001). While no significant differences were observed between glaucomatous group 2 (3.48 mm ± 0.41) and control group 2 (p = 0.17) and between glaucoma group 1 and glaucoma group 2 (p = 0.609). Lastly, the ONSAS was not significantly associated with GCC and RNFL parameters except for Focal Loss Volume (FLV), Superior RNFL and ONSAS in glaucoma group 1 and for FLV and ONSAS in all glaucomatous group. Conclusion Standardized A-scan ultrasound is a non invasive imaging technique with which it is possible to monitor ONSAS changes in glaucomatous patients. The reduction of ONSAS confirm the importance of the lower orbital CSFP as further risk factor in the progression of glaucoma disease."
https://openalex.org/W2902131271,"Regulation of transcription is a key process in cellular homeostasis. It depends on regulators that either repress or stimulate the transcription of genes, therefore controlling different biological functions. The Nuclear Receptor Corepressor 1 (NCOR1) is one of those co-repressors that regulate the transcription by facilitating the recruitment of HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. In our article, by using an in silico approach, we evaluate the mutational status of NCOR1 in breast and lung tumors. We identified that NORC1 is mutated in more than 3% of breast tumors and lung adenocarcinomas and linked this fact with detrimental outcome in some subtypes, particularly in those that are hormone receptor negative. In addition to these findings, as mutations in this gene are deleterious, we confirmed that high levels of this gene were linked with good prognosis in the same tumor subtypes. Findings in the same direction were identified in lung adenocarcinomas, with mutations associated with detrimental prognosis and high expression with better outcome. In conclusion, hereby we describe the presence and prognostic role of mutations in the NCOR1 gene in hormone receptor negative breast and lung adenocarcinomas, and we also confirm that NCOR1 is a tumor suppressor gene. Further studies should be performed to explore therapeutic mechanisms to restore its function."

A causal depiction of the societal interest around violent attacks, gun control and gun purchase, both synchronous and over time, should be a stepping stone for designing future strategies regarding the safety concerns of the U.S. population. Objective Examine the causal relationships between unexpected increases in population interest about violent attacks, gun control, and gun purchase. Methods Relationships among online searches for information about violent attacks, gun control, and gun purchase occurring between 2004 and 2017 in the U.S. are explained through a novel structural vector autoregressive time series model to account for simultaneous causal relationships. Results More than 20% of the stationary variability in each of gun control and gun purchase interest can be explained by the remaining factors. Gun control interest appears to be caused, in part, by violent attacks informational shocks, yet violent attacks, although impactful, have a lesser effect than gun control debate on long-term gun ownership interests. Conclusions The form in which gun control has been introduced in public debate may have further increased gun ownership interest. Reactive gun purchase interest may be an unintended side effect of gun control debate. U.S. policymakers may need to rethink current approaches to promotion of gun control, and whether societal policy debate without policy outcomes could be having unintended effects."
https://openalex.org/W2902331418,"Finger photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive method that measures blood volume changes in the finger. The PPG fitness index (PPGF) has been proposed as an index of vascular risk and vascular aging. The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of heart rate (HR) on the PPGF and to determine whether PPGF is influenced by blood pressure (BP) changes. Twenty subjects (78±8 years, 3 female) with permanent cardiac pacemakers or cardioverter defibrillators were prospectively recruited. HR was changed by pacing, in a random order from 60 to 100 bpm and in 10 bpm increments. At each paced HR, the PPGF was derived from a finger photoplethysmogram. Cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were derived from the finger arterial pressure waveform. Brachial blood pressure (BP) was measured by the oscillometric method. This study found that as HR was increased from 60 to 100 bpm, brachial diastolic BP, brachial mean BP and CO were significantly increased (p<0.01), whilst the PPGF and SV were significantly decreased (p<0.001). The effects of HR on the PPGF were influenced by BP, with a decreasing HR effect on the PPGF that resulted from a higher BP. In conclusion, HR was a significant confounder for PPGF and it must be taken into account in analyses of PPGF, when there are large changes or differences in the HR. The magnitude of this effect was BP dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2903089409,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic disease affecting a large amount of the population. To optimize treatment and disease management, it is crucial to detect patients suffering from severe forms. Several tools have been used to classify patients according to severity: standardized questionnaires, visual analogue scales (VAS) and cluster analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the best method to stratify patients suffering from seasonal AR and to propose cut-offs to identify severe forms of the disease. In a multicenter French study (PollinAir), patients suffering from seasonal AR were assessed by a physician that completed a 17 items questionnaire and answered a self-assessment VAS. Five methods were evaluated to stratify patients according to AR severity: k-means clustering, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, Allergic Rhinitis Physician Score (ARPhyS), total symptoms score (TSS-17), and VAS. Fisher linear, quadratic discriminant analysis, non-parametric kernel density estimation methods were used to evaluate miss-classification of the patients and cross-validation was used to assess the validity of each scale. 28,109 patients were categorized into “mild”, “moderate”, and “severe”, through the 5 different methods. The best discrimination was offered by the ARPhyS scale. With the ARPhyS scale, cut-offs at a score of 8–9 for mild to moderate and of 11–12 for moderate to severe symptoms were found. Score reliability was also acceptable (Cronbach’s α coefficient: 0.626) for the ARPhyS scale, and excellent for the TSS-17 (0.864). The ARPhyS scale seems the best method to target patients with severe seasonal AR. In the present study, we highlighted optimal discrimination cut-offs. This tool could be implemented in daily practice to identify severe patients that need a specialized intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2902158497,"In Drosophila it has recently been demonstrated that a spindle matrix in the form of a membrane-less macromolecular assembly embeds the microtubule-based spindle apparatus. In addition, two of its constituents, Megator and Chromator, were shown to function as spatial regulators of spindle checkpoint proteins. However, whether the spindle matrix plays a wider functional role in spatially regulating cell cycle progression factors was unknown. Here using a live imaging approach we provide evidence that a number of key cell cycle proteins such as Cyclin B, Polo, and Ran co-localize with the spindle matrix during mitosis. Furthermore, prevention of spindle matrix formation by injection of a function blocking antibody against the spindle matrix protein Chromator results in cell cycle arrest prior to nuclear envelope breakdown. In such embryos the spatial dynamics of Polo and Cyclin B enrichment at the nuclear rim and kinetochores is abrogated and Polo is not imported into the nucleus. This is in contrast to colchicine-arrested embryos where the wild-type dynamics of these proteins are maintained. Taken together these results suggest that spindle matrix formation may be a general requirement for the localization and proper dynamics of cell cycle factors promoting signaling events leading to cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2902508536,"Audio-motor coordination is a fundamental requirement in the learning and execution of sequential actions such as music performance. Predictive motor control mechanisms determine the sequential content and timing of upcoming tones and thereby facilitate accurate performance. To study the role of auditory-motor predictions at early stages of acquiring piano performance skills, we conducted an experiment in which non-musicians learned to play a musical sequence on the piano in synchrony with a metronome. Three experimental conditions compared errors and timing. The first consisted of normal auditory feedback using conventional piano key-to-tone mappings. The second employed fixed-pitch auditory feedback consisting of a single tone that was given with each key stroke. In the third condition, for each key stroke a tone was randomly drawn from the set of tones associated with the normal sequence. The results showed that when auditory feedback tones were randomly assigned, participants produced more sequencing errors (i.e., a higher percentage of incorrect key strokes) compared to when auditory feedback was normal or consisted of a single tone of fixed pitch. Furthermore, synchronization with the metronome was most accurate in the fixed-pitch single-tone condition. These findings suggest that predictive motor control mechanisms support sequencing and timing, and that these sensorimotor processes are dissociable even at early stages of acquiring complex motor skills such as music performance."
https://openalex.org/W2902513912,"Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is generally considered safe and is widely used to treat a variety of clinical conditions involving muscle hyperactivity and for cosmetic purposes. However, the effects of BoNT-A poisoning (botulism) on brain function are poorly understood.Herein, we investigated brain functions in 9 patients who received illegal cosmetic injections of botulinum and 18 matched controls by combining the analysis methods of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) based on resting-state fMRI. Compared with the controls, the patients with botulism exhibited significantly reduced ReHo values in the left posterior lobe of the cerebellum extending to the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum, as well as in the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum extending to the parahippocampal gyrus and right posterior lobe of the cerebellum. The patients with botulism also showed weakened ALFF values in the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum extending to the left anterior lobe of the cerebellum and right posterior lobe of the cerebellum, as well as in the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum.The results indicate that BoNT-A may modulate cerebral activation in specific areas, which may play roles in both the adverse effects of botulism and the mechanism underlying clinical treatment with BoNT-A."

Subsequently a gynecological exam was administered to assess safety outcomes, followed by a questionnaire to assess acceptability and perceived efficacy. A paired t-test was used to analyze reduction of leakage in ml, and percent reduction was reported. Study limitations include observer bias while evaluating adverse outcomes and the possibility of social desirability bias during questionnaire administration that might overestimate the effect of the cup and women's acceptability.Of the 32 patients screened, 11 were eligible (100% consent rate). At baseline, mean (±SD) leakage in ml was 63.2 (±49.2) (95% CI: 30.2-96.3) over two hours, while the mean leakage over two hours of use of the cup was 16.8 (±16.5) (95% CI: 5.7-27.9). The mean difference of 46.4 (±52.1) ml with use of the cup (95% CI: 11.4-81.4) was statistically significant (p = 0.02). With the cup, women experienced an average 61.0% (±37.4) (95% CI: 35.9-86.2) leakage reduction, a difference 10/11 users (91.0%) perceived in reduced leakage. One participant, reporting four previous surgical attempts, experienced a 78.7% leakage reduction. Acceptability was high-women could easily insert (8/11), remove (8/11), and comfortably wear (11/11) the cup and most (10/11) would recommend it. No adverse effects attributable to the intervention were observed on exam, although some women perceived difficulties with insertion and removal. Data collection tools were appropriate with slight modification advised.A larger trial is warranted for a more robust evaluation of the menstrual cup for management of urinary leakage due to VVF among women who have not yet accessed surgery or for whom surgery was not successful."
https://openalex.org/W2902539521,"Biological invasions of rodents and other species have been especially problematic on tropical islands. Invasive Rattus rattus consumption of Hibiscadelphus giffardianus (Malvaceae; common Hawaiian name hau kuahiwi) fruit and seeds has been hypothesized to be the most-limiting factor inhibiting the critically endangered tree, but this has not been experimentally tested, and little is known about other factors affecting seed dispersal, germination, and seedling establishment. Thus, we do not know if rat removal is sufficient to increase hau kuahiwi recruitment. This study aims to evaluate the effect of rat population control on the ability of hau kuahiwi to retain fruit and establish seedlings. We compared hau kuahiwi fruiting and seedling recruitment in a stand treated to reduce rat abundance and a neighbouring control stand. Fruit retention increased following treatment but seedling establishment did not. Although rat control improves the ability of hau kuahiwi to retain fruit, other, presently unknown inhibitors to seed dispersal, germination, and/or seedling development remain. Seed and seedling predation by other species, competition from numerous invasive plant species, unsuitable climate, and/or other factors may be primary inhibitors in the absence of rats, but we emphasize that progressive isolation of these factors at individual hau kuahiwi life stages may be necessary to identify the remaining threats to the conservation of this critically endangered plant."

Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to explore the compositions of confounding factors among populations. The procedure of stratified standardization technique was applied to compare the differences of the average length of stay and the average hospitalization expense among three hospitals.Age, gender, comorbidity, and principal diagnoses category were considered as confounding factors. After correcting all factors, the average length of stay of hospital A and C were increased by 0.21 and 1.20 days, respectively, while that of hospital B was reduced by 1.54 days. The average hospitalization expenses of hospital A and C were increased by 1494 and 660 Yuan, whilst that of hospital B was decreased by 810 Yuan.Standardization method will be helpful to improve the comparability of medical service indicators in hospital administration.

https://openalex.org/W2952209456,"When estimating psychometric functions with sampling procedures, psychophysical assessments should be precise and accurate while being as efficient as possible to reduce assessment duration. The estimation performance of sampling procedures is commonly evaluated in computer simulations for single psychometric functions and reported using metrics as a function of number of trials. However, the estimation performance of a sampling procedure may vary for different psychometric functions. Therefore, the results of these type of evaluations may not be generalizable to a heterogeneous population of interest. In addition, the maximum number of trials is often imposed by time restrictions, especially in clinical applications, making trial-based metrics suboptimal. Hence, the benefit of these simulations to select and tune an ideal sampling procedure for a specific application is limited. We suggest to evaluate the estimation performance of sampling procedures in simulations covering the entire range of psychometric functions found in a population of interest, and propose a comprehensive set of performance metrics for a detailed analysis. To illustrate the information gained from these metrics in an application example, six sampling procedures were evaluated in a computer simulation based on prior knowledge on the population distribution and requirements from proprioceptive assessments. The metrics revealed limitations of the sampling procedures, such as inhomogeneous or systematically decreasing performance depending on the psychometric functions, which can inform the tuning process of a sampling procedure. More advanced metrics allowed directly comparing overall performances of different sampling procedures and select the best-suited sampling procedure for the example application. The proposed analysis metrics can be used for any sampling procedure and the estimation of any parameter of a psychometric function, independent of the shape of the psychometric function and of how such a parameter was estimated. This framework should help to accelerate the development process of psychophysical assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2953192522,"High-level behaviour of metabolic systems results from the properties of, and interactions between, numerous molecular components. Reaching a complete understanding of metabolic behaviour based on the system's components is therefore a difficult task. This problem can be tackled by constructing and subsequently analysing kinetic models of metabolic pathways since such models aim to capture all the relevant properties of the system components and their interactions. Symbolic control analysis is a framework for analysing pathway models in order to reach a mechanistic understanding of their behaviour. By providing algebraic expressions for the sensitivities of system properties, such as metabolic flux or steady-state concentrations, in terms of the properties of individual reactions it allows one to trace the high level behaviour back to these low level components. Here we apply this method to a model of pyruvate branch metabolism in Lactococcus lactis in order to explain a previously observed negative flux response towards an increase in substrate concentration. With this method we are able to show, first, that the sensitivity of flux towards changes in reaction rates (represented by flux control coefficients) is determined by the individual metabolic branches of the pathway, and second, how the sensitivities of individual reaction rates towards their substrates (represented by elasticity coefficients) contribute to this flux control. We also quantify the contributions of enzyme binding and mass-action to enzyme elasticity separately, which allows for an even finer-grained understanding of flux control. These analytical tools allow us to analyse the control properties of a metabolic model and to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of the quantitative contributions of each of the enzymes to this control. Our analysis provides an example of the descriptive power of the general principles of symbolic control analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2902056828,"Pelagic crustaceans are arguably the most abundant group of metazoans on Earth, yet little is known about their natural behavior. The deep pelagic shrimp Hymenopenaeus doris is a common decapod that thrives in low oxygen layers of the eastern Pacific Ocean. When first observed in situ using a remotely operated vehicle, most specimens of H. doris appeared dead due to inactivity and inverted orientation. Closer inspection revealed that these animals were utilizing small, subtle shifts in appendage position to control their orientation and sink rate. In this mode, they resembled molted shrimp exoskeletons. We hypothesize that these shrimp may avoid capture by visually-cued predators with this characteristic behavior. The low metabolic rates of H. doris (0.55–0.81 mg O2 kg-1 min-1) are similar to other deep-living shrimp, and also align with their high hypoxia tolerance and reduced activity. We observed similar behavior in another deep pelagic decapod, Petalidium suspiriosum, which transiently inhabited Monterey Canyon, California, during a period of anomalously warm ocean conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2902217790,"Previous laboratory studies on the centipede game have found that subjects exhibit surprisingly high levels of cooperation. Across disciplines, it has recently been highlighted that these high levels of cooperation might be explained by ""team reasoning"", the willingness to think as a team rather than as an individual. We run an experiment with a standard centipede game as a baseline. In two treatments, we seek to induce team reasoning by making a joint goal salient. First, we implement a probabilistic variant of the centipede game that makes it easy to identify a joint goal. Second, we frame the game as a situation where a team of two soccer players attempts to score a goal. This frame increases the salience even more. Compared to the baseline, our treatments induce higher levels of cooperation. In a second experiment, we obtain similar evidence in a more natural environment-a beer garden during the 2014 FIFA Soccer World Cup. Our study contributes to understanding how a salient goal can support cooperation."

There are few prospective population-based surveillance studies of the immunological and inflammatory consequences of exposure to dengue virus in young children. Objective To study the association between serologically confirmed prior medical diagnosis of dengue infection and blood measures of systemic inflammation with dengue virus immunoglobulin G levels. Methods A population-based study of healthy three-year old children living in Havana, Cuba. Results 865 individuals provided a blood sample. Fourteen (1.6%) had a prior medical diagnosis of dengue infection, and 851 individuals had no prior medical diagnosis. There was no difference in the serum immunoglobulin G titres between these groups (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.49). Total white cell count, blood neutrophil and eosinophil counts were linearly associated with a dengue immunoglobulin G value above the median value. Conclusions There was no difference between the dengue immunoglobulin G titres in young children who had previously had clinically proven dengue infection compared to those who had no diagnosis of prior infection. This may be a consequence of a relatively high prevalence of sub-clinical infection. A higher dengue immunoglobulin G level was positively associated with a range of inflammatory biomarkers, although these data cannot demonstrate a causal association."
