https://openalex.org/W2171367003,"Human cyclin D1 has been associated with a wide variety of proliferative diseases but its biochemical role is unknown. In diploid fibroblasts we find that cyclin D1 is complexed with many other cellular proteins. Among them are protein kinase catalytic subunits CDK2, CDK4 (previously called PSK-J3), and CDK5 (also called PSSALRE). In addition, polypeptides of 21 kd and 36 kd are identified in association with cyclin D1. We show that the 36 kd protein is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA. Cyclin D3 also associates with multiple protein kinases, p21 and PCNA. It is proposed that there exists a quaternary complex of D cyclin, CDK, PCNA, and p21 and that many combinatorial variations (cyclin D1, D3, CDK2, 4, and 5) may assemble in vivo. These findings link a human putative G1 cyclin that is associated with oncogenesis with a well-characterized DNA replication and repair factor."
https://openalex.org/W2003059369,"The peak concentration and rate of clearance of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft are important determinants of synaptic function, yet the neurotransmitter concentration time course is unknown at synapses in the brain. The time course of free glutamate in the cleft was estimated by kinetic analysis of the displacement of a rapidly dissociating competitive antagonist from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors during synaptic transmission. Glutamate peaked at 1.1 millimolar and decayed with a time constant of 1.2 milliseconds at cultured hippocampal synapses. This time course implies that transmitter saturates postsynaptic NMDA receptors. However, glutamate dissociates much more rapidly from alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Thus, the time course of free glutamate predicts that dissociation contributes to the decay of the AMPA receptor-mediated postsynaptic current."
https://openalex.org/W2046805949,"The HM1 gene in maize controls both race-specific resistance to the fungus Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 and expression of the NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)-dependent HC toxin reductase (HCTR), which inactivates HC toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide produced by the fungus to permit infection. Several HM1 alleles were generated and cloned by transposon-induced mutagenesis. The sequence of wild-type HM1 shares homology with dihydroflavonol-4-reductase genes from maize, petunia, and snap-dragon. Sequence homology is greatest in the beta alpha beta-dinucleotide binding fold that is conserved among NADPH- and NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent reductases and dehydrogenases. This indicates that HM1 encodes HCTR."
https://openalex.org/W1965412944,"The human Y chromosome was physically mapped by assembling 196 recombinant DNA clones, each containing a segment of the chromosome, into a single overlapping array. This array included more than 98 percent of the euchromatic portion of the Y chromosome. First, a library of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones was prepared from the genomic DNA of a human XYYYY male. The library was screened to identify clones containing 160 sequence-tagged sites and the map was then constructed from this information. In all, 207 Y-chromosomal DNA loci were assigned to 127 ordered intervals on the basis of their presence or absence in the YAC's, yielding ordered landmarks at an average spacing of 220 kilobases across the euchromatic region. The map reveals that Y-chromosomal genes are scattered among a patchwork of X-homologous, Y-specific repetitive, and single-copy DNA sequences. This map of overlapping clones and ordered, densely spaced markers should accelerate studies of the chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2111202552,Homeotic genes encode transcription factors that are thought to specify segmental identity by regulating expression of subordinate genes. Limb development is repressed in the abdominal segments of the Drosophila embryo by the hometic genes of the Bithorax complex (BX-C). Localized expression of the homeobox gene Distal-less (DII) is required for leg development in thoracic segments. We have identified a minimal cis-regulatory enhancer element that directs DII expression in the larval leg primordia. We present evidence that the BX-C proteins repress DII expression in abdominal segments by binding to a small number of specific sites in this element. Mutating these sites eliminates BX-C protein binding and renders the element insensitive to BX-C-mediated repression in vivo. Repression of limb development in the abdomen appears to be controlled at the DII enhancer. Thus DII may serve as a downstream target gene through which the homeotic genes control abdominal segment identity in the Drosophila embryo.

https://openalex.org/W1624721816,"P-glycoprotein, an active efflux pump of antitumor agents in multidrug-resistant tumor cells, exists in various normal tissues, including brain capillaries. To study the physiological function of P-glycoprotein expressed in brain capillary endothelium, we established nine mouse brain capillary endothelial cell (MBEC) lines and examined the transport of antitumor agents across the monolayer of MBEC epithelia. In the MBECs, the activities of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, specific markers for brain capillary endothelial cells, were about three times higher than those in other cells including human umbilical vein endothelial cells. By immunoblot analysis, P-glycoprotein was detected in all of the nine MBEC clones. The P-glycoprotein expressed in MBECs specifically bound [125I]iodoaryl azidoprazosin as that in multidrug-resistant cells, and efflux of vincristine was observed in the MBECs. When MBECs were grown on a porous filter membrane, they formed a monolayer of epithelium. By immunoelectron microscopic analysis, P-glycoprotein in MBEC epithelia was shown to be localized to the apical surface of the cells. Moreover, the unidirectional transepithelial transport of vincristine from basal side to apical side was demonstrated in vitro. These observations indicate that P-glycoprotein in brain capillary endothelium prevents vincristine from entering the central nervous system and thus may be one of the functional components of the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2076980678,"Presynaptic calcium channels are crucial elements of neuronal excitation-secretion coupling. In mammalian brain, they have been difficult to characterize because most presynaptic terminals are too small to probe with electrodes, and available pharmacological tools such as dihydropyridines and omega-conotoxin are largely ineffective. Subsecond measurements of synaptosomal glutamate release have now been used to assess presynaptic calcium channel activity in order to study the action of peptide toxins from the venom of the funnel web spider Agelenopsis aperta, which is known to inhibit dihydropyridine and omega-conotoxin-resistant neuronal calcium currents. A presynaptic calcium channel important in glutamate release is shown to be omega-Aga-IVA sensitive and omega-conotoxin resistant."
https://openalex.org/W2085046609,"The increased synthesis of heat shock proteins is a ubiquitous physiological response of cells to environmental stress. How these proteins function in protecting cellular structures is not yet understood. The mitochondrial heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) has now been shown to form complexes with a variety of polypeptides in organelles exposed to heat stress. The Hsp60 was required to prevent the thermal inactivation in vivo of native dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) imported into mitochondria. In vitro, Hsp60 bound to DHFR in the course of thermal denaturation, preventing its aggregation, and mediated its adenosine triphosphate-dependent refolding at increased temperatures. These results suggest a general mechanism by which heat shock proteins of the Hsp60 family stabilize preexisting proteins under stress conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1599165949,"Tetanus toxin (100 nM) when preincubated with guinea pig cerebrocortical synaptosomes for 45 min reduces the final extent of the KCl-evoked, Ca(2+)-dependent, glutamate transmitter release to 30% of non-intoxicated controls. Similarly, 100 nM Botulinum neurotoxins, types A and B, preincubated for 90 min inhibit release to 45-60% of non-intoxicated controls. The toxins preferentially attenuate a slow phase of KCl-evoked glutamate release which may be associated with synaptic vesicle mobilization. Tetanus toxin additionally inhibits the release of aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid and met-enkephalin from the same preparation. Since amino acids and neuropeptides are released by distinct mechanisms, this indicates that the toxin affects a step common to both exocytotic pathways. When Ba2+ (which does not interact with calmodulin) is substituted for Ca2+, the control KCl-evoked release of each transmitter is unaffected and tetanus toxin is still inhibitory. Taken together these results implicate a calmodulin-independent locus (or loci) of action common to small- and large-dense-core vesicles and associated with vesicle transport."
https://openalex.org/W2129917788,"Genetic studies suggest that three homeotic functions, designated A, B, and C, act alone and together to specify the fate of floral organ primordia in distantly related dicotyledonous plant species. To test the genetic model, we have generated transgenic tobacco plants that ectopically express the AGAMOUS gene from Brassica napus, which is necessary for the C function. Flowers on the resulting plants showed homeotic transformations of sepals into carpels and petals into stamens. These phenotypes are consistent with predictions from the genetic model, show that expression of AGAMOUS is sufficient to provide ectopic C function, and demonstrate that the structure of flowers can be manipulated in a predictable manner by altering the expression of a single regulatory gene. Furthermore, the generation of the predicted transformations by ectopic expression of the Brassica gene in transgenic tobacco indicates that gene functions are interchangable between phylogenetically distant species."
https://openalex.org/W2168959672,"To determine the number of drug binding sites that exist on the multidrug transporter, P-glycoprotein, we used azidopine, a dihydropyridine photoaffinity compound that reverses multidrug resistance and labels P-glycoprotein. Azidopine labels P-glycoprotein in two distinct locations: one labeled site is within the amino half of P-glycoprotein between amino acid residues 198 and 440, and the other site is within the carboxy half of the protein. Vinblastine is a cytotoxic drug that is used in cancer chemotherapy and is a substrate for transport by P-glycoprotein. We found that vinblastine inhibits azidopine labeling to approximately the same extent at each labeled site on P-glycoprotein. Because several studies have shown that amino acid residue 185 of P-glycoprotein plays a critical role in some aspects of drug binding and transport, we also studied the effect that amino acid residue 185 has on azidopine labeling. These studies show that azidopine labels both sites equivalently in both wild-type (G185) and mutant (V185) P-glycoproteins. We conclude from our results that the two halves of P-glycoprotein approach each other to form a single binding site for these drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2005174079,"Several proteins have been discovered that either catalyze slow protein-folding reactions or assist folding in the cell. Prolyl isomerase, which has been shown to accelerate rate-limiting cis-trans peptidyl-proline isomerization steps in the folding pathway, can also participate in the protein-folding process as a chaperone. This function is exerted on an early folding intermediate of carbonic anhydrase, which is thereby prevented from aggregating, whereas the isomerase activity is performed later in the folding process."
https://openalex.org/W2028592334,"An adeno-associated virus vector encoding an antisense RNA was used to transduce stable intracellular resistance to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in human hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cell lines. The antisense targets are present in all HIV-1 transcripts and include the TAR sequence, which is critical for transcription and virus replication, and the polyadenylation signal. Cell lines expressing antisense RNA showed up to 95 percent inhibition of gene expression directed by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and greater than 99 percent reduction in infectious HIV-1 production, with no detectable cellular toxicity. Because of their efficient transcription and inability to recombine with HIV-1, adeno-associated virus vectors represent a promising form of anti-retroviral gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1580245730,"In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, glutamate elevated the Ca(2+)-independent activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) through autophosphorylation when the neurons were incubated in Mg(2+)-free buffer, and this response was blocked by specific antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. In addition, glutamate stimulated the transient translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. This effect was not blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists but was partially blocked by DL-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate. Quisqualate or trans-1-amoinocyclopentane-trans1,3-dicarboxylate produced a similar effect on the translocation of PKC. In the experiments with 32P-labeled cells, the phosphorylation of microtuble-associated protein 2 and synapsin I, as well as autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II, were found to be stimulated by exposure to glutamate. These results suggest that glutamate can activate CaM kinase II through the ionotropic NMDA receptor, which in turn increases the phosphorylation of microtuble-associated protein 2 and synapsin I. PKC was activated through the metabotropic glutamate receptor in the hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1521424334,"The expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is low in the adipose tissue of suckling rats and increases markedly at weaning to a high carbohydrate diet. We have studied in vitro the factors regulating this phenomenon. Inguinal adipose tissue pieces from 19-day-old suckling rats were cultured for 6 or 24 h in minimal essential medium. Insulin (100 nM) added in the presence of lactate and pyruvate did not stimulate the expression of FAS and ACC. Glucose (20 mM) alone resulted in a 5-7-fold increase of FAS and ACC mRNA. Insulin potentiated the effect of glucose. 3-O-Methylglucose, a glucose analog that is transported into the cell but not metabolized, had no effect on FAS and ACC mRNA accumulation. However, 2-deoxyglucose (1 mM), a glucose analog which is phosphorylated to 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate, stimulated the expression of FAS and ACC to the same extent as 20 mM glucose. Glucose 6-phosphate concentrations in adipose tissue pieces cultured in various conditions changed in parallel with the FAS and ACC mRNA levels. We conclude that glucose 6-phosphate could be the metabolite involved in the stimulation of lipogenic enzyme gene expression in response to glucose."

https://openalex.org/W1493538310,"We undertook these studies to characterize the molecular basis of the interaction of histamine with the H2 receptor. Key areas of homology in the structures of the histamine H2 and beta 2 adrenergic receptor suggested specific transmembrane amino acids that might be important for binding of histamine. A third transmembrane aspartic acid of the histamine receptor (Asp98), thought to serve as a counter anion that interacts with the cationic amine moiety of histamine, was mutated to Asn98, and the mutated receptor was expressed in Hepa cells. Removal of the negatively charged amino acid abolished both binding of the H2 receptor antagonist [methyl-3H]tiotidine and histamine stimulated increases in cellular cAMP content. Mutation of a fifth transmembrane aspartic acid (Asp186) to Ala186 or Asn186 by itself or in conjunction with mutation of another fifth transmembrane amino acid (Thr190 to Ala190) resulted in a loss of [methyl-3H] tiotidine binding, although the generation of cAMP in response to histamine was maintained. The histamine receptor with only a Thr190 to Ala190 or Cys190 mutation retained the ability to bind [methyl-3H]tiotidine, but both the affinity and efficacy of binding were reduced. These data lead us to propose a model for histamine binding in which Asp98 is essential for histamine binding and action, Asp186 defines H2 selectivity, and Thr190 is important in establishing the kinetics of histamine binding, but is not essential for H2 selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2097515362,"Infection of vertebrates with the parasitic blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni induces a variety of host immune responses, which are directed against both protein and carbohydrate antigens. In this report, we describe our studies on the structures of antigenic oligosaccharides derived from glycoproteins synthesized by S. mansoni. Immobilized antibodies derived from the sera of infected hamsters and mice bind to a family of high molecular weight Asn-linked oligosaccharides in glycoproteins from the adult parasite. Structural analysis of the major antigenic oligosaccharides revealed that they have high amounts of fucose-linked alpha 1,3 to N-acetylglucosamine residues within the linear repeating disaccharide (3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1)n, a poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequence containing the Lewis X antigenic blood group. The remarkable ability of S. mansoni to synthesize these vertebrate-type oligosaccharides may have implications in both the mechanisms of host-parasite interactions and on the development of vaccines to prevent this disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1579430004,"The interferon-inducible 68-kDa dsRNA-dependent eIF2 alpha-kinase (dsI) is a potent cellular antiviral enzyme which is activated by autophosphorylation in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activated dsI has also been implicated as a second messenger for gene induction by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and interferon (IFN). We have shown previously that introduction of a transforming ras gene into BALB/c-3T3 fibroblasts blocks induction of responsive genes by PDGF and IFN. We therefore investigated the effect of transforming ras genes on dsI activity in these cells. We report here that dsRNA-mediated activation of dsI is blocked in v-ras-containing cells in a manner specific to ras and not attributable to the transformed phenotype since: 1) a dexamethasone-inducible v-Ha-ras gene produced the effect within 18 h of induction; 2) morphologic reversion of ras-transformed cells with cAMP or the Krev-1 gene restored potential for dsI activation; and 3) transformation by v-mos or v-abl had no effect on dsI activation. Latent dsI levels were unaffected by v-ras. A heat-sensitive dsI inhibitory activity could be demonstrated in v-ras-containing cells which functioned in trans when mixed with untransformed cell extracts prior to stimulation with dsRNA. The inhibitory activity, which was destroyed by phenol-chloroform extraction, did not bind dsRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2012125630,"Thymic selection of the developing T cell repertoire is thought to occur at the CD4+CD8+ stage of differentiation and to be determined by the specificity of the T cell receptors (TCRs) that CD4+CD8+ thymocytes express. However, TCR signals can inhibit the differentiation of precursor thymocytes into CD4+CD8+ cells, which suggests that selection might occur earlier than thought. Indeed, in a negatively selecting male thymus, CD4-CD8lo precursor thymocytes that express a transgenic TCR to male antigen are developmentally arrested as a consequence of antigen encounter and fail to become CD4+CD8+. Thus, negative selection can occur before the CD4+CD8+ stage of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1987814664,"Electron transfer in nitrogenase involves a gating process initiated by MgATP (magnesium adenosine triphosphate) binding to Fe-protein. The redox site, an 4Fe:4S cluster, is structurally separated from the MgATP binding site. For MgATP hydrolysis to be coupled to electron transfer, a signal transduction mechanism is proposed that is similar to that in guanosine triphosphatase proteins. Based on the three-dimensional structure of Fe-protein, Asp125 is likely to be part of a putative transduction path. Altered Fe-protein with Glu replacing Asp has been prepared and retains the ability for the initial nucleotide-dependent conformational change. However, either MgADP or MgATP can induce the shift and Mg binding to the nucleotide is no longer essential."
https://openalex.org/W1520977668,"A number of diverse signaling pathways can be activated by G-protein coupled receptors. However, the factors involved in selection of a particular transduction pathway by a single receptor are not well understood. We are attempting to address this issue utilizing the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2-AR) subfamily as a representative model system. In this report, we demonstrate that the cellular response mediated by an alpha 2-AR subtype is cell-specific and thus depends on its environment. Receptor coupling to adenylylcyclase was determined following stable expression of the rat alpha 2B- and alpha 2D-AR subtypes in three functionally distinct cell types (NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells, and the pheochromocytoma cell line PC-12). When the receptor subtype gene is expressed in NIH-3T3 and DDT1 MF-2 cells, receptor activation inhibits basal and forskolin-induced increases in cellular cAMP. However, in PC-12 transfectants the same receptor subtype actually increases basal cAMP and augments the effect of forskolin. Potentiation of the forskolin effect in PC-12 cells is insensitive to pertussis toxin but is blocked by loading the cells with BAPTA (bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) which minimizes changes in Ca2+i by calcium chelation. These data and the functional demonstration of a Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive adenylylcyclase in PC-12 but not NIH-3T3 and DDT1 MF-2 cells, suggests that the cell-specific effects of epinephrine are due to receptor coupling to both different G-proteins and types of adenylylcyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1480480728,"A highly specific proteinase, converting dynorphin A (1-17) to enkephalins, was isolated from the human spinal cord and subjected to further characterization. The enzyme was found to be a thiol-dependent protein with a relative molecular mass of 50 kDa and a pH optimum between 5.0 and 5.5. This proteinase appears to exclusively convert dynorphin A (1-17) to Leu-enkephalin and its COOH-terminal extensions Leu-enkephalin-Arg6 (which was a major conversion product) and Leu-enkephalin-Arg6-Arg7 but not the other prodynorphin- or proenkephalin-derived peptides. This high specificity toward a single structure is suggested to be involved in a distinct processing pathway associated with the generation of the opioid peptides with selectivity for delta-opioid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1603467189,"Most of the physiological actions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) may be attributed to activation of the natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) guanylyl cyclase. We report here that truncation of the NPR-A cytoplasmic domain results in increased expression of cell surface ANP binding sites. The truncated receptor exhibited a hyperbolic time course for ANP binding and had a high affinity for [125I]hANP, Kd = 8 pM. Cells expressing truncated NPR-A were used as an immunogen to obtain monoclonal antibodies against the native conformation of the extracellular domain. These antibodies were used to select for high levels of stable NPR-A expression in 293 cells, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linked [125I]ANP to 135-kDa NPR-A on intact cells. Monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled proteins revealed NPR-A size heterogeneity, with 135- and 125-kDa species. A synthetic peptide antibody directed against the extracellular domain immunoprecipitated 125-kDa NPR-A, but recognized both sizes of receptor by Western blotting. The 125-kDa NPR-A did not bind to or cross-link ANP. NPR-A size variants were expressed on the cell surface, and heterogeneity was removed by deglycosylation with protein:N-glycosidase F. Our results suggest that the degree of N-linked glycosylation of the NPR-A extracellular domain influences the ability to bind ANP."
https://openalex.org/W2165508577,"In an effort to explore the molecular basis for agonist-induced destabilization of beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA, we investigated the nature of RNA-binding proteins both in untreated and agonist-treated DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells. Messenger RNAs for the alpha 1b-, beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenergic receptors as well as for beta-globin were transcribed in vitro, incubated with cytosolic fractions, covalently cross-linked by short-wave UV light, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A prominent M(r) 35,000 radiolabeled protein(s) with the following characteristics was identified: (i) binds selectively to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNAs, both of which undergo agonist-induced down-regulation; (ii) does not bind to either alpha 1b-adrenergic receptor mRNA, which does not undergo agonist induced down-regulation, or to beta-globin mRNA; (iii) displays binding to beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA that is selectively competed by poly(U) RNA, but not poly(A), -(C), or -(G) RNA; and (iv) displays binding to receptor mRNA that can be competed by RNA harboring destabilizer sequences that are AU-rich and AUUUA pentamer-rich. The abundance of the M(r) 35,000 RNA-binding protein selective for beta-adrenergic receptor message, a factor we term beta ARB protein, varies inversely with the level of receptor mRNA, being induced by agonists that down-regulate receptor mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1519762830,"GTP cyclohydrolase I exhibits a positive homotropic cooperative binding to GTP, which raises the possibility of a role for GTP in regulating the enzyme reaction (Hatakeyama, K., Harada, T., Suzuki, S., Watanabe, Y., and Kagamiyama, H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21660-21664). We examined whether or not the intracellular GTP level is within the range of affecting GTP cyclohydrolase I activity, using PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma and IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells. Since GTP cyclohydrolase I was the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin in these cell lines, the intracellular activities of this enzyme were reflected in the tetrahydrobiopterin contents. We found that the addition of guanine or guanosine increased GTP but not tetrahydrobiopterin in these cells. On the other hand, three IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors, tiazofurin, 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole, and mycophenolic acid, decreased both GTP and tetrahydrobiopterin in a parallel and dose-dependent manner, and these effects were reversed by the simultaneous addition of guanine or guanosine. There was no evidence suggesting that these inhibitors inhibited other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin. Comparing intracellular activities of GTP cyclohydrolase I in the inhibitor-treated cells with its substrate-velocity curve, we estimated that the intracellular concentration of free GTP is 150 microM at which point the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I is elicited at its maximum velocity. Below this GTP concentration, GTP cyclohydrolase I activity is rapidly decreased. Therefore GTP can be a regulator for tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606380892,"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells deliver endogenous apical and basolateral proteins directly to the appropriate domains. We are investigating the molecular signals on a model plasma membrane hydrolase, dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV). Most newly synthesized rat liver DPPIV is delivered directly to the apical surface of transfected MDCK cells; however, about 20% is delivered first to the basolateral surface and reaches the apical surface via transcytosis (Casanova, J. E., Mishumi, Y., Ikehara, Y., Hubbard, A. L., and Mostov, K. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24428-24432). A soluble form of DPPIV (solDPPIV) containing only the lumenal domain of the protein was efficiently transported and secreted by stably transfected MDCK cells. If this domain contains apical sorting information, we would expect 80% of the soluble protein to be secreted apically. Surprisingly, 95% of the secreted solDPPIV was found in the apical medium. The high efficiency of apical secretion suggested that the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of DPPIV might contain competing basolateral targeting information. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the trafficking of a chimera in which the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domains of DPPIV were joined to lysozyme, an exogenous protein which should not contain sorting information. This protein was delivered predominantly to the basolateral surface. Our results suggest that the lumenal domain of DPPIV carries dominant apical sorting information while the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the molecule contains competing basolateral sorting information."
https://openalex.org/W1575516617,"When mouse 3T3-F442A preadipocyte fibroblasts reach confluence in the appropriate culture medium, their growth is arrested, and the cells undergo terminal differentiation to adipocytes. Two proteins that may be involved in this process are interferon and the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (DAI). In 3T3-F442A cells, interferon and DAI are transiently expressed with a maximum level of active kinase appearing at confluence. Interestingly, the level of active DAI was found to be low when cells were maintained under conditions nonpermissive for differentiation. This reduction in DAI was at least partly because of the presence of elevated levels of a specific inhibitor of DAI, termed dRF, which appeared to be a reversible inhibitor of the autophosphorylation (activation) of DAI. In the present study, the mechanism of action of dRF was investigated. Photocross-linking experiments indicated that dRF prevented the binding of ATP to DAI. Since the binding of ATP to DAI is dsRNA-dependent, we examined the effect of dRF on the binding of dsRNA to the kinase using RNA mobility shift assays. dRF was found to prevent the formation of DAI-dsRNA complexes without a direct effect on the dsRNA. This suggests that dRF exerts its effect through an interaction with DAI."
https://openalex.org/W1501493202,"To study the mechanism by which heme regulates the heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase (HRI), the effects of various protoporphyrin IX (PP) compounds on the kinase activities and intersubunit disulfide formation of HRI and on protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates were examined. Hemin and cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) are more effective than ZnPP, NiPP, SnPP, and metal-free PP in promoting intersubunit disulfide bond formation in HRI, in inhibiting the autokinase and eIF-2 alpha kinase activities of HRI, in inhibiting phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha in rabbit reticulocytes, in maintaining protein synthesis, and in reversing the inhibition of protein synthesis in heme deficiency. There is an apparent correlation of in vitro intersubunit disulfide formation of HRI and the regulation of HRI kinase activities and protein synthesis by these porphyrin compounds. HRI in the reticulocyte lysate can be cross-linked by 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (bis-NEM). The formation of bis-NEM cross-linked dimers in lysates is prevented completely by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) which alkylates free sulfhydryl groups and is diminished by hemin and CoPP. These results support the view that HRI in hemin-supplemented lysates is in equilibrium between the noncovalently linked dimer and the disulfide-linked dimer. The molecular size of HRI in control, hemin-supplemented, or NEM-treated hemin-supplemented lysates is identical to that of purified HRI; activation of HRI and changes in its thiol status do not significantly affect its molecular size."
https://openalex.org/W1533420624,"Recently, we amplified the Lactobacillus bulgaricus NAD(+)-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase gene by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned and overexpressed it in Escherichia coli (Kochhar, S., Chuard, N., and Hottinger, H. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 185, 705-712). Polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments may contain base changes resulting in mutant gene products. A comparison of specific activities of D-lactate dehydrogenase in the crude extracts of 50 recombinant clones indicated that one of the clones had drastically reduced enzyme activity. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the insert DNA showed an exchange of A to G at position 795 resulting in substitution of Glu264 to Gly in the D-lactate dehydrogenase. The purified mutant D-lactate dehydrogenase showed a shift of 2 units in its optimum pH toward the acidic range. The dependence of kcat/Km on the pH of the mutant enzyme showed that the pKa of the free enzyme was around 4, at least 2 pH units lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Both the wild-type and the mutant enzyme at their respective optimum pH values showed similar kcat and Km values. The data suggest that the highly conserved Glu264 is not critical for enzyme catalysis, but it must be situated within hydrogen bonding distance to amino acid residue(s) involved in substrate binding as well as in catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1588455918,"We have used a strain of rat (Fischer 344) lacking brush border membrane dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity to examine its effect on the intestinal assimilation of prolyl peptides. In addition, we have examined the biochemical basis for the enzyme deficiency. An analysis of several brush border membrane hydrolases in different regions of the small intestine demonstrates that these rats lack only dipeptidyl peptidase IV. They also have a greatly reduced ability to hydrolyze and absorb in vivo peptides of the NH2-X-Pro-Y type which are known substrates for the enzyme. Immunoblot analysis with polyclonal and monoclonal antibody indicates that the animals lack an identifiable dipeptidyl peptidase IV protein in intestinal epithelial cells. Levels and types of dipeptidyl peptidase IV mRNA were analyzed in several tissues and found to be similar to that of control animals. Biosynthetic labeling of intestinal explants revealed that two distinct forms (102 and 108 kDa) of dipeptidyl peptidase IV are initially synthesized by deficient rats, in contrast to the single protein (106 kDa) observed in normal animals. Pulse-chase labeling experiments (+/- endoglycosidase H) show that these two altered forms of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, although initially glycosylated with N-linked high mannose carbohydrate, fail to be processed to the mature complex glycosylated form and undergo intracellular degradation."

https://openalex.org/W1533722989,"The neu proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (p185) that is closely related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. It has been proposed that receptor tyrosine kinases are activated through oligomerization. Because this clustering model predicts that oligomerization of receptors is sufficient to activate them, we determined if p185 can be activated by introducing an extra cysteine proximal to the transmembrane domain. This should induce inter-receptor disulfide bonding and, according to the clustering model, activate the receptor. This amino acid substitution enhanced recovery of both normal and transforming neu proteins as dimers, with normal p185 recovered predominantly as monomers and transforming p185* as dimers. However, the cysteine substitution did not affect the transforming activity of the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1535821456,"We have examined the expression in Escherichia coli of genes encoding a plant chloroplast molecular chaperone, chaperonin-60. Purified plant chaperonin-60 is distinct in that it contains two polypeptides, p60cpn-60 alpha and p60cpn-60 beta, which have divergent amino acid sequences (Hemmingsen, S. M., and Ellis, R. J. (1986) Plant Physiol. 80, 269-276; Martel, R., Cloney, L. P., Pelcher, L. E., and Hemmingsen, S. M. (1990) Gene (Amst.) 94, 181-187). The precise polypeptide composition(s) of the active tetradecameric specie(s) (cpn60(14)) has not been determined. Genes encoding the mature forms of the Brassica napus chaperonin polypeptides have been expressed separately and in combination in E. coli to produce three novel strains: alpha, beta, and alpha beta. The plant cpn60 polypeptides accumulated in soluble forms and to similar high levels in each. There was no conclusive evidence that p60cpn-60 alpha assembled into cpn60(14) species in alpha cells. In beta and alpha beta cells, the plant gene products assembled efficiently into cpn60(14) species. Thus, the assembly of p60cpn-60 alpha required the presence of p60cpn-60 beta, whereas the assembly of p60cpn-60 beta could occur in the absence of p60cpn-60 alpha. Significant proportions of the endogenous groEL polypeptides were not assembled into tetradecameric groEL14 in beta and alpha beta cells. Analysis of the tetradecameric species that did form indicated the presence of novel hybrid cpn6014 species that contained both plant and bacterial cpn60 polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1520631316,"Brassica napus chaperonin-60 alpha and chaperonin-60 beta genes expressed separately and in combination produce three novel Escherichia coli strains: alpha, beta, and alpha beta. In beta and alpha beta cells, the plant gene products assemble efficiently into tetradecameric cpn60(14) species, including novel hybrids containing both bacterial and plant gene products. The levels of authentic groEL14 are reduced in these cells (Cloney, L. P., Wu, H. B., and Hemmingsen, S. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23327-23332). The assembly of cyanobacterial ribulose-P2 carboxylase (rubisco) in E. coli requires the activities of the endogenous chaperonin proteins. Furthermore, the extent to which assembly occurs is limited by the normal levels of expression of the groE operon (Goloubinoff, P., Gatenby, A. A., and Lorimer, G. H. (1989) Nature 337, 44-47). We have now monitored the accumulation of cyanobacterial rubisco in E. coli alpha, beta, and alpha beta cells to assess the activity of the plant cpn60 gene products and effects on endogenous chaperonin functions. Expression of cpn-60 alpha alone did not enhance rubisco assembly, which is consistent with our previous observation that p60cpn-60 alpha required the presence of p60cpn-60 beta for assembly into cpn60(14) species. In contrast, expression of cpn-60 beta alone resulted in markedly enhanced rubisco assembly in cells that accumulated normal levels of both endogenous chaperonin polypeptides (groEL and groES). This demonstrates that assembled p60cpn-60 beta is functional as a chaperonin in E. coli. Co-expression of cpn-60 alpha and cpn-60 beta in cells with normal levels of expression of groES and groEL suppressed rubisco assembly. Increased expression of groES in cells in which cpn-60 alpha and cpn-60 beta were co-expressed relieved this suppression and resulted in enhanced rubisco assembly. Implications with respect to dependence of chloroplast cpn60 function on cpn10 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1491551316,"In Escherichia coli cells expressing 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase (6-HDNO), a flavoprotein with covalently bound FAD, approximately 40% of the polypeptide is in its apoform. We investigated whether in vivo holoenzyme formation was influenced by the association of the apoenzyme with cellular chaperones. Immunoprecipitation of apoenzyme-containing cell extract with protein-A-Sepharose-bound 6-HDNO- or GroEL-specific antibodies failed to reveal the formation of complexes between these proteins. The limiting factor in holoenzyme formation in vivo appeared to be the intracellular supply of phosphorylated tricarbon compounds (e.g. glycerol-3-P) acting as allosteric effectors in the flavinylation reaction. When holoenzyme formation from purified apo6-HDNO was investigated in vitro, addition of GroEL and GroES to the reaction assays increased the yield of holoenzyme formation. The observed increase in apoenzyme to holoenzyme transition was ATP independent, and the effect of GroE could be simulated by high concentrations of glycerol (40%). Apparently, a nonspecific protein-protein interaction between the GroE proteins and the apo6-HDNO favored holoenzyme formation. The refolding of guanidinium hydrochloride-unfolded holoenzyme, however, was catalyzed by GroEL and GroES in an ATP-dependent reaction. Recovery of the native, enzymatically active, conformation ranged from 30 to 40%. When apo6-HDNO was denatured and refolded, the same dependence on GroE and ATP was observed in the recovery of a conformation able to incorporate FAD and to holoenzyme. [14C] FAD in the refolding assay yielded radioactively labeled 6-HDNO demonstrating the autocatalytical covalent incorporation of FAD into the polypeptide during the folding process."
https://openalex.org/W1522603082,"Two closely related but functionally distinct P-glycoprotein isoforms are encoded by the murine multidrug-resistance genes mdr1a and mdr1b. In a series of independently selected multidrug-resistant (MDR) J774.2 cell lines, mdr gene amplification and/or overexpression and overproduction of either the mdr1a or mdr1b products, or both gene products, correlates with the MDR phenotype. To investigate the possibility that mutations in the promoter regions of the mdr1a or mdr1b genes could influence their differential expression, mdr promoter-specific probes were used to detect and map potential structural alterations. An unusual structural rearrangement was found in the 5'-region of the amplified mdr1a allele in J7.T1, a cell line selected with taxol. To characterize this rearrangement, the regulatory regions of the mdr1a and mdr1b genes were analyzed. Whereas no gross structural alterations were detected by Southern blot hybridization using the mdr1b promoter probe, a novel amplified EcoRI fragment was detected by the mdr1a promoter probe. To determine the precise nature of this mutation, an mdr1a 5'-genomic clone was isolated from J7.T1 cells. Sequence analysis revealed an unusual DNA rearrangement consisting of the mdr1b gene, from its fourth intron toward its 3'-end, upstream of an intact mdr1a promoter on the amplified allele. We propose that this event occurred by an unequal sister chromatid exchange that was mediated by LINE-1 repetitive elements."
https://openalex.org/W1533787993,"The adenovirus E1a protein (E1A) regulates transcription through interaction with transcription factors bound to DNA, like cAMP response element BP1/ATF2, or through dissociating E2F transcription factor complex. However, it was also reported that E1A can bind to DNA (Chatterjee, P. K., Bruner, M., Flint, S. J., and Harter, M. L. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 835-841), and it is not clear whether DNA binding of E1A is involved in a part of the process of transcriptional regulation by E1A. In this paper, the small region of E1A that is responsible for DNA binding was identified and a point mutant lacking DNA binding activity was constructed. Analysis of deletion mutants of E1A proteins expressed in bacteria showed that a basic region between amino acids 201 and 216 of E1A is essential for DNA binding. Point mutation of arginines at amino acid numbers 205 and 206 to aspartic acids completely abolished the DNA binding activity of E1A. Using this mutant, the requirement of the E1A DNA binding for E1A-dependent transcriptional regulation was examined. trans-Activation of the adenovirus E4 promoter and trans-repression of the human c-erbB-2 promoter by this point mutant were examined by cotransfection experiments. Mutations of the E1A DNA-binding domain affected neither the E1A-induced trans-activation nor trans-repression at all. These results give complete proof that the DNA binding activity of E1A is not required for transcriptional regulation by E1A."

https://openalex.org/W1583650674,"The in vivo observation that the expression of bacteriophage T7 gene 3.5 (T7 lysozyme) inactivates T7 class II transcription and the in vitro observation that T7 lysozyme inhibits T7 RNA polymerase lead to the hypothesis that T7 lysozyme might preferentially inhibit transcription from T7 class II promoters. T7 lysozyme was cloned into a lambda pL expression vector, overproduced in Escherichia coli, and purified. The ability of purified T7 lysozyme to inhibit transcription from T7 DNA, the cloned T7 class II promoters, phi 2.5 and phi 4.7, and the cloned class III promoter, phi 10, was measured in vitro. It was observed that the effectiveness of T7 lysozyme as an inhibitor of T7 RNA polymerase is inversely related to the concentration of Mg2+; T7 lysozyme inhibits T7 RNA polymerase most effectively at low Mg2+ concentrations. In addition, no preferential inhibition of transcription from cloned T7 class II promoters was observed, nor was a strong T7 class III promoter preferred when transcriptional capacity was reduced by T7 lysozyme. These observations contradict the hypotheses that the temporal control of T7 gene expression is either due to direct and selective inhibition of the T7 class II promoters by T7 lysozyme or to preferential transcription of the strong T7 class III promoters when transcriptional capacity is reduced by T7 lysozyme. It appears that alternative mechanisms such as the involvement of additional proteins and/or cellular conditions to enhance transcription from T7 class III promoters or to inhibit transcription from T7 class II promoter are necessary to explain the temporal control of transcription of bacteriophage T7."

https://openalex.org/W4300825321,"A genetic linkage map of the human genome was constructed that consists of 1416 loci, including 279 genes and expressed sequences. The loci are represented by 1676 polymorphic systems genotyped with the CEPH reference pedigree resource. A total of 339 microsatellite repeat markers assayed by PCR are contained within the map, and of the 351 markers with heterozygosities of at least 70%, 205 are microsatellites. Seven telomere loci define physical and genetic endpoints for 2q, 4p, 7q, 8p, 14q, 16p, and 16q, and in other cases distal markers on the maps have been localized to terminal cytogenetic bands. Therefore, at least 92% of the autosomal length of the genome and 95% of the X chromosome is estimated to be spanned by the map. Since the maps have relatively high marker density and numerous highly informative loci, they can be used to map disease phenotypes, even for those with limited pedigree resources. The baseline map provides a foundation for achieving continuity of clone-based physical maps and for the development of a truly integrated physical, genetic, and cytogenetic map of the human."
