https://openalex.org/W3108215075,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education and healthcare systems worldwide. The disease can cause life-threatening conditions and it presents challenges for medical education, as instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience. These measures could then be followed by hands-on experience that is provided in a safe environment."
https://openalex.org/W3110395203,"Genetic diversity is key to crop improvement. Owing to pervasive genomic structural variation, a single reference genome assembly cannot capture the full complement of sequence diversity of a crop species (known as the 'pan-genome'1). Multiple high-quality sequence assemblies are an indispensable component of a pan-genome infrastructure. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important cereal crop with a long history of cultivation that is adapted to a wide range of agro-climatic conditions2. Here we report the construction of chromosome-scale sequence assemblies for the genotypes of 20 varieties of barley-comprising landraces, cultivars and a wild barley-that were selected as representatives of global barley diversity. We catalogued genomic presence/absence variants and explored the use of structural variants for quantitative genetic analysis through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 300 gene bank accessions. We discovered abundant large inversion polymorphisms and analysed in detail two inversions that are frequently found in current elite barley germplasm; one is probably the product of mutation breeding and the other is tightly linked to a locus that is involved in the expansion of geographical range. This first-generation barley pan-genome makes previously hidden genetic variation accessible to genetic studies and breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3110287817,"The distal lung contains terminal bronchioles and alveoli that facilitate gas exchange. Three-dimensional in vitro human distal lung culture systems would strongly facilitate the investigation of pathologies such as interstitial lung disease, cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we describe the development of a long-term feeder-free, chemically defined culture system for distal lung progenitors as organoids derived from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids were able to differentiate into AT1 cells, and basal cell organoids developed lumens lined with differentiated club and ciliated cells. Single-cell analysis of KRT5+ cells in basal organoids revealed a distinct population of ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic cells, whose offspring further segregated into a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction that comprised about ten per cent of KRT5+ basal cells. This subpopulation formed clusters within terminal bronchioles and exhibited enriched clonogenic organoid growth activity. We created distal lung organoids with apical-out polarity to present ACE2 on the exposed external surface, facilitating infection of AT2 and basal cultures with SARS-CoV-2 and identifying club cells as a target population. This long-term, feeder-free culture of human distal lung organoids, coupled with single-cell analysis, identifies functional heterogeneity among basal cells and establishes a facile in vitro organoid model of human distal lung infections, including COVID-19-associated pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3108567773,"The liver connects the intestinal portal vasculature with the general circulation, using a diverse array of immune cells to protect from pathogens that translocate from the gut1. In liver lobules, blood flows from portal triads that are situated in periportal lobular regions to the central vein via a polarized sinusoidal network. Despite this asymmetry, resident immune cells in the liver are considered to be broadly dispersed across the lobule. This differs from lymphoid organs, in which immune cells adopt spatially biased positions to promote effective host defence2,3. Here we used quantitative multiplex imaging, genetic perturbations, transcriptomics, infection-based assays and mathematical modelling to reassess the relationship between the localization of immune cells in the liver and host protection. We found that myeloid and lymphoid resident immune cells concentrate around periportal regions. This asymmetric localization was not developmentally controlled, but resulted from sustained MYD88-dependent signalling induced by commensal bacteria in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which in turn regulated the composition of the pericellular matrix involved in the formation of chemokine gradients. In vivo experiments and modelling showed that this immune spatial polarization was more efficient than a uniform distribution in protecting against systemic bacterial dissemination. Together, these data reveal that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells sense the microbiome, actively orchestrating the localization of immune cells, to optimize host defence."
https://openalex.org/W3107908899,"To identify the molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD), we performed an integrative network analysis of multi-omics profiling of four cortical areas across 364 donors with varying cognitive and neuropathological phenotypes. Our analyses revealed thousands of molecular changes and uncovered neuronal gene subnetworks as the most dysregulated in LOAD. ATP6V1A was identified as a key regulator of a top-ranked neuronal subnetwork, and its role in disease-related processes was evaluated through CRISPR-based manipulation in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and RNAi-based knockdown in Drosophila models. Neuronal impairment and neurodegeneration caused by ATP6V1A deficit were improved by a repositioned compound, NCH-51. This study provides not only a global landscape but also detailed signaling circuits of complex molecular interactions in key brain regions affected by LOAD, and the resulting network models will serve as a blueprint for developing next-generation therapeutic agents against LOAD."
https://openalex.org/W3108107032,"Janus kinases (JAKs) mediate responses to cytokines, hormones and growth factors in haematopoietic cells1,2. The JAK gene JAK2 is frequently mutated in the ageing haematopoietic system3,4 and in haematopoietic cancers5. JAK2 mutations constitutively activate downstream signalling and are drivers of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). In clinical use, JAK inhibitors have mixed effects on the overall disease burden of JAK2-mutated clones6,7, prompting us to investigate the mechanism underlying disease persistence. Here, by in-depth phosphoproteome profiling, we identify proteins involved in mRNA processing as targets of mutant JAK2. We found that inactivation of YBX1, a post-translationally modified target of JAK2, sensitizes cells that persist despite treatment with JAK inhibitors to apoptosis and results in RNA mis-splicing, enrichment for retained introns and disruption of the transcriptional control of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling. In combination with pharmacological JAK inhibition, YBX1 inactivation induces apoptosis in JAK2-dependent mouse and primary human cells, causing regression of the malignant clones in vivo, and inducing molecular remission. This identifies and validates a cell-intrinsic mechanism whereby differential protein phosphorylation causes splicing-dependent alterations of JAK2–ERK signalling and the maintenance of JAK2V617F malignant clones. Therapeutic targeting of YBX1-dependent ERK signalling in combination with JAK2 inhibition could thus eradicate cells harbouring mutations in JAK2. Inhibition of YBX1, a downstream target of the Janus kinase JAK2, sensitizes myeloproliferative neoplasm cells to JAK and could provide a means to eradicate such cells in human haematopoietic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3108485699,"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been widely used in the study of human disease and development, and about 70% of the protein-coding genes are conserved between the two species1. However, studies in zebrafish remain constrained by the sparse annotation of functional control elements in the zebrafish genome. Here we performed RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments in up to eleven adult and two embryonic tissues to generate a comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin, methylomes and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish Tübingen reference strain. A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types. By combining long-read DNA sequencing and Hi-C, we assembled the sex-determining chromosome 4 de novo. Overall, our work provides an additional epigenomic anchor for the functional annotation of vertebrate genomes and the study of evolutionarily conserved elements of 3D genome organization. A comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin structure, the methylome and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) enables identification of species-specific and evolutionarily conserved regulatory features, and provides a foundation for modelling studies on human disease and development."
https://openalex.org/W3106750870,"Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands (radioactively labelled tracer compounds) are extremely useful for in vivo characterization of central nervous system drug candidates, neurodegenerative diseases and numerous oncology targets1. Both tritium and carbon-11 radioisotopologues are generally necessary for in vitro and in vivo characterization of radioligands2, yet there exist few radiolabelling protocols for the synthesis of either, inhibiting the development of PET radioligands. The synthesis of such radioligands also needs to be very rapid owing to the short half-life of carbon-11. Here we report a versatile and rapid metallaphotoredox-catalysed method for late-stage installation of both tritium and carbon-11 into the desired compounds via methylation of pharmaceutical precursors bearing aryl and alkyl bromides. Methyl groups are among the most prevalent structural elements found in bioactive molecules, and so this synthetic approach simplifies the discovery of radioligands. To demonstrate the breadth of applicability of this technique, we perform rapid synthesis of 20 tritiated and 10 carbon-11-labelled complex pharmaceuticals and PET radioligands, including a one-step radiosynthesis of the clinically used compounds [11C]UCB-J and [11C]PHNO. We further outline the direct utility of this protocol for preclinical PET imaging and its translation to automated radiosynthesis for routine radiotracer production in human clinical imaging. We also demonstrate this protocol for the installation of other diverse and pharmaceutically useful isotopes, including carbon-14, carbon-13 and deuterium."
https://openalex.org/W3108685405,"Choosing a mate is one of the most consequential decisions a female will make during her lifetime. A female fly signals her willingness to mate by opening her vaginal plates, allowing a courting male to copulate1,2. Vaginal plate opening (VPO) occurs in response to the male courtship song and is dependent on the mating status of the female. How these exteroceptive (song) and interoceptive (mating status) inputs are integrated to regulate VPO remains unknown. Here we characterize the neural circuitry that implements mating decisions in the brain of female Drosophila melanogaster. We show that VPO is controlled by a pair of female-specific descending neurons (vpoDNs). The vpoDNs receive excitatory input from auditory neurons (vpoENs), which are tuned to specific features of the D. melanogaster song, and from pC1 neurons, which encode the mating status of the female3,4. The song responses of vpoDNs, but not vpoENs, are attenuated upon mating, accounting for the reduced receptivity of mated females. This modulation is mediated by pC1 neurons. The vpoDNs thus directly integrate the external and internal signals that control the mating decisions of Drosophila females. In Drosophila melanogaster, female mating decisions are governed by female-specific descending neurons that integrate input from auditory neurons that respond to features of the song of a conspecific male and central neurons that encode the mating status of the female."
https://openalex.org/W3109939438,"In mammals, telomere protection is mediated by the essential protein TRF2, which binds chromosome ends and ensures genome integrity1,2. TRF2 depletion results in end-to-end chromosome fusions in all cell types that have been tested so far. Here we find that TRF2 is dispensable for the proliferation and survival of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Trf2−/− (also known as Terf2) ES cells do not exhibit telomere fusions and can be expanded indefinitely. In response to the deletion of TRF2, ES cells exhibit a muted DNA damage response that is characterized by the recruitment of γH2AX—but not 53BP1—to telomeres. To define the mechanisms that control this unique DNA damage response in ES cells, we performed a CRISPR–Cas9-knockout screen. We found a strong dependency of TRF2-null ES cells on the telomere-associated protein POT1B and on the chromatin remodelling factor BRD2. Co-depletion of POT1B or BRD2 with TRF2 restores a canonical DNA damage response at telomeres, resulting in frequent telomere fusions. We found that TRF2 depletion in ES cells activates a totipotent-like two-cell-stage transcriptional program that includes high levels of ZSCAN4. We show that the upregulation of ZSCAN4 contributes to telomere protection in the absence of TRF2. Together, our results uncover a unique response to telomere deprotection during early development. Depletion of TRF2—an essential mediator of telomere protection in most mammalian cells—in mouse embryonic stem cells activates a compensatory transcriptional program that renders TRF2 dispensable for their survival and proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W3110421531,"Hyposalivation is an important problem in elders and could interfere with several oral functions and microbial ecology. While the number of independent elders who retain more natural teeth increases worldwide, few studies examined hyposalivation in this population. Thus, this study aims to examine relationships between hyposalivation, oral health conditions and oral Candida colonization in independent dentate elders and evaluate factors associated with salivary flow and Candida carriage. We conducted a cross-sectional study in fifty-three dentate elders (≥65 years old with at least 4 pairs of posterior occlusal contacts) with no, or well-controlled, systemic conditions. Participants were interviewed for medical history, subjective dry mouth symptoms, oral hygiene practices and denture information. Unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates, objective dry mouth signs, gingival, tongue-coating, and root-caries indices were recorded. Stimulated saliva was cultured on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for Candida counts. Candida species were identified using chromogenic Candida agar and polymerase chain reaction. Statistical significance level was set at p&lt;0 . 05 . The results showed that hyposalivation was associated with higher gingival and tongue-coating indices ( p = 0 . 003 and 0 . 015 , respectively), but not root-caries index. Hyposalivation was also associated with higher prevalence of oral Candida colonization ( p = 0 . 010; adjusted OR = 4.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.29–14.72). These two indices and Candida load were negatively correlated with unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates. Interestingly, non- albicans Candida species were more prevalent in denture wearers ( p = 0 . 017 ). Hence, hyposalivation is a risk factor for poorer oral health and oral Candida colonization in independent dentate elders. Because of its potential adverse effects on oral and systemic health, hyposalivation should be carefully monitored in elders."

https://openalex.org/W3108821813,"This study characterized the evolution of Brazilian public telemedicine policy in the Brazilian Unified Health System for 30 years from 1988 to 2019 by analyzing its legal framework. We identified 79 telemedicine-related legislations from the federal government (laws, decrees, and ordinances) and 31 regulations of federal councils of health professionals. Three historical phases were established according to the public policy cycle, and material was classified according to the purpose of the normative documents. The content analysis was based on the advocacy coalition framework model. Of the federal legislations, 8.9% were for the Formulation/Decision-Making phase, 43% for the Organization/Implementation phase, and 48.1% for the Expansion/Maturation phase of telemedicine policy in Brazil. The Federal Council of Medicine was the most active in standardizing telemedicine and was responsible for 21 (67.7%) regulations. The first legislations were passed in 2000; however, the coalitions discussed topics related to telemedicine and created their belief systems from the 1990’s. The time cycle which included formulation and decision making for Brazilian telemedicine policy, extended until 2007 with the creation of several technical working groups. The expansion and maturation of telemedicine services began in 2011 with the decentralization of telemedicine policy actions across the country. Telemedicine centers which performed telediagnosis influenced the computerization of primary health care units. We conclude that Brazilian telemedicine field has greatly grown and changed in recent years. However, despite the proliferation of legislations and regulations in the period studied, there is still no fully consolidated process for setting up a wholly defined regulatory framework for telemedicine in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W3109004748,"Purpose To investigate whether a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) program developed using the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) on neck US images can predict the BRAF V600E mutation in thyroid cancer. Methods 469 thyroid cancers in 469 patients were included in this retrospective study. A CAD program recently developed using the deep CNN provided risks of malignancy (0–100%) as well as binary results (cancer or not). Using the CAD program, we calculated the risk of malignancy based on a US image of each thyroid nodule (CAD value). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed including patient demographics, the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) categories and risks of malignancy calculated through CAD to identify independent predictive factors for the BRAF V600E mutation in thyroid cancer. The predictive power of the CAD value and final multivariable model for the BRAF V600E mutation in thyroid cancer were measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results In this study, 380 (81%) patients were positive and 89 (19%) patients were negative for the BRAF V600E mutation. On multivariate analysis, older age (OR = 1.025, p = 0.018), smaller size (OR = 0.963, p = 0.006), and higher CAD value (OR = 1.016, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. The CAD value yielded an AUC of 0.646 (95% CI: 0.576, 0.716) for predicting the BRAF V600E mutation, while the multivariable model yielded an AUC of 0.706 (95% CI: 0.576, 0.716). The multivariable model showed significantly better performance than the CAD value alone (p = 0.004). Conclusion Deep learning-based CAD for thyroid US can help us predict the BRAF V600E mutation in thyroid cancer. More multi-center studies with more cases are needed to further validate our study results."

https://openalex.org/W3108141831,"Malaria in the Amazon is often perceived as an exclusively rural disease, but transmission has been increasingly documented within and near urban centers. Here we explore patterns and causes of urban-to-rural mobility, which places travelers at risk of malaria in Mâncio Lima, the main malaria hotspot in northwestern Brazil. We also analyze rural-to-urban mobility caused by malaria treatment seeking, which poses an additional risk of infection to urban residents. We show that the rural localities most frequently visited by urban residents–typically farming settlements in the vicinity of the town–are those with the most intense malaria transmission and also the most frequent source localities of imported malaria cases diagnosed in the town. The most mobile urban residents are typically poor males 16 to 60-years old from multi-sited households who lack a formal job. Highly mobile residents represent a priority target for more intensive and effective malaria control interventions, that cannot be readily delivered to the entire community, in this and similar urbanized endemic settings across the Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W3107976627,"Background Thyroid hormone plays a pivotal role in human metabolism. In epidemiologic studies, adequate registration of thyroid disorders is warranted. We examined the prevalence of thyroid disorders, reported thyroid medication use, thyroid hormone levels, and validity of thyroid data obtained from questionnaires in the Lifelines Cohort Study. Methods We evaluated baseline data of all 152180 subjects (aged 18–93 years) of the Lifelines Cohort Study. At baseline, participants were asked about previous thyroid surgery and current and previous thyroid hormone use. At follow-up (n = 136776, after median 43 months), incident thyroid disorders could be reported in an open, non-structured question. Data on baseline thyroid hormone measurements (TSH, FT4 and FT3) were available in a subset of 39935 participants. Results Of the 152180 participants, mean (±SD) age was 44.6±13.1 years and 58.5% were female. Thyroid medication was used by 4790 participants (3.1%); the majority (98.2%) used levothyroxine, and 88% were females. 59.3% of levothyroxine users had normal TSH levels. The prevalence of abnormal TSH levels in those not using thyroid medication was 10.8%; 9.4% had a mildly elevated (4.01–10.0 mIU/L), 0.7% had suppressed (&lt;0.40 mIU/L), while 0.7% had elevated (&gt;10.0 mIU/L) TSH levels. Over 98% of subjects with TSH between 4 and 10 mIU/L had normal FT4. Open text questions allowing to report previous thyroid surgery and incident thyroid disorders proved not to be reliable and severely underestimated the true incidence and prevalence of thyroid disorders. Conclusions Undetected thyroid disorders were prevalent in the general population, whereas the prevalence of thyroid medication use was 3.1%. Less than 60% of individuals using levothyroxine had a normal TSH level. The large group of individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism (9.4%) offers an excellent possibility to prospectively follow the natural course of this disorder. Both structured questions as well as linking to G.P.’s and pharmacists’ data are necessary to improve the completeness and reliability of Lifelines’ data on thyroid disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3107245017,"There has been an increase in the usage of heat-not-burn (HNB) cigarette products. However, their effects on alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) remain unknown. AECs are the target cells of conventional cigarette smoking-related respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer whose pathogenesis involves oxidative stress. In this study, primary rat AECs were isolated, cultured and stimulated by HNB cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Our data indicate that rat AECs exposed to HNB CSE induced oxidative stress response genes (e.g. Hmox-1 , Gsta1 , Gsta3 and Nqo1 ). We also compared the oxidative stress response between two different types of AECs, alveolar type I-like (ATI-like) cells and type II (ATII) cells, and between two different types of cigarette, HNB cigarettes and conventional cigarettes. The expressions of Gsta1 , Gsta3 and Nqo1 were higher in ATII cells than ATI-like cells in response to HNB and conventional cigarettes, but there was no significant difference in their expression levels between HNB cigarette and conventional cigarette. Taken together, our results suggest that HNB cigarettes have the similar potential as conventional cigarette products to induce oxidative stress response in AECs."
https://openalex.org/W3108356175,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite curative surgical resection, high recurrence of HCC after surgery results in poor patient survival. To develop prognostic markers is therefore important for better prevention and therapy of recurrent HCC to improve patient outcomes. Deletion mutations over the pre-S1 and pre-S2 gene segments of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been closely associated with recurrence of HCC after curative surgical resection. In this study, we applied a next-generation sequencing-based approach to further evaluate the association of pre-S deletion regions with HCC recurrence. We demonstrated that the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) was the most predominant deletion regions of pre-S gene in plasma of HBV-related HCC patients. Moreover, patients with the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) exhibited a significantly higher risk of HCC recurrence after curative surgical resection than those without. The pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) in plasma represented a prognostic factor that independently predicted HCC recurrence with greater performance than other clinicopathological and viral factors. Our data suggest that detection of the pre-S2 deletion (nucleotide 1 to 54) in plasma may be a promising noninvasive strategy for identifying patients at high risk for HCC recurrence after curative surgical resection."
https://openalex.org/W3108607889,"The incidence of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in Asians is lower than that seen in Western populations, but there are few available data on the incidence and associated cardiac etiology of SCA in Asians. From 2002 to 2013, patients with SCA were analyzed using a cohort from the South Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) coded database. Sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS) was defined as cryptogenic arrest, excluding that of non-cardiac origin, coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy (CM), and valvular heart disease. During the 12-year study period, 5,973 patients (0.53%) from the total cohort of 1,125,691 had a cardiac arrest code. The overall incidence of arrest was 48.7 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 16.6–18.0). The incidence of primary SCA excluding those of non-cardiac origin was 16.1 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 15.4–16.8). It was higher in males than in females (18.1 vs. 14.1 per 100,000 person-years). CAD was the most common cause of SCA (59.4%), and followed by CM (13.9%). SUDS accounted for 14.7% of SCA events. The risk of SCA had increased gradually from over 25 years old. Heart failure, atrial fibrillation and hypertension are major factors associated with SCA incidence. Our findings outline epidemiologic data for SCA and the proportion of associated cardiac etiology leads SCA in a large population."
https://openalex.org/W3107174808,"Objectives This study aimed to: (1) Estimate HPV prevalence and genotype distribution among female sex workers (FSWs) in Mali and Benin as well as the prevalence of multiple HPV type infections in this group, and (2) Identify potential risk factors associated with high-risk (HR) HPV infections. Methods We analyzed baseline data of 665 FSWs aged ≥ 18 years recruited during a prospective cohort of cervical cancer screening in Cotonou (Benin) and Bamako (Mali) from 2017 to 2018. The Linear Array HPV genotyping test was used to identify HPV genotypes. Descriptive statistics and multivariate log-binomial regression were used. Adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated to identify risk factors associated with HR-HPV infections. Results HPV data were available for 659 FSWs (Benin: 309; Mali: 350). The mean age was 35.0 years (± 10.7) in Benin and 26.8 years (± 7.6) in Mali. The overall HPV prevalence rates were 95.5% in Benin and 81.4% in Mali. About 87.7% and 63.4% of FSWs harbored ≥ 2 HPV types in Benin and Mali, respectively. The top three prevalent HR-HPV among FSWs in Benin were: HPV58 (37.5%), HPV16 (36.6%) and HPV52 (28.8%). Corresponding patterns in Mali were HPV16 (15.7%), HPV51 (14.3%) and HPV52 (12.9%). In Benin, the main factors associated with HR-HPV were vaginal douching (APR = 1.17; 95%CI:1.02–1.34) and gonococcal infection (APR = 1.16; 95%CI:1.04–1.28), while in Mali they were sex work duration ≤ 1 year (APR = 1.35; 95%CI:1.10–1.65) and HIV infection (APR = 1.26; 95%CI: 1.06–1.51). Conclusion Our study found a very high prevalence of HPV infection as well as high frequency of multiple HPV type infections in FSWs in two countries in West Africa. These findings suggest the necessity to emphasize cervical cancer prevention in this high-risk group."
https://openalex.org/W3109043949,"Linking phenotypes to specific gene expression profiles is an extremely important problem in biology, which has been approached mainly by correlation methods or, more fundamentally, by studying the effects of gene perturbations. However, genome-wide perturbations involve extensive experimental efforts, which may be prohibitive for certain organisms. On the other hand, the characterization of the various phenotypes frequently requires an expert’s subjective interpretation, such as a histopathologist’s description of tissue slide images in terms of complex visual features (e.g. ‘acinar structures’). In this paper, we use Deep Learning to eliminate the inherent subjective nature of these visual histological features and link them to genomic data, thus establishing a more precisely quantifiable correlation between transcriptomes and phenotypes. Using a dataset of whole slide images with matching gene expression data from 39 normal tissue types, we first developed a Deep Learning tissue classifier with an accuracy of 94%. Then we searched for genes whose expression correlates with features inferred by the classifier and demonstrate that Deep Learning can automatically derive visual (phenotypical) features that are well correlated with the transcriptome and therefore biologically interpretable . As we are particularly concerned with interpretability and explainability of the inferred histological models, we also develop visualizations of the inferred features and compare them with gene expression patterns determined by immunohistochemistry. This can be viewed as a first step toward bridging the gap between the level of genes and the cellular organization of tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3108692153,"Background Mitochondria support critical cellular functions, such as energy production through oxidative phosphorylation, regulation of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and calcium homeostasis. Objective Given the heightened level of cellular activity in patients with asthma, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number measured in peripheral blood differed between individuals with and without asthma. Methods Whole genome sequence data was generated as part of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program on participants from the Study of Asthma Phenotypes and Pharmacogenomic Interactions by Race-ethnicity (SAPPHIRE) and the Study of African Americans, Asthma, Genes, &amp; Environment II (SAGE II). We restricted our analysis to individuals who self-identified as African American (3,651 asthma cases and 1,344 controls). Mitochondrial copy number was estimated using the sequencing read depth ratio for the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Respiratory complex expression was assessed using RNA-sequencing. Results Average mitochondrial copy number was significantly higher among individuals with asthma when compared with controls (SAPPHIRE: 218.60 vs. 200.47, P&lt;0.001; SAGE II: 235.99 vs. 223.07, P&lt;0.001). Asthma status was significantly associated with mitochondrial copy number after accounting for potential explanatory variables, such as participant age, sex, leukocyte counts, and mitochondrial haplogroup. Despite the consistent relationship between asthma status and mitochondrial copy number, the latter was not associated with time-to-exacerbation or patient-reported asthma control. Mitochondrial respiratory complex gene expression was disproportionately lower in individuals with asthma when compared with individuals without asthma and other protein-encoding genes. Conclusions We observed a robust association between asthma and higher mitochondrial copy number. Asthma having an effect on mitochondria function was also supported by lower respiratory complex gene expression in this group."
https://openalex.org/W3110325063,"Previous studies have indicated that older men often experience disconnection from the community after retirement. Social activities have been shown to be effective in preventing social isolation among older urban men. Nevertheless, it has been reported that they often do not participate in community social activities and tend to be reluctant to do so. We explored the values and meanings of social activities for retired older men living in an urban area of Japan to understand support using social activities that are more suitable for them. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 older men (aged 68–80 years; M = 74.6 ± 3.79 years) about their interactions with family and non-family members, and their participation in various community social activities. The grounded theory approach was used for the analysis. As a result, the following five categories were derived as the values that participants place on the social activities that they engage in: “health as a resource and reward for social activities,” “feeling I am still useful,” “feeling that something is my responsibility,” “feeling of time well spent,” and “finding interest through interactions.” In addition, the following three categories were extracted as meanings of social activities: “fulfilling social life,” “maintaining stable family relationships,” and “maintaining safety and peace in the community.” When considering the social activities that older urban retired men are interested in and likely to participate in, these five values can be considered indicators. In contrast, to maintain stable family relationships and safety and peace in the community, participants sometimes used strategies to stop or abandon social activities. Therefore, in situations where a peaceful life within a family or neighborhood is threatened, it may be useful to help set aside sufficient time and allow for psychological leeway in advance to incorporate social activities into their lives."
https://openalex.org/W3106976033,"In many Western societies there are rising concerns about increasing polarization in public debate. However, statistics on private attitudes paint a different picture: the average attitudes in societies are more moderate and remain rather stable over time. The present paper presents an agent-based model of how such discrepancies between public opinion and private attitudes develop at the scale of micro-societies. Based on social psychological theorizing, the model distinguishes between two types of agents: a) those seeking to gain or maintain a good reputation and status, and b) those seeking to promote group harmony by reaching consensus. We characterized these different types of agents by different decision rules for either voicing their opinion or remaining silent, based on the behavior of their proximal network. Results of the model simulations show that even when the private attitudes of the agents are held constant, publicly expressed opinions can oscillate and (depending on the reputational concerns of individual actors) situations can occur in which minorities as well as majorities are silenced. We conclude that the macro-level consequences of micro-level decisions to either voice an opinion or remain silent provide a foundation for better understanding how public opinions are shaped. Moreover, we discuss the conditions under which public opinion could be considered a good representation of private attitudes in a society."
https://openalex.org/W3107074671,"Introduction Data on the sexual behavior among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) dwelling at HIV prevalent setting located at the periphery of Ethiopia is lacking. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate sexual practice of patients following their antiretroviral therapy (ART) service and factors affecting their behavior. Materials and methods A facility based cross-sectional study design was employed to assess risky sexual practice and associated factors among HIV positive adults attending ART clinics in Gambella town, Southwest Ethiopia. Risky sexual practice is defined as a custom of getting in at least one of the following practices such as condom-unprotected sex with any partner, having two or more sexual partners and practicing casual sex in the last three months. A total of 352 randomly selected clients were interviewed by using a structured questionnaire. The multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the association between covariates and the outcome variable. Results Majority of the study participants were engaged at least in one of the risky sexual practices (79.8% confidence interval (CI): 75.3% - 83.9%). The multivariable analysis found that the odds of risky sexual practice were higher among individuals who use substances (‘khat’ users (AOR: 3.82, 95%CI:1.30–11.22), smoke cigarette (AOR:4.90, 95%CI:1.19–12.60), consume alcohol (AOR: 2.59, 95%CI:1.28–5.21)); those who never discuss about safe sex with their partner/s (AOR: 2.21, 95%CI:1.16–4.21); those who have been in attachment for longer duration (more than four years) with their partner (AOR: 3.56, 95%CI: 1.32–9.62); and groups who desire to bear children in their future life (AOR: 3.15, 95%CI:1.40–7.04) as compared to their respective comparison groups. Conclusions A significant number of participants were engaged at least in one of the risky sexual practices which potentially result in super infection by a new or/and drug resistant viral strain/s, and onward transmission of the virus. Thus, an HIV intervention program which focuses on the identified factors has to be implemented to mitigate risk of unsafe sexual behavior of this population group and move towards ending the HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic."

In this study we evaluate the capacity of GlcCer in inducing resistance in N . tabacum cv Xanthi plants against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Spraying tobacco plants with GlcCer before virus infection reduced the incidence of necrotic lesions caused by TMV. In addition, plants already infected with the virus showed a reduction in hypersensitive response (HR) lesions after GlcCer treatment, suggesting an antiviral effect of GlcCer. Our investigations showed that GlcCer stimulates the early accumulation of H 2 O 2 and superoxide radicals. In addition, the expression of PR-1 (pathogenesis-related 1, with suggested antifungal action), PR-2 (β-1,3-glucanase), PR-3 (Chitinase), PR-5 (Osmotin), PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), LOX (Lipoxygenase) and POX (Peroxidase) genes was highly induced after treatment of tobacco plants with GlcCer and induction levels remained high throughout a period of 6 to 120 hours.

In the presence of α-FAD, we observed that NADH transferred a hydride to β-FAD at a rate of 920 s−1, yielding the charge–transfer complex NAD+:β-FADH− with an absorbance maximum at 650 nm. β-FADH− bifurcated one electron to α-FAD and the other electron to α-FAD of a second EtfAB molecule, forming two stable α-FAD•−. With α-FAD•−, the reduction of β-FAD with NADH was 1500 times slower. Reduction of β-FAD in the presence of α-FAD displayed a normal kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 2.1, whereas the KIE was inverted in the presence of α-FAD•−.

Nature uses the high energy electron to establish ion gradients for energy conservation or to conduct difficult reductions such as nitrogen fixation or synthesis of molecular hydrogen. In the so-called flavin-based electron bifurcation, the reductant NAD(P)H reduces FAD to the hydroquinone state (HQ, FADH−), which bifurcates one electron to an acceptor with a higher reduction potential, such as crotonyl-CoA, heterodisulfide, menaquinone, or benzoquinone, and the other to ferredoxin (Fd) or flavodoxin (Fld), which have reduction potentials between −390 and −420 mV (6Buckel W.

Recently, we measured the reduction potentials of a bifurcating system composed of electron transfer flavoprotein (electron transfer flavoprotein containing α-FAD bound on A- and β-FAD bound on B-subunit [EtfAB]) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd); both proteins are from the anaerobic gut bacterium Acidaminococcus fermentans (7Chowdhury N.P.

In contrast to Etfs involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, which only contains α-FAD that can stabilize an anionic semiquinone (ASQ), the A. fermentans EtfAB harbors an additional bifurcating β-FAD which is bound to the B-subunit. We propose that NADH (E°′ = −320 mV) reduces β-FAD (E°′ = −271 mV) by transferring a hydride to generate β-FADH˗, which bifurcates one electron energetically uphill from its ASQ/HQ potential of +172 mV to α-FAD•−(E°′ = −36 mV) and the other electron downhill from its Q/ASQ potential of −714 mV to Fd (E°′ = −390 mV). The formed α-FADH− on the rotatable domain II of Etf makes a turn by 90° and encounters δ-FAD of Bcd (10Demmer J.K. Chowdhury N.P. Selmer T. Ermler U. Buckel W. The semiquinone swing in the bifurcating electron transferring flavoprotein/butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase complex from Clostridium difficile.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereby its reduction potentials change to a two-electron potential of E°′ = −228 mV, almost the same as that of β-FAD, which allows a smooth further one-electron transfer to δ-FAD to generate δ-FAD•− (E°′ = +162 mV). The electron derived from the next bifurcation round reduces δ-FAD•− further to δ-FADH⁻ (E°′ = −63 mV). The formed δ-FADH⁻ changes its reduction potentials to the two-electron potential of −100 mV and reduces crotonyl-CoA by hydride transfer to butyryl-CoA (E°′ = −10 mV) (11Sucharitakul J. Buttranon S.

To get insight into the mechanism of the electron bifurcation, stopped-flow kinetics were applied. However, the complete reaction turned out to be much too fast for this method. The red anionic semiquinone of α-FAD occurred already before the dead time of the instrument (1 ms). Therefore, Fd and Bcd were omitted, and only the slower reduction of EtfAB with NADH was investigated. To get adjusted to the system, the experiments started with Etf containing only β-FAD (EtfaB), from which α-FAD was removed. The main part of this work consists of the reduction mechanism of EtfAB with NADH and (4R)[4-2H]NADH (NADD). Though still very fast, the rate constant of the first reduction of β-FAD with NADH could be determined, whereas the second reduction occurred 1500 times slower. The slow reduction was caused by the neighboring α-FAD when it was in the α-FAD•−-redox state. Interestingly, reduction of EtfAB by NADD exhibited a normal kinetic isotope effect (KIE), whereas in the presence of α-FAD•−, the KIE became inverse. The stoichiometric reduction of 45 μM EtfaB (containing 45 μM β-FADH but no α-FAD (11Sucharitakul J. Buttranon S. Wongnate T. Chowdhury N.P. Prongjit M. Buckel W. Chaiyen P.

About 40% of the reduction of EtfaB (from black line to the first red line, Fig. 1A) was fast and occurred before the dead time (∼0.002 s) of the stopped-flow machine (ΔA452 ∼0.20 at 0.002 s, Fig. 1B). The remaining oxidized EtfaB (60%) was reduced within 0.002 and 1.0 s (red lines, Fig. 1A and black line, Fig. 1B). The absorbance at 340 nm (red lines, Fig. 1A) was from residual NADH, which completely disappeared after 1 s. During 0.002 and 0.01 s, the absorbance at 750 nm increased (red line, Fig. 1B), probably because of formation of the β-FADH−:NAD+ charge–transfer complex found in many flavoproteins (12Massey V. Palmer G. Charge transfer complexes of lipoyl dehydrogenase and free flavins.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2347-2358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the whole reduction process, the characteristic spectrum of a red semiquinone did not show up (absorbance increase around 360–370 nm). The kinetic trace monitored at A452 could be fitted with two exponential phases. The first phase (dead time −0.01 s) occurred concurrently with the charge–transfer complex formation which showed a rate constant of 213 s−1, whereas the second phase (0.01–1.0 s) showed about 19-times slower rate constant of 11 ± 0.2 s−1. Reduction of 50 μM EtfaB by various concentrations of NADH ranging from 0.25 mM to 8 mM (Fig. 1C) was carried out and monitored by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The reduction kinetics showed two exponential phases with a fast exponential phase (dead time −0.006 s) and a slow exponential phase (0.006–20 s). The analysis of the observed rate constants for reduction (kobs1 and kobs2) which are dependent on NADH concentrations for reduction is according to Equation 1.At=A1ekobs1t+A2e−kobs2t+c(1) At is absorbance change at 452 nm at a given time. A1 and A2 are magnitude of absorbance changes of fast and slow reduction population, respectively. C is nonzero baseline. The fast species (A1, Equation 1) was the major enzyme population (∼84%, calculated from the starting A452 = 0.5 of the oxidized enzyme, Fig. 1A) which was reduced before 0.002 s, indicating that observed rate constants (kobs) for reduction was greater than 600 s−1 (EtfaBox∗, Fig. 2). This phase also occurred concurrently with the charge–transfer complex formation at 750 nm (Fig. 1D). Another enzyme fraction (A2, Equation 1) was a minor enzyme population (∼16%) and less active (EtfaBox, Fig. 2). Because the ratios of the absorbance changes at 452 nm of fast and slow kinetic phases were the same (∼4.6) from the lowest to the highest NADH concentration (Fig. 1C), the data suggest that both fast and slow reacting enzyme populations are linked by a very slow equilibrium and that both reductions proceeded independently from each other. The proposed mechanism is based on the two distinct kinetic properties of the fast and slow reduction populations also found in other flavoprotein systems (13Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P.

Kinetic isotope effects on the noncovalent flavin mutant protein of pyranose 2-oxidase reveal insights into the flavin reduction mechanism.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3753-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because the kinetics of the fast reacting species mainly occurred during the dead time of the stopped-flow machine, we could only analyze the data of the slower phase. Kinetic analysis of the traces at 452 nm of the slow reacting species from the lowest to the highest NADH concentration showed two exponential phases (Fig. 1C). A plot of the observed rate constants as a function of the NADH concentration exhibited saturation kinetics according to Equation 2 with a significant intercept of 3.35 ± 0.05 s−1 (Inset in Fig. 1C). According to the model shown in Figure 2, the first step was treated as rapid binding of NADH to oxidized EtfaBox forming a Michaelis–Menten complex with Kd = 3.8 ± 0.2 mM. The second step was the reversible hydride transfer with a forward rate constant of 8.88 ± 0.15 s−1 (k4, Fig. 2) and a reverse rate constant of 3.35 ± 0.05 s−1 (k−4, Fig. 2).kobs=k4[NADH]Kd+[NADH]+k−4(2) EtfAB (34 μM β-FAD) was reduced by 34 μM NADH and monitored at 451 nm using the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The first phase (dead time −0.006 s) was a fast reduction with an observed rate constant of ∼450 s−1, whereby some part of the reaction occurred during the dead time (blue line, Fig. 3A). Concurrently, the charge–transfer complex β-FADH−:NAD+ (absorbance at 650 nm) was also formed (green line, Fig. 3A) during this phase. When compared with the data in Figure 1A, the observed rate constant of the stoichiometric reduction of the holo EtfAB was faster than that of EtfaB. This implies that the presence of α-FAD possibly affects the surroundings of β-FAD which accelerates the reduction rate constant. The second phase (0.006–0.1 s) was an increase in absorbance at 377 nm with the observed rate constant of 47 ± 1 s−1, because of red semiquinone formation. During this phase, the absorbance at 650 decreased, indicating the decay of the charge–transfer complex. It should be mentioned that the charge–transfer complex of EtfAB (absorbs maximally at 650 nm) was different from that of EtfaB which exhibits maximum absorbance at 750 nm. Because the initial absorbance (A452) of EtfAB used was ∼0.7 (green line, Fig. 3B), β-FAD was fully reduced by NADH (red line, Fig. 3B) at 0.006 s when ΔA452 was ∼0.35 (equivalent to the concentration of β-FAD bound to EtfAB). At 0.1 s, the stable semiquinone of α-FAD was formed (α-FAD•−) as represented by the blue line (Fig. 3B). Under absence of a low-potential acceptor such as Fd or Fld, β-FADH− most likely bifurcated one electron intramolecularly to α-FAD of the same EtfAB molecule and the other intermolecularly to α-FAD of another EtfAB molecule (Fig. 4A, as indicated by red arrow). This re-oxidation of β-FADH− by intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfers was consistent with the decrease of the charge–transfer complex at 650 nm because of NAD+ release (from red to blue line, inset in Fig. 3B). During the first phase, the formation of 34 μM β-FADH− caused an absorbance increase at 650 nm (red line, Fig. 3B) with a maximum ΔA650 ∼ 0.083 (red arrow, inset of Fig. 3B). Afterward, the absorbance decreased by ΔA650 ∼ 0.034 (blue arrow, inset of Fig. 3B). This amount of charge–transfer species was equivalent to 34 × 0.034/0.083 = 14 μM β-FADH− which could generate 28 μM of stable α-FAD•−. These data indicate that only around 41% of β-FADH− generated α-FAD•− by electron bifurcation, whereas 59% of β-FADH− remained reduced without transferring an electron. To demonstrate that an electron from EtfAB-bound β-FADH− can be transferred intermolecularly to another enzyme-bound α-FAD, EtfaB (+NADH) was added to increase the concentration of β-FADH− without changing the concentration of α-FAD. An increase of β-FAD− could mediate more intermolecular electron transfer. Hence, more red semiquinone should be detected according to more EtfaB concentrations. The data clearly indicate an increase in the amount of α-FAD•− (noted by the increase in absorbance at 377 nm) without affecting its rate of formation (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the generation of α-FAD•− by electron bifurcation from β-FADH− in EtfaB required the interaction of three molecules, EtfaB as donor with two EtfAB as electron acceptors (Fig. 4B, as indicated by red arrows). Owing to the lack of additional α-FAD, the further raise in EtfaB concentration resulted in saturation of the amount of α-FAD•−. In another experiment, in which the EtfAB and NADH concentrations were raised, the rate and amount of the generated α-FAD•− raised proportionally, and no saturation was observed (Fig. 3D). The observed rate constants of 47 ± 4 s−1 for α-FAD•− formation were similar at all EtfAB concentrations and similar to that of the red semiquinone formation in Figure 3A. To investigate the first and second reduction of β-FAD, a solution of 34 μM EtfAB was mixed with two equivalents of NADH (68 μM). Under this condition, only 34 μM β-FAD was reduced, leaving 34 μM NADH in the solution. Kinetic traces of the reaction monitored at 451 nm showed fast reduction, which occurred during the dead time until 0.004 s (blue line, Fig. 5A) similar to the results observed in Figure 3A. A kinetic trace of the reaction monitored at 650 nm (green line, Fig. 5A) also showed that the charge–transfer complex was formed during this phase. The second phase (0.004–0.077 s) was the decay of the charge–transfer complex (green line, Fig. 5A) with an increase in the absorbance at 377 nm (red line, Fig. 5A). The observed rate constant of this phase (47 s−1) was similar to that obtained for the decay of charge transfer in the previous section (red line, Fig. 3A). This second phase was interpreted as oxidation of β-FADH− by intermolecular and intramolecular electron transfers to two molecules of α-FAD, resulting in two molecules of α-FAD•−. The charge–transfer complex exhibited a maximum absorbance of 0.10 at 650 nm (green lines in Fig. 5, A–B). The change from the green to the blue spectrum (Fig. 5B) was consistent with the decrease of ΔA650 = 0.041, which is equivalent to oxidation of 41% β-FADH− by intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer to α-FAD. In the third phase (0.077–50 s), a slow increase of absorbance at 650 nm (green line, Fig. 5A) occurred concomitantly with a decrease of absorbance at 377 nm and 451 nm with a rate constant of 0.050 ± 0.001 s−1 (red and blue lines, Fig. 4A). This phase was interpreted as the second round of reduction of EtfAB-bound β-FAD by excess NADH to form another charge–transfer complex which is much slower than the formation of the charge–transfer complex during the first phase. These data indicate that the presence of α-FAD•− instead of α-FAD inhibits the rate of β-FAD reduction (Fig. 4A). To get a clearer picture of this effect, the reduction kinetics of EtfAB with various NADH concentrations were investigated. Reduction of EtfAB with various NADH concentrations under pseudo-first order conditions was investigated. To avoid high background absorbance from high NADH concentrations, the absorbance at 395 nm instead of 377 nm was used to monitor formation of the red semiquinone (Fig. 6A). The first kinetic phase (dead time −0.003 s) monitored at 395 nm showed a decrease in absorbance because of the reduction of β-FAD which occurred concurrently with an increase in absorbance at 650 nm, indicating that this phase was the formation of the charge–transfer complex (FADH⁻:NAD+) (Fig. 6B). As most of the first-phase kinetics occurred during the dead time of the instrument, the data obtained for this phase could not be reliably used for analyzing the reaction kinetics. In the second phase (0.003–0.1 s), the red semiquinone (indicated by absorbance at 395 nm) increased with the observed rate constant, kobs = 44 ± 1 s−1 (Fig. 6A). This rate constant was similar to kobs = 47 s−1 for semiquinone formation by bifurcation via intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer processes using either stoichiometric NADH (Fig. 3A) or two-fold NADH (Fig. 5A). The observed rate constants of this phase were independent on NADH concentrations (Fig. 6A). In the third phase, the excess NADH further reduced EtfAB-bound β-FAD in the presence of α-FAD•− with an increase of the charge–transfer complex at 650 nm (black line, Fig. 6B). Because most of the absorbance change at 650 nm in the first phase mostly occurred during the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument, NADD was used to slow the observed rate constants involved in the first step of the hydride transfer. The kinetic trace of NADD reduction monitored at 650 nm showed that the reaction was indeed slower, and the kinetics of the intermediate charge–transfer formation could be observed during 0.001 to 0.01 s (Fig. 6C). The clear observation of a KIE = 2.1 also indicated that the EtfAB-reduction by NADH was specific for the 4R-position. The observed rate constants with various NADD concentrations from 30 μM to 3.0 mM showed saturation kinetics, indicating that the first reduction of EtfAB-bound β-FAD by NADH in the presence of α-FAD proceeded with a two-step reduction process, a rapid equilibrium binding of NADH to EtfAB (step A, Fig. 7). The Michaelis–Menten complex was formed with a bimolecular rate constant of k1 = 1.1 × 109 M−1 s−1 and a reverse rate constant of k−1 = 1.7 × 105 s−1 followed by hydride transfer to obtain the stable charge–transfer complex of β-FADH−:NAD+ with a rate constant of k2 = 917 s−1 (step B, Fig. 7). The values of the rate constants of k1, k−1, and k2 were calculated from kinetic simulations (Experimental procedures) developed from the reaction model from step A to B (Fig. 7). Around 59% of the semi-reduced EtfAB remained stable as the charge–transfer complex (step C, Fig. 7), whereas the remaining 41% rapidly transferred electrons intermolecularly and intramolecularly to α-FAD (step D, Fig. 7) with k4 = 44 s−1 to form two different EtfAB species with stable α-FAD•−, one with β-FADH− and another with β-FAD (step E, Fig. 7). Two-fold evidence supported that k4 = 44 s−1 was an intrinsic rate constant for intermolecular and intramolecular electron transfer (1Herrmann G. Jayamani E. Mai G. Buckel W. Energy conservation via electron-transferring flavoprotein in anaerobic bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This observed rate constant was not dependent on the NADH concentrations (2Nitschke W. Russell M.J. Redox bifurcations: mechanisms and importance to life now, and at its origin: a widespread means of energy conversion in biology unfolds.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There was no isotope effect on the observed rate constant for semiquinone formation when NADD was used instead of NADH, because an electron rather than a hydride was transferred. The kinetic traces at 395 nm using the highest concentration of 3 mM NADD (orange line, Fig. 6D) and the same concentration of NADH (black line, Fig. 6D) showed the same kobs = 44 s−1 but at a different ΔA395. The EtfAB species containing α-FAD•− and re-oxidized β-FAD (step E, Fig. 7) were again reduced by NADH (second reduction) to reform charge–transfer species (Fig. 5B). The kinetics of this reduction were much slower than the first reduction and also showed saturation (inset in Fig. 6B), which suggested a two-step process. This included rapid binding of NADH to β-FAD (step F, Fig. 7) followed by hydride transfer to yield the stable charge–transfer complex (step G, Fig. 7). Rate constants associated with the reaction model in Figure 7 were analyzed by kinetic simulations (red-dotted lines from simulations versus solid-black lines from experimental traces shown in Fig. 6B). The hydride transfer rate constant to form the charge–transfer complex of the second reduction was calculated as k6 = 0.584 s−1 and the reverse rate constant as k−6 = 0.0334 s−1 (step G, Fig. 7). The existence of a reversible step was also supported by the fact that each kinetic trace did not reach the same point at the end of the reduction, caused by different equilibrium states according to the NADH concentrations (15Bagshaw C.R. Biomolecular Kinetics: A Step-by-Step Guide. Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2017Crossref Google Scholar). All results of NADD and NADH reductions both indicate that the α-FAD•− state strongly inhibits the reduction rate of β-FAD as compared with the α-FAD state. Actually, the inhibition was k2/k6 = 917 s−1/0.584 s−1 = 1570 fold (steps B and G, Fig. 7). One interesting observation of the second reduction of β-FAD by NADD, which is different from the first reduction, is the inverse KIE on the charge–transfer complex formation monitored at 650 nm. The first reduction (dead time −0.01 s) exhibited a normal observed KIE (kobsH/kobsD) of 2.1 indicated by the first absorption maximum at about 0.006 s with 3 mM NADH (Fig. 6B) and 0.01 s with 3 mM NADD (Fig. 6C). The second absorption maximum with 3 mM NADH, however, occurred later at around 6 s than that with 3 mM NADD at already 1 s, which indicated an inverse KIE for the second reduction. Furthermore, the kinetic traces in Figure 6E after 0.1 s showed that the rates for the second reduction of β-FAD with NADD were greater than those with NADH (orange versus black lines). A plot of the observed rate constants from NADD (open-circle orange line) versus from NADH (close-circle black line) reactions showed an observed inverse KIE (kobsH/kobsD) = 0.19 at the highest NADH and NADD concentrations of 3 mM (inset in Fig. 6E), whereas at 30 μM NADH/D, no KIE could be detected. As the second reduction of β-FAD using NADD showed an inverse KIE on the reduction rate constant which is quite unusual for hydride transfer from NAD(P)H/D to flavin, we further investigated this issue by directly measuring the KIE of the second reduction. For the experiments in Figures 5 and 6, NADH/D was added into the enzyme solution when both FADs of EtfAB were in the oxidized state. The KIE of the second flavin reduction observed in Figure 6 could be because of the combined effects from the first reduction. To directly measure an inverse isotope effect of the second flavin reduction, we carried out the experiment using a double-mixing stopped-flow spectrophotometer. In the first mixing, NADH was added stoichiometrically to reduce β-FAD and generate α-FAD•−. Then, NADD was added, and the second reduction was directly observed. The experiment was performed by reducing 60 μM EtfAB with 60 μM NADH in the first mixing. The reaction was incubated for 0.1 s to form the stable α-FAD•− and then mixed with 30 μM of either NADH (black line indicated as 30 μM, Fig. 8A) or NADD (orange line indicated as 30 μM, Fig. 8A) in the second mixing. The second reduction was monitored at 650 nm to follow the formation of the charge–transfer complex. Both kinetic traces did not show a clear inverse KIE at the low concentration of 30 μM NADH(D) because both reactions gave similar observed rate constants of 0.070 ± 0.001 s−1 for NADH and 0.069 ± 0.006 s−1 for NADD. When the concentrations of NADH (black line indicated as 3 mM, Fig. 8A) and NADD (orange line indicated as 3 mM, Fig. 8A) were raised to 3 mM in the second mixing, the inverse isotope effect was detected similar to the results from the single mixing. The observed rate constants at 3 mM NADD from single mixing versus double"

If someone does not act like they are interested in connecting with you, it may make it difficult to feel connected to them. And yet, some parents report feeling strongly connected to their autistic children. We conducted phenomenological interviews with 13 mothers to understand how they experienced connection with their 5- to 14-year-old nonspeaking autistic children. Mothers of nonspeaking autistic children represent a unique group in which to study connection because their children both may not seem interested in connecting with them and have limited ability to communicate effectively using speech, a common way people connect with each other. The mothers in this study interpreted a range of child behaviors—some unconventional, but many conventional—as signs that their children were interested in connecting with them, (re)framed child behaviors that could undermine connection as caused by factors unrelated to the relationship, and expressed several convictions that may help build and sustain connection in the face of uncertainty about the meaning of their children’s behavior. Even though their autistic children may not consistently act in conventional socially oriented ways, these mothers reported perceiving their children’s behavior as embedded within an emotionally reciprocal relationship."

To gain insight into environmental factors that contribute to obesity, we analyzed the relation of personal or social background to obesity in men and women separately with the use of data from a community-based questionnaire survey of 5425 residents aged 20 to 64 years of Kobe, a representative large city in Japan. Obesity and normal weight were defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 and of ≥ 18.5 and &lt; 25 kg/m 2 , respectively, according to the diagnostic criteria of the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity. The personal or social background factors examined included marital status, family structure, employment, household income, residence type, welfare enrollment, economic conditions of current life, educational level, extracurricular activity in school, living conditions at 15 years of age, and childhood adversity. We found that the prevalence of obesity was 27.2% and 10.6% in men and women, respectively. Among women, unmarried status, a low household income, welfare enrollment, difficult current economic conditions, a low educational level, and childhood adversity were associated with obesity, whereas none of the personal or social background factors examined were associated with obesity in men. Our results suggest that the development of obesity in women is strongly influenced by personal or social background, and such factors should be taken into consideration in the management of this condition in women."

Multiple spawning run contingents (aka run timing groups) are reported here for the first time for striped bass, an economically important coastal species, which is well known for plastic estuarine and shelf migration behaviors. Adult Hudson River Estuary striped bass (n = 66) were tagged and tracked with acoustic transmitters from two known spawning reaches separated by 90 km. Biotelemetry recaptures for two years demonstrated that each river reach was associated with separate contingents. Time series of individual spawning phenologies were examined via nonparametric dynamic time warping and revealed two dominant time series centroids, each associated with a separate spawning reach. The lower spawning reach contingent occurred earlier than the higher reach contingent in 2017 but not in 2018. The majority (89%) of returning adults in 2018 showed the same contingent behaviors exhibited in 2017. Spawning contingents may have been cued differently by temperatures, where warming lagged 1-week at the higher reach in comparison to the lower reach. The two contingents exhibited similar Atlantic shelf migration patterns with strong summer fidelity to Massachusetts Bay and winter migrations to the southern US Mid-Atlantic Bight. Still, in 2017, differing times of departure into nearby shelf waters likely caused the early lower reach contingent to experience substantially higher mortality than the later upper reach contingent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that higher fishing effort is exerted on the early-departing individuals as they first enter shelf fisheries. Thus, as in salmon, multiple spawning units can lead to differential demographic outcomes, potentially stabilizing overall population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3108201420,"Purpose This study investigates how both the peripheral zone design and corneal shape affect the behaviour of soft contact lenses on-eye. Methods In this study, soft contact lenses of varying nominal cylindrical powers and peripheral zone designs—a single-prism gravity-based stabilised lens (G1P), two-prism blink-based stabilised lens (B2P) and four-prism blink-based stabilised lens (B4P)—were generated as finite element models. The on-eye simulation results were analysed to identify the impact of each peripheral zone design (Each with different volume ratios) on the effective power change (EPC) when worn by a subject. Topographies of three eyes of varying average simulated anterior corneal curvature (flat, average &amp; steep) were used in this study. Results The volume of the lens’s peripheral zone as a ratio of the total lens volume (V p ) recorded very weak correlations with the effective power change (EPC) among the three investigated designs when they were fitted to the flat eye (R = -0.19, -0.15 &amp; -0.22 respectively), moderate correlations with the average eye (R = 0.42, 0.43 &amp; 0.43 respectively) and strong correlations with the steep eye (R = 0.91, 0.9 &amp; 0.9 respectively). No significant differences were noticed among the three investigated designs and none of the cylindrical lenses designed with axis 90° recorded EPC values outside the acceptance criteria range (ACR) of ±0.25 D. No significant differences in EPC were recorded among the three designs G1P, B2P and B4P (p&gt;0.6) when they were designed with three axes at 90°, 45° and 0°. Moving the toric lens axis away from 90° dragged the EPC to the negative side and most of the investigated lenses with axes at 45° and 0° recorded EPCs outside the ±0.25D range. Conclusions In all cases, the shape of the cornea had a more dominant effect on EPC when compared to the peripheral zone design. Corneal shape influences the soft toric contact lens’s on-eye power change more than the lens design."

A cow was defined as having PF when its rectal temperature rose to ≥39.5°C between 1 and 3 days postpartum. We recorded electrocardiograms during this period using a Holter-type electrocardiograph and applied power spectral analysis of HRV. Comparisons between the groups were analyzed by t test or Mann-Whitney U test, and the relationship between rectal temperature and each parameter was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Heart rate was higher in PF cows than in CH cows (Mean ± SE, 103.3 ± 2.7 vs. 91.5 ± 1.7 bpm). This result suggested that PF cows had a relatively dominant sympathetic nervous function. Total (44,472 ± 2,301 vs. 55,373 ± 1,997 ms) and low frequency power (24.5 ± 3.8 vs. 39.9 ± 5.3 ms) were lower in PF cows than in CH cows. These findings were possibly caused by a reduction in autonomic nervous function. The total white blood cell count (54.3 ± 5.1 vs. 84.5 ± 6.4 ×10 2 /μL) and the serum magnesium (2.1 ± 0.1 vs. 2.4 ± 0.1 mg/dL) and iron (81.5 ± 8.0 vs. 134.4 ± 9.1 μg/dL) concentrations were lower and the serum amyloid A concentration (277 ± 33 vs. 149 ± 21 μg/mL) was higher in PF cows than in CH cows. These results imply that more inflammation was present in PF cows than in CH cows. Multiple regression analysis showed that both of low frequency power and concentration of serum iron were associated with rectal temperature. We found differences in changes in hematologic results, biochemical findings, and HRV patterns between PF cows and CH cows."
https://openalex.org/W3109531378,"Statins are used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease. Musculoskeletal side effects known as statin associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS), are reported in up to 10% of statin users, necessitating statin therapy interruption and increasing cardiovascular disease risk. We tested the hypothesis that, when exposed to statins ex vivo , engineered human skeletal myobundles derived from individuals with (n = 10) or without (n = 14) SAMS and elevated creatine-kinase levels exhibit statin-dependent muscle defects. Myoblasts were derived from muscle biopsies of individuals (median age range of 62–64) with hyperlipidemia with (n = 10) or without (n = 14) SAMS. Myobundles formed from myoblasts were cultured with growth media for 4 days, low amino acid differentiation media for 4 days, then dosed with 0 and 5μM of statins for 5 days. Tetanus forces were subsequently measured. To model the change of tetanus forces among clinical covariates, a mixed effect model with fixed effects being donor type, statin concentration, statin type and their two way interactions (donor type*statin concentration and donor type* statin type) and the random effect being subject ID was applied. The results indicate that statin exposure significantly contributed to decrease in force (P&lt;0.001) and the variability in data (R 2 C [R square conditional] = 0.62). We found no significant differences in force between myobundles from patients with/without SAMS, many of whom had chronic diseases. Immunofluorescence quantification revealed a positive correlation between the number of straited muscle fibers and tetanus force (R 2 = 0.81,P = 0.015) and negative correlation between number of fragmented muscle fibers and tetanus force (R 2 = 0.482,P = 0.051) with no differences between donors with or without SAMS. There is also a correlation between statin exposure and presence of striated fibers (R 2 = 0.833, P = 0.047). In patient-derived myobundles, statin exposure results in myotoxicity disrupting SAA organization and reducing force. We were unable to identify differences in ex vivo statin myotoxicity in this system. The results suggest that it is unlikely that there is inherent susceptibility to or persistent effects of statin myopathy using patient-derived myobundles."

The differentiation potency of ASCs has been reported to deteriorate with aging; however, relevant studies used ASCs that were isolated and subcultured several times. It is still unclear whether subcultured ASCs accurately reflect the in vivo state. To address this question, we used freshly isolated stromal vascular fractions (SVFs) and performed comprehensive single-cell transcriptome analysis. In this study, we identified three cell populations as putative ASC candidates in SVFs and three novel ASC-related genes: Adamts7 , Snai2 , and Tgfbr1 , that are reported to be negative regulators of cell differentiation. Moreover, we identified age-associated high gene expression levels of Adamts7 , Egfr , and Igfbp4 in the earliest differentiation stage of ASCs. These results suggest that aging may make it impossible to maintain the stringency of the regulation of the expression of some genes related to ASC differentiation."

The objective of this study is to determine if ethnicity has an impact on obesity traits in a multiethnic cohort of first-year students at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. Methods 183 first year students from the three most represented ethnic groups (South Asian, East Asian, and white-Caucasian) in our study sample were followed longitudinally with data collected early in the academic year and towards the end of the year. Obesity parameters including body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, and waist hip ratio (WHR) were analyzed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pairwise comparison of traits from the beginning to the end of the year in the absence of adjustments. Linear regression was used with covariate adjustments to investigate the effect of ethnicity on obesity traits. Results A significant increase in weight by 1.49 kg (95%CI: 1.13–1.85) was observed over the academic year in the overall analyzed sample. This was accompanied by significant gains in BMI, waist and hip circumferences, and WHR. Ethnicity stratified analysis indicated significant increase in all investigated obesity traits in East Asians and all traits, but WHR, in South Asians. White-Caucasians only displayed significant increases in weight and BMI. Body weight and hip circumference were significantly lower in East Asians compared to white-Caucasians at baseline. However, East Asians displayed a significantly larger increase in mean BMI and weight compared to white-Caucasians after first-year. South Asians displayed larger waist circumference at baseline compared to East Asians and larger WHR compared to white-Caucasians. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that ethnicity has an impact on obesity traits in first-year university students. Universities should take ethnicity into account while implementing effective obesity prevention programs to promote healthy and active lifestyles for students."

This study examined Chinese merchant sailors’ social participation using a nationwide survey. Across 12 Chinese provinces, 7,296 merchant sailors completed the questionnaire on sailor' willingness to engage in and status of social participation. The results showed that most Chinese merchant sailors were willing to participate in social affairs, but few of them reported having joined relevant social organizations, over half of sailors reported never having participated in public affairs, and half of them chose to ignore when they faced with an obvious mistake in shipping-related information in the media. Most of sailors reported unknowing the role of the labor union related to Chinese seafarers and NGO related to navigation well, and their evaluation of these organizations were mostly negative. Chinese merchant sailors reported higher expectations of services in terms of protection of rights, providing information and technology, and providing employment opportunity. We conclude that Chinese merchant sailors have willingness to social participation although the reality is not positive and discuss implications for improving the social participation of Chinese merchant sailors."
https://openalex.org/W3109672485,"Objective To develop and validate the content of an instrument for assessing the motivation for weight loss in adolescents with overweight and obesity. Methods The development and validation of the instrument were conducted in five stages, for which two systematic reviews were conducted. The first one, for the identification of questionnaires assessing the motivation for weight loss, included six studies and contributed to the selection of the domains for the instrument. The second one, conducted to identify the motivations for weight loss in adolescents with overweight and/or obesity, included six studies and contributed to the selection of 17 motivations included in the initial version of the instrument. The motivations most commonly identified were: having better health, improving my appearance, improving my self-esteem and avoiding bullying. The content validity was confirmed by a committee of 12 experts from the areas of nutrition, endocrinology, psychology, and physical education. Based on these evaluations, the content validity index was calculated. Only the items with a content validity index &gt;0.80 for practical relevance were held in the instrument. Results Five of the 17 motivations included in the initial version of the instrument were excluded because they had content validity index &lt;0.80 for practical relevance. Of the 12 items held in the instrument, five were revised by experts in order to standardize wording and make the language more appropriate for adolescents. Experts categorized the items into the health, personal satisfaction, appearance and social domains. Conclusions This is the first instrument assessing the motivation for weight loss in adolescents with overweight and obesity in Brazil. The content validity evaluation by the panel of experts provided more practical relevance, as well as contributed to a better presentation of the items.

Data on OOPs is needed to monitor progress in financial risk protection, and the evaluation of health financing policies. In low-and-middle-income countries, estimates of OOPs rely heavily on self-reported data from household surveys. These surveys require respondents to recall events in the past and can suffer from recall biases. This study investigates the effect of recall period on the agreement of the amount and timing of inpatient OOPs between household reports and provider records in Bavi, Vietnam. We recruited 1397 households for interview using records from the district hospital. The households were interviewed with identical questionnaires except that the recall period was either 12 or 6 months. We linked household with provider data and excluded medicine costs from both household and provider OOPs since they could be purchased outside the hospital. We estimated the effect of recall period on the overall mean and variability of ratios of household to hospital reported OOPs using the Bland-Altman approach for method comparison. We estimated the effect of recall period on whether a transaction was recalled correctly in expenditure and time using multinomial regression. The households reported higher amounts of OOPs than did the hospital for both recall periods. There was no evidence of an effect of recall period on the mean of the ratios of household- to hospital-reported OOPs, although the confidence intervals are not inconsistent with previous studies indicating higher OOPs for shorter recall periods. The geometric mean ratio for the 6-month period was estimated to be a multiple of 1.4 (95% CI 0.9, 2.1) times that of the 12-month period. Similarly, there was no evidence of an effect of recall period on the risk of reporting lower or higher amounts than provider OOPs. The occurrence and timing of inpatient stays generally recalled well, with 70% remembered in the correct month declining slightly over time. Respondents for the 6-month recall period had a significantly lower risk of failing to report the event (RR 0.8 (0.7, 1.0)). The results suggest the best recall period may depend on whether the purpose of a survey is for the recall of the timing of events, in which case the 6 month period may be better, or the amounts of OOPs, where there was no significant difference and the provider records are not a gold standard but the 12 month period had a tendency to be in closer agreement with the provider OOPs."
https://openalex.org/W3107835667,"Objective The anatomy of the tracheobronchial tree differs among not only various races but also individual ethnic groups. Different lengths of the right mainstem bronchus (RMSB) had been described in previous publications. Since the differences in the anatomy of the RMSB and right upper lobe bronchus (RUB) may have clinical relevance when selecting devices, specifically, the right-side double lumen tube (R-DLT) for lung isolation, we revisited the anatomy of the right upper lobe in a large scale Chinese population. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed 2093 consecutive adult patients undergoing thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans from data base in our hospital. Demographic characteristics were collected. The lengths, internal diameters, and angles of the RMSB and RUB were measured using reconstructive CT images. The correlations between the demographic variables and the RMSB length and diameters were also analyzed. Results The incidence of the aberrant RUB originated equal or above the tracheal carina was 8.1‰. 52.3% of the patients had a length of RMSB less than 23 mm, and the incidence of RMSB length &lt;23 mm in women was significantly higher than that in men (63.5% vs. 42.8%, p = 0.000). The right bronchial length (RBL) was less than 10 mm in 21% of cases (17.8% in men and 24.8% in women, respectively, p = 0.000). Both the RMSB lengths and diameters had poor correlations with the heights in either male or female patients. Conclusion A much higher incidence of a shortened RMSB potentially make placement of a R-DLT more difficult in Chinese population. Both the lengths and diameters of the RMSB cannot be predicted by the height. Preoperative thoracic CT scan for each patient helps optimizing the selection of a lung isolation device, and the importance of an evaluation of the CT scans preoperatively by the anesthesiologists should be emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W3110067692,"Introduction The aim of this study is to explore patients’ experiences with community-based care programmes (CCPs) and develop dimensions of patient experience salient to community-based care in Singapore. Most countries like Singapore are transforming its healthcare system from a hospital-centric model to a person-centered community-based care model to better manage the increasing chronic disease burden resulting from an ageing population. It is thus critical to understand the impact of hospital to community transitions from the patients’ perspective. The exploration of patient experience will guide the development of an instrument for the evaluation of CCPs for quality improvement purposes. Methods A qualitative exploratory study was conducted where face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted using a purposive sampling method with patients enrolled in CCPs. In total, 64 participants aged between 41 to 94 years were recruited. A deductive framework was developed using the Picker Patient Experience instrument to guide our analysis. Inductive coding was also conducted which resulted in emergence of new themes. Results Our findings highlighted eight key themes of patient experience: i) ensuring care continuity, ii) involvement of family, iii) access to emotional support, vi) ensuring physical comfort, v) coordination of services between providers, vi) providing patient education, vii) importance of respect for patients, and viii) healthcare financing. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that patient experience is multi-faceted, and dimensions of patient experience vary according to healthcare settings. As most patient experience frameworks were developed based on a single care setting in western populations, our findings can inform the development of a culturally relevant instrument to measure patient experience of community-based care for a multi-ethnic Asian context."

New drugs and a shorter treatment regimen (SCR) are now recommended. However, patient and health-care worker (HCW) perspectives regarding the SCR are unknown. We aimed to determine the views and experiences of patients with MDR-TB and HCW regarding the SCR in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan. Methods In a qualitative study, we conducted 48 in-depth interviews with 24 people with MDR-TB and 20 HCW, purposively recruited to include those with a range of treatment-taking experiences and employment positions. Data were analysed thematically using Nvivo 12, to identify emergent patterns, concepts, and categories. Principles of grounded theory were drawn upon to generate findings inductively from participants’ accounts. Results All patients viewed the SCR favourably. The SCR was seen as enabling an expedited return to work, studies, and “normality”. This reduced the burden of treatment and difficulties with treatment fatigue. The SCR appeared to improve mental health, ease difficulties with TB-related stigma, and foster improved adherence. While patients wanted shorter treatment, it was also important that treatment be tolerable and effective. However, HCW doubted the appropriateness and effectiveness of the SCR, which influenced their confidence in prescribing the regimen. Conclusion The SCR was said to benefit treatment completion and patients’ lives. HCW concerns about SCR appropriateness and effectiveness may influence who receives the regimen. These are important considerations for SCR implementation and MDR-TB treatment developments, and dissonance between patient and HCW perspectives must be addressed for successful implementation of shorter regimens in the future."
