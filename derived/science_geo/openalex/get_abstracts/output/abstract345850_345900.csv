https://openalex.org/W2084603524,"Some Toll and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide immunity to experimental infections in animal models, but their contribution to host defense in natural ecosystems is unknown. We report a dominant-negative TLR3 allele in otherwise healthy children with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. TLR3 is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is required to control HSV-1, which spreads from the epithelium to the CNS via cranial nerves. TLR3 is also expressed in epithelial and dendritic cells, which apparently use TLR3-independent pathways to prevent further dissemination of HSV-1 and to provide resistance to other pathogens in TLR3-deficient patients. Human TLR3 appears to be redundant in host defense to most microbes but is vital for natural immunity to HSV-1 in the CNS, which suggests that neurotropic viruses have contributed to the evolutionary maintenance of TLR3."
https://openalex.org/W1966803171,"Targeted therapies that inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway have shown promising anticancer activity, but their efficacy in the brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other solid tumors has been modest. We hypothesized that multiple RTKs are coactivated in these tumors and that redundant inputs drive and maintain downstream signaling, thereby limiting the efficacy of therapies targeting single RTKs. Tumor cell lines, xenotransplants, and primary tumors indeed show multiple concomitantly activated RTKs. Combinations of RTK inhibitors and/or RNA interference, but not single agents, decreased signaling, cell survival, and anchorage-independent growth even in glioma cells deficient in PTEN, a frequently inactivated inhibitor of PI3K. Thus, effective GBM therapy may require combined regimens targeting multiple RTKs."
https://openalex.org/W1986864699,"Antibodies play a central role in immunity by forming an interface with the innate immune system and, typically, mediate proinflammatory activity. We describe a novel posttranslational modification that leads to anti-inflammatory activity of antibodies of immunoglobulin G, isotype 4 (IgG4). IgG4 antibodies are dynamic molecules that exchange Fab arms by swapping a heavy chain and attached light chain (half-molecule) with a heavy-light chain pair from another molecule, which results in bispecific antibodies. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the third constant domain is critical for this activity. The impact of IgG4 Fab arm exchange was confirmed in vivo in a rhesus monkey model with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. IgG4 Fab arm exchange is suggested to be an important biological mechanism that provides the basis for the anti-inflammatory activity attributed to IgG4 antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2071903046,"Precise timing of CONSTANS ( CO ) gene expression is necessary for day-length discrimination for photoperiodic flowering. The FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), and GIGANTEA (GI) proteins regulate CO transcription in Arabidopsis . We demonstrate that FKF1 and GI proteins form a complex in a blue-light–dependent manner. The timing of this interaction regulates the timing of daytime CO expression. FKF1 function is dependent on GI, which interacts with a CO repressor, CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1), and controls CDF1 stability. GI, FKF1, and CDF1 proteins associate with CO chromatin. Thus, the FKF1-GI complex forms on the CO promoter in late afternoon to regulate CO expression, providing a mechanistic view of how the coincidence of light with circadian timing regulates photoperiodic flowering."
https://openalex.org/W1974970149,"Mercury (Hg) isotopes can be used as tracers of Hg biogeochemical pathways in the environment. The photochemical reduction of aqueous Hg species by natural sunlight leads to both mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) of Hg isotopes and mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of the odd-mass isotopes, with the relation between the MIF for the two odd isotopes being distinct for different photoreduction pathways. Large variations in MDF and MIF are observed in fish and provide new insights into the sources and bioaccumulation of Hg in food webs. MIF in fish can also be used to estimate the loss of methylmercury via photoreduction in aquatic ecosytems."
https://openalex.org/W2018949714,"As an emergent electronic material and model system for condensed-matter physics, graphene and its electrical transport properties have become a subject of intense focus. By performing low-temperature transport spectroscopy on single-layer and bilayer graphene, we observe ballistic propagation and quantum interference of multiply reflected waves of charges from normal electrodes and multiple Andreev reflections from superconducting electrodes, thereby realizing quantum billiards in which scattering only occurs at the boundaries. In contrast to the conductivity of conventional two-dimensional materials, graphene's conductivity at the Dirac point is geometry-dependent because of conduction via evanescent modes, approaching the theoretical value 4e 2 /πh (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant) only for short and wide devices. These distinctive transport properties have important implications for understanding chaotic quantum systems and implementing nanoelectronic devices, such as ballistic transistors."
https://openalex.org/W1968881729,"We have studied the mechanism of A-769662, a new activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Unlike other pharmacological activators, it directly activates native rat AMPK by mimicking both effects of AMP, i.e. allosteric activation and inhibition of dephosphorylation. We found that it has no effect on the isolated alpha subunit kinase domain, with or without the associated autoinhibitory domain, or on interaction of glycogen with the beta subunit glycogen-binding domain. Although it mimics actions of AMP, it has no effect on binding of AMP to the isolated Bateman domains of the gamma subunit. The addition of A-769662 to mouse embryonic fibroblasts or primary mouse hepatocytes stimulates phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), effects that are completely abolished in AMPK-alpha1(-/-)alpha2(-/-) cells but not in TAK1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in response to A-769662 is also abolished in isolated mouse skeletal muscle lacking LKB1, a major upstream kinase for AMPK in this tissue. However, in HeLa cells, which lack LKB1 but express the alternate upstream kinase calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta, phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in response to A-769662 still occurs. These results show that in intact cells, the effects of A-769662 are independent of the upstream kinase utilized. We propose that this direct and specific AMPK activator will be a valuable experimental tool to understand the physiological roles of AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W1976216831,"The forces that maintain genetic diversity among individuals and diversity among species are usually studied separately. Nevertheless, diversity at one of these levels may depend on the diversity at the other. We have combined observations of natural populations, quantitative genetics, and field experiments to show that genetic variation in the concentration of an allelopathic secondary compound in Brassica nigra is necessary for the coexistence of B. nigra and its competitor species. In addition, the diversity of competing species was required for the maintenance of genetic variation in the trait within B. nigra . Thus, conservation of species diversity may also necessitate maintenance of the processes that sustain the genetic diversity of each individual species."
https://openalex.org/W2049155474,"Microscopic sulfides with low 34 S/ 32 S ratios in marine sulfate deposits from the 3490-million-yearold Dresser Formation, Australia, have been interpreted as evidence for the presence of early sulfate-reducing organisms on Earth. We show that these microscopic sulfides have a mass-independently fractionated sulfur isotopic anomaly (Δ 33 S) that differs from that of their host sulfate (barite). These microscopic sulfides could not have been produced by sulfate-reducing microbes, nor by abiologic processes that involve reduction of sulfate. Instead, we interpret the combined negative δ 34 S and positive Δ 33 S signature of these microscopic sulfides as evidence for the early existence of organisms that disproportionate elemental sulfur."
https://openalex.org/W1967215617,"Biological nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia for biosynthesis, is exclusively performed by a few bacteria and archaea. Despite the essential importance of biological nitrogen fixation, it has been impossible to quantify the incorporation of nitrogen by individual bacteria or to map the fate of fixed nitrogen in host cells. In this study, with multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry we directly imaged and measured nitrogen fixation by individual bacteria within eukaryotic host cells and demonstrated that fixed nitrogen is used for host metabolism. This approach introduces a powerful way to study microbes and global nutrient cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2051263494,"Rice diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced in suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor and in rice leaves irradiated with UV light. The common substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate is converted into diterpene hydrocarbon precursors via a two-step sequential cyclization and then into the bioactive phytoalexins via several oxidation steps. It has been suggested that microsomal cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450s) are involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons leading to the phytoalexins and that a dehydrogenase is involved in momilactone biosynthesis. However, none of the enzymes involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons have been identified. In this study, we found that a putative dehydrogenase gene (AK103462) and two functionally unknown P-450 genes (CYP99A2 and CYP99A3) form a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor- and UV-inducible gene cluster, together with OsKS4 and OsCyc1, the diterpene cyclase genes involved in momilactone biosynthesis. Functional analysis by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli followed by enzyme assays demonstrated that the AK103462 protein catalyzes the conversion of 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide into momilactone A. The double knockdown of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 specifically suppressed the elicitor-inducible production of momilactones, strongly suggesting that CYP99A2, CYP99A3, or both are involved in momilactone biosynthesis. These results provide strong evidence for the presence on chromosome 4 of a gene cluster involved in momilactone biosynthesis.

Plants that are attacked by pathogenic microorganisms respond with a variety of defense reactions. One such reaction is the production of secondary metabolites that serve as plant antibiotics, known as phytoalexins, which are generated through the perception of signal molecules called elicitors, which are mostly derived from pathogens. Fifteen phytoalexin compounds have been identified in suspension-cultured rice cells treated with biotic elicitors such as a chitin oligosaccharide or a cerebroside (1Yamada A. Shibuya N. Komada O.

With the exception of the flavonoid sakuranetin, all of these rice phytoalexins are diterpenoids. These compounds have been classified into four structurally distinct types of polycyclic diterpenoid phytoalexins based on the structures of their diterpene hydrocarbon precursors: phytocassanes A to E, oryzalexins A to F, momilactones A and B, and oryzalexin S. The common precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate is cyclized to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) and then to ent-cassa-12,15-diene and ent-sandaracopimaradiene, leading to phytocassanes A to E and oryzalexins A to F, respectively. Geranylgeranyl diphosphate is also cyclized to syn-CDP and then to 9βH-pimara-7,15-diene and stemar-13-ene, leading to momilactones A and B and oryzalexin S, respectively. The hypothetical biosynthetic pathways of the diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice are illustrated in Fig. 1. We have reported that two type-B diterpene cyclases, ent-CDP synthase (OsCyc2) and syn-CDP synthase (OsCyc1), catalyze the conversion of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to ent-CDP and syn-CDP, respectively (11Otomo K. Kenmoku H. Oikawa H. Konig W.A. Toshima H. Mitsuhashi W. Yamane H. Sassa T. Toyomasu T. Plant J. 2004; 39: 886-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and that four type-A diterpene cyclases, ent-cassa-12,15-diene synthase (OsDTC1), ent-sandaracopimaradiene synthase (OsKS10), 9βH-pimara-7,15-diene synthase (OsKS4), and stemar-13-ene synthase (OsDTC2), catalyze the conversion of ent-CDP or syn-CDP to the four diterpene hydrocarbons ent-cassa-12,15-diene, ent-sandaracopimaradiene, 9βH-pimara-7,15-diene, and stemar-13-ene, respectively (12Cho E.-M.

The functional identification of OsCyc1 (OsCPSsyn), OsCyc2 (OsCPS2ent), and OsKS4 (OsDTS2) was independently reported by a group at Iowa State University (15Xu M. Hillwig M.L. Prisic S. Coates R.M.

OsCyc1, OsCyc2, OsDTC1, and OsDTC2 correspond to OsCPS4, OsCPS2, OsKS7, and OsKS8, respectively, that had been identified as putative rice diterpene cyclase genes by Sakamoto et al. (18Sakamoto T. Miura K. Itoh H. Tatsumi T. Ueguchi-Tanaka M. Ishiyama K. Kobayashi M. Agrawal G.K. Takeda S. Abe K. Miyao A. Hirochika H. Kitano H. Ashikari M. Matsuoka M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that microsomal P-450s are involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons, leading to the bioactive phytoalexins by analogy to known biosynthetic pathways for polycyclic diterpenes such as gibberellins (19Peters R.J. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In fact, in the biosynthesis of the rice phytoalexins oryzalexins D and E, the conversion of ent-sandaracopimaradien-3β-ol into oryzalexins D and E was found to be possibly catalyzed by inducible P-450 enzymes, because these enzyme reactions were inhibited by P-450 inhibitors (20Kato H. Kodama O. Akatsuka T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was also reported that a dehydrogenase is involved in momilactone biosynthesis; a soluble protein fraction from UV-irradiated rice leaves showed dehydrogenase activity, converting 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide into momilactone A (21Atawong A. Hasegawa M. Kodama O. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, none of the enzymes involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons have been identified. We previously reported that OsDTC1 is located near OsCyc2 on chromosome 2 of the rice genome and that OsKS4 is located near OsCyc1 on chromosome 4 (13Otomo K. Kanno Y. Motegi A. Kenmoku H. Yamane H. Mitsuhashi W. Oikawa H. Toshima H. Itoh H. Matsuoka M. Sassa T. Toyomasu T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, some P-450 genes have been found near the diterpene cyclase genes on chromosomes 2 and 4, suggesting that the phytocassane and momilactone biosynthesis genes are clustered on chromosomes 2 and 4, respectively (13Otomo K. Kanno Y. Motegi A. Kenmoku H. Yamane H. Mitsuhashi W. Oikawa H. Toshima H. Itoh H. Matsuoka M. Sassa T. Toyomasu T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To investigate this hypothesis, in this study, we first focused on the gene cluster on chromosome 4. As described, a dehydrogenase has been suggested to be involved in momilactone biosynthesis. We found that a putative dehydrogenase gene (AK103462) is located near OsKS4, OsCyc1, and two functionally unknown P-450 genes (CYP99A2 and CYP99A3). This information supports the presence of a momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster on chromosome 4. We therefore investigated whether AK103462 and the two P-450 genes (CYP99A2 and CYP99A3) are involved in momilactone biosynthesis. Chemicals and cDNA Clones—Purified chitooctaose supplied by Yaizu Suisankagaku Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) was re-N-acetylated to give N-acetylchitooctaose, as described (22Ito Y. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Plant J. 1997; 12: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and used as a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor throughout this study. Phytocassanes were isolated from rice leaves infected with M. grisea (8Koga J. Shimura M. Oshima K. Ogawa N. Yamauchi T. Ogasawara N. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 7907-7918Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Koga J. Ogawa N. Yamauchi T. Kikuchi M. Ogasawara N. Shimura M. Phytochemistry. 1997; 44: 249-253Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Momilactones were isolated from rice husks (23Kato T. Tsunakawa M. Sasaki N. Aizawa H. Fujita K. Kitahara Y. Takahashi N. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 45-48Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide was prepared as described (24Kato T. Aizawa H. Tsunakawa M. Sasaki N. Kitahara Y. Takahashi N. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I. 1977; : 250-254Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The general P-450 inhibitor uniconazole-P was supplied by Sumitomo Chemical Co. (Takarazuka, Japan). cDNA clones for AK103462, AK071546 (CYP99A2), and AK071864 (CYP99A3) were provided by the Rice Genome Project of the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences and the Rice Genome Resource Center in Japan. Quantification of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—An Agilent 1100 separation module (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a Pegasil C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm in diameter; Senshu Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) was used for HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ORF, open reading frame; RNAi, RNA interference; UTR, untranslated region; RT, reverse transcription. analysis. Diterpenoid phytoalexins were eluted in 70% aqueous acetonitrile (MeCN) containing 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1. The respective authentic samples of diterpenoid phytoalexins were dissolved in 79% aqueous ethanol containing 7% MeCN and 0.01% acetic acid for use as standard solutions. For the selection of diagnostic precursor-to-product ion transitions, the standard solutions were directly infused at a flow rate of 5 μl min–1 into a quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (API 3000; Applied Biosystems Instruments, Foster City, CA) outfitted with an electrospray ion source. All of the diterpenoid phytoalexins were analyzed in positive ion mode. Nitrogen was used as the collision gas. The electrospray capillary was set at 3.0 kV, and the source temperature was 400 °C. Other parameters were optimized using the spectrometer software (Applied Biosystems Instruments). The diterpenoid phytoalexin levels were determined with the m/z combinations (precursor/product ions) of 315/271 for momilactone A, 331/269 for momilactone B, 317/299 for phytocassanes A, D, and E, and 319/301 for phytocassane C in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Cell Culture and Treatment with Chitin Oligosaccharide Elicitor—Calli of Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare were maintained as described previously (12Cho E.-M. Okada A. Kenmoku H. Otomo K. Toyomasu T. Mitsuhashi W. Sassa T. Yajima A. Yabuta G. Mori K. Oikawa H. Toshima H. Shibuya N. Nojiri H. Omori T. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. Plant J. 2004; 37: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Samples of ∼1 ml of rice cells were transferred into 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml of fresh culture medium (N6 medium with 1 mg l–1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and cultured on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm and 25 °C, in darkness. After 6 days, the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mg l–1. For pretreatment with the P-450 inhibitor uniconazole-P, the compound was added to a final concentration of 30 mg l–1 at 2 h before the addition of the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor. Quantification of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in the Rice Cell Culture Medium—To analyze the diterpenoid phytoalexins, 1-ml samples of rice cell culture medium were extracted three times with ethyl acetate (0.5 ml) at approximately pH 5.8. The combined ethyl acetate extracts were concentrated in vacuo. The residues were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 79% aqueous ethanol containing 7% MeCN and 0.01% acetic acid, and 5-μl samples of the resulting solutions were subjected to HPLC-MS/MS. Expression Analysis of Clustered Genes on Chromosome 4 in Elicited Suspension-cultured Rice Cells and UV-irradiated Rice Leaves—Reverse transcription was performed with SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using total RNA (1 μg) that had been prepared from suspension-cultured rice cells (cv. Nipponbare) harvested at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 h after the addition of the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor (1 mg l–1). Rice plants (cv. Nipponbare) were cultured in a greenhouse. At the six-leaf stage, the fourth and fifth leaves were detached and UV-irradiated as described previously (12Cho E.-M. Okada A. Kenmoku H. Otomo K. Toyomasu T. Mitsuhashi W. Sassa T. Yajima A. Yabuta G. Mori K. Oikawa H. Toshima H. Shibuya N. Nojiri H. Omori T. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. Plant J. 2004; 37: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Control rice leaves (UV–) were handled similarly, except that they were not exposed to UV irradiation. PCR was carried out using KOD-Plus-DNA polymerase (Toyobo) with the following program: 2 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min 50 s at 68 °C, followed by cooling to 4 °C. The pairs of gene-specific primers that were used are as follows: for CYP99A2, 5′-CTACTCACCAATAATCCATCCTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATTACGTGCACCCTTACAAGG-3′ (reverse); for CYP99A3, 5′-GCTAAACTGCCAAGTAATTAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGTATGCAAGCACGTAAG-3′ (reverse); for AK103462, 5′-CCATGTTTCTGCTGATGCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCCTGAAGAAACCAAAGCTC-3′ (reverse); and for the rice actin gene ACT1 as an internal standard, 5′-CATGCTATCCCTCGTCTCGACCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCACTTCATGATGGAGTTGTAT-3′ (reverse). Expression of the AK103462 cDNA in Escherichia coli—The AK103462 ORF was subcloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector using the Gateway pENTR/D-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). The resulting entry clone was used for recombination of the Gateway expression vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen) to add an N-terminal His6 tag. The resulting plasmid (pDEST17-AK103462) was transformed into the E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Invitrogen). The strain was grown at 37 °C for 10 h in LB medium (10 g l–1 tryptone, 5 g l–1 yeast extract, 5 g l–1 NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 50 μgml–1 ampicillin. The collected cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl and disrupted by mild sonication on ice. After centrifugation at 3500 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was affinity-purified using the QuickPick™ IMAC Plus kit (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) to yield His6-tagged OsMAS. As a control, E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) was similarly cultured, and the bacterial lysate was subjected to affinity column chromatography. The affinity-purified His6-tagged AK103462 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 10% acrylamide gel followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Enzyme Assay of His6-tagged AK103462 Protein—A reaction mixture was prepared containing 10 μg of His6-tagged AK103462 protein and 500 μl of assay buffer consisting of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NAD+, and 10 μg 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide. After incubation at 30 °C for 40 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of methanol. The mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate, and the extract was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 500 μl of 79% aqueous ethanol containing 7% MeCN and 0.01% acetic acid, and a 5-μl sample of the solution was subjected to HPLC-MS/MS. The ethyl acetate extract from the reaction mixture was also subjected to gas chromatography mass spectrometry, which was conducted using an Agilent 6890N JEOL K9 mass selective detector system (ionization voltage 70 eV) fitted with a fused silica chemically bonded capillary column (DB-5; 0.25 mm in diameter, 15 m long, 0.25-μm film thickness; J&W Scientific Inc., Folsom, CA). Each sample was injected onto the column at 120 °C in the splitless mode. After a 2-min isothermal hold at 120 °C, the column temperature was increased by 16 °C min–1 to 280 °C with a 3-min isothermal hold at 280 °C. The flow rate of the helium carrier gas was 1 ml min–1. Double Knockdown of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 by RNA Interference (RNAi)—A CYP99A2-specific RNAi plasmid was constructed using a Gateway destination vector, pANDA (25Miki D. Shimamoto K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), which was kindly supplied by Drs. D. Miki and K. Shimamoto (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan). A CYP99A2 cDNA fragment (325 bp) consisting of a 108-bp 3′-UTR and a 217-bp 3′-terminal region of the ORF was synthesized as an RNAi trigger region by PCR. The pair of gene-specific primers are as follows: 5′-CACCGTTTGGAACCGGGAGGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCTTACAAGGTACACAAACACGC-3′ (reverse). Subcloning of the PCR product with the pENTR/DTOPO vector was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid pANDA-CYP99A2-RNAi was constructed by recombination reaction of the entry clone (pENTR-CYP99A2) and the pANDA vector with the Gateway LR Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen). The pANDA-CYP99A2-RNAi vector was used to generate transgenic rice cells (var. Nipponbare) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (26Kaku H. Nishizawa Y. Ishii-Minami N. Akimoto-Tomiyama C. Dohmae N. Takio K. Minami E. Shibuya N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Double knockdown of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR as described above. Characterization of a 168-kb Gene Cluster on Chromosome 4—Utilizing the Rice Genome Automated Annotation System (RiceGAAS; ricegaas.dna.affrc.go.jp/), we found that the genes OsCyc1, CYP99A3, the putative dehydrogenase gene AK103462, OsKS4, and CYP99A2 are linearly arranged within a 168-kb region on chromosome 4 (Fig. 2). No other genes or miRNAs were encoded in this 168-kb region. The transcription of OsCyc1 and OsKS4 is up-regulated in suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor (18Sakamoto T. Miura K. Itoh H. Tatsumi T. Ueguchi-Tanaka M. Ishiyama K. Kobayashi M. Agrawal G.K. Takeda S. Abe K. Miyao A. Hirochika H. Kitano H. Ashikari M. Matsuoka M.

We therefore performed semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis on AK103462, CYP99A2, and CYP99A3 in rice cells treated with the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor N-acetylchitooctaose and in UV-irradiated rice leaves. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of all three genes was up-regulated in both the elicited rice cells and the UV-irradiated leaves. The AK103462 cDNA is 1265 bp in length, with an ORF encoding 274 amino acid residues. The ORF shows 55.0% identity to secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase of Forsythia intermedia (28Xia Z.Q. Costa M.A. Pelissier H.C. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12614-12623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 cDNAs are 1780 and 1750 bp in length with ORFs encoding 502 and 507 amino acid residues, respectively. The amino acid sequences encoded by CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 share 55.8 and 55.0% identities with that encoded by CYP99A1, respectively, which is a functionally unknown P-450 identified in Sorghum bicolor (29Bak S. Kahn R.A. Nielsen H.L. Moller B.L. Halkier B.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 amino acid sequences are 83.9% identical, and no other P-450 ORFs with greater than 40% identity to these ORFs are present in the rice genome.FIGURE 3Expression analysis of AK103462, CYP99A2, and CYP99A3 in rice cells treated with the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor (a) and in UV-irradiated rice leaves (b). RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers and total RNA (1μg) prepared from rice cells treated with the elicitor (1 mg l–1) for the indicated times and UV-irradiated (+) and control (–) rice leaves. As an internal standard, the rice actin gene ACT1 was amplified by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functional Analysis of the AK103462 Protein—A soluble fraction from UV-irradiated rice leaves has shown dehydrogenase activity that catalyzes the conversion of 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide into momilactone A (21Atawong A. Hasegawa M. Kodama O. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Considering the possibility that the putative dehydrogenase gene AK103462, together with OsCyc1 and OsKS4, is involved in momilactone biosynthesis, we investigated whether the AK103462 gene encodes momilactone A synthase. The AK103462 protein was overexpressed in E. coli as a His6-tagged fusion protein. The E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3), which harbors a plasmid that directs the expression of the His6-tagged fusion protein, was used, and the bacterial lysate was subjected to affinity column chromatography and then to SDS-PAGE to confirm production of the fusion protein. Enzyme assays of the affinity-purified His6-tagged fusion protein for momilactone A synthase activity were performed using 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide as a substrate, and the reaction product was analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 4a, it was indicated that the substrate was efficiently converted into momilactone A by the recombinant protein. The identification of momilactone A as a reaction product was further confirmed by gas chromatography MS analysis as follows: the reaction product (retention time (Rt)11 min 0 s), m/z (% base peak) 314 (M+, 24%), 299 (9), 286 (2), 271 (24), 255 (31), 241 (9), 227 (17), 213 (33), 199 (100), 187 (30), 173 (26), 157 (31), 145 (39), 133 (45), 119 (33), 105 (45), 91 (77), 81 (91), 67 (41), and 55 (48); authentic momilactone A (Rt 11 min 1 s), m/z (% base peak) 314 (M+, 23%), 299 (8), 286 (2), 271 (23), 255 (32), 241 (9), 227 (18), 213 (32), 199 (100), 187 (30), 173 (27), 157 (31), 145 (40), 133 (44), 119 (32), 105 (43), 91 (76), 81 (85), 67 (40), and 55 (47). In contrast, in the control experiment, only the substrate was recovered (Fig. 4b). These results demonstrate that the AK103462 gene encodes momilactone A synthase. Therefore, this gene has been named the O. sativa L. momilactone A synthase gene (OsMAS). Involvement of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 in Momilactone Biosynthesis—We next investigated whether the P-450 genes CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 in the 168-kb gene cluster on chromosome 4 are involved in momilactone biosynthesis. We treated suspension-cultured rice cells with uniconazole-P, a P-450 inhibitor, which was followed 2 h later with treatment with the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor. At 48 h after the elicitor treatment, we determined the levels of the major diterpenoid phytoalexins momilactones and phytocassanes in the culture medium using HPLC-MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 5, the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible production of momilactones A and B and phytocassanes A to E was much lower than in rice cells that had not been treated with uniconazole-P. These results indicate that P-450s might be involved in the biosynthesis of momilactones and phytocassanes. To examine the involvement of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 in the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice cells, RNAi-mediated knockdown of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 was attempted. The 3′-UTRs of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 are 162 and 202 bp long, and they show 33.9% identity to each other, whereas the ORFs of the two genes share 87% identity at the nucleotide sequence level (83.9% identity at the amino acid sequence level). To generate RNAi constructs for gene suppression, it is preferable to generate 300–500-bp fragments of gene sequences by PCR from genes of interest (25Miki D. Shimamoto K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We therefore used a 325-bp region as an input trigger for RNAi knockdown of CYP99A2. Thus, the input trigger consisted of a 108-bp 3′-UTR and a 217-bp 3′-terminal region of the ORF, which is highly homologous to that of CYP99A3. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CYP99A2 using this input trigger resulted in production of the double knockdown of the two genes (Fig. 6a). We also attempted RNAi-mediated knockdown of CYP99A3 using the plasmid harboring the trigger region consisting of an 81-bp 3′-UTR and a 207-bp 3′-terminal region of the CYP99A3 ORF, resulting in production of the double knockdown lines (data not shown). The accumulation of momilactones and phytocassanes in rice cell culture medium was determined using HPLC-MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 6 (b–d), in culture medium of the double-knockdown cell lines 1 and 2 at 48 h after chitin oligosaccharide elicitor treatment, the accumulation of momilactones A and B was much lower than in control medium, but total amounts of phytocassanes that accumulated in the knockdown lines and control medium were similar. In this study, we investigated the function of a 168-kb gene cluster on rice chromosome 4 that consists of a possible dehydrogenase gene (AK103462), two functionally unknown P-450 genes (CYP99A2 and CYP99A3), and two diterpene cyclase genes (OsCyc1 and OsKS4) involved in momilactone biosynthesis (23Kato T. Tsunakawa M. Sasaki N. Aizawa H. Fujita K. Kitahara Y. Takahashi N. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 45-48Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that the AK103462 gene, CYP99A2, and CYP99A3 are inducible by chitin oligosaccharide elicitor treatment in suspension-cultured rice cells and by UV irradiation in rice leaves (Fig. 3). Because the diterpene cyclase genes OsCyc1 and OsKS4 are also known to be chitin oligosaccharide elicitor- and UV-inducible (11Otomo K. Kenmoku H. Oikawa H. Konig W.A. Toshima H. Mitsuhashi W. Yamane H. Sassa T. Toyomasu T. Plant J. 2004; 39: 886-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Otomo K. Kanno Y. Motegi A. Kenmoku H. Yamane H. Mitsuhashi W. Oikawa H. Toshima H. Itoh H. Matsuoka M. Sassa T. Toyomasu T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Kato T. Tsunakawa M. Sasaki N. Aizawa H. Fujita K. Kitahara Y. Takahashi N. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 45-48Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), these results suggest that AK103462, CYP99A2, and CYP99A3, together with OsCyc1 and OsKS4, form a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor- and UV irradiation-inducible gene cluster on chromosome 4 and that they are involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis. We next carried out functional analysis of the AK103462 protein by heterologous expression in E. coli followed by enzyme assays and demonstrated that the AK103462 protein (OsMAS) functions as momilactone A synthase, catalyzing the conversion of 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide into momilactone A (Fig. 4). We further attempted to perform knockdown experiments using plasmids for the gene-specific knockdowns of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3. However, the knockdown of either gene resulted in the production of double-knockdown lines of both. As already described, this is because the input trigger consisted of not only a gene-specific region from the 3′-UTR but a 3′-terminal region of the ORF. Because the nucleotide sequences of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 are highly similar to each other, siRNAs directed against either gene could target both the CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 ORFs. In the double-knockdown lines, momilactone biosynthesis was specifically suppressed (Fig. 6, a–c), strongly suggesting that CYP99A2, CYP99A3, or both are involved in biosynthetic steps between 9βH-pimara-7,15-diene and 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide in the momilactone biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 7). These results provide strong evidence for the presence of a gene cluster consisting of four or five genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of momilactones on chromosome 4. In eukaryotes, gene clusters for the synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as gibberellins, aphidicolin, and abscisic acid, have been reported in fungi (30Tudzynski B. Hedden P. Carrera E. Gaskin P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3514-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Toyomasu T. Nakaminami K. Toshima H. Mie T. Watanabe K. Ito H. Matsui H. Mitsuhashi W. Sassa T.

Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4619-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In higher plants, it was reported that five genes involved in biosynthesis of the cyclic hydroxamic acid 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one are localized to a 6-cM region on the short arm of chromosome 4 in maize. 2,4-Dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one is a secondary metabolite that forms part of the defense against insects and microbial pathogens (33Frey M. Chomet P. Glawischnig E. Stettner C. Grun A. Winklmair A. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Meeley R.B. Briggs S.P. Simcox K. Gierl A. Science. 1997; 277: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that all of the momilactone biosynthetic genes clustered on chromosome 4 are coordinately expressed after treatment with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor. Coordinate elicitor-inducible expression of this cluster of genes might suggest the presence of common cis-elements in the promoter regions of the respective genes. Computational analysis of the promoter regions indicates that the respective genes contain recognition sites of transcriptional factors such as WRKY and basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins that have been indicated to be involved defense responses (34Chujo T. Takai R. Akimoto-Tomiyama C. Ando S. Minami E. Nagamura Y. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Yasuda M. Nakashita H. Umemura K. Okada A. Okada K. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Biochim. Biophys.

To elucidate regulatory mechanisms for the coordinate expression of this gene cluster of genes, promoter analysis followed by identification of transcription factors involved in expression of the respective genes will be required. We have previously suggested that a phytocassane biosynthetic gene cluster is present on chromosome 2 (13Otomo K. Kanno Y. Motegi A. Kenmoku H. Yamane H. Mitsuhashi W. Oikawa H. Toshima H. Itoh H. Matsuoka M. Sassa T. Toyomasu T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Momilactones and phytocassanes are major representatives of four distinct types of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice. Although the biological significance of gene clusters for the synthesis of secondary metabolites is not clear, such gene clusters might contribute to the efficient coordinated expression of the genes by elicitation, followed by the production of high levels of diterpenoid phytoalexins."

These plant-derived compounds must be cleaved and metabolically converted by intrinsic carotenoid oxygenases to support the panoply of vitamin A-dependent physiological processes. Two different carotenoid-cleaving enzymes were identified in mammals, the classical carotenoid-15,15′-oxygenase (CMO1) and a putative carotenoid-9′,10′-oxygenase (CMO2). To analyze the role of CMO1 in mammalian physiology, here we disrupted the corresponding gene by targeted homologous recombination in mice. On a diet providing β-carotene as major vitamin A precursor, vitamin A levels fell dramatically in several tissues examined. Instead, this mouse mutant accumulated the provitamin in large quantities (e.g. as seen by an orange coloring of adipose tissues). Besides impairments in β-carotene metabolism, CMO1 deficiency more generally interfered with lipid homeostasis. Even on a vitamin A-sufficient chow, CMO1-/- mice developed a fatty liver and displayed altered serum lipid levels with elevated serum unesterified fatty acids. Additionally, this mouse mutant was more susceptible to high fat diet-induced impairments in fatty acid metabolism. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-regulated marker genes related to adipogenesis was elevated in visceral adipose tissues. Thus, our study identifies CMO1 as the key enzyme for vitamin A production and provides evidence for a role of carotenoids as more general regulators of lipid metabolism.

Dietary lipids are precursors for signaling molecules that control many facets in cell physiology. As the classic example, fat-soluble vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is essential for processes ranging from development to vision and cell proliferation (1Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 451-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 2Simoni D. Tolomeo M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1823-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Thompson D.A.

Retinol is the precursor for at least two critical metabolites, 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of visual G-protein-coupled receptors (4Palczewski K. Annu. Rev.

All-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA regulate gene expression via heterodimeric nuclear receptors consisting of an RA receptor and a retinoid X receptor (RXR) (5Petkovich M. Brand N.J. Krust A. Chambon P.

Both are ligand-dependent transcription factors belonging to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (7Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). Additionally, RXRs form heterodimers with other members of the nuclear receptor family (8Shulman A.I. Mangelsdorf D.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 604-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Because animals, including humans, are unable to synthesize vitamin A de novo, all retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) derive from the oxidative cleavage of dietary provitamin A carotenoids, mainly β-carotene (9Olson J.A. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1364-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Goodman D.S. Huang H.S.

Both belong to a family of structurally related nonheme iron oxygenases, common to all taxa (16Giuliano G. Al-Babili S. von Lintig J.

From this cleavage product, all biologically active retinoids can be produced by endogenous metabolic pathways, including 11-cis-retinal and RA. The CMO1 gene has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by the action of PPARs and RXRs in both mice and humans (25Boulanger A. McLemore P. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Yu S.S.

The second carotenoid-metabolizing enzyme, CMO2, catalyzes an eccentric oxidative cleavage of carotenoids, such as β-carotene and lycopene, at the C9′,C10′ double bond (27Kiefer C. Hessel S.

The physiological role of this carotenoid oxygenase is still poorly understood. In most mammals, including humans, dietary provitamin A carotenoids can maintain all vitamin A-dependent physiological functions. But it is still not clear whether dietary vitamin A possess the full biological activity of the provitamin. There is evidence in the literature that carotenoid oxygenases can tissue-specifically impact physiological processes. In Drosophila, mutations in CMO1 are associated with blindness (29von Lintig J. Wyss A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, CMO1 is required for RA production in certain developing cells (30Lampert J.M. Holzschuh J. Hessel S. Driever W. Vogt K. von Lintig J. Development. 2003; 130: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence for mammals exists that carotenoid derivatives produced by eccentric cleavage of β-carotene, such as β-14-apocarotenal, can influence gene regulation via PPARs and RXRs (31Ziouzenkova O. Orasanu G. Sukhova G. Lau E. Berger J.P. Tang G. Krinsky N.I. Dolnikowski G.G. Plutzky J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In humans, mutations in carotenoid monooxygenases have not yet been described in association with any known physiological disorder. Therefore, to learn more about mammalian carotenoid metabolism and function, here we have established and characterized a mouse model with a disruption of the CMO1 gene. Targeting Construct, Electroporation of Embryonic Stem Cells, and Generation of CMO1-/-Chimera—To obtain a homozygous CMO1 knock-out mouse, we used homologous recombination in TC1 ES cells to replace exon 2 and exon 3 of the wild-type CMO1 gene by an IRES-lacZ gene and a neomycinR cassette (Fig. 1). Three clones were isolated by PCR screening from a 129SvJ mouse BAC library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). They span three exons and a genomic region of ∼19.5 kb of the CMO1 gene. The flanking sequences (5′ arm, 3.9-kb SacI-ApaI fragment; 3′ arm, 3.4-kb ApaI-ApaI) were cloned into the pGL-1 vector. Approximately 8.8 kb, including half of exon 2 and exon 3, were deleted from the wild-type CMO1 allele and replaced by an IRES-lacZ cassette, followed by a neoR cassette between two loxP sites (Fig. 1). TC1 ES cells (embryonic stem cells from mouse strain 129SvJ/SvEvTac) were routinely cultured on mitomycin C-treated embryonic fibroblasts, in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C, 10% CO2 and subjected to G418 selection. For the electroporation into TC1 ES cells, 0.8 ml of a single cell suspension (5 × 106 cells/ml of phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+) were placed into a Bio-Rad electroporation cuvette. After the addition of 20 μg of the purified, NotI-linearized targeting construct, the electroporation was performed in a Bio-Rad GenePulser (Bio-Rad) at 240 V, 500 microfarads. After electroporation, the cells were seeded onto neomycin-resistant embryonic fibroblasts. The selection with 200 mg/ml G418 was started after 48 h. Individual clones were isolated 10–12 days after electroporation. All of the clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting using two specific probes. Two clones that have undergone homologous recombination were selected and injected into blastocytes, and approximately 200 blastocysts were transferred into pseudopregnant foster mothers. Chimerism was estimated according to the coat color of the litter. The male chimeric mice were backcrossed with female C57BL/6 to produce heterozygous and subsequently homozygous CMO1-/- mice. Confirmation of the Genotype by Southern Blot and PCR—The Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen) was used to isolate genomic DNA from mouse tail biopsies. Genotyping was carried out both by Southern blot analysis and by a combination of different PCRs (Fig. 1). PCR was performed with the following primers: neomycin up, 5′-ATG ATT GAA CAA GAT GGA TTG CAC GCA G-3′; neomycin down, 5′-GAT ATT CGG CAA GCA GGC ATC GCC AT-3′; Cmo1up, 5′-GAG AGA GCA AGT ACA ACC ATT GGT TTG ATG-3′; Cmo1down, 5′-CTT GTA AGA CTG TAA ATC CTG GTT TGA GAC-3′; LacZ long forward primer (5′-CCT CAA TTT GCT TTT TGG TCA TGG TG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTC GCC GCA CAT CTG AAC TTC AG-3′); neomycin long forward primer (5′-AGG TCT AAT TCC ATC AGA AGC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCA GCC ACT TCT CTG TGT CGA G-3′). For Southern blot analysis, 20 μg of genomic DNA were digested with KpnI (3′ arm) or EcoRV (5′ arm). After electrophoretic separation, DNA was transferred onto a Zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 3′ and 5′ probes. The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC and once with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min each. Animals, Diets, and Experimental Procedures—In all experiments, we used C57/BL6;129SvJ-CMO1tm1dnp (CMO1-/-) mice. For the analysis of vitamin A and lipid metabolism under β-carotene supplementation (β-carotene feeding study), we used mixed background F1 generation of C57/BL6;129SvJ mice (RCC Ltd.) as wild-type controls. For the analysis of vitamin A and lipid metabolism on the vitamin A-sufficient chow, we used C57/BL6 (Charles River) mice as wild-type controls. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with Swiss and German animal protection laws by the guidelines of the local veterinary authorities. Mice were maintained under environmentally controlled conditions (temperature 24 °C, 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle) and had ad libitum access to feed and water in all experiments. For the β-carotene supplementation study, basic feed consisted of the powdered Ssniff®EF 1/51 diet (Ssniff GmbH, Soest, Germany), containing a residual amount of 0.15 IU/g vitamin A. In the β-carotene feeding study, this chow was supplemented with β-carotene beadlets (10% CWS; DSM Ltd., Sisseln, Switzerland). The final amount of β-carotene in the feed was 1 mg/g. In all other experiments, mice were routinely fed with KLIBA 3430 chow (Provimi Kliba AG, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) containing 14 IU/g vitamin A. HPLC analysis revealed that this chow contains the carotenoids: β-carotene, zeaxanthin, and lutein. The high fat chow consisted of the KLIBA 3430 enriched with 30% (w/w) soybean oil and was purchased from Provimi Kliba AG (Kaiseraugst, Switzerland). For plasma and serum preparations, first blood was taken from the vena cava under deep anesthesia. The animals were then killed prior to organ removal. Immunoblot Analysis—For determination of blood RBP4 levels, a commercially available polyclonal antiserum raised against human RBP4 (Dako Cytomation) was used in a dilution of 1:1000. For the tubulin loading control, we used the antiserum AB6046 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in a dilution of 1:500. For determination of CMO1, we used an antiserum previously described (30Lampert J.M. Holzschuh J. Hessel S. Driever W. Vogt K. von Lintig J. Development. 2003; 130: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG whole molecules (Sigma). Immunoblots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of bands was performed by the Quantity-one (version 4.6) software (Bio-Rad). HPLC Separation for Retinoids and Carotenoids—Retinoids and carotenoids were extracted from tissues and plasma under dim red safety light (600 nm). Briefly, tissues (20–40 mg) were homogenized in 200 μl of 2 m hydroxylamine (pH 6.8) and 200 μl of methanol with a glass homogenizer. For determination of β-carotene and vitamin A blood levels, 200 μl of plasma was added to 200 μl of methanol. Then 400 μl of acetone was added either to plasma or tissue extracts. Extraction of carotenoids and retinoids was performed with petrolether. The extraction was repeated three times, and the collected organic phases were dried under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in HPLC solvent. HPLC separation of carotenoids and retinoids and quantification of peak integrals was performed as previously described (19von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Solvents for HPLC and extraction were purchased in HPLC grade from Merck. Determination of Tissue and Serum Lipids and Glucose Tolerance Test—Determination of the levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase in serum and tissues was carried out by the Central Laboratory Unit of the University Hospital Freiburg (Germany). For determination of the total lipid content, liver samples (5–15 mg) were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). Total lipid content was determined by Merckotest 3321 Total Lipids (Diagnostica Merck) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Glucose tolerance tests were performed by intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1 g/kg body weight) after overnight starvation. Blood glucose levels were determined by a glucometer (Accu-Chek Aviva; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. For this purpose, tail tips of the mice were nicked with a fresh razor blade for the collection of blood samples. Histology—For paraffin sections, livers were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and processed routinely into paraffin blocks. The embedded tissues were cut into 6-μm slices, mounted on charged adhesive slides, and dried overnight at 50 °C. Slides were then deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols to distilled water. Representative histologic sections of each specimen were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (Merck, Germany) according to the standard staining method of Ref. 32Lillie R. Connŉs Biological Stains, 9th Ed. Williams and Wilkins Co, Baltimore1977: 66-248Google Scholar or by Massonŉs trichrome stain (Sigma) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. For cryosections, livers were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight. The tissues were embedded in 1.5% agarose and sectioned with a cryostat (Microm HM 500-O) into 12-μm slices. After fixation, the sections were stained with Sudan Red 7B (Sigma) according to Refs. 32Lillie R. Connŉs Biological Stains, 9th Ed. Williams and Wilkins Co, Baltimore1977: 66-248Google Scholar and 33Su N. Ban P.M. Scheffrahn R.H. Sociobiology. 1991; 19: 349-362Google Scholar for general histological stain methods. RNA Preparation and Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from liver and visceral adipose tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. RNA samples were cleaned up, DNase I-digested with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), and quantified spectrophotometrically. Integrity of the extracted RNA was verified by gel electrophoresis. For cDNA synthesis, 0.5 μg of total RNA (in a final volume of 25 μl) was denatured at 65 °C for 10 min. Then cDNA synthesis was carried out for 15 min at 20 °C and 45 min at 42 °C with reverse transcriptase (MuLV RT; Applied Biosystems). The reaction was stopped at 95 °C for 5 min using a thermal cycler (Progene). For qRT-PCR analysis of target genes, the following primers were used: PPARα, 5′-CGA TGC TGT CCT CCT TGA TGA-3′ and 5′-CTC GCG TGT GAT AAA GCC ATT-3′; ACOX1, 5′-GAT TGG TAG AAA TTG CTG CAA AAA-3′ and 5′-ACG CCA CTT CCT TGC TCT TC-3′; SREBP1c, 5′-CCA GAG GGT GAG CCT GAC AA-3′ and 5′-AGC CTC TGC AAT TTC CAG ATC T-3′; FASN, 5′-CCA AGC AGG CAC ACA CAA-3′ and 5′-CAC TCA CAC CCA CCC AGA-3′; SCD1, 5′-TTC CGC CAC TCG CCT ACA-3′ and 5′-CTT TCC CAG TGC TGA GAT CGA-3′; CD36, 5′-AAT TAG AAC CGG GCC ACG TA-3′ and 5′-CGC CAA CTC CCA GGT ACA A-3′; FABP4, 5′-ATG TGT GAT GCC TTT GTG G-3′ and 5′-CTG TCG TCT GCG GTG ATT T-3′. As housekeeping gene, we used β-actin (5′-ACG GGC ATT GTG ATG GAC TC-3′ and 5′-GTG GTG GTG AAG CTG TAG CC-3′). qRT-PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 μl, consisting of diluted (1:50) cDNA template, forward and reverse primers (1–2 μm each), and SYBR Green ROX Mastermix (ABgene) with an ABI prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Germany). After an initial enzyme activation (95 °C for 15 min), 40 cycles at 60 °C were performed for anneal/extension steps, and fluorescence was measured. In order to verify purity of PCR products, we performed 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Additionally, a dissociation curve program was performed after each reaction. Relative quantification of target genes was calculated according to Ref. 34Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25420) Google Scholar, based on the efficiency of each reaction and the crossing point deviation of each sample versus a control and expressed in comparison with a reference gene (β-actin). Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as means ± S.D. Studentŉs t test was used to analyze data between the controls and knock-out strains. p values of ≤0.05 were considered significant. Mouse CMO1 Gene and Targeting Construct—The CMO1 gene appears to be present as a single copy in the mouse (and human) genome. The entire mouse CMO1 gene sequence can be found at the NCBI site on the World Wide Web as a complement (44443023.44480639) at locus NT_078575 (GenBank™) containing 37,617 bp. CMO1 is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the intestine, testis, liver, spleen, and adipocytes (21Wyss A. Wirtz G.M. Woggon W.D. Brugger R. Wyss M. Friedlein A. Riss G. Bachmann H. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham Jr., F.X. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A mouse CMO1 genomic sequence was isolated by screening of a 129SvJ mouse BAC library. A targeting vector was constructed to replace half of exon 2 and exon 3 with an IRES-lacZ cassette and a neomycinR cassette (Fig. 1A), linearized with NotI and electroporated into ES cells (129S6/SvEvTac). ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Initial screening for homologous recombination was carried out by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1C). The male chimeric mice were backcrossed with female C57BL/6 mice to produce heterozygous and subsequently homozygous CMO1-/- mice. The wild-type allele was routinely identified using the primer pair CMO1up and CMO1down (diagnostic fragment 351 bp) and the knock-out gene using CMO1up and lacZlongdown (diagnostic fragment 588 bp) (Fig. 1B). The expression of CMO1 was abolished in the liver of CMO1-/- mice as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D). CMO1-/- mice developed normally, and females and males were fertile on a standard mouse chow, thus excluding a developmental role of CMO1 and β-carotene when preformed vitamin A is available. β-Carotene Metabolism Is Impaired in CMO1 Deficiency—To analyze the consequences of CMO1 deficiency on a diet that provides β-carotene as the major dietary source for vitamin A, we performed a feeding experiment. To deplete endogenous stores for retinoids (i.e. in the liver), we already subjected control and CMO1-/- breeders to a diet poor in vitamin A (0.15 IU/g). This dietary regimen caused no obvious clinical symptoms related to vitamin A deficiency in breeders or likewise in control and CMO1-/- offspring. Upon weaning, animals were continuously raised on a diet low in vitamin A, but they additionally received β-carotene (1000 ppm). After 16 weeks, the consequence of CMO1 deficiency was already visible upon sectioning. CMO1-/- mice but not wild-type control animals showed an orange coloring in visceral adipose tissue (Fig. 2, A and B), in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and in the intestine (Fig. 2, C and D). Retinoid production from β-carotene already takes place in intestinal cells. Therefore, we first performed HPLC analysis with intestinal lipid extracts. This analysis confirmed β-carotene accumulation in CMO1-/- mice, whereas in controls besides β-carotene (Fig. 2F), cleavage products, such as retinyl esters and all-trans-retinol, were present (Fig. 2, G and H). This lack of intestinal β-carotene conversion in CMO1-/- mice was accompanied by a ∼35-fold increase of β-carotene blood levels (Fig. 2E). To further assess the consequence of CMO1 deficiency, we determined β-carotene and retinoid (retinyl esters and retinol) levels in additional tissues that are known to express the CMO1 gene (Fig. 3). In all of these tissues, levels of β-carotene were increased as compared with control animals. Conversely, tissue vitamin A levels were decreased in CMO1-/- mice as compared with controls. Only in the kidney were retinol levels low and indistinguishable between CMO1-/- and control animals. Thus, CMO1 deficiency impaired β-carotene metabolism, and the provitamin accumulated in several tissues. CMO1-/-Mice Develop Liver Steatosis when β-Carotene Is Provided as the Major Dietary Source for Vitamin A—We next looked to see whether CMO1 deficiency is associated with any additional phenotype under β-carotene supplementation. We found that livers of CMO1-/- mice had a pale color. Determination of the lipid content of the livers revealed a significant increase over control levels (Fig. 4C). Histological analysis of liver slices showed abnormalities of hepatocytes in centrolobular and midzonal regions (Fig. 4, D and E). These hepatocytes contained large droplets positively staining for lipids (Fig. 4, A and B). HPLC analysis revealed that liver vitamin A (retinyl esters and retinol) was significantly lower as compared with controls (Fig. 4G). Instead, β-carotene accumulation was found in the livers of CMO1-/- mice (Fig. 4H). This impairment in liver vitamin A homeostasis was also seen by an accumulation of the serum retinol-binding protein (RBP4) (Fig. 4, F and I). RBP4 is produced in the liver and secreted in a vitamin A-dependent manner to deliver vitamin A to peripheral target tissues (35O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35647-35657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, CMO1-/- mice developed a fatty liver and displayed depleted vitamin A liver stores when β-carotene was provided as the major dietary source for vitamin A. Liver Steatosis Is Related to CMO1 Deficiency and Develops Independently of the Vitamin A Status of the Diet—β-Carotene derivatives, such as RA, can influence liver fatty acid metabolism (e.g. genetic disruption of RA signaling can cause liver steatosis and steatohepatitis) (36Yanagitani A. Yamada S. Yasui S. Shimomura T. Murai R. Murawaki Y. Hashiguchi K. Kanbe T. Saeki T. Ichiba M. Tanabe Y. Yoshida Y. Morino S. Kurimasa A. Usuda N. Yamazaki H. Kunisada T. Ito H. Murawaki Y. Shiota G. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We found that CMO1-/- mice developed a fatty liver when β-carotene was provided as the major precursor for vitamin A. Therefore, we next wondered whether this liver phenotype can be prevented by feeding mice with preformed vitamin A. To address this question, we bred and raised mice on a vitamin A-sufficient standard chow (14 IU of vitamin A/g). In a first set of experiments, we performed Massonŉs trichrome staining for collagen of liver sections of CMO1-deficient animals with different ages (n = 2 per age) (Fig. 5, A–C). We found that hepatocytes of 3-month-old animals already contained some lipid droplets (Fig. 5B). Droplets were larger and more widespread in livers of 12-month-old animals (Fig. 5C), but this analysis revealed that this alteration was not accompanied by enhanced collagen deposition, a characteristic of liver fibrosis (37Campbell J.S. Hughes S.D. Gilbertson D.G. Palmer T.E. Holdren M.S. Haran A.C. Odell M.M. Bauer R.L. Ren H.P. Haugen H.S. Yeh M.M. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3389-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For a developmental and more defined analysis, we used 25-week-old CMO1-/- mice and age-matched controls (n = 10/genotype), raised and bred under the same environmental and dietary conditions. CMO1-/- mice had significantly elevated levels of total lipids as compared with control animals (Fig. 5D). Additionally, livers of CMO1-/- mice contained significantly more triglycerides (Fi"

https://openalex.org/W1980273151,"Membrane attack is important for mammalian immune defense against invading microorganisms and infected host cells. Proteins of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) and the protein perforin share a common MACPF domain that is responsible for membrane insertion and pore formation. We determined the crystal structure of the MACPF domain of complement component C8α at 2.5 angstrom resolution and show that it is structurally homologous to the bacterial, pore-forming, cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. The structure displays two regions that (in the bacterial cytolysins) refold into transmembrane β hairpins, forming the lining of a barrel pore. Local hydrophobicity explains why C8α is the first complement protein to insert into the membrane. The size of the MACPF domain is consistent with known C9 pore sizes. These data imply that these mammalian and bacterial cytolytic proteins share a common mechanism of membrane insertion."

https://openalex.org/W2034872735,"Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family and has been thought to be involved in suppressing mitochondrial ROS production through uncoupling mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis. However, we show here that loss of function of UCP2 does not result in a significant increase in ROS production or an increased propensity for cells to undergo senescence in culture. Instead, Ucp2-/- cells display enhanced proliferation associated with a metabolic switch from fatty acid oxidation to glucose metabolism. This metabolic switch requires the unrestricted availability of glucose, and Ucp2-/- cells more readily activate autophagy than wild-type cells when deprived of glucose. Altogether, these results suggest that UCP2 promotes mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation while limiting mitochondrial catabolism of pyruvate. The persistence of fatty acid catabolism in Ucp2+/+ cells during a proliferative response correlates with reduced cell proliferation and enhances resistance to glucose starvation-induced autophagy."

Proper localization and activity of sorLA are dependent on functional interaction with GGA and PACS-1, adaptor proteins involved in protein transport to and from the trans-Golgi network.

Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13461-13466Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). APP follows a complex trafficking pathway through secretory and endocytic compartments that determines processing into amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic products. It is generally believed that in route to the cell surface, most newly synthesized APP molecules are cleaved by α-secretase in a post-Golgi compartment or at the plasma membrane to produce soluble (s)APPα. Alternatively, some precursor molecules are re-internalized from the plasma membrane and delivered to late endocytic compartments for β-secretase (and subsequent γ-secretase) processing into sAPPβ and amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) (7De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Because alternative targeting of APP to Golgi compartments or to endosomes is a crucial determinant of proteolytic processing and Aβ production (9Small S.A. Gandy S. Neuron. 2006; 52: 15-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), much attention has been focused on elucidating the underlying regulatory mechanisms. A decisive role for sorLA in this process has been suggested because sorLA directly interacts with APP and colocalizes with the precursor in the perinuclear region of neuronal cell types (6Andersen O.M.

Binding to sorLA results in sequestration of APP in intracellular compartments and in reduction of APP processing into both sAPPα and Aβ products (6Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M.

The significance of sorLA as negative regulator of APP processing in vivo is supported by studies in sorLA-deficient mice that exhibit significantly higher levels of Aβ in the brain compared with control animals (6Andersen O.M.

Here, we used wild type and trafficking defective mutants of sorLA to decipher the molecular mechanisms governing the intracellular transport route of the receptor, and their relevance for APP transport and amyloidogenic peptide production. Materials—Antibodies against sorLA were provided by Claus Munck Petersen (University of Aarhus); antisera against APP were produced in-house (1227) or obtained from commercial suppliers (6E10, Signet; JP18957, IBL, Hamburg). Constructs for expression of paGFP- and mRFP-tagged APP and sorLA variants were provided by Robert Spoelgen (Harvard Medical School); HA-PACS-1 and GFP-GGA-1 were from Gary Thomas (Oregon Health Sciences University) and Juan S. Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), respectively. A plasmid encoding fluorescence-tagged endosomal marker Rab11A-GFP was obtained by cloning the respective cDNA from the UMR cDNA Resource Center into the pEGFPC2 vector from Clontech. The marker pDsRedm-GalT was purchased from Clontech; Alexa Fluor633-conjugated transferrin from Invitrogen. Generation of SorLA Variants—SorLA variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the human cDNA using a PCR-based cloning strategy. The amino acid changes introduced into the sorLA polypeptide sequence were sorLAΔcd (stop at Phe-2141), sorLAgga (D2180A, M2183A), and sorLAacidic (D2162A, D2163A, E2166A, D2167A, D2168A, E2169A, D2170A). For sorLAKKLN primers 5′-GCGCGGCCGCAAAGCAGATGCATCTGCAACGCAGGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-CGCTCGAGTCAGTTGAGTTTTTTGGCTATCACCATGGGGACGTCATCTGAAAATCC-3′ were used. Parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) clone 13-5-1 stably expressing human APP695 (in pcDNA3.1, selection with 500 μg/ml hygromycin) was kindly provided by Anton Roebroek (Catholic University of Leuven). CHO 13-5-1 as well as SH-SY5Y cells were stably transfected with expression constructs for sorLA variants (in pcDNA3.1, selection with 300 μg/ml zeocin). Cell Culture Experiments—Cellular localization of proteins was detected by sequential scanning confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using Alexa 488-, Alexa 555-, or Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies and a ×100 Plan-Apo-chromat oil objective. Subcellular fractionation of cells by discontinuous iodixanol density gradient was performed according to published protocols (6Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P. Wu X. Bales K.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Gliemann J. Mufson E.J. Hyman B.T. Paul S.M. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13461-13466Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated in cysteine- and methionine-free medium (Sigma) for 60 min prior to biolabeling using 200 μCi of l-[35S]cysteine and l-[35S]methionine/ml (Pro-mix, Amersham Biosciences) for 7 min. Thereafter, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, chased for various time points, and lysed. Lysates were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) pre-coated with antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acid residues of human APP (IgG 1227). After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, beads were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and prepared for standard SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For deglycosylation studies, protein extracts were incubated with neuraminidase (Roche) and O-glycosidase (Roche) in 60 mm Na-acetate, pH 5.5, overnight at 16 °C, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For FACS analysis, cells were harvested and incubated in FACS buffer (0.1% fetal calf serum, 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) without (surface staining) or with 0.1% saponin (total staining), followed by incubation with primary anti-sorLA (1:40), and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary IgG (1:100). Cells were subjected to FACS analysis (10,000 events/gate) using program BD Biosciences CellQuest Pro Version 5.2.1. Co-immunoprecipitations—CHO cells stably expressing sorLA variants were transiently transfected with constructs encoding GFP-tagged GGA-1 or HA-tagged PACS-1. After 48 h, cells were washed and lysed in Triton X-100/Nonidet P-40 buffer on ice. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-sorLA serum or anti-HA1.1 IgG1 (Covance), and protein G-coupled Sepharose beads (Pierce) according to standard protocols. Live Cell Imaging—CHO cells on coverslips were transferred in medium buffered with 20 mm HEPES to a live cell chamber heated to 37 °C on the microscope stage. A LSM510 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a pulsed, tunable TiSa laser (Chameleon, Coherent) and a ×40 or ×63 Plan-Apo-chromat oil objective was used. paGFP was photoactivated by a 820-nm laser pulse with 5% transmission at zoom 30 for 0.5 s. Stacks of z-sections of GFP (excitation (ex): 488 nm, 3% transmission, emission (em): 500-550 nm BP) and mRFP/mDsRed (ex: 543 nm, 10-15% transmission, em: 560 nm LP) were sequentially acquired before and after photoactivation. Z-stacks were aligned for drift in x,y,z direction. Projections of confocal z-stacks are displayed. Single aligned z-sections were used for quantification of mean fluorescence intensity of a selected area using LSM software Image Examiner. For quantification of sorLA in recycling endosomes, representative micrographs from CHO-A/Swt and CHO-A/Sgga cells were converted into binary images, and the number of peripheral vesicles either stained for sorLA only or for sorLA and Rab11 were counted manually. APP Processing Products—The amount of sAPP, carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTF), and Aβ products were determined by Western blotting (antisera WO2, 1227, and JP18957) or ELISA (KHB3482 for Aβ40 and KHB3442 for Aβ42; BIOSOURCE). Statistical significance of the data were determined using Student's t test. Previously, we reported that co-expression with sorLA results in accumulation of APP in the perinuclear region and in reduced exposure on the surface of cultured cells (6Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P. Wu X. Bales K.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Gliemann J. Mufson E.J. Hyman B.T. Paul S.M. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13461-13466Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). To dissect which step in the intracellular transport route of APP may be influenced by sorLA, we studied its trafficking through the secretory and endocytic compartments in CHO and in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells in the presence or absence of sorLA. Initially, we characterized export of nascent APP molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To do so, we studied acquisition of carbohydrate modifications on APP, indicative of subsequent ER and Golgi maturation steps. In CHO cell lysates, APP immunoreactivity was seen in three distinct bands (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cell extracts with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase uncovered that the high molecular weight band (sensitive to neuraminidase) represented the mature protein, carrying terminally modified N,O-linked carbohydrates. The intermediate sized band corresponded to APP carrying complex O-linked carbohydrates as it was sensitive to O-glycosidase. The lowest molecular weight band represented the immature precursor in the ER as it was resistant to neuraminidase and O-glycosidase treatment. No qualitative difference in this pattern was seen when comparing CHO cells stably expressing human APP695 (CHO-A) and APP695 with sorLA (CHO-A/Swt) (Fig. 1A). However, CHO-A/Swt cells showed an increase in O-glycosylated APP products (middle and upper protein bands) compared with CHO-A cells (Fig. 1A, bracket), suggesting accumulation of the mature protein in the presence of sorLA (ratio mature/immature APP: 0.67 ± 0.06 in CHO-A/Swt versus 0.46 ± 0.06 in CHO-A, p = 0.04). This effect was also seen in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells expressing the wild type receptor (supplemental Fig. S1). Accumulation of the mature APP species in the presence of sorLAwt was confirmed by studying the time course of glycosylation in pulse-chase experiments in CHO cells (Fig. 1B). The emergence of partially and fully glycosylated forms of APP (mature APP) followed similar kinetics in cells with and without sorLA (20 min chase), but their protein half-life was significantly extended in the presence of the sorting receptor as shown by determining the ratio of signal intensities for mature versus immature APP species (120 min chase; p < 0.01) (Fig. 1C). As trafficking of APP from ER to Golgi compartments was unaffected by sorLA, we investigated its effect on APP transport through the Golgi, the major site of APP concentration in the cell (17Caporaso G.L. Takei K. Gandy S.E. Matteoli M. Mundigl O. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3122-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significant co-localization of sorLA and APP in this compartment has been reported before (6Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P. Wu X. Bales K.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Gliemann J. Mufson E.J. Hyman B.T. Paul S.M. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To test the consequence of sorLA activity on APP transit through this organelle, we used live cell imaging to visualize exit of the protein from the perinuclear region. APP immunoreactivity in this region mainly co-localized with β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT), a marker for the trans-Golgi/TGN compartments (data not shown). A photoactivable APP-green fluorescent fusion protein (APP-paGFP) was activated in the perinuclear region (identified by co-expression with constitutively fluorescent APP-red fluorescent protein; APP-RFP) by a short laser pulse, and the trafficking out of this area recorded as a decrease in green fluorescence signal (schematic in Fig. 2D). In CHO cells expressing APP only (Fig. 2A), the precursor exhibited rapid export from the perinuclear region as shown by the immediate appearance of vesicles containing APP-paGFP outside the area of photoactivation. Overall, the decrease in fluorescence signal in the photoactivated region was more than 60% within 12 min after laser pulse (Fig. 2C). Intriguingly, exit of APP-paGFP from the perinuclear region was impaired in the presence of sorLA-RFP as shown by the delayed appearance of APP-paGFP-positive vesicles in distal cell compartments (12 min after pulse; Fig. 2B, p < 0.005). In fact, the decrease in green fluorescence in this region was not significantly different from that caused by unspecific bleaching of the cells during image acquisition as shown for fixed control cells (Fig. 2C). As well as regulating export of APP from the trans-Golgi/TGN, sorLA may also affect retrograde trafficking of precursor molecules internalized from the cell surface to this compartment. To test this hypothesis, we immunolabeled APP molecules on the surface of CHO-A and CHO-A/Swt cells kept at 4 °C to block endocytosis. When the cells were shifted to 37 °C, endocytic uptake and subcellular targeting of APP was evaluated using co-localization with Alexa 633-transferrin (endosomes) and GalT (trans-Golgi/TGN) (supplemental Fig. S2). No discernable differences were seen for the appearance of APP in endosomes (after 30 min) or in trans-Golgi/TGN (after 120 min) when comparing cells with (CHO-A/Swt) and without sorLA (CHO-A), indicating that endocytic uptake and retrograde targeting of APP were not influenced by the receptor. So far, our studies had uncovered a critical function for sorLA as trans-Golgi/TGN-localized receptor controlling APP exit from these compartments. To conceptually prove the ability of sorLA to act as retention factor for APP, we generated a receptor variant that carried four extra amino acid residues (KKLN) at the carboxyl terminus (sorLAkkln). This di-lysine peptide sequence acts as an ER retention motif in some transmembrane proteins. Accordingly, sorLAkkln mainly resided in the ER and was blocked from exit to the Golgi in stably transfected CHO cells as indicated by subcellular fraction studies (Fig. 3A). Aberrant sequestration of sorLAkkln in the ER caused redistribution of APP to the same compartment as deduced from fractionation studies that uncovered APP in ER and Golgi fractions in cells expressing sorLAwt but only in the ER in sorLAkkln expressing cells (Fig. 3A). Sequestration of sorLAkkln in the ER was also demonstrated by faster electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B, upper panel) compared with sorLAwt, indicating the absence of terminal glycosylation. In line with a sorLAkkln-dependent blockade of ER exit of APP, accumulation of immature and decrease of mature forms of the protein was seen in cells expressing sorLAkkln (CHO-A/Skkln) compared with cells without sorLA (CHO-A) (Fig. 3B, middle panel) (ratio mature/immature APP: 0.43 ± 0.06 versus 0.57 ± 0.03, p = 0.02). Finally, the inability of APP to enter distal secretory compartments harboring secretase activities was confirmed by a 66 ± 4.8% decrease in processing to sAPPα (Fig. 3B, lower panel; p < 0.001) and 95% reduction in conversion to Aβ40 (Fig. 3C; p < 0.0009) that was not seen in CHO-A cells. Similar findings were obtained in SH-SY5Y cells expressing sorLAkkln (supplemental Fig. S3). A number of cellular mechanisms are known that target proteins to and from the TGN including interaction with sorting adaptors GGA and PACS-1 (18Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 19Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Binding of GGA-1 and -2 to a tetrapeptide motif DVPM in the tail of sorLA has been demonstrated before (4Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Geraerts W.P. Gliemann J. Smit A.B. Petersen C.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An acidic cluster that may serve as binding site for PACS-1 is also present in the cytoplasmic receptor domain. To dissect regulatory elements in sorLA that convey TGN targeting, we constructed receptor mutants with point mutations in the tail sequence presumed to abolish adaptor bindings (Fig. 4A). Thus, we generated mutants lacking the acidic cluster (sorLAacidic) or the GGA binding site (sorLAgga), or the entire cytoplasmic domain (sorLAΔcd). Activity of these mutants was compared with sorLAwt. All mutants were stably expressed in parental CHO-A cells harboring the human APP695 transgene (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, co-expression with sorLAwt but with no other sorLA variant caused accumulation of mature APP, indicating loss of protective function of sorLA by any of the modifications (Fig. 4B). The inability of mutant receptors to protect APP from processing was not due to impaired interaction with the precursor protein as all sorLA variants were able to co-immunoprecipitate APP (Fig. 4C). However, sorLAgga and sorLAacidic failed to co-immunoprecipitate GGA-1 (Fig. 4D) and PACS-1 (Fig. 4E), respectively, consistent with disruption of the individual adaptor binding sites in the mutants. Inability to interact with both GGA-1 and PACS-1 was also seen for sorLAΔcd that lacks the entire receptor tail (Fig. 4, D and E). Next, we investigated the consequences of the sorLA tail mutations on cellular trafficking of the receptor polypeptide and its target APP. Although all sorLA variants exhibited partial colocalization with APP in the perinuclear region as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy of permeabilized cells (Fig. 5), a clear distinction in two receptor categories was shown by surface staining of cells not permeabilized prior to antibody incubation (Fig. 5, insets). Whereas cell lines expressing sorLAΔcd and sorLAacidic exhibited pronounced signals for sorLA and APP on the plasma membrane, little cell surface staining was observed in cells expressing sorLAwt and sorLAgga. Quantification of surface exposure by FACS analysis revealed statistical significant differences (p < 0.004) for sorLAΔcd (51.2 ± 6.8% receptor on cell surface) and sorLAacidic (42.9 ± 3.9%) compared with sorLAwt (20.1 ± 5.4%) (see “Experimental Procedures” for experimental details). Aberrant surface localization of sorLAΔcd and sorLAacidic was also confirmed by subcellular fractionation of CHO cell lines using Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). As reference, the presence of marker proteins for specific cell compartments was evaluated in parallel (Fig. 6B). In all cell lines, distinct peaks for sorLA were seen in fractions containing markers of ER (glucose-related protein 78, Grp78; fractions 3-4) and Golgi (Golgi SNARE 28, GS28; fractions 4-11). Whereas only 3% of sorLAwt protein was detected in the peak fractions of the plasma membrane (β1-integrin; fractions 15-16), accumulation of variants sorLAΔcd and sorLAacidic in this compartment was evident (23-28% of total protein). This finding was in line with predominant surface localization of these two mutants seen in immunofluorescence (Fig. 5) and FACS sorting (see above) experiments. Surprisingly, in addition to ER and Golgi peak fractions, sorLAgga was also enriched in fractions 16 and 17 that contained endosomes, but partially also overlapped with the plasma membrane (peak fractions 15 and 16). The ratio of sorLAgga protein mass in endosomal versus plasma membrane fractions was increased to ∼1:1 compared with other receptor variants (∼1:3). Because no obvious difference in subcellular localization between sorLAgga and sorLAwt was seen from the immunofluorescence analysis in Fig. 5, we mapped the localization of both proteins more precisely using markers of various endocytic compartments. A subtle but consistent difference was seen with Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes, that partially colocalized with sorLAgga but to a lesser extent with the wild type protein (supplemental Fig. S4). Quantification of a total of 700 peripheral vesicles for each cell line that stained positive for sorLA identified 22.0 ± 1.6% co-localization with Rab11 in CHO-A/Swt but 43.6 ± 3.6% in CHO-A/Sgga (p = 0.0004). This feature suggested faulty recycling to the plasma membrane (rather than retrograde TGN trafficking) for sorLAgga. Cell surface recycling was supported independently by the appearance of some shedded extracellular domains of sorLAgga in the cell supernatant (supplemental Fig. S5). Typically, the ectodomain is released by proteolysis of sorLA by metalloproteases (20Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect seen most pronounced for cell surface variants sorLAΔcd and sorLAacidic, but not for the wild type form of the receptor under these conditions (supplemental Fig. 5). Given the distinct distribution of various sorLA mutants in either trans-Golgi/TGN, the recycling compartment, or at the plasma membrane, we investigated the effects of these variants on APP processing. When the subcellular fractions of CHO cells in Fig. 6A were probed for the presence of APP, accumulation of the mature protein species was seen exclusively in Golgi fractions of CHO-A/Swt cells but not in this compartment or any other compartment of CHO-A/SΔcd (p < 0.01; Fig. 6C) or other mutant cell lines (data not shown). This finding confirmed that sorLAwt has the unique property to accumulate mature APP molecules in the Golgi, most likely by extending the transit time of the precursor through this compartment. SorLA mutants that lack the ability to interact with GGA and PACS-1 do not parallel such activity. We also analyzed how altered localization of sorLA (and APP) may affect the generation of APP processing products, initially focusing on the two intracellular variants, sorLAwt and sorLAgga. Consistent with earlier observations, co-expression of"

Our technique allows us to separate and quantify three fundamental contributions involved in magnetization switching (i.e., current-induced spin torque, heating the island by the tunneling current, and Oersted field effects), thereby providing an improved understanding of the switching mechanism."

Kim A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The APOBEC family in humans includes APOBEC1 (hA1), APOBEC2 (hA2), APOBEC3A-H (hA3A-H), and activation-induced cytidine deaminase. The APOBEC proteins are capable of inhibiting the replication of a wide variety of retroviruses and non-retroviruses, suggesting that these proteins represent a novel component of innate immunity to viral infection (for review, see Refs. 3Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and 4Yu X.-F. Curr. Opin. HIV AIDS. 2006; 1: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The virus counters hA3G’s anti-viral activity with the viral protein Vif (virion infectivity factor), which binds to hA3G, and targets hA3G for proteasomal degradation (5Stopak K. Kim C. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 6Yu X. Kim Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Vif is thus required for HIV-1 replication in cell types that constitutively express hA3G (termed “non-permissive” cells), such as primary T lymphocytes, macrophages, and T-cell lines such as H9. Vif is not required for viral replication in cells not expressing hA3G (“permissive” cells) such as SupT1, Jurkat, 293, HeLa, and CEM-SS lines (7Fisher A.G. Kim B. Ivanoff L. Chamberlain M.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6489-6495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1-containing hA3G shows a reduced ability to produce new viral DNA upon infecting cells (10Goncalves J. Kim Y. Zack J. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8701-8709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li J. Kim M.J. Volsky D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 560-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Mangeat B. Kim P. Caron G.

It has been suggested that this results from the degradation of newly synthesized viral DNA, rather than the inhibition of new DNA synthesis. Thus, because the small amount of minus strand cDNA that is made in newly infected cells (∼5% of wild type) contains 1-2% of the cytosines deaminated by hA3G to form uracil (12Mangeat B. Kim P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 14Zhang H. Kim B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L.

Science. 2003; 300: 1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that most newly synthesized viral DNA edited in this manner will be degraded by the DNA repair system. For example, DNA glycosylases such as UNG2, a uracil DNA glycosylase packaged into HIV-1 (17Selig L. Kim S. Rogel M.E. Wu L.I. Vodicka M.A. Sire J. Benarous R. Emerman M. J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can recognize an altered base and remove the base by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, resulting in either a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate group that is a substrate for DNA repair enzymes or in the degradation of the DNA (19Fromme J.C. Kim G.L. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2004; 69: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, a reduction in UNG2 incorporation into HIV-1 containing hA3G, using either an UNG2 inhibitor or virus-producing cells lacking endogenous UNG2 activity, had no effect on the antiviral capacity of hA3G, i.e. in the presence of hA3G, viral infectivity and resulting synthesis of viral DNA are reduced equally with or without viral UNG2 (20Kaiser S.M. Kim M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several reports have shown that mutant hA3G (21Chiu Y.L. Kim V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W.

Chem. 2007; 282: 2587-2595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) that have lost their cytidine deaminase activity still show strong anti-HIV-1 activity and a reduction in viral DNA synthesis, and hA3F and/or hA3G can also inhibit hepatitis B virus replication with little or no editing (25Rosler C.

Science. 2004; 303: 1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). One should then consider the possibility that hA3G inhibits reverse transcription. We have recently reported that Vif-negative virions containing hA3G show a 55% reduction in the production of early viral DNA in newly infected cells and that this is correlated with a similar reduction in the initiation of reverse transcription (22Guo F. Kim S. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11710-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide further evidence that the greater (∼95%) reduction in late DNA synthesis can be accounted for by the hA3G-induced inhibition of minus and plus strand transfer steps in reverse transcription. Plasmid Construction, Cell Transfections, and Virus Purification—BH10 is a simian virus 40-based vector that contains full-length wild-type HIV-1 proviral DNA. The construction of BH10.Vif-, as well as wild-type and mutant forms of hA3G has been previously described (27Cen S. Kim F. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Deflassieux J. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33177-33184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The culture and transfection of HEK-293T cells with these plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the isolation of virions 48 h post-transfection from the cell supernatant, were done as previously described (22Guo F. Kim S. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11710-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Cen S. Kim F. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Deflassieux J. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33177-33184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, 293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of HIV-1 proviral DNA and 1 μg of plasmid coding for wild-type or mutant forms of hA3G. The total amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection was kept constant in controls by replacing plasmid coding for hA3G with the empty vector, pcDNA3.1. Viral p24 was measured with a commercial kit available for p24 antigen capture (Abbott Laboratories). Culture of SupT1 and its infection with the HIV-1 produced from 293T cells, were as previously described (22Guo F. Kim S. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11710-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Cellular and viral proteins were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell and viral lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE HealthCare). Western blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies that are specifically reactive with HIV-1 capsid (Zepto Metrocs Inc.), hA3G (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), hemagglutinin (HA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and β-actin (Sigma), or with Vif-specific polyclonal antiserum 2221 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Detection of proteins was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using as secondary antibodies anti-mouse (for hA3G, capsid, HA, and β-actin) and anti-rabbit (for Vif) antibodies, both obtained from GE HealthCare. Bands in Western blots were quantitated using the ImageJ 1.35s automated digitizing system (National Institutes of Health). Quantitation of Newly Synthesized HIV-1 DNA—Real-time fluorescence-monitored PCR, using the LightCycler Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH), was used to monitor, over a 24-h period post-infection, the synthesis of viral cDNA intermediates in a permissive cell line, SupT1, that had been infected with Vif-negative HIV-1 containing or lacking hA3G. Equal amounts of DNase-treated virions (100 ng of p24) were used to infect 2.4 × 107 SupT1 cells rotating at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells with bound viruses were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and aliquots of × 106 cells were plated into 24-well plates containing complete RPMI 1640 medium pre-warmed to 37 °C and incubated at 37 °C. At different time points post-infection, equal aliquots of cells were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular DNA was extracted using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Equal amounts of cellular genomic DNA (determined spectrophotometrically at an optical density of 260 nm) were used to quantitate viral cDNA intermediates containing sequences for either R-U5, R-U3, pol, gag, or U5-gag, which represents, respectively, minus strand strong stop DNA, minus strand transfer DNA/early minus single strand DNA, middle minus single strand DNA, late minus single strand DNA, and plus strand-transfer DNA. Five pairs of primers were used: U5-R forward, 5′-TTAGACCAGATCTGAGCCTGGGAG; U5-R reverse, 5′-GGGTCTGAGGGATCTCAGTTACC; R-U3 forward, 5′-CGGGACTGGGGAGTGGCGAGC; R-U3 reverse, 5′-CAGAGTCACACAACAGACGGGC; pol forward, 5′-GGGAGCCACACAATGAATG; 5′pol reverse, 5′-CCAGGGCTCTAGTCTAGGATC; gag forward, 5′-GGCGGCGACTGGTGAGTAC; gag reverse, 5′-CCCTGCTTGCCCATACTATATG; U5-gag forward, 5′-TGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGA; and U5-gag reverse, 5′-GAGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGAGCT. All analyses were done in triplicate, with triplicate samples in each experiment. The statistical analyses employed herein include column statistics and one-way analysis of variance. The lowest level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Quantitation of Viral Genomic RNA in the Cell—SupT1 cells were infected with equal amounts of wild-type or Vif-negative HIV-1, and then were collected at the different time point of post-infection, as above described. Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and β-actin mRNA was quantitated using real-time reverser transcription (RT)-PCR as described previously (28Wu X. Kim J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Samples of total cellular RNA containing equal amounts of β-actin mRNA were used to generate cDNA containing the 5′-long terminal repeat of the viral genome, using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the U5-R primer, 5′-GGGTCTGAGGGATCTCAGTTACC. The amount of cDNA containing the 5′-long terminal repeat of the viral genome was determined using real-time fluorescence-monitored PCR with a pair of primers U5-R forward and reverse, as described above. In Vitro Analysis of Minus Strand Transfer—Using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion), an RNA template of 384 nt was synthesized from the linearized Tp-2 DNA (29Guo X. Kim M. Wei X. Roques B. Gotte M. Liang C. Wainberg M.A. Virology. 2003; 307: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The RNA template contained both the 5′ and 3′ R regions and is competent to support strand transfer. An 18-nt DNA oligonucleotide (5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA), complimentary to the PBS, was used as primer in the reactions described below. The DNA oligomer, 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase, was annealed to the RNA template by heating at 85 °C for 5 min and gradually cooling to room temperature. Final reactions contained 2.25 μm NCp7, 50 nm RNA template, 100 nm primer DNA, 0.1 mm of each dNTP, 100 ng of RT, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Ambion), in a volume of 20 μl. Various concentrations of purified hA3G or hA3G-containing cell lysate were added to the reaction mixtures to test their effects on minus strand transfer. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min, followed by the addition of 1 μl of proteinase K, and further incubated at 65 °C for 20 min. After extraction by phenol/chloroform, the deproteinized reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, and the different bands were quantitated by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Minus strand transfer efficiency is determined by the ratio of T-DNA (transfer DNA, 296 nt): total DNA (minus strand strong stop (-sss) DNA (200 nt) plus T-DNA). Recombinant hA3G was produced in the Baculo Expression System as a T-tag fusion protein, and was provided by the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Catalog number 10068). The 72-amino acid HIV-1 NCp7 peptide used in this analysis was prepared by solid-phase chemical synthesis as previously described (30De Rocquigny H. Kim D. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recombinant HIV-1 RT (p66/51) was prepared as previously described (31Wöhrl B.M. Kim B. Keith G. Grice S.F. J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). QKI-6 RNA-binding protein was a gift from Stephane Richard (McGill University). For analysis of the effect of 293T cell lysate-expressing hA3G upon the minus strand transfer in vitro, the transfected 293T cells were lysed using CytoBuster™ protein extraction reagent (Novagen) in the presence of SUPERase.In™ (Ambion), which is effective only against RNase A-type enzymes. hA3G Deamination of -sss cDNA during in Vitro Minus Strand Transfer—The sequencing of -sss DNA was performed after the minus strand transfer reaction. The total DNA in the reaction sample was extracted using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen Inc.). PCR was performed with Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers were as follows: forward (469-492), 5′-CCAGATCTGAGCCTGGGAGCTC; reverse (764-789), 5′-CTCCTTCTAGCCTCCGCTAGTC. The PCR products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and individual clones were sequenced. In Vitro RNA Template Degradation Assay—The minus strand transfer assay described above was used with a synthetic RNA template labeled by the incorporation of [α-32P]UTP and an unlabeled DNA oligonucleotide primer in the presence or absence of NCp7. The reaction was terminated at 20 min by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and the labeled RNA content was monitored by one-dimensional PAGE. RNaseH-negative HIV-1 RT E478Q, a kind gift from Matthias Götte (32Gotte M. Kim S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was used as a control. HIV-1 Infectivity Analysis—Measurement of single-round infectivity used the multinuclear-activation galactosidase indicator (MAGI) assay (33Gabor J. Kim S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Kimpton J. Kim M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the Inhibitory Effect of hA3G on Viral DNA Synthesis in Vivo—Upon infection of cells, Vif-negative HIV-1-containing hA3G show a strong reduction in viral DNA synthesis compared with HIV-1 not containing hA3G (10Goncalves J. Kim Y. Zack J. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8701-8709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li J. Kim M.J. Volsky D.J. J. Cell.

Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Reports of the stage at which the initial viral DNA production is blocked have varied. Quantitative PCR analyses of endogenous RT transcripts have shown reduced production of both early and late reverse transcripts in some cases (10Goncalves J. Kim Y. Zack J. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8701-8709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mariani R. Kim D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), whereas another report showed reduction of only the later RT transcripts (11Li J. Kim M.J. Volsky D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 560-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have previously reported ∼95% reduction in viral DNA production, with ∼55% of this reduction due to a reduction in the synthesis of strong stop DNA due to the inhibition of tRNALys3 priming (22Guo F. Kim S. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11710-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cause of the further reduction in late DNA production is addressed in this report. The conversion of the HIV-1 genomic RNA into double-stranded proviral DNA requires two strand transfers, as shown in Fig. 1A (for recent review, see Ref. 35Bampi C. Kim S. Lener D. Decimo D. Darlix J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1668-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The RT-catalyzed synthesis of minus strand strong-stop cDNA is initiated from a tRNALys3 bound to a sequence in the 5′-region of the viral RNA known as the primer binding site (PBS). Synthesis of this DNA is accompanied by degradation of the RNA template by RT-associated RNaseH, which allows the DNA to undergo the first strand transfer, annealing to the R sequences at the 3′ terminus of the viral RNA. The synthesis of minus single strand cDNA then proceeds up through the PBS sequence and is accompanied by RNaseH degradation of the RNA template, except for a short, RNaseH-resistant polypurine tract, located at the 5′-region of U3. This polypurine tract initiates plus strand DNA synthesis, which terminates after the 3′ 18 nucleotides of tRNALys3 primer have been transcribed, i.e. a new PBS is generated. Removal of the tRNALys3 then allows for the plus strand DNA to undergo a second strand transfer, accompanied by annealing to complementary PBS sequences in the minus strand DNA. Plus and minus strand DNA synthesis are then completed, with the plus and minus strands of DNA each serving as a template for completion of the other strand. In this work, we have investigated whether the reduction in the production of late DNA synthesis is due to the inhibition by hA3G of either DNA elongation, strand transfers, or of both these processes. Using real-time fluorescence-monitored PCR with equal amounts of cellular DNA, we monitored over a 24-h period post-infection the synthesis of viral cDNA intermediates in a permissive cell line, SupT1, that had been infected with Vif-negative HIV-1 containing or lacking hA3G. As shown in Fig. 1A, five pairs of primers were used to quantitate viral cDNA intermediates containing sequences for either R-U5, R-U3, pol, gag, or U5-gag, which represent, respectively, -sss DNA, post-minus strand transfer of early, middle, and late minus single strand DNA, and post-plus strand transfer late DNA. As shown in Fig. 1 (B-F), -sss DNA (R-U5) and late viral DNA production after the second strand transfer (U5-gag) reached maximum concentrations at 8 and 12 h post-infection, respectively, with intermediate DNA species reaching peak concentrations at intermediate times. A comparison of the synthesis of each DNA region in the absence or presence of hA3G, is presented graphically in Fig. 1G. In agreement with our previous report (22Guo F. Kim S. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11710-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the presence of hA3G in Vif-negative HIV-1 caused a 48% reduction in -sss DNA and a 96% reduction in the full-length minus single strand DNA. A new observation is that the reduction in late DNA synthesis appears to reflect inhibition of the DNA strand transfer steps and not the rates of DNA elongation. Thus, the similar reductions in the three minus strand viral DNA intermediates produced after the first strand transfer (84%, 83%, and 85% for R-U3, pol, and gag, respectively) suggests that hA3G has no significant impact on the extension of minus strand viral DNA after the minus strand transfer. However, it can be seen that an additional drop in DNA production occurs after the second strand transfer (U5-gag). These results suggest that the reduction in late viral DNA synthesis by hA3G may be caused primarily by the inhibition of strand transfers during reverse transcription, and this is further examined below using an in vitro minus strand transfer system. hA3G Inhibits the Minus Strand Transfer in Vitro—The ability of hA3G to inhibit minus strand transfer was measured using an in vitro assay that is described under “Experimental Procedures” and is depicted in Fig. 2A. A DNA primer, 5′-end-labeled with 32P, and complimentary to the PBS, was annealed to the PBS of a synthetic RNA template that contains, in sequence, R, U5, PBS, U3, and R, and serves as both the donor and acceptor RNA in the strand transfer reaction. The addition of HIV-1 RT produces a 200-nucleotide -sss DNA, whereas the addition of HIV-1 mature nucleocapsid (NCp7) is used to facilitate minus strand transfer and generate a 296-nucleotide transfer DNA product (T-DNA). Resolution of the radioactive reaction products by one-dimensional PAGE is shown in Fig. 2B. The synthesis of these two DNA species is seen in lane 3. The reaction products resolved in lanes 1 and 2 show no strand transfer and contain either RNaseH-negative RT (lane 1) or lack NCp7 (lane 2). A recent study has revealed that ∼7 (±4) molecules of hA3G are incorporated into virions produced from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (36Xu H. Kim E. Chen J. Ott D.E. Roser J.D. Hu W.S. Pathak V.K. Virology. 2007; 360: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This result suggests that, during reverse transcription, the molar ratio of hA3G to HIV-1 genomic RNA is ∼3.5:1. To avoid a biologically irrelevant effect resulting from a high concentration of hA3G, we have tested low concentrations of purified hA3G, from 0.05 to 12.5 nm in the reactions, in which the molar ratio of hA3G to the 50 nm RNA template never exceeds 0.25. Similarly, estimates of NCp7 molecules/virion have ranged from 1400 (37Zhu P. Kim E. Bess J. Jr. Lifson Arthur J.D. Liu L.O. J. Taylor Roux K.A. K. H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15812-15817Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) to 5000 (38Briggs J.A. Kim M.N. Gross I. Krausslich H.G. Fuller S.D. Vogt V.M. Johnson M.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus the hA3G:NCp7 molar ratio in virions may be 0.001-0.005. The in vitro strand transfer reaction contains 2.25 μm NCp7, and thus never exceeds an hA3G: NCp7 molar ratio of 0.006. As shown in Fig. 2B, with increasing concentrations of purified hA3G added to the strand transfer reaction, the synthesis of T-DNA is gradually reduced (lanes 4-8), and Fig. 2C plots the relative amounts of total DNA and DNA resulting from minus strand transfer (T-DNA/total DNA) obtained with increasing hA3G, whose concentrations are plotted on a logarithmic scale. Inhibition of minus strand transfer by hA3G increases from 11% to 76% as the hA3G concentrations increase from 0.2 nm to 3.2 nm. Experiments in which hA3G was replaced with bovine serum albumin did not result in any inhibition of minus strand transfer (data not shown). hA3G binds to both DNA and RNA (2Jarmuz A. Kim A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 39Iwatani Y. Kim H. Strebel K. Levin J.G. J.

RNA Biol. 2005; 2: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), has no effect upon strand transfer, making it less likely that hA3G inhibits strand transfer by sterically blocking the annealing of DNA to viral RNA. Although hA3G strongly reduced the T-DNA product, it did not significantly affect the total DNA synthesis (-sss DNA and T-DNA), because the amount of -sss DNA increases when T-DNA synthesis decreases (Fig. 2, B and C). This observation suggests that the reduction in strand transfer DNA product induced by hA3G did not result from a general inhibition of reverse transcription by hA3G. This is shown further in Fig. 2D, in which increasing concentrations of hA3G are added in the absence of NCp7, and no changes in the synthesis of -sss DNA are seen. Inhibition of Minus Strand Transfer Occurs Independently of hA3G Editing—We next investigated whether the hA3G inhibition of minus strand transfer depends upon the editing activity of this enzyme. The editing activity of hA3G is specific for single-stranded DNA (41Yu Q. Kim R. Pillai S. Chiles K. Kearney M. Palmer S. Richman D. Coffin J.M. Landau N.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and only the -sss DNA is a potential editing substrate for hA3G during minus strand transfer. As indicated in Fig. 1A, minus strand transfer is facilitated by annealing of sequences in the -sss DNA (R′) to the complementary R sequence at the 3′ terminus of viral RNA. C to U mutations introduced into R′ could hinder first strand transfer. We therefore cloned and sequenced the R-U5 region of -sss DNA produced from the in vitro strand transfer reaction. Ten independent nucleotide sequences were determined for -sss DNAs that had been produced in the absence or presence of hA3G, and no C to T (U) mutations were detected. This confirms previous observations that DNA mutations induced by hA3G were least frequent in the 5′-long terminal repeat, probably representing less than 3% of total cytidines within the R-U5 region (41Yu Q.

https://openalex.org/W2093961415,"Eukaryotic vacuolar-type H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are regulated by the reversible disassembly of the active V1V0 holoenzyme into a cytosolic V1 complex and a membrane-bound V0 complex. The signaling cascades that trigger these events in response to changing cellular conditions are largely unknown. We report that the V1 subunit C of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta interacts with protein kinase A and is the only V-ATPase subunit that is phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Subunit C can be phosphorylated as single polypeptide as well as a part of the V1 complex but not as a part of the V1V0 holoenzyme. Both the phosphorylated and the unphosphorylated form of subunit C are able to reassociate with the V1 complex from which subunit C had been removed before. Using salivary glands of the blowfly Calliphora vicina in which V-ATPase reassembly and activity is regulated by the neurohormone serotonin via protein kinase A, we show that the membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) causes phosphorylation of subunit C in a tissue homogenate and that phosphorylation is reduced by incubation with antibodies against subunit C. Similarly, incubation of intact salivary glands with 8-CPT-cAMP or serotonin leads to the phosphorylation of subunit C, but this is abolished by H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A. These data suggest that subunit C binds to and serves as a substrate for protein kinase A and that this phosphorylation may be a regulatory switch for the formation of the active V1V0 holoenzyme.

V-ATPases are multi-subunit transporters composed of a catalytic ATP-hydrolyzing V1 complex (≈550 kDa), which resides on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and a membrane-bound proton-translocating V0 complex (≈250 kDa). V-ATPase-dependent proton pumping is essential for cellular pH homeostasis and creates an electrochemical proton gradient that energizes secondary transport mechanisms in a wide variety of organelles and membrane systems. Acidification of organelles by V-ATPase activity is crucial to various cellular processes such as neurotransmitter uptake into synaptic vesicles, intracellular protein trafficking, and the secretion and activation of lysosomal enzymes for protein processing and degradation (4Kanner B.I.

With respect to this diversity of function, mutations in genes encoding V-ATPase subunits obviously lead to several diseases, e.g. osteopetrosis (17Frattini A. Orchard P.J. Sobacchi C. Giliani S. Abinun M. Mattsson J.P. Keeling D.J. Andersson A.K. Wallbrandt P. Zecca L. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Villa A. Nat.

Cremers C.W. Di Pietro A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of V-ATPase activity (3Inoue T. Wang Y. Jefferies K. Qi J. Hinton A. Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The most prominent and physiologically relevant mechanism is the reversible disassembly of the V-ATPase holoenzyme into its V1 and V0 complexes as discovered in the midgut of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jaeger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both systems, a nutrient drop induced by glucose deprivation in yeast or the cessation of feeding because of molting or starvation in the insect lead to the reversible disassembly of the functional V-ATPase holoenzyme into its inactive V1 and V0 complexes (21Kane P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Wieczorek H. Grüber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although more recent additional examples support the notion that the reversible disassembly/reassembly is a widely used mechanism for the regulation of V-ATPase activity (23Zimmermann B. Dames P. Walz B. Baumann O. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I.

Biol. 2005; 25: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the signaling cascades that trigger the association/dissociation process remain elusive. The salivary glands of the blowfly Calliphora vicina have served as a model system for the analysis of the regulation of V-ATPase reassembly and activation. V-ATPase activity in these tubiform glands is under the control of the hormone serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). In the presence of 5-HT, the V1 complex reallocates within minutes to the apical membrane and reassociates with the V0 complex, thus leading to the active holoenzyme (23Zimmermann B. Dames P. Walz B. Baumann O. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent results demonstrate that a 5-HT-induced increase in intracellular cAMP induces V-ATPase reassembly (26Dames P. Zimmermann B. Schmidt R. Rein J. Voss M. Schewe B. Walz B. Baumann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3926-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that protein kinase A (PKA) is the downstream target of cAMP in this scenario. 4J. Rein, M. Voss, B. Walz, and O. Baumann, unpublished results. 4J. Rein, M. Voss, B. Walz, and O. Baumann, unpublished results. These results lead to the assumption that one or more subunits of the V-ATPase become phosphorylated via PKA and that this phosphorylation may act as a trigger for holoenzyme formation in the blowfly salivary gland and possibly other systems. Regarding the reversible assembly/disassembly, the V1 subunit C is unique among V-ATPase subunits because it is released to the cytosol upon dissociation of the holoenzyme into its V1 and V0 complexes (21Kane P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Merzendorfer H. Reinecke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 25: 369-379Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subunit C is an elongated molecule (28Drory O. Frolow F. Nelson N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that appears to bridge the V1 with the V0 complex (29Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27896-27903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, subunit C binds to actin filaments, and this interaction may be involved in stabilizing the proton pump in its assembled state (30Vitavska O. Merzendorfer H. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1070-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Vitavska O. Wieczorek H. Merzendorfer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18499-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These properties make subunit C suited to the control of V-ATPase reassembly state and to the mediation of the relevant cellular signals. Here we test the above-mentioned hypothesis and demonstrate that V-ATPase subunit C becomes phosphorylated by PKA. Animals and Preparation—M. sexta (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) was reared at 27 °C under long day conditions (16 h light) at the University of Osnabrück. Blowflies (C. vicina) were reared at 25 °C under a light-dark cycle of 12 h:12 h at the University of Potsdam. At 1-3 weeks after the eclosion of the flies, the abdominal portions of their salivary glands were dissected in physiological saline containing 128 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.7 mm sodium glutamate, 2.7 mm malic acid, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2.

After centrifugation in a sucrose gradient, the fractions containing the V1 complex were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE. As a control for the phosphorylation reaction, the 6 μm recombinant subunit C from M. sexta was incubated with the PKA catalytic subunit. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (A) after phosphoprotein staining with ProQ Diamond (B). A molecular mass marker (M) containing two phosphorylated proteins (ovalbumin, 45 kDa; β-casein, 24 kDa) was used.

V1 complex without subunit C was prepared by gel chromatography in the presence of 25% methanol as described by Vitavska et al. (31Vitavska O. Wieczorek H. Merzendorfer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18499-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase subunit C from M. sexta was expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 cells by using the pET-16b expression system from Novagen (EMD Biosciences, Madison, WI) and was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described previously (27Merzendorfer H. Reinecke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 25: 369-379Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein determination was also performed as described previously (35Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11136-11142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overlay Blots with Recombinant Subunit C—Samples containing 1.5 and 6 μg of PKA catalytic subunit were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane via the slot-blot technique; transfer was controlled by Ponceau S staining. After being blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% gelatin, the membrane was incubated with 0.35 μm recombinant subunit C from M. sexta for 1 h in the presence of 1% gelatin in TNNT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.05% Tween 20). Nonspecifically bound subunit C was removed by washing the membrane in TNNT buffer three times for 5 min each. For labeling of bound subunit C, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with anti-C antibodies at a dilution of 1:2,000 in 1% gelatin/TNNT buffer. After three washes of 5 min each in TNNT buffer, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-guinea pig antibodies at a dilution of 1:30,000 in 1% gelatin/TNNT buffer. The membrane was then washed as above, and the color reaction was performed with 0.34‰ nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.18‰ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2. Another membrane without incubation with recombinant subunit C was used as a negative control. Phosphorylation Assays—For experiments with [32P]ATP, 6 μm subunit C was incubated with 1.4 μm PKA catalytic subunit in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 μl of PKA buffer (20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP) for 3 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.25 volumes 5× SDS sample buffer (625 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% sucrose, 10% SDS, 0.025% bromophenol blue, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol). After SDS-PAGE (17.4% total acrylamide concentration [T], 0.4% cross-linker concentration [C]) and Coomassie Blue staining, the gel was exposed to a phosphoscreen and finally analyzed by a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In nonradioactive experiments, phosphoproteins were detected by the Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain. First, 8 μm V1 complex from M. sexta was incubated with or without 0.7 μm PKA catalytic subunit in PKA buffer for 3 h at 30 °C. To separate the PKA catalytic subunit from the V1 complex, the samples were loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (34Huss M. Ingenhorst G. König S. Gaβel M. Dröse S. Zeeck A. Altendorf K.

The fractions containing the V1 complex without the PKA catalytic subunit were collected and concentrated by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were resuspended, heated in SDS sample buffer for 45 s at 95 °C, and loaded onto a gel. To control the phosphorylation reaction, 6 μm recombinant subunit C from M. sexta was incubated with or without 0.7 μm PKA catalytic subunit for 1 h at 30 °C. After SDS-PAGE as above, the gels were analyzed by Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain and afterward by Coomassie Blue staining. To check whether subunit C can be phosphorylated after its reassociation with the V1 complex, the V1 complex without subunit C was incubated with a 10-fold excess of recombinant subunit C for 12 h at 4 °C. V1 complex saturated with subunit C (V1C) was collected by gel chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. Then 5 μm V1C complex was incubated with 0.5 μm catalytic subunit of PKA for 2 h at 30 °C and afterward subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Pro-Q Diamond to detect phosphoproteins and afterward with Coomassie Blue. Isolated blowfly salivary glands were homogenized on ice in sample buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail according to the manufacturerŉs instructions and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The resulting supernatant was divided into pools of equal volumes, supplemented with the respective test reagent(s) (50 μm 8-CPT-cAMP, antibodies), and incubated for 15 or 30 min at 37 °C. The preparations were mixed with sample buffer B (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) to give a final SDS concentration of 1% and were heated for 5 min at 70 °C. After SDS-PAGE (14.4% T, 0.4% C), phosphoproteins were stained with ProQ Diamond and imaged. Subsequently, the proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out with Mini-PROTEAN 2D and Mini-PROTEAN II cell from Bio-Rad. Isoelectric focusing was performed at 20 °C in denaturating 5% polyacrylamide tube gels (8 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% Servalyt 3/10) with a pH 3-10 gradient. Before the loading of samples, the pH gradient was established by pre-electrophoresis: for 10 min at 200 V, 15 min at 300 V, and 15 min at 400 V. Isolated blowfly salivary glands were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with the respective test reagent(s) (30 nm 5-HT, 100 μm 8-CPT-cAMP, and 50 μm H-89) diluted in physiological saline; a control group was bathed in physiological saline only. Subsequently, the glands were homogenized on ice in sample buffer A and centrifuged for 30 min at 120,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were mixed with sample buffer B to give a final SDS concentration of 1.4% and heated for 5 min at 70 °C. For the alkylation of cysteine residues, iodacetamide was added to give a final concentration of 6%, and the solution was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. The samples were diluted in sample buffer C (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 2% Servalyt 3/10, 0.0025% bromphenol blue) to give a final SDS concentration of 0.24% to substitute SDS by CHAPS. Proteins (from an equivalent of 5 glands/assay) were separated by the following voltage profile: 10 min at 500 V, 3.5 h at 750 V, and 1 h at 1000 V. Tube gels were rinsed in equilibration buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue) just before SDS-PAGE (10.3% T, 0.3% C). The proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed by Western blot analysis as described previously (23Zimmermann B. Dames P. Walz B. Baumann O. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interaction of the V-ATPase Subunit C with the Catalytic Subunit of Protein Kinase A—To test our assumption that subunit C can be phosphorylated by PKA, we initially chose the V-ATPase from midgut plasma membranes of the tobacco hornworm, M. sexta, a useful model system for the investigation of this family of proteins. First, we checked whether a direct interaction of subunit C with the catalytic subunit of PKA could be detected by overlay blotting. We used the catalytic subunit of bovine heart PKA (with more than 80% amino acid sequence identity with the respective Drosophila enzyme) as an appropriate substitute for the insect PKA. After loading the PKA catalytic subunit onto nitrocellulose and incubation with or without recombinant V-ATPase subunit C from M. sexta, strong immuno-signals developed on the membrane incubated with subunit C as compared with the control membrane (Fig. 1). Interaction of the PKA catalytic subunit with the M. sexta subunit C was also confirmed by overlay blots after SDS-PAGE (not depicted). These results support the conclusion that the V-ATPase subunit C binds to the catalytic subunit of PKA and thus might also be a physiologically relevant substrate for phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Subunit C by Protein Kinase A—Phosphorylation was investigated by incubation of subunit C with the catalytic subunit of PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Fig. 2 demonstrates that, after SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging analysis, subunit C is labeled with 32P in a PKA-dependent manner. The upper band at ∼42 kDa represents subunit C with a molecular mass of 44 kDa as deduced from the cDNA sequence, whereas the lower band corresponds to the PKA catalytic subunit, which has a molecular mass of about 40 kDa and is known to become autophosphorylated (36Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of subunit C does not exclude the possibility that other V-ATPase subunits are also phosphorylated, especially in view of a recent report that a WNK (with no K (lysine)) kinase from Arabidopsis phosphorylates not only subunit C but also the V1 subunits A, G, and either B or H (37Hong-Hermesdorf A. Bruex A. Grüber A. Grüber G. Schumacher K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether other subunits of the V1 complex could also be phosphorylated by PKA. After incubation of the V1 complex with and without the PKA catalytic subunit, sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed, and fractions containing only the V1 complex were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 shows gels after Coomassie staining and after Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein staining. The latter stain has, compared with the use of radiolabeled ATP, the advantage that phosphorylated proteins can be detected without prior incubation with a protein kinase and ATP. Thus, Fig. 3 also demonstrates that the recombinant subunit C, which had been expressed in E. coli, is not phosphorylated a priori and remains nonphosphorylated after incubation with ATP in the absence of the PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 3B). In the presence of the PKA catalytic subunit, however, a strong phospho-signal could be observed at subunit C (Fig. 3B). In the V1 complex purified from M. sexta, no subunit including subunit C was found to be phosphorylated, either in the absence or in the presence of the PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we suggest that the V1 complex purified from the midgut cytosol does not contain phosphorylated subunits and that subunits cannot be phosphorylated by PKA as long as they are part of the complex. This also applies to subunit C, which usually occurs in substoichiometric amounts in the isolated V1 complex (22Wieczorek H. Grüber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there could be a qualitative difference between the substoichiometric subunit C that remains bound to the V1 complex purified from M. sexta midgut and the subunit C that dissociates upon enzyme disassembly. Hence we reassociated the recombinant subunit C with the V1 complex from which we had removed before all of subunit C. The resultant V1C complex was then incubated with the catalytic subunit of PKA. Indeed, subunit C in this complex could be phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 4), thus confirming our suspicion. Thus, the free cytosolic subunit C as well as subunit C reassociated with the V1 complex both appear to be competent for phosphorylation by PKA. After dissociation of the V1V0 holoenzyme, the majority of subunit C occurs freely in the cytosol (30Vitavska O. Merzendorfer H. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1070-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be expected that the activation of PKA leads predominantly to the"

We mutagenized 19 regulatory elements that drive coexpression of Ciona muscle genes and obtained quantitative estimates of the cis-regulatory activity of the 77 motifs that comprise these elements. We found that individual motif activity ranges broadly within and among elements, and among different instantiations of the same motif type. The activity of orthologous motifs is strongly constrained, although motif arrangement, type, and activity vary greatly among the elements of different co-regulated genes. Thus, the syntactical rules governing this regulatory function are flexible but become highly constrained evolutionarily once they are established in a particular element."
https://openalex.org/W2015186816,"Activated protein C (APC) reduces mortality in severe sepsis patients and exhibits beneficial effects in multiple animal injury models. APC anticoagulant activity involves inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa, whereas APC cytoprotective activities involve the endothelial protein C receptor and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). The relative importance of the anticoagulant activity of APC versus the direct cytoprotective effects of APC on cells for the in vivo benefits is unclear. To distinguish cytoprotective from the anticoagulant activities of APC, a protease domain mutant, 5A-APC (RR229/230AA and KKK191-193AAA), was made and compared with recombinant wild-type (rwt)-APC. This mutant had minimal anticoagulant activity but normal cytoprotective activities that were dependent on endothelial protein C receptor and protease-activated receptor-1. Whereas anticoagulantly active rwt-APC inhibited secondary-extended thrombin generation and concomitant thrombin-dependent activation of thrombin activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in plasma, secondary-extended thrombin generation and the activation of TAFI were essentially unopposed by 5A-APC due to its low anticoagulant activity. Compared with rwt-APC, 5A-APC had minimal profibrinolytic activity and preserved TAFI-mediated anti-inflammatory carboxypeptidase activities toward bradykinin and presumably toward the anaphlatoxins, C3a and C5a, which are well known pathological mediators in sepsis. Thus, genetic engineering can selectively alter the multiple activities of APC and provide APC mutants that retain the beneficial cytoprotective effects of APC while diminishing bleeding risk due to reduction in APC's anticoagulant and APC-dependent profibrinolytic activities.

The physiological role of APC as a natural anti-thrombotic is evident from the increased risk for venous thrombosis and potentially fatal thrombotic complications associated with moderate to severe protein C deficiency (4Griffin J.H.

Lancet. 1983; 2: 1165-1168Abstract PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Anti-thrombotic actions of APC are supported by profibrinolytic effects of APC that are, at least in part, dependent on down-regulation of thrombin formation by APC (6Mosnier L.O. Bouma B.N.

The clinical success of APC in reducing mortality in severe sepsis patients (PROWESS trial) gave impetus to new research on the direct effects of APC on cells, collectively referred to as “the protein C cytoprotective pathway” (17Mosnier L.O. Zlokovic B.V. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2007; 109: 3161-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 18Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). The direct effects of APC on cells, here termed “APC's cytoprotective effects,” require the APC receptors endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) and include: 1) alteration of gene expression profiles; 2) anti-inflammatory activities; 3) anti-apoptotic activity; and 4) endothelial barrier stabilization. Although potentially mechanistically related and involving shared molecular pathways, each of these activities of APC is distinct in its anticipated contribution to physiological beneficial effects. The relative importance of these APC direct cytoprotective effects on cells versus the anticoagulant activity of APC for in vivo benefits of APC remains unclear. To distinguish the cytoprotective from the anticoagulant activities of APC, protease domain mutants (229/230-APC (RR229/230AA) and 3K3A-APC (KKK191-193AAA)) were generated with selectively diminished anticoagulant activity without affecting normal cytoprotective activities of APC (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In vivo studies show that the heterologous murine APC mutants, RR230/231AA-APC and KKK192-194AAA-APC, prevent endotoxemia-induced death in mice (20Kerschen E.J. Cooley B.C. Castellino F.J. Griffin J.H. Weiler H. Blood. 2005; 106 (abstract): 26Crossref Google Scholar). These observations support the notion that the cytoprotective effects of APC are beneficial in vivo and that the beneficial effects of APC are, at least in part, independent of APC anticoagulant activity (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Kerschen E.J. Cooley B.C. Castellino F.J. Griffin J.H. Weiler H. Blood. 2005; 106 (abstract): 26Crossref Google Scholar). Despite the efficacy of these APC mutants in reduction of endotoxin-induced mortality, a possible contribution of anticoagulant activity to the observed effects could not be negated as these mutants retained residual anticoagulant activity (human mutants, 5-15%; mouse mutants, 25-35%) (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Kerschen E.J. Cooley B.C. Castellino F.J. Griffin J.H. Weiler H. Blood. 2005; 106 (abstract): 26Crossref Google Scholar). The current study characterizes a new APC mutant, designated 5A-APC, with almost no anticoagulant activity (<0.1% factor Va inactivation activity compared with rwt-APC) that retains normal cytoprotective activity on cells. This new APC mutant shows markedly reduced residual anticoagulant properties compared with the related APC mutants 229/230-APC and 3K3A-APC in multiple assays that are sensitive to secondary-extended thrombin generation and to the implications thereof. This new 5A-APC mutant may be useful in studies to elucidate the relative contributions of APC anticoagulant versus cytoprotective activities to the APC beneficial effects in various settings. Furthermore, this new APC mutant may improve therapies in various settings where the cytoprotective actions of APC are most beneficial while its anticoagulant action adversely increases bleeding risk. Human kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells expressing protein C were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega), 0.6 mg/ml G418, and 10 μg/ml vitamin K1. U937 human monocytes (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. The human endothelial cell line EA.hy926, provided by Dr. C. Edgell (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Protein Cs—To construct the 5A-protein C mutant (containing alanine substitutions at Lys-191, Lys-192, Lys-193, Arg-229, and Arg-230), the cDNA of wild-type protein C in pcDNA3.1(+)neo (Invitrogen) was used as template and substitutions were introduced using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) as described previously (21Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of the protein C coding region confirmed accuracy of the mutagenesis. Protein C was purified from serum-free conditioned media derived from stable transfected HEK-293 cells, by two passes on fast flow Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using CaCl2 and NaCl elution as described previously (22Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein C concentrations were estimated by absorbance using an extinction coefficient of 14.5 (280 nm, 1%, 1 cm). The 3K3A-APC mutant was prepared as described previously (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J.

Residual thrombin, as determined by fibrin clotting, was undetectable and accounted for <0.00025% (moles of thrombin/mole of APC) of the protein. Concentrations of rwt-APC and 5A-APC were determined by active-site titration (23Gale A.J. Tsavaler A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol.

Coagulation Assays—Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) clotting assays were performed as described previously (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Synthetic phospholipid vesicles consisting of 40% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PC), 20% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (PS), and 40% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were prepared as described previously (28Mosnier L.O.

Normal pooled plasma (George King) was supplemented with 1.45 μm corn trypsin inhibitor (Enzyme Research Laboratories). Various concentrations of APC plus 10 mm CaCl2, 10 μm PC/PS/PE phospholipids vesicles, 4 pm tissue factor (Dade Behring), 0.4 mm of the fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC (Bachem), and 75 μl of normal pooled plasma were mixed, and the volume was adjusted to 150 μl with Hepes-buffered saline (25 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, pH 7.4)/0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After mixing, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to a microtiter plate (FluoroNunc), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C during which fluorescence generation was followed over time (excitation 360 nm, emission 460 nm) in a Spectramax Gemini EM fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence generation curves were corrected for inner filter effects, substrate depletion, and converted to nanomolar thrombin using the thrombin calibrator (Synapse) as described previously (29Hemker H.C.

Factor Va Inactivation—Recombinant factor Va mutants with APC cleavage sites modified at Arg-306 (R306Q mutant) or Arg-506 (R506Q mutant) were prepared in the R679Q/S2183A B-domainless factor V background (30Gale A.J. Xu X. Pellequer J.L. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The time course of APC-mediated inactivation of factor Va was determined by following the factor Va cofactor function in prothrombinase assays as described previously (30Gale A.J. Xu X. Pellequer J.L. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of factor Va proteolytic fragments generated by APC was performed by incubating APC with factor Va bound to immobilized phospholipids. In brief, high binding microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorp) were coated with 100 μm PC/PS/PE phospholipids vesicles in TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and blocked with Tris-buffered saline/0.5% gelatin. Wells were incubated for 10 min with 10 nm factor Va (Haemtech) in Hepes-buffered saline/0.1% BSA/5 mm CaCl2, and APC was added after unbound factor Va was removed. Reactions were terminated by the addition of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot using the AHV5146 monoclonal antibody against factor Va (Haemtech) with its epitope located in the 307-506 fragment. Clot Lysis Assay—Clot lysis was studied in a plasma system of thrombin-induced clot formation and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated fibrinolysis as described previously (28Mosnier L.O. Von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The change in turbidity (405 nm) at 37 °C was measured (Thermomax, Molecular Devices) in 50% normal pooled plasma (v/v) in the presence of APC, 10 nm thrombin, 10 μm PC/PS/PE phospholipid vesicles, 17 mm CaCl2, and 30 units/ml tPA (Chromogenix). The clot lysis time was defined as the time to reach a half-maximal decrease in turbidity. Carboxypeptidase inhibitor (CPI) from potato tubers (Calbiochem) was used at 20 μg/ml to inhibit TAFIa. Anti-inflammatory Activity Assays—APC anti-inflammatory activity was determined as the inhibition of cytokine release by APC of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes. Typically, U937 cells (5 × 105/well) were challenged with 25 ng/ml LPS (serotype 055:B5, Sigma) in the presence of APC. After 18 h, secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) or inter-leukin 6 in the media was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Invitrogen). Anti-apoptotic Activity Assays—APC anti-apoptotic activity was determined as the inhibition of staurosporine-induced endothelial cell apoptosis as described previously (31Mosnier L.O. Griffin J.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells (EA.hy926) were incubated with APC for 5 h prior to induction of apoptosis by staurosporine (10 μm, 1 h), and apoptosis was assessed by YOPRO-1 (Molecular Probes) dye uptake as described previously (31Mosnier L.O.

APC-mediated alteration of gene expression was determined as the inhibition of TNFα-induced p53 expression. Endothelial cells (EA.hy926) were incubated with TNFα (2 nm; Sigma) for 12 h followed by incubation with APC (20 nm) or thrombin (20 nm) for 90 min. Total RNA was isolated (RNeasy, Qiagen), and mRNA levels for p53 and β-actin were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Superscript III, Invitrogen) as described previously (32Mansilla S. Priebe W. Portugal J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 540: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Riewald M. Ruf W. J. Biol.

Permeability of endothelial cell barrier function was determined as described with minor modifications (34Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 35Patterson C.E. Rhoades R.A. Garcia J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 865-873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells (EA.hy926, 5 × 104 cells/well) were grown on polycarbonate membrane Transwells (Costar, 3-μm pore size, 12-mm diameter). Upon reaching confluency, cells were incubated with APC (50 nm). After 4 h, the media in the inner chamber was replaced with serum-free media containing 4% BSA (fatty acid poor and endotoxin free fraction V, Calbiochem) and 0.67 mg/ml Evans blue in the absence (control) and presence of thrombin (20 nm) to induce endothelial permeability. Changes in thrombin-induced endothelial cell permeability were determined by following the increase in absorbance at 650 nm in the outer chamber over time due to the transmigration of Evans blue-BSA complexes. Percent permeability is expressed as the change in absorbance after 30 min relative to that in the absence of cells (defined as 100%) and in the absence of Evans blue (defined as 0%). Inactivation of BK in plasma was analyzed using a combination of plasma filtration and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Normal pooled plasma was supplemented with 0.5 mm lisinopril (Sigma) and 1.48 μm corn trypsin inhibitor. Various concentrations of APC plus 17 mm CaCl2, 10 μm phospholipids vesicles (PC/PS/PE, 40/20/40), 4 pm tissue factor, 100 μm bradykinin (Sigma), 1 nm thrombomodulin (American Diagnostica) and 50% (v/v) normal pooled plasma in Hepes-buffered saline/0.1% BSA were mixed. At the indicated times, reactions were halted by addition of 1/8 (v/v) 160 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, and 800 μm Plummer's inhibitor (dl-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid, Calbiochem), clots were removed, and the remaining supernatant (200 μl) was filtered (Microcon Ultracel YM-10, Millipore). The filtrate (100 μl) mixed with 20 μl of 1.2 m perchloric acid was applied for HPLC analysis of BK and des-Arg9-BK. Separation was performed on an HP 1100 series HPLC system using a Deltapak C-18 reversed-phase column (3.9 × 150 mm) of 5-μm particle size (Waters) and a linear gradient of 0-67% acetonitrile (v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in deionized water. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was maintained at ambient temperature, and products were detected at 214 nm. Design of an APC Mutant with Minimal Anticoagulant Activity—The anticoagulant activity of APC involves limited, specific cleavages of factor VIIIa and, more importantly, factor Va. A positively charged surface on the protease domain of APC is required for normal interactions of APC with factor Va (21Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gale A.J. Tsavaler A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol.

This extended exosite is generally located in an area similar to the anion binding exosite I of thrombin and includes loop 37 (protein C residues 190-193 equivalent to chymotrypsin residues 36-39), the Ca2+-binding loop (residues 225-235, chymotrypsin 70-80), and the autolysis loop (residues 301-316, chymotrypsin 142-153). In contrast, APC's cytoprotective activities that are dependent on cleavage at Arg-41 by APC in the N-terminal tail of PAR-1 are assumed to involve different APC exosite requirements than cleavage at Arg-506 in factor Va. Mutation of the basic residues in loop 37 (KKK191-193AAA) and the Ca2+-binding loop (RR229/230AA) of the protease domain of APC showed the importance of these residues for interaction with factor Va and anticoagulant activity but not for EPCR- and PAR-1-dependent APC cytoprotective activities (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Gale A.J. Tsavaler A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28836-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The anticoagulant activity of these two APC mutants was reduced but not ablated relative to rwt-APC in APTT clotting assays (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We assumed that the thermodynamic contributions of residues in different APC exosites responsible for APC-factor Va interactions would be approximately additive. Thus, to obtain an APC mutant with essentially no anticoagulant activity while retaining normal cytoprotective activities, the above mutations were combined to create a novel mutant, designated 5A-APC (R229A + R230A + K191A + K192A + K193A), which we predicted would have significantly lower anticoagulant activity than either mutant alone. 5A-protein C expression levels were comparable to those of rwt-protein C. After purification, activation, and active enzyme concentration determination by active site titration, the amidolytic activities of 5A-APC and rwt-APC against a small substrate (S-2366) in the presence of CaCl2 were indistinguishable (Fig. 1A). In the presence of EDTA, the amidolytic activity of 5A-APC was modestly decreased compared with rwt-APC (5A-APC activity 75% of rwt-APC, data not shown). As expected, the active site Ser to Ala mutant, S360A-APC, had no detectable amidolytic activity (Fig. 1A). In the presence of CaCl2, 5A-APC cleaved two other small chromogenic peptide substrates (Spectrozyme aPC or Pefachrome PCa) with catalytic efficiencies similar to rwt-APC (Table 1). Furthermore, inhibition of 5A-APC by plasma protease inhibitors, as determined by the half-life of the amidolytic activity of APC in plasma (23Gale A.J. Tsavaler A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28836-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was indistinguishable from inhibition of rwt-APC (half-lives, 19 versus 20 min, respectively), further indicating that the mutations did not have any detectable global effect on conformation and/or folding of the region around the APC active site.TABLE 1Kinetic constants for rwt-APC and 5A-APC amidolytic activity vs. chromogenic peptide substratesActivity assayKmkcatkcat/KmμMs−1μM−1s−1Spectrozyme aPCrwt-APC736 ± 5323.5 ± 1.30.0325A-APC765 ± 7824.1 ± 0.60.032Pefachrome PCarwt-APC224 ± 934.9 ± 0.40.165A-APC258 ± 1335.6 ± 0.80.14 Open table in a new tab Anticoagulant Activity of 5A-APC—In APTT clotting assays, the five alanine replacements in the 5A-APC mutant essentially ablated anticoagulant activity as it was below the detection limit (<3% of rwt-APC) under the conditions employed (Fig. 1B). The 229/230-APC and 3K3A-APC mutants have 14 and 5% anticoagulant activity under similar conditions, respectively (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive S360A-APC mutant had significantly higher anticoagulant activity that is presumably mediated by binding of S360A-APC to factor Va via the positively charged exosites of APC (Fig. 1B). This suggests that a major portion of the exosite-mediated interactions of APC with factor Va was abolished in 5A-APC. Similar results were obtained showing essentially no anticoagulant activity for 5A-APC anticoagulant activity when assayed in diluted prothrombin time assays (23Gale A.J. Tsavaler A. Griffin J.H. J.

https://openalex.org/W2062101121,"Endometriosis affects 10-15% of women and is associated with pelvic pain and infertility. Angiogenesis plays an essential role in its pathogenesis. Dendritic cells (DCs) were recently implicated in supporting tumor angiogenesis. As both tumors and endometriosis lesions depend on angiogenesis, we investigated the possibility that DCs may also play a role in endometriosis. We induced endometriosis in 8-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice by implantation of autologous endometrium into the peritoneal cavity. We observed an abundance of CD11c(+) DCs infiltrating sites of angiogenesis in endometriosis lesions. We noticed a similar pattern of infiltrating DCs at sites of angiogenesis in the peritoneal Lewis lung carcinoma tumor model. These DCs were immature (major histocompatability complex class II(low)) and expressed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Peritoneal implanted bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) incorporated into both endometriosis lesions and into B16 melanoma tumors and enhanced their growth at 8 days compared with controls (5.1+/-2.5 vs. 1.5+/-0.5 mm(2), n=4 and 4, P<0.0001 for endometriosis; 67.6+/-15.1 vs. 22.7+/-14.6 mm(2), n=5 and 7, P=0.0004 for mouse melanoma). Finally, immature BMDCs but not mature BMDCs enhanced microvascular endothelial cell migration in vitro (219+/-51 vs. 93+/-32 cells, P=0.02). Based on these findings, we suggest a novel role for DCs in supporting angiogenesis and promoting lesion growth both in endometriosis and in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2047403318,"The first stars in the universe form when chemically pristine gas heats as it falls into dark-matter potential wells, cools radiatively because of the formation of molecular hydrogen, and becomes self-gravitating. Using supercomputer simulations, we demonstrated that the stars' properties depend critically on the currently unknown nature of the dark matter. If the dark-matter particles have intrinsic velocities that wipe out small-scale structure, then the first stars form in filaments with lengths on the order of the free-streaming scale, which can be ∼10 20 meters (∼3 kiloparsecs, corresponding to a baryonic mass of ∼10 7 solar masses) for realistic “warm dark matter” candidates. Fragmentation of the filaments forms stars with a range of masses, which may explain the observed peculiar element abundance pattern of extremely metal-poor stars, whereas coalescence of fragments and stars during the filament's ultimate collapse may seed the supermassive black holes that lurk in the centers of most massive galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2012800587,"Glyphosate, the world's most used herbicide, is a massive success because it enables efficient weed control with minimal animal and environmental toxicity.

Glyphosate-tolerant variants of EPSPS constitute the basis of genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant crops. A single-site mutation of Pro101 in EPSPS (numbering according to the enzyme from Escherichia coli) has been implicated in glyphosate-resistant weeds, but this residue is not directly involved in glyphosate binding, and the basis for this phenomenon has remained unclear in the absence of further kinetic and structural characterization. To probe the effects of mutations at this site, E. coli EPSPS enzymes were produced with glycine, alanine, serine, or leucine substituted for Pro101. These mutant enzymes were analyzed by steady-state kinetics, and the crystal structures of the substrate binary and substrate·glyphosate ternary complexes of P101S and P101L EPSPS were determined to between 1.5- and 1.6-Å resolution. It appears that residues smaller than leucine may be substituted for Pro101 without decreasing catalytic efficiency. Any mutation at this site results in a structural change in the glyphosate-binding site, shifting Thr97 and Gly96 toward the inhibitor molecule.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, exhibits broad-spectrum herbicidal activity, yet is essentially nontoxic to animals and does not persist in the environment. These characteristics have made it the world's most popular herbicide, and usage continues to increase with the adoption of glyphosate-dependent technologies, including herbicide-tolerant crops and minimal tillage (no-till) agriculture. The enormous reliance on glyphosate and the absence of suitably safe alternative herbicides mean that the widespread emergence of glyphosate-tolerant weeds would have devastating agricultural and environmental consequences. EPSPS, the molecular target of glyphosate, catalyzes the transfer of the enolpyruvyl moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate) to the 5-hydroxy position of shikimate 3-phosphate (S3P) (see Fig. 1). The structure of the glyphosate-inhibited complex shows that glyphosate binds to the P-enolpyruvate-binding site of EPSPS (6Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N.

Typically, however, these mutant enzymes displayed an increased Km for P-enolpyruvate and a correspondingly decreased catalytic efficiency, indicative of decreased fitness in the absence of glyphosate, and were thus considered unsuitable for the development of glyphosate-tolerant crops. Glyphosate-resistant plants have developed both through natural evolution in situ and by directed evolution or mutagenesis in vitro, and glyphosate tolerance can be induced by either target-site or non-target-site mechanisms. Non-target-site tolerance mechanisms include overexpression of EPSPS (13Amrhein N. Johanning D. Schab J. Schulz A.

Here, we describe the kinetic and structural characteristics of four E. coli mutant EPSPS enzymes containing single-residue substitutions at Pro101. The results indicate that any substitution at this site causes small but significant structural changes in the active site. The implications of our findings concerning the development and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds are discussed. S3P was synthesized and purified as described previously (27Priestman M.A. Funke T. Singh I.M. Crupper S.S. Schonbrunn E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). P-enolpyruvate was purchased from Sigma. Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The single-site Pro101 mutations were introduced into wild-type EPSPS from E. coli using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate primers. All primers were synthesized by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). The pET-24d vector (Novagen) containing the open reading frame of wild-type (WT) EPSPS was used as a template for the mutations. Pro101 mutant EPSPS enzymes were overexpressed in BL21(DE3) competent cells and purified as described previously (18Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After the final purification step, the mutant enzymes were concentrated in 50 mm Tris and 2 mm dithiothreitol using Centricon-30 devices (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) at 4 °C. The enzymatic activities of WT and Pro101 mutant EPSPS were measured spectrophotometrically at 25 °C with a Spectra-Max 340PC plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The assay mixtures (60 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm S3P, and varied concentrations of P-enolpyruvate and glyphosate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme (3.4 nm WT; 8.5 nm P101S, P101G, and P101A; and 34 nm P101L) and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 25 °C before the addition of 140 μl of Lanzetta reagent. After an additional 10 min for color development, the change in absorbance at 650 nm was recorded, and the amount of inorganic phosphate produced was determined by comparison with phosphate standards. Enzymatic activity is expressed as micromoles of phosphate produced per min of reaction/mg of enzyme (units/mg). The Km values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The Ki values were derived by determining the Km(obs) of P-enolpyruvate in the presence of increasing concentrations of glyphosate and fitting the data to following equation: Km(obs) = (Km/Ki) × [I] + Km, where Km(obs) is the Michaelis constant for P-enolpyruvate in the presence of glyphosate, [I] is the glyphosate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant for P-enolpyruvate in the absence of glyphosate. P101S and P101L EPSPS enzymes were crystallized at 19 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in the presence of 5 mm S3P with or without 5 mm glyphosate using the sodium formate crystallization conditions described previously (18Eschenburg S.

Middle, in the P101S mutant enzyme, the serine hydroxyl establishes hydrogen-bonding interactions with the Thr97 carbonyl oxygen (black dotted lines). Note that Ser101 exists in two alternate conformations. Lower, in the P101L mutant enzyme, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr97 is in a similar orientation as in the P101S enzyme. Glyphosate and S3P are displayed in green and yellow, respectively. In both mutant enzymes, the backbone of Gly96-Thr97 shifts slightly toward the glyphosate-binding site, resulting in possible clash distances (red dotted lines) between Gly96 and the phosphonate moiety of glyphosate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Four single-site mutations were introduced into E. coli EPSPS, replacing Pro101 with glycine, alanine, serine, or leucine. The resulting mutant enzymes were characterized by steady-state kinetics using the forward reaction of EPSPS (Fig. 1). The P101S and P101L mutant enzymes were crystallized in the presence of S3P with or without glyphosate, and the crystal structures were determined to between 1.5- and 1.6-Å resolution (Table 1). Enzyme Kinetics—All four mutant enzymes were found to be catalytically active, with specific activities ranging from 8 to 30 units/mg compared with 50 units/mg for WT EPSPS (Table 2 and supplemental Figs. S1–S5). The enzymatic reactions display normal saturation kinetics. Two distinct trends are discernible in the kinetic data. First, small residues may be substituted for Pro101 without substantially altering the affinity of the enzyme for P-enolpyruvate. The Km values indicate that the binding affinities for P-enolpyruvate and S3P are unchanged or only slightly decreased for the P101G, P101A, and P101S mutant enzymes; P101L displays an ∼2-fold lower affinity for both S3P and P-enolpyruvate. Second, substitution of any residue for Pro101 decreases the binding affinity of glyphosate, reducing the potency of this inhibitor. Unlike WT EPSPS, which is very sensitive to glyphosate (Ki = 0.4 μm), the mutant enzymes are 10–165-fold less sensitive (Ki values between 5.5 and 66 μm) to inhibition by glyphosate. The kinetic characteristics are in qualitative agreement with those reported previously for the equivalent P106S mutant EPSPS enzyme from Eleusine indica (goosegrass) (24Baerson S.R. Rodriguez D.J. Tran M. Feng Y. Biest N.A. Dill G.M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The specific activities and resulting catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of the mutant enzymes are 2–10-fold lower than those of WT EPSPS, with P101L EPSPS having the lowest catalytic efficiency. Overall, the substitution of residues smaller than leucine for Pro101 results in a glyphosate-tolerant, catalytically efficient enzyme.TABLE 2Kinetic characteristics of mutant and wild-type EPSPS enzymes PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.EPSPS enzymeKm(S3P)Vmaxkcat/Km(S3P)Km(PEP)kcat/Km(PEP)KiKm(PEP)/Kiμmunits/mgm–1 s–1μmm–1 s–1μmWT60 ± 650 ± 16.4 × 10560 ± 66.4 × 1050.4 ± 0.06150P101S80 ± 622 ± 0.42.0 × 10570 ± 52.9 × 1055.5 ± 0.313P101G60 ± 1028 ± 13.9 × 10590 ± 102.4 × 10512 ± 47.5P101A60 ± 431 ± 0.53.9 × 10580 ± 52.8 × 10519 ± 34.2P101L100 ± 78 ± 0.26.2 × 104150 ± 204.1 × 10466 ± 22.3 Open table in a new tab Protein Crystallography—In WT EPSPS from E. coli, Pro101 is part of an internal helix (residues 97–105) in the N-terminal globular domain, ∼9 Å distant from glyphosate (Fig. 2). Therefore, the effects of Pro101 mutations on the inhibition of EPSPS by glyphosate are likely to be due to long-range structural changes in the glyphosate-binding site. X-ray crystal structures at between 1.5- and 1.6-Å resolution revealed that the overall structures of the P101S and P101L mutant enzymes are nearly identical to that of WT EPSPS (Fig. 3). When comparing the glyphosate-bound forms of the mutant enzymes with that of WT EPSPS, the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values of all 427 C-α atoms are 0.066 and 0.097 Å for P101S and P101L, respectively. The largest differences occur in the backbone of Gly96, Thr97, and Ala98, with the C-α atom of Thr97 having 4–7 times larger r.m.s.d. values than the overall r.m.s.d. (Fig. 3). These structural alterations are also reflected by substantial changes in the backbone torsion angles of residues 96–98 (Table 3), and the changes are further evident from Fo - Fo electron density maps with difference peak heights of 23σ and 18σ in the backbone around Thr97 for the P101S and P101L enzymes, respectively (Fig. 4).TABLE 3Changes in backbone torsion angles of residues 96–98 as a result of Pro101 mutations.WT EPSPSP101S EPSPSP101L EPSPSGly96Thr97Ala98Gly96Thr97Ala98Gly96Thr97Ala98Torsion angleaThe torsion angles were calculated with MOLEMAN2 (37), with ϕ = C(i – 1) – N(i) – CA(i) – C(i), ψ = N(i) – CA(i) – C(i) – N(i + 1), ω = CA(i) – C(i) – N(i + 1) – CA(i + 1), and planarity = C(i) – CA(i) – N(i + 1) – O(i) ϕ–63°–72°–104°–60°–61°–88°–61°–63°–81° ψ–34°–5.6°–50°–38°–29°–45°–38°–32°–44° ω–178°170°–178°–178°178°180°–178°179°–180° Planarity0.32°–0.03°0.84°0.16°0.05°–0.31°–0.31°–1.3°0.16°a The torsion angles were calculated with MOLEMAN2 (37Kleywegt G.J.

Notably, the side chain of Ser101 adopts two alternate conformations. Although the hydroxyl group of either Ser101 rotamer is in hydrogen-bonding distance (<3.2 Å) of the carbonyl oxygen of Thr97, its apparent flexibility makes a strong bonding interaction unlikely (Fig. 5). Neither the P101S nor P101L mutation disrupts the α-helix present in WT EPSPS. Rather, it seems that the loss of the Pro101 ring system causes a disruption of hydrophobic interactions that hold in place the carbonyl oxygen of Thr97. In the mutant enzymes, the backbone of Thr97 relaxes and reorients, rotating about its φ/Ψ torsion angles (Table 3). As a result, Gly96 and Thr97 shift slightly toward the glyphosate-binding site, thereby causing repulsive forces (<3.2 Å) between the C-α atom of Gly96 and the phosphonate moiety of glyphosate. It appears that the altered orientation of Thr97 and Gly96 causes a slight narrowing of the binding site for glyphosate. This negatively impacts glyphosate inhibitory potency because this inhibitor interacts with EPSPS efficiently only in its extended conformation (7Funke T. Han H. Healy-Fried M.L. Fischer M. Schoenbrunn E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13010-13015Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of the substrate P-enolpyruvate would remain unaltered because the P-enolpyruvate molecule is significantly shorter than glyphosate (18Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Conclusion—The removal of undesired plant species (weeds) to increase nutrient availability and crop yields is an intrinsic component of agriculture. The current enormous (and growing) reliance on glyphosate indicates that the development and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds would have far-reaching negative consequences (34Service R.F. Science. 2007; 316: 1114-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To date, reports of target-site mutations suggest that glyphosate-tolerant EPSPS enzymes typically have a substantial fitness cost, particularly in the absence of multiple (compensatory) mutations. Mutations at sites corresponding to Pro101 appear to incur the least fitness cost, and because point mutations are far more evolutionarily accessible than multiple mutations, target-site glyphosate tolerance seems most likely to arise via mutations of this residue. With continued selective pressure from glyphosate application, the evolution of weedy plants expressing such enzymes appears inevitable. Our study indicates that the structural basis for the glyphosate tolerance of such Pro101 mutant EPSPS enzymes is due to long-range alterations in the active site of the enzyme, in particular impacting the spatial orientation of Gly96 and Thr97. It has long been known that Gly96 is critical for the efficient binding of glyphosate. For E. coli EPSPS, mutation of Gly96 to alanine results in a complete loss of inhibitory potency because of the methyl group protruding into the glyphosate-binding site; however, this glyphosate tolerance comes at the expense of a drastically lowered affinity for P-enolpyruvate and poor catalytic efficiency (18Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In general, because the degree of glyphosate tolerance depends on the extent to which the inhibitor-binding site is perturbed and because the catalytic efficiency depends on the extent to which the substrate-binding site is left intact, it appears that the Pro101 substitution is favorable precisely because the changes in the enzyme active-site structure are so slight. Residues other than proline substituted at position 101 reduce glyphosate binding, whereas residues smaller than leucine at this position essentially do not alter the S3P- and P-enolpyruvate-binding sites, retaining catalytic efficiency. To prevent the expected deterioration of the herbicidal properties of glyphosate, aggressive strategies for combating glyphosate-tolerant weeds should be implemented. Our data indicate that plants with these target-site mutations likely remain susceptible to glyphosate at high concentrations, but non-target-site mutations may act synergistically (14Powles S.B. Preston C. Weed Technol. 2006; 20: 282-289Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Yu Q. Cairns A. Powles S. Planta. 2007; 225: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Perez-Jones A. Park K.W. Polge N. Colquhoun J. Mallory-Smith C. Planta. 2007; 226: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), drastically decreasing the effectiveness of glyphosate. On the basis of the extensive structure-activity relationship studies performed with glyphosate analogs (15Franz J.E. Mao M.K. Sikorski J.A. Glyphosate: A Unique Global Herbicide. 1997; (pp. and 617-642, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.): 441-519Google Scholar) and the subtlety of the structural changes observed in glyphosate-tolerant enzymes, glyphosate analogs may not represent suitable replacements for glyphosate. Because plants with target-site glyphosate tolerance mutations remain susceptible to herbicides targeting enzymes other than EPSPS, herbicide rotation practices may delay the development and spread of glyphosate-tolerant weeds, and integrated weed management programs should be encouraged (35Reddy K.N. Weed Technol. 2004; 18: 131-139Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The engineering of crops with resistance to other herbicides, such as dicamba (36Behrens M.R. Mutlu N. Chakraborty S. Dumitru R. Jiang W.Z. LaVallee B.J. Herman P.L. Clemente T.E. Weeks D.P. Science. 2007; 316: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), holds some promise, but such crops are not yet commercially available, and glyphosate has unique advantages because of its very low toxicity to animals and its broad-spectrum activity against plants. In the long run, the development of completely new inhibitors of EPSPS or other shikimate pathway enzymes is desirable, as new nontoxic herbicides will be required."

Notably, it is yet unresolved whether CaV3 channels are modulated by protein kinases in mammalian cells. In this study, we demonstrate that protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC (but not PKG) activation induces a potent increase in CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 currents in various mammalian cell lines. Notably, we show that protein kinase effects occur at physiological temperature (∼30–37 °C) but not at room temperature (∼22–27 °C). This temperature dependence could involve kinase translocation, which is impaired at room temperature. A similar temperature dependence was observed for PKC-mediated increase in high voltage-activated CaV2.3 currents. We also report that neither CaV3 surface expression nor T-current macroscopic properties are modified upon kinase activation. In addition, we provide evidence for the direct phosphorylation of CaV3.2 channels by PKA in in vitro assays. Overall, our results clearly establish the role of PKA and PKC in the modulation of CaV3 T-channels and further highlight the key role of the physiological temperature in the effects described.

VGCCs are therefore implicated in neuronal and cardiac excitability as well as in muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release or hormone secretion, and gene expression (1Berridge M.J.

Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, the modulation of VGCCs plays a pivotal role in the control of cardiac and brain activities. VGCCs are divided into three families: the L-type channels (CaV1 family); the neuronal N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels (CaV2 family); and the T-type channels (CaV3 family) (7Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. PerezReyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Tsien R.W. Catterall W.A.

Although the molecular mechanisms implicated in the modulation of high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels of the CaV1 and CaV2 families are beginning to be unraveled (mainly, protein kinases for CaV1 channels and βγ-subunits of G proteins and protein kinase C (PKC) for CaV2 channels) (6Tedford H.W. Zamponi G.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 8Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar), those implicated in low voltage-activated CaV3 T-type channel regulation remain debated (9Chemin J. Traboulsie A. Lory P. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Some transduction pathways mediate either decreases or increases in native T-currents, depending on the tissues/species studied and/or on the recording conditions (9Chemin J. Traboulsie A. Lory P. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This apparent complexity could be explained by the existence of three T-channels (CaV3.1 or α1G, CaV3.2 or α1H, and CaV3.3 or α1I), which include different splice variant isoforms with specific tissue patterns and developmental expression (10Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Additional regulatory subunits of T-channels might also be involved in their modulation, but the native composition of T-channels remains unknown (10Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Therefore, molecular studies on recombinant T-channels are required to clarify their modulation. Recent studies on recombinant T-channels have highlighted the complexity of their regulation (9Chemin J. Traboulsie A. Lory P. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On one hand, as for CaV2 channels, CaV3.2 currents are inhibited by βγ-subunits of G proteins in mammalian cells (11Wolfe J.T. Wang H. Howard J. Garrison J.C. Barrett P.Q. Nature. 2003; 424: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12DePuy S.D. Yao J. Hu C. McIntire W. Bidaud I. Lory P. Rastinejad F. Gonzalez C. Garrison J.C. Barrett P.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In contrast with CaV2 currents, this mechanism cannot be generalized because this modulation is restricted to CaV3.2 and specifically occurs with a Gβγ dimer containing β2-subunits (11Wolfe J.T.

On the other hand, as observed with CaV1 channels, CaV3 currents are increased by protein kinase activation (13Wolfe J.T. Wang H. Perez-Reyes E. Barrett P.Q. J. Physiol.

Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) because protein kinase A (PKA)- and PKC-mediated T-current increase has been observed in Xenopus oocytes but not in mammalian cells expressing CaV3 currents (11Wolfe J.T.

In this context, it is interesting to note that protein kinase effects on native VGCCs were first described in heart frog cells and appear more robust in these cells compared with those observed in mammalian tissues (20Vassort G.

Thus, we reasoned that these differences in kinase modulation could involve the temperature at which the experiments were performed, i.e. mostly at room temperature. Although room temperature is within the physiological range for amphibian cells, it is far below that required by mammalian cells. In this study, we provide new data on PKA and PKC activation in the function of temperature that clearly establish the role of these two kinases, but not of protein kinase G (PKG), in the modulation of CaV3 T-currents in various mammalian cell lines. Cell Culture and Transfection Protocols—tsA-201 cells and a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing CaV3.2 channels (CHO-CaV3.2; a generous gift from Dr. Emmanuel Bourinet) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium, respectively, supplemented with GlutaMAX and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Neomycin (0.6 mg/ml; Invitrogen) was added to the CHO-CaV3.2 cell medium. tsA-201 cell transfection was performed using jetPEI (Qbiogen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol (4 μl of jetPEI for ∼1.5 μg of DNA/35-mm Petri dish) with a DNA mixture containing 0.5% of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid and 99.5% of one of the pcDNA3 plasmid constructs that code for the human CaV3.1a, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 T-channel isoforms (24Chemin J.

Two days after, cells were then dissociated with Versen (Invitrogen) and plated at ∼35 × 103 cells/35-mm Petri dish. Electrophysiological recordings were performed the following day. Electrophysiological Recordings—Macroscopic currents were recorded at room temperature (∼22 °C) by the whole-cell patch clamp technique using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The extracellular solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH, ∼330 mosm). Borosilicate glass pipettes have a typical resistance of 1.5–2.5 megaohms when filled with an internal solution containing 140 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgATP, 0.6 mm NaGTP, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH, ∼315 mosm). Recordings were filtered at 2 kHz. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP9 (Axon Instruments) and GraphPad Prism software. Student' t test or one-way analysis of variance combined with a Newman-Keuls post-test were used to compare the different values, which were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results are presented as the means ± S.E., and n is the number of cells used. Imaging of PKC Translocation—To study PKC translocation as a function of temperature, we generated a human PKCβ1 construct with the C terminus fused to GFP using the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech). PKCβ1-GFP was inserted into pcDNA4 (Invitrogen) and transfected into CHO-CaV3.2 cells. Two days after, cells were plated onto 12-mm glass coverslips. The following day, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatments were performed (100 nm in the culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C or at room temperature), and cells were then fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Digital images were acquired on a Leica microscope and further analyzed using Adobe Photoshop. Luminometric Analysis of HA-tagged CaV3.2 Channels—tsA-201 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with a GFP-CaV3.2-HA construct (27Dubel S.J. Altier C. Chaumont S. Lory P. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29263-29269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, PMA treatments were performed (100 nm in the culture medium for 30 or 60 min at 37 °C), and cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. After three PBS washes, half of the wells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and rinsed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (PBS plus 1% fetal bovine serum). The GFP-CaV3.2-HA protein was detected using a rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; clone 3F10, Roche Diagnostics) after incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBS plus 1% fetal bovine serum for 10 min, cells were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were rinsed four times with PBS for 10 min before addition of SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Luminescence was measured using a VICTOR2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the protein amount in each well was then measured using the BCA assay (Pierce) to normalize the measurements. All data were normalized to the level of signal obtained for incubation with the control medium (1:10,000 Me2SO). Four independent sets of transfection experiments were performed under each condition, and the results are presented as the means ± S.E. In Vitro PKA Assays—tsA-201 cells transfected with HA-tagged CaV3.2 or CaV2.1 were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, precleared for 1 h with fetal calf serum-Sepharose beads, and incubated overnight with specific antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer before PKA assays. In vitro PKA assays were performed on Sepharose beads for 30 min at 30 °C with 10 units of the PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma) in 40 μl of medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm MgATP, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 500 μm okadaic acid, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After three washes with cold Nonidet P-40 buffer, standard SDS-PAGE was performed, and phosphorylated proteins were analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Chemical Reagents—All compounds (which were from Sigma, except Gö 6976, which was from BIOMOL International LP) were dissolved in water (1 mm), except PMA, 4α-PMA, and Gö 6976, which were dissolved in Me2SO (1 mm); aliquoted; and kept at –80 °C in the dark. Control experiments were carried out using the solvent alone. To investigate the effects of protein kinase activation in mammalian cells expressing low voltage-activated T-currents, various protein kinase activators (or the control solution) were incubated with cells at 37 °C or at room temperature (∼22 °C) for 10 min before electrophysiological recordings, which were performed at room temperature in either the presence or absence of the activator (Fig. 1, A and B, insets). Under these conditions, the PKC activator PMA (100 nm) induced a strong increase in the CaV3.1 currents (∼100%, p < 0.001, n > 70) when preincubated at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained for CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 channels because PMA induced an ∼105% increase (p < 0.001, n > 90) in CaV3.2 currents and had a maximal effect on CaV3.3 currents (∼145%, p < 0.001, n > 100) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we found that PMA had no significant effect when incubated at room temperature (up to 1 h of incubation; p > 0.05 and n > 30 for each CaV3 current) (Fig. 1, B–D). We then evaluated the PMA effects on CaV3.3 currents during incubation at several intermediate temperatures (27, 30, and 32 °C). We found that the PMA effects gradually developed at 30 and 32 °C (∼60 and 100% increases, respectively; p < 0.05; n > 40) (Fig. 2), whereas no effect was observed at 27 °C (p > 0.05, n > 34) (Fig. 2). The PMA effects as a function of temperature can be described by a sigmoidal Hill equation (Fig. 2), which indicates that the temperature producing PMA half-effects is ∼30.5 °C and the Hill slope ∼18.9, indicating a strong temperature dependence of PMA effects. We also investigated the temperature dependence of the PMA effects on high voltage-activated CaV2.3 currents, which are increased by PMA at room temperature in Xenopus oocytes (26Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As observed for CaV3 currents, we found that 100 nm PMA induced a strong increase in CaV2.3 currents in human embryonic kidney 293 cells when incubated at 37 °C (∼150%, p < 0.001, n > 30) (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas PMA has no effect when incubated at room temperature (p > 0.05, n > 35) (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 2Temperature dependence of PMA effects on CaV3.3 T-currents in transiently transfected tsA-201 cells. Shown is the effect of 100 nm PMA or the control solution (10-min incubation) on CaV3.3 currents at several temperatures, i.e. at 22 (room temperature), 27, 30, 32, and 37 °C. Electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature during the following 50 min in the presence of PMA or the control solution. Currents were elicited by a –45-mV depolarization of 450-ms duration applied immediately after the whole-cell configuration from a holding potential of –80 mV. Increases in CaV3.3 currents as a function of temperature were fitted with a sigmoidal Hill equation, where T-current increase (Y) = Ymin + (Ymax–Ymin)/(1 + (T0.5/T)Hill slope), where T is temperature. The fit gave a T0.5 value of 30.54 °C and a Hill slope of 18.87.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3PMA induces an increase in CaV2.3 currents in transiently transfected tsA-201 cells at 37 °C but not at room temperature (∼22 °C).

II Mochly-Rosen Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We asked whether this phenomenon is altered in mammalian cells at a non-physiological temperature (Fig. 4). To this end, we generated a GFP-tagged PKCβ1 construct (PKCβ1-GFP; see “Materials and Methods”) to visualize PMA-induced PKC translocation in transfected mammalian cells (Fig. 4, B and C). As described for PKC of the classical family (28Dorn G.W. II Mochly-Rosen Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 407-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found that 100 nm PMA induced PKC translocation to the plasma membrane in mammalian CHO cells when incubated for 10 min at 37 °C (Fig. 4B). However, PMA had no effect on PKC translocation when incubated at room temperature (Fig. 4D). We next investigated whether PMA effects on CaV3 currents are specific to PKC activation (Fig. 5). To assess the involvement of PKC, we used 4α-PMA (100 nm), a PMA analog inactive on PKC, and chelerythrine or Gö 6976 (both at 1 μm), two selective inhibitors of PKC (Fig. 5). We found that 4α-PMA had no significant effect on the three CaV3 currents (p > 0.05 and n > 25 for each CaV3 current), whereas both chelerythrine and Gö 6976 suppressed PMA effects (p > 0.05 and n > 25 for each CaV3 current). In addition, we found no basal effect of chelerythrine on the three CaV3 currents (p > 0.05 and n > 60 for each CaV3 current) (Fig. 5, A–C). To estimate whether PKC activation-induced increase in T-currents is associated with changes in macroscopic biophysical properties, we next performed steady-state activation and inactivation protocols (Fig. 6, A and B, insets). As shown for CaV3.1 (Fig. 6, A–D), PMA induced no significant change in steady-state activation and inactivation properties. For CaV3.1, current-voltage curves (Fig. 6C) indicated steady-state activation V0.5 values of –48.6 ± 1.4 mV (n = 10) under control conditions and –47.6 ± 1.3 mV (n = 13, p > 0.05) after PMA treatment, whereas slope values were 4.1 ± 0.4 mV (n = 10) under control conditions and 4.3 ± 0.4 mV (n = 13, p > 0.05) after PMA treatment. Similarly, steady-state inactivation properties were not significantly modified by PKC activation (Fig. 6D) because V0.5 values were –70.7 ± 0.7 mV (n = 10) under control conditions and –71.8 ± 0.6 mV (n = 11, p > 0.05) after PMA treatment, whereas slope values were 4.7 ± 0.2 mV (n = 10) under control conditions and 4.1 ± 0.2 mV (n = 11, p > 0.05) after PMA treatment. In the same way, neither the steady-state activation nor inactivation properties of the CaV3.2 (n > 10 under each condition, p > 0.05) (Fig. 6E) and CaV3.3 (n > 10 under each condition, p > 0.05) (Fig. 6F) currents were significantly affected by PMA treatment. We also investigated whether the surface expression of CaV3 channels in mammalian tsA-201 cells is modulated by PKC activation (supplemental Fig. 1). To this end, we used a CaV3.2 channel construct containing an extracellular HA tag, which allowed its surface (non-permeabilized condition) and total expression (permeabilized condition) (supplemental Fig. 1A) to be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/luminometry. We found that PMA treatment did not induce significant changes in both membrane expression (supplemental Fig. 1B) and total expression (supplemental Fig. 1C) of CaV3.2-HA channels after 30 min or 1 h of treatment at 37 °C. Also, protein kinase activation did not influence the ratio of membrane expression to total expression, which was ∼20% under all conditions (supplemental Fig. 1D), further indicating that surface expression of CaV3.2-HA channels is not altered. We next explored whether, as observed for PKC, cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases modulate T-currents in mammalian cells at physiological temperatures. To investigate the effects of PKA, we used dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), a membrane-permeant analog of cAMP (Fig. 7). We found that Bt2cAMP induced an increase in the three CaV3 T-currents when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 7, A–C) but had no significant effect when incubated at room temperature (p > 0.05 and n > 30 for each CaV3 current) (Fig. 7, B–D). As observed above with PMA, Bt2cAMP produced a stronger effect on CaV3.3 currents (∼140% increase, p < 0.001, n > 60) compared with CaV3.2 currents (∼70% increase, p < 0.001, n > 80) and CaV3.1 currents (∼55% increase, p < 0.001, n > 80) (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, we observed a similar temperature dependence using monobutyryl cAMP (the bioactive product of Bt2cAMP acting on PKA). Indeed, monobutyryl cAMP treatment increased CaV3.3 currents at 37 °C (∼110% increase, p < 0.01, n > 35) but not at room temperature (p > 0.05, n > 40). These latter results demonstrate that the temperature dependence described here does not involve endogenous esterases or amidases, which convert Bt2cAMP into monobutyryl cAMP (for review, see Ref. 29Schwede F. Maronde E. Genieser H. Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We next probed the involvement of PKA activation in the Bt2cAMP effects using the specific PKA inhibitor KT5720. KT5720 suppressed Bt2cAMP-induced increases in T-currents (p > 0.05 and n > 20 for each CaV3 current) (Fig. 8, A–C) but had no effect on basal T-currents (p > 0.05 and n > 20 for each CaV3 current). It should be noted that in previous experiments, we used the PKA inhibitor H-89, but we observed that although this compound abolished Bt2cAMP effects, it had strong direct inhibitory effects at micromolar concentrations on the three CaV3 currents and especially on CaV3.2 (data not shown). We further investigated whether PKA effects would involve a direct phosphorylation of CaV3 channels. To this end, we took advantage of a commercially available PKA catalytic subunit that is constitutively active and that allows in vitro kinase assays of immunoprecipitated HA-tagged CaV3.2 channels (Fig. 8D). We found that PKA induced phosphorylation of CaV3.2 channels, but not of CaV2.1 channels, which are insensitive to PKA (6Tedford H.W. Zamponi G.W. Pharmacol.

KT5720 was applied at least 4 h at 1 μm prior to the 37 °C incubation protocols. Currents were elicited by a –45-mV depolarization (200-ms duration for CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents and 450-ms duration for CaV3.3 currents) applied immediately after the whole-cell configuration from a holding potential of –80 mV.

Furthermore, we treated cells with the specific PKG inhibitor KT5823 (supplemental Fig. 2B) and found that this compound had no significant effect on the three CaV3 current densities (p > 0.05 and n > 20 for each CaV3 current) (supplemental Fig. 2B). Finally, we further investigated the effect of PKC, PKA, and PKG activation in a CHO cell line stably expressing CaV3.2 currents (Fig. 9). In these cells, we found that PMA and Bt2cAMP (but not Bt2cGMP) induced an increase in CaV3.2 currents when incubated at physiological temperature (Fig. 9A). As observed above in transiently transfected tsA-201 cells, PMA induced stronger effects on CaV3.2 currents (∼125% increase) compared with Bt2cAMP (∼50% increase, p < 0.001, and n > 30 under each condition) (Fig. 9B). However, PMA and Bt2cAMP had no significant effect when incubated at room temperature (up to 1 h of incubation; p > 0.05 and n > 24 under each condition) (Fig. 9C).

https://openalex.org/W2012376098,"Patients with gliomas expressing high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) have a shorter overall survival prognosis. Moreover, EGF enhances PAI-1 expression in glioma cells. Although multiple known signaling cascades are activated by EGF in glioma cells, we show for the first time that EGF enhances expression of PAI-1 via sequential activation of c-Src, protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta), and sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the enzyme that produces sphingosine-1-phosphate. EGF induced rapid phosphorylation of c-Src and PKCdelta and concomitant translocation of PKCdelta as well as SphK1 to the plasma membrane. Down-regulation of PKCdelta abolished EGF-induced SphK1 translocation and up-regulation of PAI-1 by EGF; whereas, down-regulation of PKCalpha had no effect on the EGF-induced PAI-1 activation but enhanced its basal expression. Similarly, inhibition of c-Src activity by PP2 blocked both EGF-induced translocation of SphK1 and PKCdelta to the plasma membrane and up-regulation of PAI-1 expression. Furthermore, SphK1 was indispensable for both EGF-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and PAI-1 expression. Collectively, our results provide a functional link between three critical downstream targets of EGF, c-Src, PKCdelta, and SphK1 that have all been implicated in regulating motility and invasion of glioma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2073337768,"Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which starts with misfolded protein recognition, followed by ubiquitination, retrotranslocation to the cytosol, deglycosylation, and targeting to the proteasome for degradation. Actions of multisubunit protein machineries in the ER membrane integrate these steps. We hypothesized that regulation of the multisubunit machinery assembly is a mechanism by which ERAD activity is regulated. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the potential regulatory role of the small p97/VCP-interacting protein (SVIP) on the formation of the ERAD machinery that includes ubiquitin ligase gp78, AAA ATPase p97/VCP, and the putative channel Derlin1. We found that SVIP is anchored to microsomal membrane via myristoylation and co-fractionated with gp78, Derlin1, p97/VCP, and calnexin to the ER. Like gp78, SVIP also physically interacts with p97/VCP and Derlin1. Overexpression of SVIP blocks unassembled CD3δ from association with gp78 and p97/VCP, which is accompanied by decreases in CD3δ ubiquitination and degradation. Silencing SVIP expression markedly enhances the formation of gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex, which correlates with increased degradation of CD3δ and misfolded Z variant of α-1-antitrypsin, established substrates of gp78. These results suggest that SVIP is an endogenous inhibitor of ERAD that acts through regulating the assembly of the gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex. Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which starts with misfolded protein recognition, followed by ubiquitination, retrotranslocation to the cytosol, deglycosylation, and targeting to the proteasome for degradation.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the potential regulatory role of the small p97/VCP-interacting protein (SVIP) on the formation of the ERAD machinery that includes ubiquitin ligase gp78, AAA ATPase p97/VCP, and the putative channel Derlin1. We found that SVIP is anchored to microsomal membrane via myristoylation and co-fractionated with gp78, Derlin1, p97/VCP, and calnexin to the ER. Like gp78, SVIP also physically interacts with p97/VCP and Derlin1. Overexpression of SVIP blocks unassembled CD3δ from association with gp78 and p97/VCP, which is accompanied by decreases in CD3δ ubiquitination and degradation. Silencing SVIP expression markedly enhances the formation of gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex, which correlates with increased degradation of CD3δ and misfolded Z variant of α-1-antitrypsin, established substrates of gp78. These results suggest that SVIP is an endogenous inhibitor of ERAD that acts through regulating the assembly of the gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex. Degradation of misfolded or unassembled proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; VIM, VCP-interacting motif; siRNA, short interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; 2-OHM, 2-hydroxymyristic acid; CHX, cycloheximide. a process known as ERAD, is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of the secretory pathway (1Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Otherwise, delivery of misfolded proteins to their functional destinations or accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER would have detrimental effects on cells (1Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In addition to its safeguard role, ERAD can directly regulate physiological processes that occur in the ER, for example, sterol-regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-regulated degradation of IP(3) receptor that gates intracellular calcium release (1Hampton R.Y.

ERAD is also known to control the levels of normal serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 and Cox-2 proteins (6Arteaga M.F. Wang L. Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Furthermore, ERAD substrates have been extended to cytosolic and nuclear normal and/or misfolded proteins. For instance, ERAD ubiquitin ligase (E3) Hrd1 interacts with cytosolic p53 and misfolded Huntingtin protein and targets them to the proteasomes for degradation (8Yamasaki S. Yagishita N. Sasaki T.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERAD E3 Doa10 is spatially sorted to the inner nuclear membrane and targets nuclear-localized substrates for degradation (10Deng M. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 2006; 443: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Degradation of ER-localized misfolded proteins occurs in the cytosol by the proteasomes. Thus, luminal proteins have to be transported across the membrane, and membrane-integrated proteins have to be dislodged from the membrane to reach the proteasomes. These processes are collectively called retrotranslocation (1Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev.

Increasing evidence indicates that actions of large protein complexes in the ER integrate the processes of misfolded protein selection, retrotranslocation, ubiquitination, and degradation during ERAD (1Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Indispensable to these complexes are the ER membrane-spanning RING finger E3s for ubiquitination and the AAA ATPase CDC48/p97/VCP for retrotranslocation (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This is best characterized in S. cerevisiae in which distinct E3 complexes define different ERAD pathways (13Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 14Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Proteins with misfolded ER-luminal domains are targeted to the ERAD-L pathway. In this pathway, the Hrd1p/Hrd3p ligase forms a core complex by binding to Der1p via the linker protein Usa1p. This core complex associates through Hrd3p with Yos9p and Kar2p, forming a luminal protein surveillance complex. Substrates with misfolded intramembrane domains are targeted to the ERAD-M pathway, which differs from ERAD-L by being independent of Usa1p and Der1p. Membrane proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains use the ERAD-C pathway and are directly targeted to the Doa10p E3. All three pathways converge at the Cdc48p ATPase complex. The general scheme of the S. cerevisiae ERAD pathways is applicable to that in mammalian cells. So far, five ER membrane-spanning RING finger E3s, including gp78, Hrd1, TEB4, Rma1, and RFP2, have been identified in mammalian ERAD (15Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M.

Other components of S. cerevisiae ERAD pathways have also been found in mammalian cells, such as p97/VCP (homologue of CDC48), Derlin1, Derlin2, and Derlin3 (homologues of Der1p), and Sel1L (homologue of Hrd3p) (12Ye Y.

Unlike in S. cerevisiae, the ERAD pathways in mammalian cells are largely undefined. However, a link between ERAD E3s and p97/VCP ATPase has been demonstrated in mammalian cells and is essential for mammalian ERAD (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A.

We have recently reported that gp78 directly interacts with p97/VCP through a newly identified p97/VCP-interacting motif (VIM) (25Ballar P. Shen Y. Yang H. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35359-35368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This interaction is essential for degradation of ERAD substrates CD3δ and the Z variant of α-1-antitrypsin (ATZ). The putative retrotranslocation channel Derlin1 has been shown to be part of the gp78 and p97/VCP complex (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a highly conserved VIM is also found in the small p97/VCP-interacting protein (SVIP) (25Ballar P. Shen Y. Yang H. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35359-35368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SVIP was isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen using p97/VCP as bait (27Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SVIP causes vacuolization of cells, but its physiological role is unknown (27Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The sharing of VIM between gp78 and SVIP prompted us to evaluate a possible regulatory role of SVIP on gp78-mediated ERAD. We found that SVIP forms a complex with Derlin1 and p97/VCP. We provided evidence that SVIP regulates the formation of gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex, which leads to a change in substrate association with gp78 and p97/VCP and, eventually, changes in the efficacy of ERAD. These findings suggest that SVIP is an endogenous inhibitor of ERAD, acting through the inhibition of the assembly of the gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex. Thus, SVIP may act to prevent excessive ERAD that may cause damage to cells. SVIP open reading frame was amplified by reverse transcription PCR from total RNA isolated from 293 cells. A His6 tag was added in-frame to the C terminus of SVIP during PCR amplification, and the PCR product was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo via EcoRI and SalI sites (pCIneo-SVIP). pCIneo-SVIP(G2A) was created by site-directed mutagenesis to mutate myristoylation site glycine 2 to alanine. pCIneo-SVIP-VIM mutant was generated by simultaneously mutating the conserved Arg-22 to Glu-, Leu-25 to Gln-, Ala-26 to Val, Arg-31 to Asp, and Arg-32 to Glu. pCI-HA-CD3δ and pGEX4T3-SVIP have been previously described (15Fang S.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-human α-1-antitrypsin was purchased from Biomeda. Human horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-α-1-antitrypsin was acquired from Bethyl Laboratories. 293 cells that stably express HA-CD3δ alone (clone-5) and HA-CD3δ together with gp78 (clone-20) have been previously reported (6Arteaga M.F.

To generate cell lines that stably express ATZ, plasmid encoding hATZ was co-transfected with pBABE vector that confers puromycin resistance. 24 h after the transfection, 2.5 μg/ml puromycin was added to eliminate non-transfected cells. Positive clones were characterized by immunoblotting. 293 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105/well in 6-well plates or 1.2 × 106/100-mm dish prior to the day of transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (for plasmids and siRNAs) or by calcium phosphate precipitation (for plasmids only). Cells transfected with plasmids were collected 24 h after transfection, whereas those transfected with siRNA were harvested 72 h post-transfection. IB and IP were performed as we previously described (24Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Alkaline Extraction—Microsomes were isolated as described (25Ballar P. Shen Y. Yang H. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35359-35368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and then incubated with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, for 20 min at room temperature. After the incubation, microsomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting microsomes and supernatants were processed for IB. Proteinase K Digestion Assay—Microsomes were incubated with 0, 3.1, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 μg/ml proteinase K in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature before being processed for IB. N-Myristoylation Inhibition—1 mm 2-OHM (2-hydroxymyristic acid) (Sigma) was delivered to 293 cells in a complex with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as previously described (30Nadler M.J. Harrison M.L. Ashendel C.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and cells were incubated for 24 h. Because unmyristoylated cytosolic SVIP is not very stable, cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor for 5 h before being processed for fractionation and IB. Gradient Fractionation—293 cells were homogenized in buffer B (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The post-nuclear supernatant was layered on top of a preformed 0–25% iodixanol gradient in buffer B and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2.5 h, after which fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. Equal volume of each fraction was processed for IB. SVIP Is a Membrane-anchored Protein—SVIP has been reported to be a membrane-associated protein, but it possesses neither a transmembrane domain nor a signal peptide (27Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). How it associates with the membrane is not clear. To address this issue, we carried out alkaline extraction of the microsomes isolated from 293 cells. We found that Na2CO3 has no effect on SVIP-membrane association, as seen on the membrane-spanning protein Derlin1 (Fig. 1A). As a positive control, a significant amount of p97/VCP that is known to be peripherally associated with the microsomes is released into the cytosol (Fig. 1A, lane 2 versus 4). This result is consistent with the previous report that SVIP may be attached to membrane through myristoylation (27Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we mutated the putative myristoylation site glycine-2 to alanine and generated a mutant SVIP (SVIP(G2A)) that is defective in myristoylation. We found that SVIP(G2A) is exclusively localized in the cytosol (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 4 versus 5, 6). The difference is not due to overexpression, since SVIP(G2A) was still in the cytosol when its expression was markedly reduced (lanes 7, 8 versus 9, 10). Furthermore, the membrane anchorage of SVIP can be abolished by the N-myristoylation inhibitor 2-hydroxymyristic acid (2-OHM). Treatment with 2-OHM slightly increased the mobility of SVIP and resulted in its cytosolic localization (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with inhibition of SVIP myristoylation. Thus, it is likely that SVIP is membrane-anchored through myristoylation on glycine 2. In agreement, we demonstrated that SVIP is attached on the cytosolic surface of microsomes, since proteinase K completely digested SVIP, while the intraluminal domain of calnexin remained protected by the microsomal membrane (Fig. 1D). SVIP Forms a Complex with p97/VCP and Derlin1—SVIP is localized to the ER and other membranes (27Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the two known VIM-containing proteins, SVIP and gp78, are in the same membrane fraction, post-nuclear supernatants from 293 cells were fractionated on an iodixanol (Optiprep) gradient. Indeed, SVIP cofractionated with gp78 along with other ER membrane proteins such as Derlin1, Hrd1, and calnexin (Fig. 2A). As expected, a fraction of p97/VCP cofractionated with SVIP and gp78 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether SVIP interacts with ERAD components other than p97/VCP, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Among the additional five proteins examined, only Derlin1 strongly co-immunoprecipitated with SVIP (Fig. 2B, lane 2). As previously reported, VIMP interacts with p97/VCP, Derlin1, and gp78 (Fig. 2A, lane 5), whereas p97/VCP co-immunoprecipitated with SVIP, Derlin1, gp78, Hrd1, and its cofactors Ufd1-Npl4 heterodimer (lane 4). Thus, SVIP and gp78 not only share a common motif, VIM, but also have common interacting proteins, p97/VCP and Derlin1. Next, we assessed how the SVIP-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex is formed by inhibiting p97/VCP expression with RNA interference. Silencing p97/VCP expression markedly reduced the SVIP-Derlin1 interaction (Fig. 2C, lanes 5, 6), suggesting that the trimeric complex is formed through simultaneous binding of SVIP and Derlin1 to p97/VCP (illustrated in Fig. 2D). The same results were obtained by a GST-SVIP pulldown assay (supplemental Fig. S1A, lanes 5, 6). Interestingly, p97/VCP also appears to be essential for the formation of the gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex as demonstrated by GST-gp78VIM and GST fusion of the Derlin1 C-terminal tail (GST-Drlc) pulldown assays (supplemental Fig. S1A, lanes 3, 4, and S1B, lanes 3, 4). In addition, the transmembrane domains of gp78 interact with Derlin1 (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that p97/VCP interactions enhance the binding of gp78 and Derlin1. Considering that the SVIP-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex does not contain gp78 and that VIM is present in both gp78 and SVIP, it is likely that SVIP and gp78 form a mutually exclusive complex with p97/VCP-Derlin1. SVIP Regulates gp78-mediated ERAD—Overexpression of SVIP induces cellular vacuolation (27Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and electron microscopy revealed that the vacuoles represent dilated ER (27Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We speculated that such vacuoles might be caused by accumulation of misfolded ER proteins and that SVIP might be an inhibitor of ERAD. To test this possibility, we determined the effects of SVIP on ERAD. Increasing amounts of SVIP were expressed in 293 cells that stably express CD3δ, a well known ERAD substrate (31Chen B. Mariano J. Tsai Y.C. Chan A.H. Cohen M. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We found that SVIP causes a dose-dependent accumulation of CD3δ (Fig. 3A). The accumulation was due to decreased degradation as shown by cycloheximide (CHX) chase analysis in 293 cells with approximately three times overexpression of SVIP (31Chen B. Mariano J. Tsai Y.C. Chan A.H. Cohen M. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). When a similar experiment was performed with the membrane anchorage mutant form of SVIP (SVIP(G2A)), the same result was achieved. Overexpression of SVIP(G2A) significantly inhibits CD3δ degradation (Fig. 3C), indicating that the membrane anchorage of SVIP is not required for ERAD inhibition. Consistently, SVIP(G2A) remains interacting with p97/VCP and Derlin1 (Fig. 3D, lane 6). As expected, mutation of the VIM of SVIP (SVIP(VIMm)) abrogates SVIP interaction with p97/VCP and Derlin1 (Fig. 3D, lane 5). The slower mobility of SVIP(VIMm) may be caused by amino acid substitutions and/or post-translational modification. gp78 enhances CD3δ binding to p97/VCP and facilitates CD3δ degradation (24Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The apparent opposite effect of SVIP on CD3δ degradation prompted us to determine the effect of SVIP on CD3δ-p97/VCP association. Consistent with the observed decreased degradation in the previous experiment, overexpression of SVIP inhibits p97/VCP binding to CD3δ (Fig. 3E) and gp78 (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, in SVIP-overexpressing cells, gp78 did not interact with CD3δ, which correlates with a significant decrease in the level of ubiquitinated CD3δ (Fig. 3G). To further confirm this result, we immunoprecipitated HA-CD3δ in denatured cell lysates. Consistently, SVIP overexpression significantly decreased the levels of ubiquitinated CD3δ (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, SVIP overexpression diminishes gp78-Derlin1 interaction (Fig. 3H). Collectively, these experiments indicate that SVIP inhibits the interactions of gp78 with CD3δ, p97/VCP, and Derlin1, resulting in inhibition of CD3δ ubiquitination and subsequent loading to p97/VCP for retrotranslocation. Next, we asked whether the endogenous SVIP plays an inhibitory role in gp78-mediated ERAD. We again utilized 293 cells that stably express CD3δ. RNA interference was employed to silence endogenous SVIP expression. Degradation of CD3δ was assessed by CHX chase analysis. Inhibition of SVIP expression significantly increased CD3δ degradation (Fig. 4A). A similar experiment was performed on ATZ, a newly identified luminal substrate for gp78 (32Shen Y. Ballar P. Fang S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As predicted, silencing SVIP also decreased the intracellular levels of ATZ, which correlates with reduced ATZ secretion (Fig. 4B). These data further support the hypothesis that endogenous SVIP negatively regulates the function of gp78s. To determine whether endogenous SVIP inhibits gp78 interaction with p97/VCP and Derlin1, we silenced the expression of SVIP and evaluated changes in the formation of gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex by co-immunoprecipitation. Inhibition of SVIP expression markedly augmented the association of p97/VCP and Derlin1 with gp78, consistent with the fact that silencing SVIP enhances ERAD. To further substantiate gp78 as a target inhibited by SVIP, we studied the effects of SVIP silencing on CD3δ degradation in 293 cells that overexpress both gp78 and CD3δ. We predicted that overexpression of gp78 will overcome the inhibitory effect exerted by endogenous SVIP and that silencing SVIP would have no effect on CD3δ degradation in cells overexpressing gp78. This was indeed the case (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these results suggest that SVIP is an endogenous inhibitor for gp78-mediated ERAD that acts through its common motif shared with gp78 and uncouples gp78 from its substrates, p97/VCP and Derlin1. Changes in the levels of SVIP and gp78 proteins appear to control the efficacy of ERAD (Fig. 3, A and B, and Fig. 4, A, B, and D). The next question is whether the expressions of SVIP and gp78 proteins are modulated under ER stress, a condition known to regulate the efficacy of ERAD. Interestingly, tunicamycin-induced ER stress inversely regulated the levels of SVIP and gp78 proteins in a time-dependent manner, which correlates well with previous reports that ER stress enhances, but prolonged ER stress (17 h) inhibits, ERAD (33Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Doong H. Fang S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 352: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Menendez-Benito V. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2787-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The central components of the ERAD pathways include the ER resident E3s and the cytosolic CDC48/p97/VCP ATPase (13Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 14Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Multiple ER membrane-anchored proteins interact with and link CDC48/p97/VCP to ERAD E3s, thereby promoting association of ubiquitinated ER proteins with the ATPase for retrotranslocation (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14296-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that myristoylation targets SVIP to the ER membrane where it competes with gp78 to bind to p97/VCP and Derlin1. As a result, SVIP reduces the association of ERAD substrates with gp78 and p97/VCP, thereby inhibiting substrate ubiquitination and subsequent ERAD steps. This study identifies SVIP as the first endogenous inhibitor of ERAD that uses a novel mechanism through inhibiting the assembly of the gp78-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex. Previous studies have focused on the mechanisms of ERAD and how ERAD is enhanced under ER stress (1Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 11Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat.

Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). However, the control mechanism of ERAD activity is largely unknown. As a general mechanism, activated cellular events have to be turned off after having fulfilled their tasks, such as in the cases of the activated receptor tyrosine kinases and transcription factors (36Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 37Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Failure to control the durations of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and gene transcription can cause devastating diseases. Therefore, it is conceivable that activated ERAD in response to accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER has to be controlled once the misfolded proteins have been removed. A similar mechanism by which ERAD is controlled may be through degradation of key components of the ERAD machineries. For example, gp78 itself is degraded by ERAD (15Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Importantly, gp78 degradation is inhibited under ER stress, which correlates with an increase in ERAD (24Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, when misfolded proteins are accumulated in the ER, gp78 is stabilized and it aids to remove misfolded proteins. Once the accumulated proteins in the ER have been eliminated, gp78 is degraded, thereby preventing excessive ERAD that may cause damage to cells. The present finding on the regulation of the assembly of ERAD machinery by SVIP represents another mechanism of control for ERAD activity. Although p97/VCP binds gp78 and SVIP in a mutually exclusive manner, both p97/VCP-gp78 and p97/VCP-SVIP can associate with Derlin1. This type of interaction is reminiscent of the Hrd1-p97/VCP-Derlin1 complex, in which p97/VCP simultaneously binds Derlin1 and Hrd1 (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Our study also revealed an interaction between the transmembrane domains of gp78 and Derlin1, supporting the possibility that gp78 and Derlin1 may be part of the protein retrotranslocation channel as previously suggested (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 24Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Derlin1 has two homologues, Derlin2 and Derlin3. Derlin2 also forms complex with p97/VCP and Hrd1 (20Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14296-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It would be important to know whether SVIP also interacts with Derlin2 and Derlin3. If it does, SVIP may play a more general inhibitory role on ERAD. CDC48/p97/VCP ATPase is the converging point of probably all the characterized ERAD pathways. Inhibition of this ATPase is expected to disrupt the ERAD process. The question is why SVIP also uncouples Derlin1 from gp78. Derlin1 has been proposed as the long sought after channel for retrotranslocation (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, simultaneous sequestration of p97/VCP and Derlin1 by SVIP would inhibit the targeting of misfolded proteins to the retrotranslocation channel and subsequent retrotranslocation. Additionally, SVIP diminished the gp78-CD3δ interaction, which results in stabilization of non-ubiquitinated CD3δ. By doing so, SVIP may enhance protein trafficking through the ER/Golgi. In support of this possibility, we found that silencing SVIP expression increases ATZ degradation and decreases ATZ secretion (Fig. 4B). Our data presented strongly suggest that p97/VCP and Derlin1 can form a complex with either gp78 or SVIP. The gp78 complex facilitates ERAD, whereas the SVIP complex inhibits ERAD; the stoichiometry between these two complexes dictates the efficacy of gp78-mediated ERAD (Fig. 5). Importantly, the stoichiometry is apparently regulated under ER stress (Fig. 4E). We thank Dr. Yihong Ye for providing antibodies and plasmids and Drs. Russell A. DeBose-Boyd, Richard N.

However, how Id-1 interacts with these pathways and the immediate downstream effectors of the Id-1 protein are not known. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid screening technique, we identified a novel Id-1-interacting protein, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a cell membrane protein, and a positive regulator of cell survival and metastasis in prostate cancer. Using an immunoprecipitation method, we found that the helix-loop-helix domain of the Id-1 protein was essential for the physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1. In addition, we also demonstrated that the physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1 played a key role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased cell migration rate as well as resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, our results revealed that this effect was regulated by Id-1-induced Akt activation through promoting the binding activity between Cav-1 and protein phosphatase 2A.

It lacks a basic domain for DNA binding; therefore, it acts as a dominant inhibitor of the basic HLH transcription factors by forming heterodimers. Id-1 has multiple functions, including inhibition of differentiation, induction of proliferation, and delaying replicative senescence (1Perk J. Iavarone A. Benezra R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In addition, ID-1 has been suggested as a potential oncogene, because it is up-regulated in many types of human cancer such as breast (2Lin C.Q. Singh J. Murata K. Itahana Y. Parrinello S. Liang S.H. Gillett C.E. Campisi J. Desprez P.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1332-1340PubMed Google Scholar), pancreas (3Maruyama H. Kleeff J. Wildi S. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Israel M.A. Korc M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), cervical (4Schindl M. Oberhuber G. Obermair A. Schoppmann S.F. Karner B. Birner P.

Urol. 2002; 167: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Id-1 expression levels are positively associated with poor clinical outcome and drug resistance (4Schindl M. Oberhuber G. Obermair A. Schoppmann S.F. Karner B. Birner P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5703-5706PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schindl M. Schoppmann S.F. Strobel T. Heinzl H. Leisser C. Horvat R. Birner P. Clin.

Cancer. 2003; 104: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, early stage cervical cancer patients with increased Id-1 expression show poor prognosis (4Schindl M. Oberhuber G. Obermair A. Schoppmann S.F. Karner B. Birner P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5703-5706PubMed Google Scholar). In breast and ovarian cancer patients, enhanced Id-1 expression is correlated with more aggressive behavior as well as much shorter overall survival (6Schindl M. Schoppmann S.F. Strobel T. Heinzl H. Leisser C. Horvat R. Birner P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 779-785PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schoppmann S.F. Schindl M. Bayer G. Aumayr K. Dienes J. Horvat R. Rudas M. Gnant M. Jakesz R. Birner P. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that Id-1 plays a positive role in promoting the development and progression of human cancer. In addition to its well described role in cell proliferation (8Alani R.M.

Sharrocks A.D. Peters G. Hara E. Nature. 2001; 409: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), recently, Id-1 has been reported to promote survival and metastatic ability of cancer cells. For example, overexpression of the Id-1 protein enhances invasive properties of hematopoietic cell lines through transactivation of the matrix metalloproteinase 9 transcription (10Nieborowska-Skorska M. Hoser G. Rink L. Malecki M. Kossev P. Wasik M.A. Skorski T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, Id-1 mediates transforming growth factor-β-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which epithelial cells obtain mesenchymal features and show reduced cell-cell contact and motility, and is suggested to play a critical role during invasion and metastasis (11Kondo M. Cubillo E. Tobiume K. Shirakihara T. Fukuda N. Suzuki H. Shimizu K. Takehara K. Cano A. Saitoh M. Miyazono K. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of the ID-1 promoter as a result of loss of the NF-1/Rb/HDAC-1 transcription repressor complex is also found in metastatic breast cancer cells (12Singh J. Murata K. Itahana Y. Desprez P.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1812-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previously, we have observed in prostate cancer cells that ectopic expression of Id-1 promotes the growth of endothelial cells (13Ling M.T. Lau T.C. Zhou C. Chua C.W. Kwok W.K. Wang Q. Wang X. Wong Y.C. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1668-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting its positive role in promoting angiogenesis. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that Id-1 is able to protect cancer cells against a variety of anticancer drug-induced apoptosis in several types of human cancer cells, including cervical, breast, prostate, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas (14Wong Y.C. Wang X. Ling M.T. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the reports on breast and gastric cancers that increased Id-1 expression is associated with highly aggressive phenotypes in both cell lines and animal models (15Tsuchiya T. Okaji Y. Tsuno N.H. Sakurai D. Tsuchiya N. Kawai K. Yazawa K. Asakage M. Yamada J. Yoneyama S. Kitayama J. Osada T. Watanabe T. Tokunaga K. Takahashi K. Nagawa H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In combination with the evidence that Id-1 overexpression is frequently found in advanced cancers (6Schindl M. Schoppmann S.F. Strobel T. Heinzl H. Leisser C. Horvat R. Birner P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 779-785PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schoppmann S.F. Schindl M. Bayer G. Aumayr K. Dienes J. Horvat R. Rudas M. Gnant M. Jakesz R. Birner P. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it is possible that the positive role of Id-1 in cancer metastasis and survival may provide an advantage for the progression of human cancer leading to poor clinical outcome. Several signaling pathways have been suggested to mediate the function of Id-1. For example, the Id-1-induced invasion ability in breast cancer cells is mediated through induction of the expression of a 120-kDa gelatinase, a type IV collagenase matrix metalloproteinase family member (17Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinase 9 activation is found to be responsible for the Id-1-induced increased invasive ability in leukemia cells (10Nieborowska-Skorska M. Hoser G. Rink L. Malecki M. Kossev P. Wasik M.A. Skorski T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that Id-1 plays a positive role in activation of the cell-matrix adhesion signaling pathway. In addition, Id-1 has been reported to be involved in the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression and reorganization of β-catenin and F-actin as well as in transforming growth factor-β-induced EMT in several cell types (11Kondo M. Cubillo E. Tobiume K. Shirakihara T. Fukuda N. Suzuki H. Shimizu K. Takehara K. Cano A. Saitoh M. Miyazono K.

Breitkopf K. Dooley S. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that it promotes metastatic ability through modification of the cell adherens junction complex. On the other hand, Id-1 is able to protect anticancer drug-induced apoptosis through activation of NF-κB and Raf/MEK and suppression of JNK pathways in prostate cancer and other types of cancer cells (19Cheung H.W. Ling M.T. Tsao S.W. Wong Y.C. Wang X. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Lin J.C. Chang S.Y. Hsieh D.S. Lee C.F. Yu D.S. J.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4498-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), indicating its ability to regulate multiple cell signaling pathways. However, it remains unknown as how Id-1 interacts with these pathways and what are the immediate downstream effectors of the Id-1 protein that mediate its interaction with cell signaling pathways. In this study, we report that by using yeast two-hybrid screening technique, we identified a novel Id-1 interacting protein, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), an integral cell membrane protein that interacts with multiple signaling molecules and regulates signaling transduction (23Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C494-C506Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the HLH domain of the Id-1 protein was responsible for the interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1. We also demonstrate that the physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1 was essential for the positive role of Id-1 in inducing EMT and cell survival in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, our results suggested that the Id-1-induced Akt activation through promoting the binding activity between Cav-1 and PP2A was accountable for its function as a promoter of prostate cancer cell invasion and resistance to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening for Id-1 Binding Candidates—A cDNA library was established from a human nonmalignant prostatic epithelial cell line, Hpr-1 (24Choo C.K. Ling M.T. Chan K.W. Tsao S.W. Zheng Z. Zhang D. Chan L.C. Wong Y.C. Prostate. 1999; 40: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and cloned into the prey vector pGAD424, using the SMART™ cDNA library construction kit (Clontech). The full-length ID-1 cDNA was cloned into the bait vector pAS2-1. The bait and prey constructs were co-transfected into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CG-1945 using the YEASTMAKER™ yeast transformation system 2 kit (Clontech). Positive clones were selected in the medium-stringency medium, SD/–His/–Leu/–Trp, and galactosidase assay using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 and Libraries kit (Clontech). The positive plasmids were recovered using a plasmid extraction kit (YEASTMAKER™ yeast plasmid isolation kit, Clontech), transformed into Escherichia coli for plasmid amplification and sequencing for identity, respectively. Cell Culture and Drugs—Two human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCap, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and 22RV1, kindly provided by Prof. F. L. Chan (Chinese University of Hong Kong), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5 or 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, respectively, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The anti-cancer drug, taxol, PI3K/Akt specific inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin (Calbiochem; dissolved in Me2SO), were diluted in culture medium to obtain the desired concentrations. Plasmids and Transient Transfection—HA-tagged CAV-1 was generated using the following primers: forward, 5′-ATTA GGA TCC ATG TCT GGG GGC AAA TAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATTA GGA TCC ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT TCT GGG GGC AAA TAC GTA G-3′. The PCR products were then cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The vector expressing the FLAG-tagged wild type Id-1 (WT-ID-1) was described previously (25Ling M.T. Kwok W.K. Fung M.K. Xianghong W. Wong Y.C. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and FLAG-tagged truncated ID-1 vectors were generated from the WT-ID-1 and then cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The vectors expressing FLAG-tagged Id-1 site-directed mutants were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with procedures described by the manufacturer. The resulting constructs were confirmed by sequencing and then transfected into cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). The Si-Con, Si-Id-1, and Si-Cav-1 were synthesized commercially by siGENOME™ (Dharmacon).

They were transiently transfected into cells with Lipofectamine according to the protocols described before (21Zhang X. Ling M.T. Wang X. Wong Y.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Detailed experimental procedures were described previously (21Zhang X. Ling M.T. Wang X. Wong Y.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were as follows: Id-1, Cav-1, N-cadherin, β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), E-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, GSK3β (BD Biosciences), p-Akt, Akt, p-GSK3β (Cell Signaling Technology), α-SMA, vimentin, FLAG, HA (Sigma), and PP2A-C subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer 48 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the FLAG HA tandem affinity purification kit (Sigma). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin or anti-HA-agarose affinity resin overnight. The resin was then washed three times with lysis buffer. The complex on the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin was eluted with 3×FLAG peptide (150 ng/ml), and the complex on anti-HA-agarose affinity resin was eluted with urea (8 m) for 30 min at 4 °C. The eluted complex was loaded onto SDS-PAGE for Western blotting analysis, using the procedures described above. For endogenous immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was pre-cleared by incubation with protein G-agarose beads and rabbit IgG for 1 h at 4°C and then incubated with anti-Cav-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The protein G-agarose beads were then added into the cell lysate and further incubated for 2 h. The beads were then washed with RIPA buffer and boiled with 2× sample buffer for 10 min at 100 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto as SDS-PAGE for Western blotting analysis. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturerŉs protocol (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR, cDNAs were synthesized using the Super-Script™ first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) and then amplified by PCR with E-cadherin-specific primers as described previously (26Chu Q. Ling M.T. Feng H. Cheung H.W. Tsao S.W. Wang X. Wong Y.C. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 2180-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95 °C was followed by 28 cycles of PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. GAPDH was amplified as an internal loading control. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels and analyzed using a gel documentation system (UVP, LLC, Upland, CA). Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated into a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well and were co-transfected with pGL2-Basic-Ecad1359 (kindly provided by Dr. Karen M. Habra and Dr. Amy S. Woodard, Departments of Internal Medicine, Human Genetics, and Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School) (27Hajra K.M. Ji X. Fearon E.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7274-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), pRL-CMV-Luc (internal control), WT-Id-1, or truncated Id-1 (FLAG-CT60-Id-1) and Cav-1, respectively. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, WI). Each data point represents the mean of three experiments, and error bars indicate the standard deviation. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Cell viability was measured using a MTT proliferation assay kit, and the detailed procedures were described previously (21Zhang X. Ling M.T. Wang X. Wong Y.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2072-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated with a primary polyclonal antibody against Id-1, a TRITC-labeled secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (DakoCytomation), a primary monoclonal antibody against Cav-1 (BD Biosciences), and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody against mouse IgG (DakoCytomation), respectively, or the cells were incubated with primary antibodies against E-cadherin or β-catenin (BD Biosciences), respectively, and then were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody against mouse IgG (DakoCytomation). Signals were visualized and captured using a fluorescent microscope under ×400 magnifications. Wound Closure Assay—Detailed experimental procedures were described previously (26Chu Q. Ling M.T. Feng H. Cheung H.W. Tsao S.W. Wang X. Wong Y.C. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 2180-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cell migration rate was generated as follows. The vertical distance between two borderlines of the wound was measured, and the distance was set up as 1.0 at time 0 h in each cell line. Cell migration rate was calculated by dividing the distance between two borderlines at indicated experimental time points and time 0 h. Protein Phosphatase 2A Activity Assay—The PP2A activity was measured using a PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit with the procedures described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, NY). Briefly, cells were lysed with phosphatase lysis buffer described as before (28Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against PP2A-C subunit and the protein A-agarose slurry for 1 h. The agarose beads were then washed twice with phosphatase lysis buffer and once with phosphatase assay buffer. PP2A activity was determined using a malachite green phosphatase assay protocol with a phosphopeptide (KRpTIRR) as the substrate, followed by the measurement of absorbance at 650 nm. Results represented the OD ratio between the transfected cells and the untransfected controls. Each data point represented the mean ± S.D. Identification of an Id-1 Interacting Protein, Caveolin-1—To identify novel Id-1 interacting proteins, we used a full-length Id-1 cDNA as a bait to screen a cDNA library derived from an immortalized human nonmalignant prostatic epithelial cell line, Hpr-1, using the yeast two-hybrid technique. Sixteen positive clones were selected (data not shown). Sequence analysis and data base comparison revealed that one positive clone had 100% identity to the Homo sapiens caveolin-1 mRNA coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_001753). It encodes a cell membrane protein, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a subunit of caveolins that are necessary for caveolae formation, and has been reported to regulate the signaling of membrane proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor, Src, and H-ras through direct physical interaction (23Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C494-C506Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been reported that similar to the Id-1 expression patterns in prostate cancer (5Ouyang X.S. Wang X. Lee D.T. Tsao S.W. Wong Y.C. J. Urol. 2002; 167: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 29Yuen H.F. Chua C.W. Chan Y.P. Wong Y.C. Wang X. Chan K.W. Mod.

Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 2044-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), Cav-1 is up-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer specimens, and its expression levels are correlated positively with Gleason Score (31Yang G. Truong L.D. Wheeler T.M. Thompson T.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5719-5723PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1 may play a role in mediating the oncogenic function of Id-1 in prostate cancer. To confirm the in vivo interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1, expression vectors containing Id-1-FLAG and Cav-1-HA were co-transfected into a prostate cancer cell line, LNCap, and the cells transfected with Cav-1-HA alone were used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1A, Western blotting analysis on total cell lysates showed that HA was detected in the cells transfected with Cav-1-HA (Fig. 1A, lane 1, upper panel), whereas both HA and FLAG were detected in the cells transfected with Id-1-FLAG + Cav-1-HA (lane 2), indicating successful expression of both proteins. After immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin, Cav-1-HA was detected in the precipitates derived from the cells co-transfected with both Id-1-FLAG and Cav-1-HA (Fig. 1A, lane 4), indicating co-immunoprecipitation of Cav-1 with Id-1. Reciprocally, after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA-agarose affinity resin (Fig. 1A, lower panel), Id-1-FLAG was detected in the cells co-transfected with the two proteins (lane 8), confirming the interaction between Cav-1 and Id-1. To confirm these results, two prostate cancer cell lines with relatively high levels of Id-1 and Cav-1 were used to repeat the immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1B, left panel). As shown in Fig. 1B (lanes 3 and 6), the endogenous Id-1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates by an anti-Cav-1 antibody in both cell lines, further suggesting an interaction between these two proteins. In addition, fluorescent immunostaining also showed that both Id-1 and Cav-1 were co-localized in the cytoplasm of Hpr-1 cells (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest a physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1.FIGURE 1Id-1 interacts with Cav-1. A, co-immunoprecipitation analysis of Id-1 and Cav-1 in LNCap cells. Expression vectors containing ID-1-FLAG and CAV-1-HA were co-transfected into LNCap cells, and cells transfected with CAV-1-HA or ID-1-FLAG alone were used as negative controls, respectively. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG affinity resin and blotted with anti-HA and anti-FLAG (top panel) or anti-HA-agarose affinity resin and blotted with anti-FLAG or anti-HA (bottom panel), respectively. Note that Cav-1-HA co-immunoprecipitates with Id-1-FLAG (lane 4, upper panel), and vice versa (lane 8, bottom panel). B, immunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous Id-1 and Cav-1 in DU145 and PC3 cells. Left panel, Western blotting (WB) analysis of Id-1 and Cav-1 expression. Right panel, Western blotting analysis of Id-1 expression in cell lysate immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cav-1 antibody. C, immunofluorescent staining of Id-1 and Cav-1. Hpr1 cells were fixed and stained with anti-Id-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-Cav-1 mouse monoclonal antibody and processed for fluorescent microscope imaging. Top left, immunofluorescent staining shows cytoplasmic localization of Id-1; top right, immunofluorescent staining shows the localization of Cav-1, and the bottom left shows cell nuclear staining by 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Merged fluorescent image indicates cytoplasmic co-localization of Id-1 and Cav-1. Photos were taken under ×400 magnifications. D, structure of FLAG-tagged truncated and mutated Id-1 constructs. Three truncated Id-1s, FLAG-NCT20-Id-1 (20 amino acids deleted from N- and C-terminals), NT71-Id-1-FLAG (71 amino acids deleted from N terminus), and FLAG-CT60-Id-1 (60 amino acids deleted from C terminus), and four Id-1 mutants, Id-1(Y67D)-FLAG, Id-1(L76H)-FLAG, Id-1(K91E)-FLAG, and Id-1-(Y101D)-FLAG, were generated. E, co-immunoprecipitation analysis of Id-1 mutants and Cav-1. Expression vectors containing FLAG-tagged truncated or point-mutated ID-1 and CAV-1-HA were co-transfected into LNCap cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG affinity resin and blotted with anti-HA and anti-FLAG, respectively. Note that Cav-1-HA only co-immunoprecipitates with FLAG-NCT20-Id-1 (lane 3, upper panel) and FLAG tagged WT-Id-1 (lane 2 upper panel), whereas all the FLAG-tagged point-mutated Id-1s co-immunoprecipitate with Cav-1-HA (lanes 7–11, upper panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the binding domain of Id-1 to Cav-1, we constructed three vectors expressing truncated forms of Id-1, FLAG-NCT20-Id-1 (20 amino acids deleted from N and C termini, respectively), NT71-Id-1-FLAG (71 amino acids deleted from N terminus), and CT60-Id-1-FLAG (60 amino acids deleted from C terminus) (Fig. 1D). These three ID-1 truncates and the wild type ID-1 were then co-transfected, respectively, with CAV-1-HA into LNCap cells, and the whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin. As shown in Fig. 1E, all the FLAG-tagged Id-1 proteins were detected in the precipitates (lanes 2–5, lower panel), indicating successful immunoprecipitation of the FLAG protein. The Cav-1-HA, however, was only detected in the cells expressing WT-Id-1-FLAG and FLAG-NCT20-Id-1, which contained an intact HLH domain of the Id-1 protein (Fig. 1E, lanes 2 and 3, upper panel). These results demonstrate that the HLH domain of the Id-1 protein may be essential for the interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1. To further study the importance of the HLH domain in the binding activity, we constructed four Id-1 mutants containing point mutations, in which one of the conserved amino acids in the HLH domain was mutated (Fig. 1D). Then these mutants were co-transfected, respectively, with Cav-1-HA into LNCap cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin. As shown in Fig. 1E, Cav-1-HA was detected in all of the precipitates (lanes 7–11, upper panel), indicating that one amino acid alteration in the HLH domain is not sufficient to completely destroy the binding activity of Id-1 to Cav-1. However, the binding between Id-1(Y101D)-FLAG a"

We have previously demonstrated that CHOP is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this study, during the process of clarifying the mechanism of the degradation of CHOP, we identified a novel regulation domain of CHOP in its N-terminal portion that is involved in various regulations and functions. The CHOP N-terminal domain is necessary not only for protein degradation but also for its transactivity and interaction with p300. In addition, trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, repressed the degradation of CHOP protein via the N-terminal domain. TRB3, a mammalian tribbles homolog that functions as a repressor of CHOP, also interacted with CHOP via the N-terminal portion and significantly blocked the association of p300 with CHOP. These results suggest that the N-terminal portion of CHOP plays a crucial role in its functional regulation and enable us to identify a novel function of TRB3 as an intracellular antagonist of the p300-binding domain of CHOP.

This family consists of six members: C/EBPα, β (NF-IL6), γ (Ig/EBP), δ, ϵ, and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, C/EBPζ)/growth arrest-DNA damage-inducible 153 (GADD153) (1Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The prototypic C/EBP contains a transcriptional activation domain and a bZIP region for DNA binding and dimerization. All family members share strong homology in the C-terminal domain, which carries a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper motif. CHOP was originally isolated as a gene induced in response to DNA-damaging agents; subsequently it has been revealed that CHOP is induced by extracellular and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (2Fornace A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 3Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). ER stress responses are induced by cellular stresses, such as glucose starvation and hypoxia, that prevent protein folding and cause misfolded or malfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER (4Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 5Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, the homeostasis of protein folding in the ER is maintained by inter-organelle signaling from the ER to the nucleus, a process known as the unfolded protein response. Thus, from yeast to humans, the transcription of genes encoding molecular chaperones and folding enzymes in the ER is induced in the nucleus in response to unfolding in the ER, and excessive or long-term accumulations of unfolding proteins in the ER result in the apoptosis of cells. From experiments on the overexpression of its protein and knock-out mice, CHOP has been shown to act as an inducer of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis during ER stress. In addition, a recent study suggested that CHOP-mediated apoptosis during ER stress is implicated in diseases with ER stress-dependent cell death, such as neurodegenerative disease and/or type I diabetes (6Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). During ER stress, CHOP is mainly induced via activation of the ER-localized kinase double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) through the downstream phosphorylation of a translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), and induction of a transcription factor, activation transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (7Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that four different kinases phosphorylate eIF2α and activate its downstream pathway, including induction of ATF4 and CHOP. These pathways are termed the integrated stress response, and each response is activated by a distinct upstream activation signal (7Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Amino acid starvation activates the integrated stress response through general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) (8Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 7: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (563) Google Scholar), while viral infection and iron deficiency activate the integrated stress response through the vertebrate-specific kinases double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) (9Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) (10Chen J.J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K. Brodsky M. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 1: 7729-7733Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar), respectively, and stress from accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER activates the integrated stress response through PERK. Because the basic region of CHOP is less conserved than that of other C/EBP family proteins, CHOP lacks DNA binding activity for the C/EBP-binding site. In addition, as CHOP cannot form homodimer, CHOP inhibits the ability of other C/EBP proteins such as NF-IL6 to bind DNA and exert transcriptional regulatory activity by forming heterodimers with their proteins (11Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a CHOP-C/EBP heterodimer has been reported to bind to a unique DNA sequence, the CHOP-binding site, which is different from classical C/EBP-binding sites, and to act as a positive transactivator (12Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent studies, several CHOP-inducible genes have been shown to be induced during ER stress via this CHOP binding sequence (13Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 14Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). We very recently demonstrated that TRB3, a novel ER stress-inducible protein, is induced by CHOP with a novel dimerizing partner, ATF4, which is a transcription factor of ATF/CREB family member, via a novel CHOP binding sequence, CHOP-amino acid response element sites (15Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). A large number of transcription factors undergo degradation via a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway (16Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 17Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A genetic study on Drosophila revealed that Slbo, a Drosophila homolog of C/EBP, is specifically degraded dependent on the expression of tribbles by the ubiquitin-proteasome (18Rorth P. Szabo K. Texido G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In humans, we have previously reported that C/EBP family transcription factors CHOP and Ig/EBP (C/EBPγ) are multiubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (19Hattori T. Ohoka N. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22 (a): 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TRB3, a human ortholog of tribbles, interacted with CHOP but did not promote degradation of CHOP protein. Therefore, the molecular mechanism involved in CHOP degradation is still unclear. In this study, we identified the amino acid (aa) region required for degradation of the CHOP protein in its N-terminal portion. This region was also shown to be critical for CHOP transcriptional activity and interaction with p300; furthermore, TRB3 antagonized p300 binding to CHOP via this region. Degradation of CHOP protein via this region was suppressed by treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), and therefore this N-terminal domain of CHOP seemed to be crucial for various aspects of its functional regulation.

Recombinant Protein Expression—pGEX-6P-1 plasmids encoding the GST proteins alone or GST-TRB3 or GST-FLAG-CHOP fusion proteins were transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen, Madison, WI). Protein expression and purification were performed according to the procedures outlined in the Bulk GST Purification Module (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant FLAG-CHOP protein was prepared using PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were transiently transfected and treated as described in the figure legends. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described in the figure legends. One to two percent of the lysates or co-immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5%), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies indicated in the figure legends. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and light emission was quantified with a LAS1000 lumino image analyzer (Fuji). Transfection—A375 cells were transfected by a lipofection method using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293 and HepG2 cells were transfected by the Chen-Okayama method (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Endogenous CHOP Protein Is Degraded by the Proteasome System—In normal conditions in multiple tissues and cells, the endogenous CHOP protein level is very low and its expression is induced at the transcriptional level during various extracellular and ER stresses. First, we investigated whether the level of endogenous CHOP protein is regulated through degradation by the proteasome during ER stress. We previously examined the effect of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, on the endogenous CHOP protein level and showed that its expression was markedly augmented in the presence of MG132 (19Hattori T. Ohoka N. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22 (a): 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, as the proteasome inhibitors induce ER stress by inhibiting degradation of unfolded proteins in the ER, there is a possibility that this augmentation was caused at the transcriptional level. Therefore, to directly assess whether CHOP protein is regulated by the proteasome system, we first examined the effect of MG132 on the rate of degradation of endogenous CHOP protein. The degradation rate was investigated by chasing with cycloheximide, a de novo protein synthesis inhibitor, in the presence of tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor, for the indicated periods after pre-induction by treatment with tunicamycin for 6 h (Fig. 1, top). During ER stress induced by treatment with tunicamycin, endogenous CHOP protein level was effectively decreased by the degradation; however, NF-IL6 was not, as shown in a previous report (19Hattori T. Ohoka N. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22 (a): 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when CHOP was induced and chased by treatment with other ER stress inducers, A23187 and thapsigargin (data not shown). On the other hand, when chased by MG132, CHOP protein was significantly stabilized (Fig. 1, bottom). This repression of degradation was thought to be caused by the proteasome inhibitory action of MG132, thus confirming that endogenous CHOP induced during ER stress is degraded by the proteasome system. The N-terminal Region of CHOP Is Critical for Degradation—During ubiquitination, ubiquitins are added to the lysine residues of target molecules through the association of specific ubiquitin ligases, E3. In addition, various modifications, such as phosphorylation, of substrates are necessary for the binding of E3 ligase(s) in some cases. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of degradation of CHOP in detail, we constructed expression vectors for various mutants of CHOP and observed the expression level of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, CHOP deletion mutants truncated in the N-terminal region (CHOPΔN70 (aa 71–169) and CHOPΔN36 (aa 37–169)) were expressed at much higher levels compared with wild-type CHOP (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, other point and deletion mutants in the potential phosphorylation sites (Ser79, 82) and basic region, respectively, were expressed at levels similar to wild-type CHOP, and the deletion mutants of the leucine zipper domain were expressed at slightly lower levels (data not shown). To assess whether the augmentation of the expression of N-terminal-deleted CHOPs was caused by inhibition of degradation by the proteasome, we next examined the effect of MG132 treatment on the expression of these mutants. As shown in a previous report (19Hattori T. Ohoka N. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22 (a): 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the accumulation of wild-type CHOP protein was increased by treatment with MG132; however, CHOPΔN70 and CHOPΔN36 were not affected (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of CHOP is necessary for degradation by the proteasome. We examined the subcellular localization of wild-type, ΔN70 (N-terminal deletion), or N70 (N-terminal alone) CHOP by using the GFP fusion system. GFP-CHOPΔN70 was primarily localized within the nucleus, as was wild-type CHOP; by contrast, GFP alone or GFP-CHOP N70 (aa 1–70) was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that the nuclear localization signal of CHOP exists in the C-terminal region (aa 71–169) and the resistance to degradation of the N-terminal deletion mutants does not result from a difference of this subcellular localization compared with that of wild-type CHOP. Identification of the Region Required for Degradation of CHOP—To further clarify the importance and function of the CHOP N-terminal region for degradation, we constructed additional N-terminal-truncated mutants (Fig. 3A). CHOPΔN18 (aa 19–169) and CHOPΔ19–26 (aa 1–18, 27–169) were highly expressed and were not affected by MG132 treatment, which was also the case for CHOPΔN70 and CHOPΔN36. On the other hand, CHOPΔ37–64 (aa 1–36, 65–169) showed almost the same basal expression level and enhancement of accumulation by MG132 as wild-type CHOP (Fig. 3B). CHOPΔN9 (aa 10–169) and CHOPΔ27–64 (aa 1–26, 65–169) showed slightly lower expression levels as compared with the mutants insensitive to MG132, such as CHOPΔN18, and a slight increase of accumulation by MG132 treatment (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the region between aa 10 and 26 in CHOP is required for degradation by the proteasome. As the main part of this region consists of an α-helix structure (Fig. 3A) (22Ubeda M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40514-40520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), this motif may be significant for the binding to E3 ligase(s) or related molecule(s). In the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the level of degradation of many factors is controlled by the regulation of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. These modifications act as switches for direct regulation, such as binding to E3 ligase(s), or indirect regulation, for example, by changing the subcellular localization. As the region between aa 10 and 26 of CHOP, which is required for the degradation, contains some potential sites for phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), we examined the effect of substitution of these amino acids with Ala on the sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor. CHOP S5,9A, CHOP T12A and CHOP S14,15A protein levels were augmented by MG132 treatment (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, CHOP Y22A protein was accumulated under the normal conditions and was not affected by the proteasome inhibitor; however, the substitution of Tyr22 by Phe (CHOP Y22F) resulted in almost the same accumulation in response to MG132 treatment as wild-type CHOP (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the CHOP N-terminal region is not significant for the constitutive degradation of CHOP but the Tyr22 amino acid residue plays an essential role in the degradation, probably due to its role in maintaining the N-terminal α-helix structure. In summary, we concluded that the N-terminal α-helix structure of CHOP is necessary for the degradation. N-terminal-deleted CHOPs Are Not Polyubiquitinated—In the presence of MG132, CHOP protein was accumulated and multiubiquitinated, indicating that CHOP is constitutively ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (19Hattori T. Ohoka N. Inoue Y. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22 (a): 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). As the protein levels of N-terminal-deleted CHOPs were increased in the basal condition and were not affected by the treatment with proteasome inhibitor (Figs. 2 and 3), we examined whether these mutants are polyubiquitinated. Consistent with the protein stabilities, wild-type CHOP and CHOPΔN9 were highly and slightly, respectively, ubiquitinated upon co-expression with ubiquitin; however, CHOPΔN18 and CHOPΔ19–26 were not ubiquitinated under these conditions (Fig. 3E). CHOP Y22A was also not ubiquitinated, but the other substituted mutants shown in Fig. 3C were multiubiquitinated (data not shown). These results also suggest that the region between aa 10 and 26 in CHOP is essential for the polyubiquitination preceding degradation. The N-terminal Region of CHOP Is Also Critical for Its Transcriptional Activity and Interaction with a Coactivator, p300—We previously reported that the region between aa 10 and 18 in CHOP is very important for transcriptional activity, as shown by analysis using CHOP fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding region (15Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of GAL4-CHOPΔ19–26 was also lost in that assay (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the region aa 10–26 of CHOP is essential for not only the protein stability but also the transcriptional activity of CHOP. Therefore, to explore the possibility that CHOP associates with primary transcription factor(s) or coactivator(s) via this region, we examined the interaction of CHOP with p300, a transcriptional coactivator having histone acetyl transferase activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, wild-type CHOP strongly associated with p300; however, CHOPΔN18, Δ19–26, and ΔN36 almost did not. In addition, consistent with the transcriptional activities, the interaction of CHOPΔN9 with p300 was reduced but still significant (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of CHOP is critical for the interaction of CHOP with p300 as well. TRB3 Inhibits the Association of CHOP with p300—Recently, TRB3, a human ortholog of tribbles, was identified as a novel Akt-binding and -regulating protein (23Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that TRB3 is an ER stress-inducible protein and interacts with CHOP to inhibit its transcriptional activity (15Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In addition, the region between aa 10 and 18 in CHOP is necessary for the interaction with TRB3 (15Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), indicating that this region is overlapping with the p300-binding site. Therefore, we examined the effect of TRB3 expression for the association of CHOP with p300. As shown in Fig. 5A, TRB3 expression dramatically inhibited the binding of CHOP with p300; on the other hand, p300 expression did not affect the binding of CHOP with TRB3. In our previous study, TRB3 also suppressed the transcriptional activity of ATF4, another ER stress-induced transcription factor (15Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, TRB3 inhibited the p300-ATF4 interaction as well. In an in vitro binding assay, recombinant GST-TRB3 dose-dependently interacted with recombinant FLAG-CHOP and inhibited the association of p300 with that (Fig. 5C). In addition, TRB3 expression suppressed coactivation of the transcriptional activity of wild-type CHOP by p300, whereas neither TRB3 nor p300 affected the transcriptional activity of CHOP ΔN18 (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that the affinity of the CHOP-TRB3 interaction is probably high as compared with that of the CHOP-p300 interaction and therefore TRB3 inhibits CHOP-dependent transcriptional activation by preventing CHOP-p300 association. Trichostatin A Represses CHOP Protein Degradation—P300/CBP coactivators acetylate not only chromatin-conjugated histone but also various molecules such as transcription factor p53. The inhibition of cellular deacetylases leads to a longer half-life of endogenous p53; furthermore, p53 is ubiquitinated and acetylated on similar sites at the C terminus, suggesting that these modifications may compete for the same residues (24Ito A. Lawaguchi Y. Lai C. Kovacs J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 25Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). As CHOP bound strongly to p300, we next explored whether p300 acetylates CHOP and regulates its ubiquitination and degradation. First, we examined the effect of TSA, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, on the CHOP protein level and found that exogenous wild-type CHOP protein, but not ΔN18 or Δ19–26, accumulated in response to treatment with TSA as well as MG132 (Fig. 6A). The additive or synergistic effect of MG132 and TSA on the CHOP protein accumulation was not observed, suggesting that the effects of these treatments are caused by a similar mechanism. In addition, endogenous CHOP induced by tunicamycin was also accumulated as a result of TSA treatment in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6B) or A375 and 293 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, endogenous CHOP protein degradation was repressed in the presence of TSA (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that CHOP protein is stabilized by inhibition of HDAC activities. The stabilization of CHOP by TSA treatment was thought to be induced through the acetylation of CHOP protein. Therefore, we examined whether CHOP is acetylated by p300 in the presence of TSA or MG132. By Western blotting using an antibody specifically recognizing acetylated lysine residues, acetylated p53 was detected as a positive control; however, acetylated CHOP was not detected at all (Fig. 6D). This result suggests that the accumulation of CHOP protein induced by TSA is not caused through an antagonistic mechanism of acetylation for ubiquitination. On the other hand, CHOP interacted with some HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC5, and HDAC6) (Fig. 6E), and these HDACs may regulate the degradation of CHOP through some mechanism not involving the deacetylation of CHOP itself. CHOP is a transcription factor induced by ER stress and is involved in apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that the accumulation of CHOP protein during ER stress is regulated through modulation of its degradation by the proteasome. In addition, the region between aa 10 and 26 of CHOP was essential for its degradation. In the N-terminal region aa 1–70 of CHOP, a lysine residue, which would be necessary for modification by ubiquitins, only exists at position aa 50. CHOPΔN36 was not accumulated as a result of MG132 treatment despite the absence of Lys50, indicating that the enhancement of accumulation caused by N-terminal deletion does not result from the lack of the ubiquitination of lysine residues. Indeed, the substitution of CHOP Lys50 with Arg (CHOP K50R) resulted in almost the same protein expression level and accumulation upon MG132 treatment as for the wild-type CHOP (data not shown). At the same time, these results indicate that the N-terminal region of CHOP is important for degradation by the proteasome and probably for binding to E3 ligase(s) or related molecule(s). In this study, we have identified a novel functional domain of CHOP in the region between aa 10 and 26 that is necessary for not only the degradation of the protein but also its transcriptional activity and interaction with p300. Recently, there have been several reports showing that the acetylation of transcription factors can trigger critical regulation of activation or inactivation (26Freiman R.N. Tjian R. Cell. 2003; 112: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). CHOP associated with p300 but was not acetylated by it. Therefore, at least, p300 seems to not regulate the activity of CHOP via its acetylation. On the other hand, recently p300 was shown to be a crucial factor for degradation of p53 as E4 ligase (27Grossman S.R. Deato M.E. Brignone C. Chan H.M. Lung A.L. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Science. 2003; 300: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of CHOP necessary for degradation was essential for interaction with p300; therefore, p300 may regulate the degradation of CHOP protein as well. CHOP associated with MDM2, the E3 ligase for p53 (25Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and Fbw1, the F-box protein for IκB (28Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3859-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or β-catenin (29Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), in vivo (data not shown). The molecular mechanisms underlying whether these molecules function as the E3 ligase for CHOP are currently under investigation. We showed here that CHOP degradation is repressed by the inhibition of deacetylation activity by TSA treatment via the region aa 10–26 as well. CHOP interacted with HDACs but was not acetylated upon the treatment with TSA, indicating that the degradation of CHOP is not regulated by its acetylation. Recently, it was revealed that the acetylation of MDM2 causes inactivation of its activity for degradation of p53 (30Wang X. Taplick J. Geva N. Oren M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, the E3 ligase for CHOP may be activated through deacetylation by HDAC(s) in untreated cells and may be inactivated through the inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA as well. We previously showed that TRB3, an ER stress-induced kinase-like protein, associated with CHOP to suppress CHOP-dependent transcriptional activation through a proteolysis-independent pathway (15Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). TRB3 did not interfere with the dimerization of CHOP or with its DNA binding activity. In addition, as TRB3 repressed even the transcriptional activity of a GAL4 fusion protein of CHOP, it was suggested that TRB3 primarily inhibits CHOP transactivation, probably by inhibiting the modification of CHOP required for its transactivation or by interfering with the association of coactivator(s) or by recruiting corepressor(s) to DNA. Indeed, the TRB3 binding region of CHOP, aa 10–18, is a part of its p300 binding region, aa 10–26, and TRB3 expression significantly blocked the association of p300 with CHOP. TRB3 suppressed the transcriptional activity of ATF4, another ER stress-induced transcription factor. In the present study, TRB3 repressed the p300-ATF4 interaction as well. These results suggest a novel function of TRB3 as an intracellular antagonist of the p300-binding domains of both CHOP and ATF4. As TRB3 and other tribbles family members contain the classic substrate-binding domains of a protein kinase but not the ATP-binding and kinase-activation domains (31Bowers A.J. Scully S. Boylan J.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), TRB3 could act as a novel type of decoy kinase-like protein for Akt or other substrates. Similarly, TRB3 could act as a novel type of decoy deacetylase-like protein for p300 as well. This study revealed that various molecules regulate the function of CHOP via effects on its degradation. CHOP is induced by various stress signals, such as ER stress, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and amino acid deprivation. Therefore, it is possible that CHOP signaling is strictly regulated by these stresses via its N-terminal portion. The analysis of these mechanisms may identify potential targets for the regulation of CHOP function. We thank Dr. D. Bohmann, Dr. T. Okamoto, and Dr. S. Akira for the gifts of expression plasmids."

The most common and studied of these mutations is T8993G converting the highly conserved leucine 156 into arginine. We have introduced this mutation at the corresponding position (183) of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrially encoded Atp6p. The “yeast NARP mutant” grew very slowly on respiratory substrates, possibly because mitochondrial ATP synthesis was only 10% of the wild type level. The mutated ATP synthase was found to be correctly assembled and present at nearly normal levels (80% of the wild type). Contrary to what has been reported for human NARP cells, the reverse functioning of the ATP synthase, i.e. ATP hydrolysis in the F1 coupled to F0-mediated proton translocation out of the mitochondrial matrix, was significantly compromised in the yeast NARP mutant. Interestingly, the oxygen consumption rate in the yeast NARP mutant was decreased by about 80% compared with the wild type, due to a selective lowering in cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) content. This finding suggests a possible regulatory mechanism between ATP synthase activity and complex IV expression in yeast mitochondria.

Most of the cellular ATP requirements in human are produced by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase. This enzyme synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate by using the electrochemical proton gradient formed across the inner mitochondrial membrane in the course of electron transfer to oxygen by the respiratory chain (complexes I–IV). The ATP synthase harbors two major structural domains, a transmembrane component (F0) containing a proton-permeable pore and a peripheral, matrix-localized, catalytic component (F1) where the ATP is synthesized (1Boyer P.D.

Some authors proposed that the underlying mechanism for the impaired ATP production would be a defect in the assembly/stability of the ATP synthase (13Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanska J. Houstkova H.

The use of model organisms easily tractable to genetic manipulations may help to better understand ATP synthase alterations involved in human diseases. E. coli ATP synthase was found to be very sensitive to the leucine to arginine pathogenic change induced by T8993G (at position 207 of the homologous subunit a) as evidenced by a complete loss of both ATP synthesis and ATP-driven proton pumping activities (22Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12250-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whereas the assembly of L156R-Atp6p in human cells containing high levels, up to 100%, of T8993G was found to be unaffected (19Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Murray J. Santorelli F.M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The more sophisticated structure of mitochondrial ATP synthase, with at least 10 subunits not present in the bacterial enzyme (24Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), together with important differences in subunit a and Atp6p structures (10Schon E.A. Santra S. Pallotti F. Girvin M.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), might be responsible for the different sensitivities of the bacterial and human ATP synthases to the leucine to arginine pathogenic change. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a facultative aerobic eukaryote, obviously is a much better model than bacteria for the study of human mitochondrial disorders (46Onishi T. Kroger A. Heldt H.W. Pfaff E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), especially those involving mutations of the ATP synthase, an enzyme that is highly similar in yeast and human (24Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As in human, the yeast Atp6p gene lies within the mtDNA, and S. cerevisiae is one of the rare organisms tractable to site-directed mutagenesis of the mtDNA (25Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 381-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its normal incapacity to stably propagate an heteroplasmic state, one can easily obtain yeast populations where all the mtDNA molecules bear a given mutation, thus creating excellent conditions to investigate the consequences of specific mtDNA alterations on mitochondrial structure and function. Yeast Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains and their genotypes are listed in Table 1. The media used for growth of yeast were: YPGA (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose, and 40 mg liter–1 adenine); N3 (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2); YPGALA (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) galactose, and 40 mg liter–1 adenine); WO (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose), and other supplements depending on the strain auxotrophic markers.

Roganti T. Lecrenier N. Purnelle B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar)), from nucleotide position –316 upstream of the ATP6 initiator codon to nucleotide position +275 downstream of the ATP6 stop codon, was PCR amplified as a BamHI-BamHI fragment (described in Ref. 27Rak M. Tetaud E. Godard F. Sagot I. Salin B. Duvezin-Caubet S. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 280: 10853-10864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Its unique EcoRI site (internal to the ATP6 coding sequence) was cut and the two resulting BamHI-EcoRI fragments cloned separately into pUC19, to give pSDC8 and pSDC9. The pSDC8 plasmid contains the 5′ end of the ATP6 locus where the leucine TTA codon 183 (equivalent to the leucine 156 codon of human ATP6 gene) is located. Using the QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit of Stratagene, the TTA codon 183 of the yeast ATP6 gene in pSDC8 was changed into the arginine AGA codon with primers 5′-CGCTAGAGCTATTTCAAGAGGTTTAAGATTAGGTTCTAATATCTTAGCTGG and 5′-CCAGCTAAGATATTAGAACCTAATCTTAAACCTCTTGAAATAGCTCTAGCG (the mutagenic bases are in bold), to give plasmid pSDC15. The SapI-EcoRI ATP6 fragment of pSDC15 was isolated and ligated with pJM2 cut with the same enzymes, to give pSDC17. The pJM2 plasmid contains the yeast mitochondrial COX2 gene as a marker for mitochondrial transformation (28Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The 3′ part of the wild type ATP6 locus in pSDC9 was liberated by a SapI + EcoRI digestion and cloned into the same sites of pSDC17, to give pSDC22, thus reconstructing a whole ATP6 gene containing the L183R mutation. The pSDC22 plasmid was introduced by co-transformation with the nuclear selectable LEU2 plasmid pFL46 into the ρ0 strain DFS160 by microprojectile bombardment using a biolistic PDS-1000/He particle delivery system (Bio-Rad) as described (25Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 381-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial transformants were identified among the Leu+ nuclear transformants by their ability to produce respiring clones when mated to the nonrespiring NB40-3C strain bearing a deletion in the mitochondrial COX2 gene (25Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 381-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One mitochondrial transformant (synthetic ρ– SDC31) was crossed to the atp6::ARG8m deletion strain MR10 (27Rak M. Tetaud E. Godard F. Sagot I. Salin B. Duvezin-Caubet S. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 280: 10853-10864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The crosses SDC31 x MR10 produced cytoductants (called MR14) harboring the MR10 nucleus and where the ARG8m open reading frame had been replaced with the ATP6-L183R gene. The MR14 clones were identified by virtue of their inability to grow in the absence of an external source of arginine and complementation tests with a ρ-strain (SDC30 (27Rak M. Tetaud E. Godard F. Sagot I. Salin B. Duvezin-Caubet S. Slonimski P.P. Rytka J. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol.

Sequencing of the mutated atp6 locus in MR14 revealed no other changes than L183R. Miscellaneous Procedures—Cells that were ρ+ in MR14 cultures were identified by virtue of their ability to form pink colonies in the presence of limiting amounts of adenine, whereas ρ–/ρ° cells gave white colonies. The pink color is due to an intermediate of the adenine biosynthetic pathway that accumulates in strains with an auxotrophic mutation in the ADE2 gene (49Reaume S.L. Tatum E.L. Arch. Biochem. 1949; 22: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar, 50Kim G. Sikder H. Singh K.K. Mutagenesis. 2002; 17: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When respiration is totally abolished, this pigment is not oxidized and remains white. For mitochondrial enzyme assays and membrane potential analyses, mitochondria were prepared by the enzymatic method (29Guerin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), from MR6 and MR14 strains grown to middle exponential phase (3–4 × 107 cells ml–1) in YPGALA medium.

Oxygen consumption rates were measured with a Clark electrode in the respiration buffer (0.65 m mannitol, 0.36 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris phosphate, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.8) as described previously (31Rigoulet M. Guerin B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For ATP synthesis rate measurements, mitochondria (0.3 mg ml–1) were placed in a 2-ml thermostatically controlled chamber at 28 °C in respiration buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 4 mm NADH and 1 mm ADP and stopped by 3.5% perchloric acid, 12.5 mm EDTA. Samples were then neutralized to pH 6.5 by addition of 2 n KOH, MOPS. 0.3 m ATP was quantified by luciferin/luciferase assay (ThermoLabsystems) on an LKB bioluminometer. Participation of the F1F0-ATP synthase in ATP production was assessed by oligomycin addition (20 μgmg–1 of protein). The specific ATPase activity was measured at pH 8.4 using a previously described procedure (32Somlo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Variations in transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) were evaluated in the respiration buffer by measurement of rhodamine 123 fluorescence quenching with a SAFAS Monaco fluorescence spectrophotometer (33Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Cytochrome spectral analysis was performed as in Ref. 47Venar R. Brèthes D.

SDS-PAGE was according to Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (35Arselin G.

Monoclonal antibodies against Cox2p subunit of complex IV (from Molecular Probes) were used after dilution to 1:5000. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibodies at a 1:10,000 dilution and revealed with the ECL reagent of Amersham Biosciences.

Converting Atp6p Leucine Residue 183 into Arginine Severely Compromises the Yeast Respiratory Growth—Leucine residue 156 of human Atp6p changed into arginine by the T8993G mutation corresponds to leucine residue 183 of yeast Atp6p. The TTA triplet encoding this residue was converted into the arginine AGA codon on a plasmid bearing the yeast wild type ATP6 gene. The resulting mutated plasmid (pSDC22) was introduced by biolistic transformation into the mitochondria of a yeast strain lacking mtDNA (ρ°). Crossings were then performed to fix the atp6-L183R mutation by mtDNA recombination into a complete (ρ+) mitochondrial genome, and give strain MR14. MR14 strain exhibited a very slow growth on media containing a non-fermentable carbon source (e.g. glycerol), both at 28 °C, the optimal temperature for growing yeast (Fig. 1), and at 36 °C (not shown), whereas the growth on glucose was normal (Fig. 1). The MR14 respiratory growth deficiency was rescued by crossing with a synthetic ρ– strain (SDC30) containing in its mitochondria the wild type ATP6 gene only (not shown), which proved that no other genetic alteration than atp6-L183R, in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, was involved in the expression of MR14 respiratory growth-deficiency phenotype. The atp6-L183R Mutation Has a Minor Influence on Yeast mtDNA Stability—Quite often, in S. cerevisiae, mutations of the ATP synthase destabilize the mtDNA in the form of ρ–/ρ° petites issued from large deletions in the mtDNA (36Contamine V. Picard M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 281-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It was thus important to determine whether the atp6-L183R mutation compromised the stability of the mtDNA. To this end, we scored the number of ρ–/ρ° cells produced by MR14 grown by fermentation with, as carbon source, either galactose, which does not elicit catabolite repression, or glucose. When grown on galactose, MR14 cultures contained only 5–10% of petites versus 2% for the corresponding wild type strain MR6, whereas <5 and <1% of petites accumulated in MR14 and MR6, respectively, when glucose was the carbon source. The poor growth of MR14 on non-fermentable substrates was thus not due to a defect in mtDNA maintenance. Influence of the atp6-L183R Mutation on the Yeast Mitochondrial Energy Transducing System—In the following sections we describe a number of experiments aiming to determine how the atp6-L183R mutation impacts the ATP synthase and respiration. All were performed using MR14 cells grown on galactose, i.e. in non-repressing conditions for a good mitochondrial expression, and at 28 °C, the optimal temperature for oxidative phosphorylation in yeast. The atp6-L183R Mutation Results in a Strong Lowering in Oxygen Consumption Due to a Poor Accumulation of Complex IV—Mitochondria isolated from MR14 exhibited a low respiratory activity. With NADH as an electron donor, the basal oxygen consumption rate (state 4) was 3 times lower compared with wild type (Table 2). In the presence of an excess of ADP (state 3), conditions in which the respiration rate normally increases to compensate for the use of the mitochondrial potential (ΔΨ) by the ATP synthase, to phosphorylate the added ADP, the oxygen consumption rate in MR14 was only very weakly stimulated, i.e. 1.1-fold versus 1.8 for the wild type. In the presence of the membrane potential uncoupler CCCP, where it is maximal, the oxygen consumption rate was still very low in MR14, indicating a strong decrease in respiratory enzyme content. However, the uncoupled respiration in MR14 was higher compared with state 3 by a factor of about 2, as in wild type mitochondria, which indicated that the atp6-L183R mutation did not increase the inner mitochondrial membrane passive permeability to protons.TABLE 2Influence of atp6-L183R mutation on yeast mitochondrial respiratory, ATP hydrolytic, and ATP synthesis activitiesStrainRespiration ratesATPase activityATP synthesis rateNADHNADH + ADPNADH + CCCPAsc/TMPD + CCCP-Oligo+Oligo-Oligo+Oligonmol O min−1 mg−1nmol Pi min−1 mg−1nmol Pi min−1 mg−1MR6364 ± 35647 ± 301231 ± 1451911 ± 2462439 ± 247375 ± 48911 ± 106174 ± 45MR14132 ± 15139 ± 13281 ± 24430 ± 182047 ± 92482 ± 9159 ± 6<5 Open table in a new tab Using ascorbate/TMPD, an electron donor that directly reduces the terminal respiratory complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and in the presence of CCCP, MR14 still exhibited a strong respiratory deficit of 78% (Table 2). The drop in complex IV activity correlated with a decrease in the content of spectrally detectable cytochromes aa3, whereas cytochromes cc1 and b were in normal amounts in MR14 (Table 3), which indicated that the respiratory defect was due to a low content in complex IV. This was confirmed by SDS- and BN-PAGE analyses of mitochondrial proteins. In SDS-PAGE, the complex III cytochrome b and c1 subunits were in almost normal amounts in MR14, whereas the cytochrome c oxidase Cox2p subunit was much less abundant, only 33% compared with the wild type (Fig. 4C). BN-PAGE was performed in conditions where respiratory complexes III and IV are normally resolved as two distinct “supercomplexes” (III2IV2 and III2IV1) and free complex III homodimers (III2) (43Bach S. Talarek N. Andrieu T. Vierfond J.M. Mettey Y. Galons H. Dormont D. Meijer L. Cullin C. Blondel M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These different complexes were revealed after transfer on membranes blotted with antibodies against Cox2p or cytochrome b. The shown blots (Fig. 4B) support the existence of a selective and substantial decrease in complex IV content in the mutant strain MR14. Of the two supercomplexes, only III2IV2 was significantly reduced. Consistent with a specific lack in complex IV, a larger amount of complex III homodimers was detected in the mutant than in the wild type (Fig. 4B). Although a precise quantification of the protein complexes in BN-PAGE is rather difficult, the shown data are perfectly consistent with a specific lack in complex IV in MR14 of about 70% as estimated from the respiration assays, spectral, and SDS-PAGE analyses.TABLE 3Mitochondrial cytochromes contentsStrainc + c1baa3MR6572 ± 47349 ± 20135 ± 14MR14722 ± 34329 ± 1039 ± 16 Open table in a new tab Noteworthy, the relative intensities of the immunological signals corresponding to the III2IV2 and III2IV1 complexes were very different depending on the antibodies used for their detection. In the wild type MR6 lane, with antibodies against Cox2p, the III2IV2 complex gave a much stronger signal than the III2IV1 complex, whereas the latter was much better detected than the former with antibodies against cytochrome b. This is certainly due to a better accessibility for the anti-cytochrome b antibodies when the complex III dimer is associated to only one complex IV. Prior work has shown that the entire deletion of the ATP6 gene also results in an important and selective decrease in complex IV content (of about 95%) (27Rak M. Tetaud E. Godard F. Sagot I. Salin B.

The low level of complex IV in Δatp6 yeast was attributed to a specific decrease (>90%) in the synthesis rate of the mitochondrially encoded Cox1p subunit of this complex (27Rak M. Tetaud E.

Gastrin is the only hormone capable of stimulating gastric acid and is thus required to maintain functional parietal cells. We have shown previously that gastrin-null mice display gastric atrophy and metaplasia prior to progression to distal, intestinal-type gastric cancer. Because reduced levels of Shh peptide correlate with gastric atrophy, we examined whether gastrin regulates Shh expression in parietal cells. We show here that gastrin stimulates Shh gene expression and acid-dependent processing of the 45-kDa Shh precursor to the 19-kDa secreted peptide in primary parietal cell cultures. This cleavage was blocked by the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and mediated by the acid-activated protease pepsin A. Pepsin A was also the protease responsible for processing Shh in tissue extracts from human stomach. By contrast, extracts prepared from neoplastic gastric mucosa had reduced levels of pepsin A and did not process Shh. Therefore processing of Shh in the normal stomach is hormonally regulated, acid-dependent, and mediated by the aspartic protease pepsin A. Moreover parietal cell atrophy, a known pre-neoplastic lesion, correlates with loss of Shh processing.

In human subjects, the presence of an atrophic stomach can be confirmed by documenting a loss of gastric acidity or serologically by measuring the pepsinogen (Pg) A to C ratio (3Nomura A.M.

It has been suggested that the presence of gastric atrophy is a reliable indicator of pre-neoplastic changes in the stomach (2El-Zimaity H.M. Ota H. Graham D.Y. Akamatsu T. Katsuyama T. Cancer. 2002; 94: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Loss of mature parietal cells from the body of the stomach (atrophy) by either genetic or pharmacologic mechanisms results in severe abnormalities in the differentiation and development of gastric cell lineages characteristically demonstrated by the appearance of intestinal or gastric metaplastic cells (7Li Q. Karam S.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3671-3676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8Canfield V. West A.B. Goldenring J.R. Levenson R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Thus, understanding the mucosal signals that promote loss of parietal cells will reveal important targets for therapeutic intervention.Gastrin is the only hormone capable of regulating acid secretion by increasing parietal cell mass and stimulating expression of the acid pump, H+,K+-ATPase (11Walsh J.H. Digestion. 1990; 47: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although parietal cells express H+,K+-ATPase protein, gastrin-deficient mice have severely impaired acid secretion, demonstrating a requirement for gastrin hormone in the functional maturation and maintenance of the parietal cell (12Friis-Hansen L. Sundler F. Li Y. Gillespie P.J. Saunders T.L. Greenson J.K. Owyang C. Rehfeld J.F. Samuelson L.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G561-G568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Koh T.J. Goldenring J.R. Ito S.

Thus, gastrin is required to sustain the differentiated, acid-producing phenotype of the stomach. Recently, we reported that these gastrin-null mice develop bacterial overgrowth by 4 months of age (14Zavros Y. Rieder G. Ferguson A. Samuelson L.C. Merchant J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 119-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and intestinal-type gastric cancer by 12 months (15Zavros Y. Eaton K.A. Kang W. Rathinavelu S. Katukuri V. Kao J.Y. Samuelson L.C. Merchant J.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, gastric atrophy characterized by the drastic reduction in the number of parietal cells preceded the development of the tumors (15Zavros Y. Eaton K.A. Kang W. Rathinavelu S. Katukuri V.

Normally, Shh is expressed in the mature acid-secreting glands of the mammalian stomach, primarily within parietal cells (16Van Den Brink G.R. Hardwick J.C. Tytgat G.N. Brink M.A. Ten Kate F.J.

Pathol. 2005; 206: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that Shh stimulates H+,K+-ATPase gene expression (18Stepan V. Ramamoorthy S. Nitsche H. Zavros Y. Merchant J.L. Todisco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15700-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the gastric mucosa of newborn Shh-deficient mice also exhibit abnormalities in glandular differentiation (21Ramalho-Santos M. Melton D.A. McMahon A.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2763-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kim J.H. Huang Z. Mo R. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Shh levels contribute to the dysfunction or loss of the parietal cell. Thus to determine if Shh levels are modulated by gastrin and contribute to parietal cell function, we examined the expression of Shh in primary cultures of parietal cells.We show here that gastrin stimulates the processing of Shh peptide by increasing parietal cell acid production. The increase in acid facilitates the intramolecular conversion of PgA to the active protease pepsin A. Pepsin A subsequently cleaves Shh to the active 19-kDa form (ShhN). Thus, Shh processing in the parietal cell depends upon processing by pepsin A. In addition, we show that the processing of Shh by pepsin A also occurs in the normal human stomach and is severely restricted in the atrophic neoplastic stomach. Therefore, a consequence of hypochlorhydria is the absence of activated pepsin available to process Shh to its biologically active form in the parietal cell.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Gastrin-deficient (G–/–) and strain-matched (C57BL/6×129/Sv) wild-type control mice (WT) were bred by homozygous mating. WT (n = 8) and G–/– (n = 8) mice were maintained in individual, sterile microisolator cages in non-barrier mouse rooms (conventional housing) for 4 months. All mice were fasted overnight with access to water ad libitum before analysis. The study was performed with the approval of the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use Committee that maintains an American Association of Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) facility.Gastrin Infusions—Both amidated (G-17) and non-amidated (G-17gly) forms of gastrin are secretagogues of acid secretion (23Wang T.C.

Thus, the infusion of G-17 and G-17gly (GAST infusion) into 8-week-old G–/– mice was performed using a microosmotic pump (Alzet, model 1002) inserted into the peritoneum, delivering 5 μg/kg/h of a mixture of rat gastrin (G-17) (Bachem) plus gastrin-17gly (G-17gly) (from Dr. Chris Dickinson, University of Michigan). Mice were continuously infused for 14 days prior to sacrifice and collection of plasma for radioimmunoassay. Protein was extracted from gastric mucosal scrapings by homogenizing the tissue in lysis buffer (300 mmol/liter NaCl, 30 mmol/liter Tris, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2mmol/liter CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitor tablets (without pepstatin, Roche Applied Science) then analyzed for Shh and Ptch expression by immunoblot. Total RNA was isolated from gastric mucosal scrapings using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturerŉs protocol (Invitrogen) and analyzed for Shh and Ptch mRNA abundance by RT-PCR.Gastrin Radioimmunoassay—After euthanization, ∼1 ml of blood was collected by cardiac puncture, aliquoted into lithium-heparin tubes (Sarstedt, Germany) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The plasma was collected immediately and stored at –20 °C until assayed for gastrin by radioimmunoassay as previously described (14Zavros Y. Rieder G. Ferguson A. Samuelson L.C. Merchant J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 119-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera number 1296 was from the Center for Ulcer Research and Education Digestive Disease Research Center (University of California, Los Angeles).Gastric Acidity—After an overnight fast, the stomach was opened along the greater curvature and washed with 2 ml of normal saline (pH 7.0). Gastric debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant collected. The acid concentration of the supernatant was determined by titration using 0.005 n NaOH. The gastric acidity was expressed as μEq (14Zavros Y. Rieder G. Ferguson A. Samuelson L.C. Merchant J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 119-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from gastric mucosal scrapings using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturerŉs protocol (Invitrogen). Using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad), cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA. RT-PCR was then performed based on previously published primer sequences and conditions (26Madison B.B. Braunstein K. Kuizon E. Portman K. Qiao X.T. Gumucio D.L. Development. 2005; 132: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).Primary Parietal Cell Preparation and Culture—Primary cells were isolated from the gastric mucosa of four wild type C57BL/6 and gastrin-deficient (G–/–) mouse stomachs according to a previously modified method using dispase (14Zavros Y. Rieder G. Ferguson A. Samuelson L.C. Merchant J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 119-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Gastric cells (2 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin on 35-mm round culture dishes coated with 150 μl of growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in a total media volume of 5 ml. The cells were treated with either phosphate-buffered saline or G-17 and G-17gly (GAST, 10 nm) for 6 h. The media was then collected to size fractionate the secreted forms of Shh by gel filtration chromatography. Whole cell extracts were prepared from the entire 5-ml plate of cells using M-Per extraction lysis buffer (Pierce) then analyzed by immunoblot.Canine parietal cells were isolated based on a modified elutriation method by Soll et al. (27Soll A. J. Clin. Investig. 1978; 61: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The isolated parietal cells (2 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in Hamŉs F-12/Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (1:1) containing 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 0.01 mg/ml ciprofloxacin, and 2% Me2SO (Sigma) on 35-mm round culture dishes coated with 150 μl of growth factor reduced Matrigel in 5 ml of media (18Stepan V.

After an overnight culture and removal of non-adherent cells, the remaining adherent cells were 95 to 98% homogenous for parietal cells (28Soll A.H. Amirian D.A. Park J. Elashoff J.D. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G569-G573PubMed Google Scholar). Omeprazole was dissolved in Me2SO/PEG (4.5/0.5 v/v). Parietal cells were treated with either vehicle (Veh, Me2SO/PEG), the G-17 and G-17gly mix (GAST, 10 nm), omeprazole alone (OM, 100 nm), histamine alone (HIST, 10–4m), isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (10–5m), HIST plus IBMX, HIST plus OM, HIST plus OM and IBMX. The medium was collected to size fractionate secreted Shh by gel filtration chromatography as described below, and the corresponding adherent cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma) to analyze Shh in the whole cell extracts by immunoblot.Gel Filtration Chromatography—Shh in the culture media of primary cells was detected using previously published methods (18Stepan V. Ramamoorthy S. Nitsche H. Zavros Y. Merchant J.L. Todisco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15700-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Briefly, the entire 5 ml of media from each plate was concentrated to 0.5 ml using a Centricon YM-10 spin column (Millipore, Bedford, MA) then loaded onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with 0.01% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline. The molecular mass standards used to calibrate the column were albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Twenty 0.5-ml fractions were collected after the void volume. The three 0.5-ml fractions corresponding to the 19-kDa molecular weight marker were combined, concentrated to 50 μl using the Centricon YM-10 columns, then 20 μl was mixed with sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis.Shh Expression Vectors—Wild-type mouse Shh expressed in pBluescript II SK(–) (a gift from Dr. Philip Beachy, Johns Hopkins University) was subcloned into pcDNA (Invitrogen) for transfection into AGS cells, a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. After the FuGENE transfection, cells were allowed to settle for 16 h. Subsequent to replenishing the media, the cells were allowed to incubate for 48 h prior to collect the media for analysis. Two copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (TACCCTTACGACGTTCCTGATTACGCT TACCCTTACGACGTTCCTGATTACGCT) were inserted after residue 32 by PCR. Mutation of residue 200 from F to H and residue 271 from H to A was performed using the QuikChange kit (Invitrogen) and the following primers, respectively: GCCAAATCCGGCGGCTGTTTCCCGGGTCCGCCACCGTG, WT; GCCAAATCCGGCGGCTGTCACCCGGGATCCGCCACCGTG, F200H Sense; TGCTCACCGCCGCGCACCTGCTCTTCGTGGC, WT; TGCTCACCGCCGCGGCCCTGCTCTTCGTGGC, H271A Sense. All mutations and modifications of the Shh expression vector were confirmed by sequencing. HA-tagged ShhN was detected on immunoblots using anti-HA-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HA-Probe (Y-11) horseradish peroxidase cat. SC-805HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Aminopyrine Uptake—Gastric acid secretion was measured according to published methods (18Stepan V. Ramamoorthy S. Nitsche H. Zavros Y. Merchant J.L. Todisco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15700-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Kaise M. Muraoka A. Yamada J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18637-18642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, accumulation of the weak base [14C]aminopyrine (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect acid production by the canine parietal cells. Cultured parietal cells were washed once with Earleŉs balanced salt solution and incubated with 0.1 μCi of [14C]aminopyrine. The cells were then treated with either (Veh, Me2SO/PEG), G-17 and G-17gly (GAST, 10 nm), omeprazole alone (OM, 100 nm) or OM plus GAST for 30 min. Parietal cells were then lysed with 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity in the lysate was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter.Mouse Shh ELISA—Shh was measured using 100 μl of cell culture media collected from WT or G–/– mouse cell cultures treated with either vehicle (Veh) or gastrin (GAST). A mouse-specific Shh ELISA kit (R&D Systems) was used according to the manufacturerŉs protocol.Luciferase Assay—AGS cells were transfected with a hedgehog responsive reporter construct in which 8 Gli binding sites were subcloned upstream of a luciferase reporter construct in a Bluescript vector (8 × 3′Gli-BS-Luc construct, kindly provided by Dr. Hiroshi Sasaki) (31Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells in Hamŉs F-12 nutrient mixture containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin without serum were incubated for 48 h with 20 ng/well of Shh prepared from pooled fractions 14, 15, and 16 (∼19 kDa molecular mass). Fraction number 17 eluted from the gel filtration column and 500 ng/well of recombinant human Shh (R&D Systems, 1314-SH) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Luciferase assays were performed on a Wallac, Victor3 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and normalized for total protein using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce).In Vitro Transcription/Translation of Shh Protein—Mouse Shh cDNA expressed in pBluescript II SK(–) was in vitro-translated to the full-length Shh protein using the T3 TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). A mutation was introduced into the mouse Shh cDNA using the QuikChange kit at residue 200 (F200H) as described above. In vitro translated protein was then incubated with whole cell extract (10 μg) collected from canine parietal cells treated with vehicle, gastrin, omeprazole, or omeprazole plus gastrin for 4 h at pH 2–3 at 37 °C. Whole cell extracts were immunodepleted of Shh, PgA, or PgC by incubating 50 μg of protein with a 1:200 dilution of the goat polyclonal anti-Shh (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1194), 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-PgA or PgC (Acris, Germany) at 4 °C overnight with rocking. After the overnight incubation, immuno-complexes were separated by incubating the mixture with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4°C. Extracts plus beads were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant (unbound fraction) was collected and analyzed by immunoblot. The remaining unbound fraction was added to the in vitro translated Shh protein, incubated for 4 h at pH 2–3 at 37°C. The beads (bound fraction) were added to the Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad), boiled, and analyzed by immunoblot. In a separate experiment, in vitro translated Shh protein was incubated with pepsin A (Sigma) at pH 2 for 0, 20, 40, and 60 min.Human Tissue Extracts—Three sets of normal corpus and intestinal-type tumor tissue extracts were purchased from BioChain Institute (Hayward, CA). The tumor tissues supplied were collected from patients with intestinal type gastric cancer. According to the manufacturer, protein was isolated from whole tissue homogenates using a proprietary lysis buffer, which contained HEPES (pH 7.9), MgCl2, KCl, EDTA, sucrose, glycerol, sodium deoxycholate, and Nonidet P-40.Immunoblot Analysis—Protein (75 μg of tissue homogenate) was loaded per lane on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gel for immunoblot analysis. The membranes (Hybond-C Extra Nitrocellulose, Amersham Biosciences) were blocked with Detector Block (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, 71-83-00) for 1 h at room temperature followed by an overnight incubation with a 1:200 dilution of the goat polyclonal anti-Shh (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1194), 1:200 rabbit anti-Ptch (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9016), 1:200 rabbit anti-PgA or PgC (Acris, Germany), 1:100 anti-HA-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 1:500 GAPDH (Molecular Probes) antibody. The membranes were washed three times for 5 min and incubated for an additional 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-goat, -rabbit, or -mouse antibodies. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Lumilight substrate, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany).Protease Activity—The protease fluorescent detection kit (Sigma, PF0100) was used to measure the pepsin A concentration within extracts collected from canine parietal cells treated with vehicle, gastrin, omeprazole, or omeprazole plus gastrin according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Briefly, the pepsin A standard curve was generated using known concentrations of the protease between 0.5 and 20 ng and FITC-tagged casein as the substrate. The pepsin A concentration was then measured in 10 μl of parietal cells extracts. The fluorescence intensity was detected at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm using a Wallac, Victor3 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Statistical Analysis—The significance of the results were tested using the unpaired t test for the in vivo mouse studies or one-way ANOVA for cell culture experiments using a commercially available software (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A p value <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSGastrin Regulates Shh Expression in Vivo—Gastric atrophy is a pre-neoplastic lesion that is intimately linked to the presence of the parietal cell and its ability to produce acid. We have shown previously that Shh stimulates H+,K+-ATPase gene expression and in this way is able to regulate the content of this parietal cell-specific enzyme (18Stepan V. Ramamoorthy S. Nitsche H. Zavros Y. Merchant J.L. Todisco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15700-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, Shh transcription is induced under low pH conditions, although the mechanism of the regulation is not understood (32Dimmler A. Brabletz T. Hlubek F. Hafner M. Rau T. Kirchner T. Faller G. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because gastrin-deficient (G–/–) mice are hypochlorhydric from birth (12Friis-Hansen L. Sundler F. Li Y.

Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 119-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and develop parietal cell atrophy and distal cancer within 12 months of age (15Zavros Y. Eaton K.A. Kang W. Rathinavelu S. Katukuri V. Kao J.Y. Samuelson L.C. Merchant J.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we used this mouse model to evaluate the effect of low gastric acidity on Shh expression. At 4 months of age when the mice are hypochlorhydric, but have not yet developed parietal cell atrophy, both the 45-kDa nascent Shh protein and the 19-kDa processed form were detected in tissue homogenates from WT mice (Fig. 1, A and B). However, there was a significant decrease in the level of Shh peptides in the (G–/–) mice suggesting that gastrin-regulated Shh expression. To test this hypothesis, we infused gastrin into G–/– mice for 2 weeks (G–/–Gast) and restored gastric acid secretion (Table 1). Gastrin infusion also induced re-expression of Shh (Fig. 1, A and B) that was accompanied by parallel changes in the Shh receptor Patched (Ptch), a known transcriptional target of hedgehog signaling (Fig. 1, A and C). The dramatic loss of Shh peptide suggested that there might be a decrease in Shh mRNA in the gastrin-deficient mice. Indeed, qRT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from the WT, G–/–, and G–/–Gast demonstrated essentially the same changes observed at the protein level (Fig. 1, D and E). These results showed that gastrin induces Shh expression and correlates with restoration of acid secretion in vivo.TABLE 1Plasma gastrin and gastric acid levels in WT, G-/-, and G-/-Gast miceGroupPlasma gastrinGastric aciditypmol/literμEqWT31 ± 66 ± 1G-/-NDaND, not detected.1 ± 0.5bp < 0.05 versus WT.G-/-Gast562 ± 57bp < 0.05 versus WT.,cp < 0.05 versus G-/-.8 ± 0.6bp < 0.05 versus WT.,cp < 0.05 versus G-/-.a ND, not detected.b p < 0.05 versus WT.c p < 0.05 versus G-/-.

Primary gastric cells dissociated from the stomachs of WT or G–/– mice, were treated with gastrin for 6 h prior to generating WCE for immunoblot analysis. We found that the 45-kDa peptide was induced in both the WT and G–/– mouse primary cultures. However, the 19-kDa processed form of Shh (ShhN) was not readily detected in the extracts despite induction of the Ptch protein, the transcriptional target and receptor for Shh (Fig. 2A). Because prior studies have indicated that Shh is autocatalytically processed and the biologically active form secreted from the cell, we coll"

In an attempt to explore the molecular mechanisms of these associations, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a cardiac cDNA library. We showed that the desmin amino-terminal domain (N-(1-103)) binds to a 413-kDa TRIM-like protein, myospryn, originally identified as the muscle-specific partner of dysbindin, a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Binding of desmin with myospryn was confirmed with glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Western blot analysis revealed that the complex immunoprecipitated by desmin antibodies, in addition to myospryn, contained the BLOC-1 components dysbindin and pallidin. Deletion analysis revealed that only the (N-(1-103)) fragment of desmin binds to myospryn carboxyl terminus and that this association takes place through the 24-amino acid-long carboxyl-terminal end of the SPRY domain of myospryn. Using an antibody against the COOH terminus of myospryn, we demonstrated that myospryn colocalizes with desmin at the periphery of the nucleus, in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum, of mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes. In adult heart muscle, the two proteins colocalize, predominantly at intercalated disks and costameres. We also showed that myospryn colocalizes with lysosomes. Using desmin null hearts, we determined that desmin is required for both the proper perinuclear localization of myospryn, as well as the proper positioning of lysosomes, thus suggesting a potential role of desmin intermediate filaments in lysosomes and lysosome-related organelle biogenesis and/or positioning.

The intermediate filaments (IFs) 2The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; DTT, dithiothreitol; DOC, deoxycholate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid; PKA, protein kinase A. form one of the three cytoskeletal networks found in higher eukaryotes. They display a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated pattern of expression. IFs were initially characterized as “integrators of cellular space” (1Lazarides E. Nature. 1980; 283: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), because of their relative stable organization. Desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament protein family, is one of the earliest known myogenic markers, both in heart and in somites (2Kaufman S.J. Foster R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Herrmann H. Fouquet B. Franke W.W. Development (Camb.). 1989; 105: 279-298PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kuisk I.R. Li H.

In mature striated muscle, desmin IFs form a three-dimensional scaffold that seems to extend across the entire diameter of the myofibril. Desmin IFs surround the Z disks, extend from one Z disk to the other, and potentially associate with different cellular organelles. Finally, desmin IFs extend from the Z disk to the plasma membrane at the level of costameres and intercalated disks in the case of cardiac muscle, and project from the Z disks of the perinuclear myofibrils to the nuclear membrane. The molecular mechanism responsible for the majority of these associations remains unknown. (For review see Ref. 8Capetanaki Y. Bloch R.J. Kouloumenta A. Mavroidis M. Psarras S. Exp.

Brain. 2004; 127: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this protein is crucial for the maintenance of healthy muscle. Defects because of the lack of desmin are more severe in the heart, where transient cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and chamber dilation characterized by extensive myocyte death lead to heart failure (9Li Z.

Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2063-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the earliest observed defects were found in mitochondrial positioning, structure, and function (13Milner D.J. Mavroidis M. Weisleder N. Capetanaki Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Capetanaki Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that these might be the target organelles in desmin null pathogenesis. Accordingly, analysis of the mitochondrial proteome from wild type and desmin null heart demonstrates several changes in proteins involved in energy metabolism and apoptosis (15Fountoulakis M. Soumaka E. Rapti K. Mavroidis M. Tsangaris G. Maris A. Weisleder N. Capetanaki Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 461-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These data, so far, strongly suggest potential defects either in proper protein targeting to mitochondria and other cellular organelles, without excluding destabilization of specific regions or complexes on them. Amelioration of mitochondrial abnormalities by overexpressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, located at the mitochondrial contact sites and known to regulate the voltage-dependent anion channel function, supports the above hypothesis (16Weisleder N. Taffet G.E. Capetanaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, new evidence from studies in other cell types also support the involvement of IFs in similar functions, including organelle positioning and protein targeting to the proper intracellular compartments (17Styers M.L. Kowalczyk A.P. Faundez V. Traffic. 2005; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Toivola D.M. Tao G.Z. Habtezion A. Liao J. Omary M.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 608-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify new desmin-associated proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a cardiac cDNA library. Here, we describe a novel association of desmin with myospryn, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) superfamily of proteins, initially identified as a dysbindin-associated protein (19Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10450-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and as a Mef-2 target gene (20Durham J.T. Brand O.M. Arnold M. Reynolds J.G. Muthukumar L. Weiler H. Richardson J.A. Naya F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6841-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Dysbindin is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), which is involved in protein trafficking and organelle biogenesis. We provide evidence that the interaction between desmin and myospryn is important for the proper perinuclear localization of the latter and that it potentially facilitates lysosome biogenesis and/or positioning. The procedures for the care and treatment of animals were according to institutional guidelines, which follow the guidelines of Association for the Assessment ad Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and the recommendations of Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Association (FELASA). Mice lacking desmin were generated as described previously (10Milner D.J. Weitzer G. Tran D. Bradley A. Capetanaki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1255-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and were of the 129SV genetic background. Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screening—The Matchmaker GAL-4 two-hybrid system was used as described by the manufacturer (Clontech). A cDNA fragment encoding the NH2 terminus of mouse desmin (nucleotides 80-410 bp) was inserted downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pGBKT7 bait vector. A yeast two-hybrid cDNA library (Clontech, catalog number 638865) derived from human heart muscle was screened for interacting proteins as described by the distributor. For interaction, positive clones were selected in selection medium (SD/-Trp/-Leu,/-Ade/-His + X-α-galactosidase plates). Generation and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—The myospryn fragment was inserted into pGEX-5x-1 at EcoRI/XhoI sites (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST fusion protein. The recombinant polypeptides were expressed into BL21 bacteria by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The bacteria were harvested by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer 1: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340) plus 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 20 min. The inclusion bodies which contained the GST-myospryn fusion proteins were dissolved in lysis buffer 2 containing 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol and dialyzed against buffer 3: 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% v/v) glycerol. Preparation of Desmin-enriched Cardiac Extract—Cardiac tissue was homogenized in PBS, 0.6 m KCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in gel filtration buffer (PBS, 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT with protease inhibitors) and was further purified with gel filtration column chromatography using the Shodex KW-804 column (Thomson Instruments, Clear Brook, VA) connected to AKTA-P900 purifier (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions enriched in desmin were chosen by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (data not shown). Preparation of Heart Homogenates—Cardiac tissue from wild type and desmin null mice was homogenized in extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.01% (v/v) SDS, 20 mm NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.01% (v/v) DOC, 5 mm EDTA, 2mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g, and the supernatant was used. GST Pulldown Assay—Equal amounts of recombinant GST and GST-myospryn, or GST-desmin were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and mixed with either 0.1 mg of desmin-enriched cardiac extract or 1.5 mg of total heart homogenates at room temperature for 2 h. Bound proteins after washing in the cold washing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.01% (v/v) DOC, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% (v/v) SDS) were eluted by heating for 5 min at 90 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm DTT, 2% (v/v) SDS, 0.2% (v/v) bromphenol blue, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The soluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies to desmin and myospryn, respectively. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Co-IP—Proteins encoded by the various constructs, hemagglutinin (HA), HA-myospryn in pGADT7 and c-Myc, c-Myc-full-length desmin in pGBKT7, were synthesized and labeled with [35S]methionine using the TnT QuickCoupled transcription/translation system (catalog number L4610, Promega, Madison, WI). 30 μl from each protein lysate was mixed and incubated for 2 h to allow the complexes to be formed. 5 μl of chimeric protein A/G (Pierce, catalog number 53132) with 10 μl of antibody anti-HA or anti-c-Myc (Clontech) were used for each reaction to capture the protein complexes. The mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 1 min, and the pellet was washed four times with 1× PBS, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (v/v) DOC and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were heated at 90 °C for 5-10 min, separated by electrophoresis on 10-15% gradient acrylamide gel, and proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Coimmunoprecipitations Experiments with Cardiac Extract—Heart muscle was dissected from a normal adult 129SV mouse, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in 500 μl of solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.05% (v/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 45 min. The following procedures were performed at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. 1.5 mg of soluble protein in a volume of 0.5 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) DOC, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) was pre-cleared with 50 μl of chimeric protein A/G (Pierce, catalog number 53132) for 3 h. Anti-desmin antibodies (15 μl of D3 from Hybridoma Bank plus 15 μl of H-76 (in case of dysbindin and pallidin experiment) or D3 plus Y-20 (in case of myospryn experiment) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were applied on 50 μl of protein A/G for 3 h. The pre-cleared cardiac extract was combined with protein A/G carrying the desmin antibodies for 16-18 h. The beads were washed five times with washing buffer by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 min, eluted in 60 μl of elution buffer (75 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3.8% (v/v) SDS, 4 m urea, 5% mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and analyzed by Western blotting for the detection of dysbindin (1:200, Novus, CO, catalog number NB100-40808), pallidin (1:200, Novus, catalog number NB100-1234), and myospryn (1:1000, rabbit anti-peptide antibody). A sample lacking primary antibody acted as negative control. Primary Culture of Cardiomyocytes from Neonatal Mice—Hearts were harvested from 3-day old neonatal mice, and after removal of the atria, the ventricles were subjected to trypsin (Invitrogen, catalog number 840-7250IL) digestion, in a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, for 16-18 h at 4 °C. Digestion with 150 units collagenase (Invitrogen, catalog number 17101015) was followed and the mixture of cells was plated on collagen-coated Petri dishes in a concentration of 100,000 cells/cm2. For LysoTracker-positive organelles visualization, cells were incubated with LysoTracker dye (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) at a final concentration of 100 nm for 30 min. After extensive washes, cells were visualized with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (see under “Immunofluorescence Labeling of Cardiomyocytes from Neonatal Mice and Cryosections from Adult Heart and Skeletal Muscle”). Anti-myospryn Antibody Production—A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic 15-aa peptide (EGVH-PAFALEKPGKC) near the COOH terminus of myospryn, coupled to preactivated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (antiserum was generated by Sigma Genosys). Its specificity was confirmed using the 15-peptide as competitor in Western blots and in immunocytochemistry studies (see supplemental data; Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence Labeling of Cardiomyocytes from Neonatal Mice and Cryosections from Adult Heart and Skeletal Muscle—Cells were fixed in cold acetone (100%) for 3 min in -20 °C and then were permeabilized with 0.02% (v/v) saponin and were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For cryosections, methanol:ethanol (70: 30%) was used for 20 min at -20 °C, and the fixed sections were subjected in two 20-min washes, one with 0.1% (v/v) saponin and the second with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Primary antibodies including anti-myospryn (1:400, rabbit polyclonal), anti-desmin (1:20, mouse monoclonal, D3, Hybridoma Bank), anti-α-actinin (1:1000 mouse monoclonal; Sigma, clone EA-53 catalog number A7811), anti-cathepsin D (1:50 goat polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6487), anti-KDEL (1:100, mouse monoclonal; StressGen Bioreagents, catalog number SPA-827), TGN38 (1:100, mouse monoclonal; BD Biosciences, catalog number 610898), and anti-PKA RII subunit (1:50, goat polyclonal; Upstate, catalog number 06-411) were incubated with the cells for 3 h at room temperature. Samples were stained with Alexa Fluor 488, 594, or 568 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells as well as sections were extensively washed with PBS/Tween 20 (0.01%), mounted with fluorescent mounting medium from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA), and analyzed with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP5, DMI6000, inverted, with the acquisition software LAS-AF, at 23-24 °C) equipped with ×63 NA 1.4 objective. The Amino-terminal Domain of Desmin Binds to the SPRY Domain of Myospryn—In an effort to explore the role of the terminal domains of the desmin molecule and to identify potential binding partners of desmin in heart, we used the amino-terminal domain, aa 1-103, as a “bait” to screen a cDNA library from human cardiac muscle. Approximately 1 × 106 transformants were screened, of which 170 “prey” clones met the stringent criteria for positive interactions. From the sequencing analysis of these clones we identified myospryn (GenBank™ accession number NM_153610; fragment 12,078-12,884 bp) as a potential binding partner of desmin. Confirmation of the desmin-myospryn interaction was achieved by both reciprocal GST pulldown assays and co-IP experiments. Recombinant GST-myospryn and GST-desmin were prepared and used for binding studies to endogenous desmin and myospryn, respectively. Gel filtration chromatography was applied to enrich for desmin the cardiac extracts (data not shown), used in the pulldown assay with GST-myospryn. When the desmin-enriched cellular extract was incubated with GST-myospryn bound to a glutathione matrix, desmin was efficiently and specifically absorbed, as detected by Western blot analysis using anti-desmin antibodies (Fig. 1I, A2, 2nd lane). The inability of GST alone to absorb desmin confirmed this interaction. In the reverse experiment, we produced recombinant GST-desmin, which was incubated with cardiac homogenates from wild type mice. After binding to glutathione matrices, recombinant GST-desmin absorbed myospryn from cardiac muscle preparation, as shown by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-myospryn antibodies (Fig. 1I, B2, 2nd lane). In this experiment, a very small portion of myospryn was absorbed nonspecifically by GST. We also performed in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments with differently tagged proteins, HA-myospryn and c-Myc-desmin. Proteins were expressed and 35S-labeled with the TnT QuickCoupled transcription/translation system. After incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose, each 35S-labeled translated protein was immunoprecipitated with either anti-c-Myc or anti-HA antibody and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1II). Myospryn can be coimmunoprecipitated using anti-c-Myc, the desmin tag antibody. Anti-c-Myc can specifically precipitate desmin, whereas desmin alone cannot be precipitated using anti-HA, the antibody of myospryn tag. These results demonstrated that desmin interacts directly with myospryn. To determine the precise corresponding region of desmin and myospryn molecules, necessary and sufficient for their interaction, we extended the yeast two-hybrid analysis by generating deletions constructs. For desmin, bait constructs encoding aa 1-61, 58-103, 1-33, 107-470, 408-470, and the entire molecule were coexpressed in yeast with the prey vector encoding the myospryn region corresponding to aa 4003-4069 (Fig. 2A). Only when the desmin region aa 58-103 was included in the used bait constructs, colony growth and α-galactosidase gene activation occurred. In addition, we showed that this region by itself was sufficient for myospryn binding. The data demonstrate that the binding to the 4003-4069-aa region of myospryn occurs only with the amino-terminal domain of the desmin molecule, because the bait construct encoding the entire desmin molecule lacking the amino-terminal domain did not allow the growth of yeast. Furthermore, it was shown that the 58-103-aa region of desmin is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the myospryn carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2A). Similarly, we expressed two fragments of the originally isolated myospryn clone in the prey vector and assayed their ability to interact with the amino terminus of desmin (Fig. 2B). From the two fragments, aa 4003-4054 and 4045-4069, only the latter gave a positive response, suggesting that the desmin amino terminus binds to aa 4045-4069 of the myospryn molecule, which corresponds to the last 24 aa of its carboxyl terminus. This region includes a part of the SPRY (SPIa/ryanodine receptor) domain of the myospryn molecule (Fig. 2B), corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the TRIM-like motif as shown in Fig. 2B. These data demonstrate that the 24 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the SPRY domain of myospryn are necessary and sufficient for its association with desmin, but it does not exclude the possibility that another region of myospryn might bind to desmin, as well. Myospryn Colocalizes with Desmin in Vivo—To determine the subcellular colocalization of myospryn with desmin, we generated an antibody against a 15-aa long peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of myospryn. The peptide chosen for this purpose was unique to myospryn, and the specificity of the generated antibodies was confirmed by competition with the peptide in Western blot and immunocytochemistry studies (see supplemental Fig. 1). We initially examined the colocalization of these two proteins in primary cultures of mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, myospryn is found predominantly at the periphery of the nucleus. As expected, in addition to the perinuclear localization, desmin also forms a continuous network throughout the cell (Fig. 3B). As shown in the merged image (Fig. 3C), the two proteins colocalize at the periphery of the nucleus. We also performed immunocytochemistry on longitudinal cryosections of adult mouse hearts where desmin exhibits the known Z-line pattern, in addition to the strong localization at intercalated disks. Myospryn is found predominantly at intercalated disks where it colocalizes with desmin, as the yellow color of the merged image reveals (Fig. 4, A1 and A2). Myospryn is also localized at the Z-line costamere connection level of the sarcolemma (Fig. 4B1), as described previously for skeletal muscle (19Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10450-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Durham J.T. Brand O.M. Arnold M. Reynolds J.G. Muthukumar L. Weiler H. Richardson J.A. Naya F.J. J.

However, myospryn is not easily detected at the internal sarcomere Z-lines, as the double labeling with anti-myospryn and anti-α-actinin reveals (Fig. 4B2). The colocalization of desmin with myospryn at the costamere Z-line level was also confirmed in skeletal muscle (Fig. 5). In longitudinal cryosections of adult mouse skeletal muscle, nuclei were easily detected, and thus it was possible to confirm the intense colocalization of myospryn with desmin at the periphery of the nucleus as well (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4Colocalization of myospryn and desmin in cardiac muscle sections. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy for myospryn and desmin in cardiac muscle cryosections reveal that myospryn colocalizes with desmin predominantly at the intercalated disks (A1 and A2) as well as at the costameres of the sarcolemma (B1), and it is not easily detectable at the internal sarcomeric Z lines (B2). No labeling was observed when nonimmune (myospryn serum) was used (A3).

We examined the localization of myospryn in cardiomyocytes from neonatal wild type and desmin null mice by immunofluorescence staining for myospryn. As shown in Fig. 6, in the absence of desmin (B), myospryn loses its sharp localization pattern around the nucleus and seems to diffuse throughout the cytoplasm, in contrast to wild type cardiomyocytes (A). Similar studies in adult heart cryosections revealed no significant change in the localization of myospryn at the intercalated disks, although these structures seemed to be altered in the absence of desmin (Fig. 6, C and D). In addition, the level of myospryn expression is not significantly altered by the absence of desmin (see supplemental Fig. 2). Myospryn Colocalizes with the Endoplasmic Reticulum—We sought to determine more precisely the perinuclear compartment at which myospryn localizes in primary cardiomyocytes from wild type mice. We used markers for the main parts of the cell sorting machinery and, specifically, KDEL receptor for endoplasmic reticulum and TGN38 for trans-Golgi. Indirect immunofluorescence labeling for myospryn and either KDEL receptor or TGN38 revealed that myospryn resides closer to the endoplasmic reticulum, as revealed by its colocalization with KDEL (Fig. 7). We have also used an antibody against the RII subunit of PKA, which resides in the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum, and we have shown that the two proteins colocalize (see supplemental data Fig. 3). This finding is in agreement with the work of Reynolds et al. (21Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), where it was shown that myospryn is an AKAP protein and that it colocalizes with the RII subunit of PKA. Myospryn Colocalizes with Lysosomal Markers—Myospryn has been found to interact with dysbindin, a component of the BLOC-1 complex. However, its link to lysosomes has not yet been established.

https://openalex.org/W2055422634,"Two isoforms of Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) are expressed in cells, α (p92) and β (p83), both derived from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing. The 55-residue C-terminal transactivation domain of Stat3α is deleted in Stat3β and replaced by seven unique C-terminal residues (CT7) whose function remains uncertain. We subcloned the open reading frames of Stat3α and Stat3β into the C terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Fluorescent microscopic analysis of HEK293T cells transiently transfected with GFP-Stat3α or GFP-Stat3β revealed similar kinetics and cytokine concentration dependence of nuclear accumulation; these findings were confirmed by high throughput microscope analysis of murine embryonic fibroblasts that lacked endogenous Stat3 but stably expressed either GFP-Stat3α or GFP-Stat3β. However, although time to half-maximal cytoplasmic reaccumulation after cytokine withdrawal was 15 min for GFP-Stat3α, it was >180 min for GFP-Stat3β. Furthermore, although the intranuclear mobility of GFP-Stat3α was rapid and increased with cytokine stimulation, the intranuclear mobility of GFP-Stat3β in unstimulated cells was slower than that of GFP-Stat3α in unstimulated cells and was slowed further following cytokine stimulation. Deletion of the unique CT7 domain from Stat3β eliminated prolonged nuclear retention but did not alter its intranuclear mobility. Thus, Stat3α and Stat3β have distinct intracellular dynamics, with Stat3β exhibiting prolonged nuclear retention and reduced intranuclear mobility especially following ligand stimulation.

Blood. 2000; 96: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most isoforms generated by alternative splicing or proteolysis are C-terminal truncation mutants that act as dominant negatives of their full-length counterparts by virtue of missing the C-terminal transactivation domain. In the case of Stat3β, however, the 55-amino acid C-terminal acidic transactivation domain of Stat3α is replaced by seven unique amino acid residues (CT7 domain). Stat3β was isolated initially in the mouse using a yeast two-hybrid strategy with the N terminus of c-Jun as bait (6Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The CT7 domain was presumed responsible for this interaction; however, subsequent studies revealed that residues within the coiled-coil and DNA binding domains of Stat3, common to both isoforms, were found to be responsible for c-Jun interaction, thereby leaving unresolved the functional role of the CT7 domain if any. To gain additional insight into the unique aspects of Stat3β at the single cell level and how the CT7 domain may contribute to them, we subcloned the open reading frames of Stat3α and Stat3β into the C terminus of GFP and transfected them into HEK293T and mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells; endogenous Stat3α and Stat3β were deleted within MEF cells using Cre-lox technology. Cytokine stimulation of the resultant cell lines revealed similar kinetics of nuclear accumulation for GFP-Stat3α and GFP-Stat3β. However, cytoplasmic reaccumulation after ligand removal, although rapid for GFP-Stat3α (t½ = 15 min), was markedly delayed for GFP-Stat3β (t½ > 180 min). Prolonged nuclear retention of Stat3β was accompanied by reduced intranuclear mobility and increased immobile fraction. Interestingly, prolonged nuclear retention but neither reduced intranuclear mobility nor increased immobile fraction mapped to the CT7 domain of Stat3β. Cell Lines and Cytokines—The human embryonic kidney fibroblast cell line HEK293T and the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml). HeLa cells were grown in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) with 4% fetal bovine serum. Stat3Δ/Δ MEFs and Stat3fl/fl MEF kindly provided by Dr. Valeria Poli (University of Turin, Italy) (21Costa-Pereira A.P. Tininini S. Strobl B. Alonzi T. Schlaak J.F. Is'harc H. Gesualdo I. Newman S.J. Kerr I.M. Poli V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8043-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) were cultured in 10% DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Human IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human G-CSF was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmid—GFP-Stat3α and GFP-Stat3β expression vectors were constructed by subcloning the full-length cDNA of human Stat3α and Stat3β in frame 3′ of GFP contained within pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) using the appropriate enzyme digestion fragments. The truncated Stat3β mutant construct (deletion of the C-terminal 7 amino acids; Stat3βΔ) was generated by substituting a stop codon for that encoding the first in the 7-amino acid sequence using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. An acute phase response element (APRE)-luciferase reporter construct, which has four copies of APREs, was kindly provided by Dr. I. Matsumura (Osaka, Japan). The full-length G-CSF receptor cDNA was obtained and used as described previously (22Shao H. Xu X. Jing N. Tweardy D.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—For transient transfections, MEFs were grown in 6-well (35-mm diameter) tissue culture plates to 50–70% confluence. Twelve hours later, the cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors and reporter genes using the GeneJuice transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instruction as previously reported (23Dong S. Tweardy D.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amounts of plasmid DNA used per well were 250 ng of reporter vector, 1 μg of expression vector, and 250 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as transfection control. Luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer (Luminoskan Ascent, Labsystems, Franklin, MA), expressed in arbitrary units, and normalized according to the transcriptional efficiency from β-galactosidase expression. Each point is the mean of at least three independent experiments. Gel Shift Assay—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates using 2 μg of plasmid. Forty-eight hours later, cells were either not treated or treated for 30 min with G-CSF (100 ng/ml). Whole cell extracts were prepared, and gel shift assays were performed as described previously (23Dong S. Tweardy D.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of whole cell extract protein was incubated with [γ-32P]adenosine triphosphate (ATP; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) end-labeled duplex oligonucleotide high affinity serum-inducible element probe at 37 °C for 2 h in the following binding buffer: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin. Protein-DNA complexes were separated on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels equilibrated in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer (TBE). Gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager plates, and images were developed and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Probing of polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with primary antibodies and detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies by enhanced chemiluminescence was as indicated (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used in this study were as follows: Stat3 monoclonal antibody obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and β-actin monoclonal antibody obtained from Abcam Inc. Generation of MEF Cells Stably Expressing GFP-Stat3α or GFP-Stat3β—Stat3Δ/Δ MEFs were transfected with GFP-Stat3α or GFP-Stat3β constructs (3 μg) using DNA carrier GeneJuice reagent as reported previously (23Dong S. Tweardy D.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After transfection overnight, the cells were fed with fresh medium and incubated for 24 h. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were split and cultured in selection medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) at different cell concentrations to promote growth of isolated colonies. After 10 days, 50 isolated colonies of GFP-Stat3α and GFP-Stat3β were harvested using sterile cloning discs (PGC Scientific Corp.) with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen); each colony was replated into a single well of a 24-well plate. After 3 weeks of growth in G418-containing medium, each colony was screened for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy. Several colonies were expanded, analyzed, and sorted for low and uniform levels of GFP expression by the Beckman Altra cell sorter. Sorted cells with levels of GFP-Stat3 isoform expression similar to endogenous levels in Stat3fl/fl MEF cells (Fig. 3) were selected for further analysis. MEF/GFP-Stat3βΔ cells were generated in a similar fashion with the exception that after selection in G418, cells were sorted four times to obtain cells with low and uniform levels of expression that on immunoblot analysis were similar to endogenous Stat3 levels in Stat3fl/fl MEF cells (Fig. 3). High Throughput Microscope Analysis—After plating into coverslip-containing wells and incubation for 24 h, MEF/GFR-Stat3α, -β, and -βΔ cells at 75–85% confluence were incubated without or with IL-6/sIL-6Rα, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PEM Buffer (80 mm potassium PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 4 °C, quenched in 1 mg/ml NaBH4 (Sigma) in PEM buffer, counterstained for 1 min in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) (1 mg/ml in PEM buffer), and mounted in Slow Fade reagent (Molecular Probes). A Beckman/Q3DM IC-100 high throughput microscope (HTM) was used to automate fluorescent image acquisition and analysis of the nuclear translocation, as described (24Marcelli M. Stenoien D.L. Szafran A.T. Simeoni S. Agoulnik I.U. Weigel N.L. Moran T. Mikic I. Price J.H. Mancini M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 770-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The system was used to scan multiple fields and to acquire and analyze each of the cells in the images. Algorithms were generated to determine fractional localized intensity in the nucleus (FLIN) for each set of cell images, as described (25Berno V. Hinojos C.A. Amazit L. Szafran A.T. Mancini M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 414: 188-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nuclear masks were generated by applying a nonlinear least-squares optimized image filter to create marked object-background fluorescence corrected by estimating and subtracting the mean background image intensity. The correlated channel mask was computed as an intersection between the threshold-correlated channel image (the threshold level is dynamically computed using a proprietary background level estimation method) and a circle of user-defined radius from the nuclear centroid. Different gates (area, wiggle, and absolute) were set to measure the majority of cells and to avoid overexpression or lower expression level cells and very large or small cells. The same settings were used for examining FLIN in all experiments. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Prior to live cell imaging, MEF/GFR-Stat3α, -β, and -βΔ cells (2 × 105 cells/dish) were incubated in 23-mm glass bottom Delta T plates (Bioptechs Inc.) until 80–90% confluent. After culturing for 24 h and treatment without and with IL-6 (200 ng/ml) and sIL-6R (250 ng/ml) for 30 min, cells were examined using an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 63× (numerical aperture 1.4) objective. Cells were maintained at 37 °C using a Bioptechs Delta Controller, and fresh medium without or with IL-6 and sIL-6R was cycled over the cells. Five single imaging scans were acquired prior to bleaching. A bleach pulse of 2 s was delivered using a 488-nm laser set for GFP maximum power for 20 iterations (laser output, 75%); immediately after the bleach, the intensity remaining was 40–50% of the original fluorescence. A single z section was imaged before and at time intervals following the bleach. Fluorescence intensity of the region of interest was determined using LSM software. Data were exported to Excel for analysis as previously described (26Dong S. Stenoien D.L. Qiu J. Mancini M.A. Tweardy D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). LSM images were exported as TIF files. All of the quantitative data for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) recovery kinetics represent means ± S.D. from at least 18 cells imaged in two independent experiments. The immobile fraction for each cell analyzed was calculated by subtracting the mean of the last 10 single image scans from the mean of the prebleach single image scans and then dividing this value by the mean of the prebleach single image scans and multiplying by 100. Statistical Analysis—Unless indicated otherwise, data presented are the mean ± S.E.; differences between means were assessed for significance using analysis of variance or Student's t test, where appropriate. The Addition of GFP to the N Terminus of Stat3α or Stat3β Does Not Change Its DNA Binding or Transcriptional Activity—To study the cellular dynamics of Stat3α and Stat3β at the single cell level, the open reading frames for each were inserted into the C terminus of GFP (Fig. 1). Transient transfection of these constructs into HEK293T cells revealed expression of proteins of the anticipated size (Fig. 1) that bound DNA with activity similar to their untagged counterparts upon activation with two cytokine/receptor systems known to activate Stat3, G-CSF/G-CSFR (Fig. 1b) and IL-6/IL-6R (Fig. 1c). As shown previously for their untagged counterparts (27Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GFP-Stat3β displayed a higher level of DNA binding without and with cytokine/receptor addition than GFP-Stat3α. To further characterize the functional properties of GFP-Stat3α and GFP-Stat3β compared with their untagged counterparts, we examined their transcriptional activity by luciferase reporter assay in MEF/Stat3Δ/Δ cells in which the endogenous Stat3 gene had been deleted using Cre-lox technology (21Costa-Pereira A.P. Tininini S. Strobl B. Alonzi T. Schlaak J.F. Is'harc H. Gesualdo I. Newman S.J. Kerr I.M. Poli V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8043-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). MEF/Stat3Δ/Δ cells were co-transfected with G-CSFR, a luciferase reporter construct containing four copies of the APRE from the rat α2-macroglobulin promoter and Stat3α, Stat3β, or both expression plasmids and treated without or with G-CSF. G-CSF-induced activation of the APRE-luciferase reporter was observed in MEF/Stat3Δ/Δ cells co-transfected with Stat3α but not in cells co-transfected with Stat3β (Fig. 2a), similar to results obtained by others using similar reporter constructs in COS-7 cells (8Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B.

Furthermore, Stat3α-mediated activation of this reporter was inhibited by about 65% in cells co-transfected with Stat3β (Fig. 2a), similar to findings using reporter constructs containing the pIRE contained within the ICAM-1 promoter (8Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B.

Experiments using GFP-tagged Stat3 isoforms completely recapitulated these findings (Fig. 2b). Thus, the GFP tag did not alter the DNA binding or transcription activities of Stat3α and Stat3β in MEF cells.

To address this, we transiently co-transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids containing G-CSFR and either GFP-Stat3α or GFP-Stat3β and examined 30–50 cells by fluorescent microscopy before and after incubation with G-CSF (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 ng/ml) for 30 min (Table 1). The percentage of cells transfected with GFP-Stat3α that demonstrated predominantly nuclear localization increased from 4% cells incubated without G-CSF to 90% of cells incubated with G-CSF at 100 ng/ml; similar results were obtained at each corresponding concentrations of G-CSF for cells transfected with GFP-Stat3β. To assess the kinetics of nuclear translocation of GFP-Stat3α versus GFP-Stat3β, HEK293T cells co-transfected with G-CSFR and GFP-Stat3α or GFP-Stat3β were incubated without or with G-CSF (100 ng/ml) for 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 min. The percentage of cells transfected with GFP-Stat3α that demonstrated predominantly nuclear localization increased from 4% of cells at time 0 to 95% of cells at both 30 and 100 min; similar results were obtained at corresponding time points examined for cells transfected with GFP-Stat3β.TABLE 1Dose response and kinetics of nuclear accumulation of Stat3α and Stat3β following transient transfection into HEK293T cellsCell with predominantly nuclear accumulationa30–50 cells examined per condition[G-CSF]bCells incubated for 30 minTimec[G-CSF] = 100 ng/ml0 ng/ml1 ng/ml3 ng/ml10 ng/ml30 ng/ml100 ng/ml0 min1 min3 min10 min30 min100 min%%%%%%%%%%%%GFP-Stat3α488104090455909598GFP-Stat3β10510104090101010879595a 30–50 cells examined per conditionb Cells incubated for 30 minc [G-CSF] = 100 ng/ml Open table in a new tab To confirm and extend these findings in cells that express only GFP-tagged Stat3α or Stat3β at levels similar to endogenous levels, MEF/Stat3Δ/Δ cells were stably transfected with the GFP-Stat3α or GFP-Stat3β plasmid constructs, and surviving colonies were sorted to obtain >90% GFP-positive cells that express GFP-Stat3 at low to moderate levels. Immunoblot analysis of representative colonies established that levels of GFP-Stat3α and GFP-Stat3β protein expression were similar to wild type MEF (MEFfl/fl; Fig. 3). HTM of MEF/GFP-Stat3α and MEF/GFP-Stat3β cells (300–500 cells/condition) (Fig. 3, b–d) revealed similar increases in FLIN levels from 0.31 ± 0.11 for Stat3α and 0.39 ± 0.13 for Stat3β, respectively, in unstimulated cells to 0.7 ± 0.18 for α and 0.79 ± 0.11 for β, respectively, in stimulated cells. The GFP signal was distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in unstimulated MEF/GFP-Stat3α cells and predominantly within the nucleus in a diffuse pattern sparing the nucleolus in stimulated MEF/GFP-Stat3α cells, which was identical to the pattern and distribution of GFP signal in unstimulated and stimulated MEF/GFP-Stat3β cells, respectively. To examine the kinetics of cytoplasmic reaccumulation of Stat3 isoforms, cells were removed from IL-6/sIL-6R and examined by HTM at 30–60-min intervals (Fig. 3). FLIN decreased rapidly in MEF/GFP-Stat3α cells following cytokine/receptor removal, returning to unstimulated levels within 30 min and demonstrated a time to half-maximal cytoplasmic reaccumulation (t½) of 15 min. In contrast, FLIN of MEF/GFP-Stat3β cells decreased only slightly after cytokine/receptor removal and demonstrated a cytoplasmic reaccumulation t½ of >180 min. Examination of the Nuclear Mobility of Stat3α and Stat3β—We have previously demonstrated that aberrant nuclear sequestration of chimeric RARα-containing transcription factors found in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells is associated with their reduced nuclear mobility (26Dong S. Stenoien D.L. Qiu J. Mancini M.A. Tweardy D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine if reduced mobility of Stat3β may contribute to its nuclear retention, we performed FRAP using MEF/GFP-Stat3α and MEF/GFP-Stat3β cells (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Only cells expressing low levels of protein were examined by FRAP to avoid artifacts of overexpression as previously described (31Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L.

https://openalex.org/W2049034034,"Interactions with cellular PDZ domain-containing proteins obviously contribute to the tumorigenic potential of several viral oncoproteins. In this regard, the oncogenic potential of the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein correlates with its binding capacity to the tumor suppressor hDlg. Recent results show that hDlg in T cells is associated to a network of scaffolding proteins including another PDZ domain-containing protein termed hScrib. Interestingly, previous studies have revealed complementary activities of both proteins in the control of epithelial cell polarity. Here, we demonstrate that Tax can bind to hScrib and that the resulting Tax/hScrib complex is present in human T cell leukemia virus type 1-infected T cells. By confocal microscopy, we show that Tax modifies the localization of hScrib in transfected COS cells as well as in infected T cell lines and targets hScrib to particular spots exhibiting a granular distribution, mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Given that Tax sequesters hScrib to these particular structures, we postulate that Tax might inhibit hScrib activity. Providing further support to this idea, we find that transient overexpression of hScrib attenuates T cell receptor-induced NFAT activity but that the presence of Tax counteracts this negative effect on the NFAT pathway. The fact that hDlg and hScrib are both targeted by Tax underlies their importance in T cell function.

Adult T cell leukemia is caused by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HTLV-1, human T cell leukemia virus type 1; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; PDM, PDZ-binding motif; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase; HPV, human papillomavirus; TCR, T cell receptor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; IS, immunological synapse. infection and occurs several decades after initial infection (1Takatsuki K. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The viral protein Tax is considered to play a central role in the proliferation of infected cells and leukemogenesis because of its pleiotropic actions (2Grassmann R. Aboud M. Jeang K.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5976-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). During virus replication, Tax trans-activates viral transcription by interacting with different members of the activating transcription factor/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), including ATF-1, CREB, CREB-2, or cAMP-responsive element modulator and by recruiting the transcriptional cofactors CREB-binding protein, p300, and P/CAF (3Lemasson I.

Progress in Virus Research. 2005; (Thébault, S., ed.) pp. , Nova Science, Hauppauge, NY: 1-38Google Scholar). Tax also controls transcription of cellular genes by positively regulating different transcriptional pathways such as NF-κB, AP-1, and E2F or by negatively modulating others such as p53 and basic helix-loop-helix factors (5Hall W.W. Fujii M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5938-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the oncogenic action of HTLV-1 likely involves deregulation of diverse cellular genes encoding proteins, which induce cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Tax is also able to stimulate cell transformation by direct binding to cell cycle factors and deregulating checkpoints and DNA damage repair pathways (2Grassmann R. Aboud M. Jeang K.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5976-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Mesnard J.M. Devaux C. Virology. 1999; 257: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tax contains a C-terminal PSD-95/SAP90, Discs Large, and Zona Occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif (PBM) (8Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which has been shown to increase HTLV-1-induced proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (9Xie L. Yamamoto B. Haoudi A. Semmes O.J. Green P.L. Blood. 2006; 107: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and Tax-transforming activity in rat fibroblasts (10Hirata A. Higuchi M. Niinuma A. Ohashi M.

Fujii M. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This enhanced transforming activity has been attributed to the interaction between Tax and the human homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor (hDlg) (10Hirata A. Higuchi M. Niinuma A. Ohashi M. Fukushi M. Oie M. Akiyama T. Tanaka Y. Gejyo F. Fujii M. Virology. 2004; 318: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki T. Ohsugi Y. Uchida-Toita M. Akiyama T. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5967-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Dlg belongs to the family of proteins termed membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) (13Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). MAGUKs are characterized by the presence of distinct protein modules including the PDZ domain, SH3 domain, and guanylate kinaselike domain. MAGUKs act as molecular scaffolds (14Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) for cell polarity and signal transduction within epithelial cell junctions and neuronal synapses. Recently, hDlg has also been described to be involved in T cell polarity and immune synapse assembly (15Round J.L. Tomassian T. Zhang M. Patel V. Schoenberger P. Miceli M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Xavier R. Rabizadeh S. Ishiguro K. Andre N. Ortiz J.B. Wachtel H. Morris D.G. Lopez-Ilasaca M. Shaw A.C. Swat W. Seed B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutational studies in Drosophila have led to the classification of Dlg as a tumor suppressor (17Humbert P. Russell S. Richardson H. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Its implication in cancer has been further supported by the demonstration that viral oncoproteins (adenovirus type 9 E4-ORF1, high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6, and Tax) target the cellular protein (18Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). hDlg has been shown to form a complex with APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein (19Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), which negatively regulates cell cycle progression (20Ishidate T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The APC gene is mutated in colon cancers, and the mutated gene product generally lacks the PBM (21Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the PBMs of Tax, HPV E6, and adenovirus type 9 E4-ORF1 interact with the same Dlg PDZ domain targeted by APC, suggesting that they may disrupt the APC-Dlg complex and deregulate cell cycle progression (12Suzuki T. Ohsugi Y. Uchida-Toita M. Akiyama T. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5967-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, the growth suppressing ability of Dlg cannot solely be attributed to its membrane-associated activity, because it has been demonstrated that the high risk HPV E6 protein targets the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools (23McLaughlin M. Hale R. Ellston D. Gaudet S. Lue R.A. Viel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6406-6412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) of hDlg rather than membrane-associated forms (24Massimi P. Gammoh N. Thomas M. Banks L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8033-8039Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mutational studies in Drosophila have shown that Dlg act in concert with two other tumor suppressors, the Scrib (Scribble) and Lgl (lethal giant larvae) proteins, to regulate cell polarity and growth control (25Bilder D. Li M. Perrimon N. Science. 2000; 289: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The three proteins are highly conserved in sequence among species and are likely functionally conserved as well (17Humbert P. Russell S. Richardson H. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Scrib is a member of the LAP (leucinerich and PDZ domain) family of proteins and possesses 16 canonical leucine-rich repeats and four PDZ domains (26Nourry C. Grant S.G. Borg J.P. Sci. STKE. 2003; 179: 1-12Google Scholar). Scrib and Dlg form a scaffolding complex, whose function is required for the maintenance of correct epithelial polarity and efficient signal transmission at synaptic junctions (27Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M. Budnik V. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Reduction in hScrib expression in T cells prevents the polarization of cell surface receptors and morphological changes associated with uropod formation, migration, and antigen presentation (28Ludford-Menting M.J. Oliaro J. Sarcibegovic F. Cheah E.T.Y. Pedersen N. Thomas S.J. Pasam A. Iazzolino R. Dow L.E. Waterhouse N.J. Murphy A. Ellis S. Smyth M.J. Kershaw M.H. Darcy P.K. Humbert P.O. Russell S.M. Immunity. 2005; 22: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hScrib was first isolated in a biochemical screen designed to identify protein targets of HPV-39 E6, and it is now well established that the high risk HPV E6 proteins can target both hScrib and hDlg for proteasome-mediated degradation (29Nakagawa S. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2000: 8244-8253Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Altogether these observations suggest the possible existence of a common mechanism underlying inhibition of two suppressor proteins by human viral oncoproteins. Moreover, by a two-hybrid approach, we have previously isolated different cDNAs encoding cellular proteins able to interact with Tax in yeast (30Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, we characterized clones containing cDNA corresponding to the human myeloblast KIAA0147 gene (GenBank™ accession number D63481) coding for a protein of unknown function at this time (30Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently demonstrated that the KIAA0147 cDNA clone corresponds to an incomplete hScrib sequence (31Dow L.E. Brumby A.M. Muratore R. Coombe M.L. Sedelies K.A. Trapani J.A. Russell S.M. Richardson H.E. Humbert P.O. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9225-9230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting possible interactions of hScrib with Tax. Here we demonstrate that Tax binds to hScrib and that this complex is present in HTLV-1-infected T cells. Furthermore, Tax altered the subcellular localization of hScrib in cotransfected COS cells as well as in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. Moreover, we show that transient overexpression of hScrib attenuates T cell receptor (TCR)-induced activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and that the presence of Tax counteracts this negative effect on the NFAT pathway. Altogether our results demonstrate that Tax targets another PDZ-containing cellular factor, hScrib, known to be associated with hDlg in scaffolding complexes involved in T cell signaling. Plasmids and Antibodies—The pGEX constructs expressing various regions of hScrib fused to the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) have already been described and were obtained from J. M. Huibregtse (29Nakagawa S. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2000: 8244-8253Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar).

The goat (C-20 and K-21) and rabbit anti-hScrib (H-300), goat anti-HP1α (C-15), mouse anti-HA (F-7) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse anti-Myc antibody 9E10 has already been described (37Hivin P. Frédéric M. Arpin-André C. Basbous J. Gay B. Thébault S. Mesnard J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Anti-Tax was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of the Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. HTLV-1 Tax hybridoma 168A51 (Tab176) was from B. Langton. GST Pulldown Assay—pGEX vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to produce GST fusion proteins, which were purified as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Then Tax or Tax2 cDNA cloned into pSG was transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system of Promega and incubated at 4 °C with equal amounts of GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed five times with incubation buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Two-hybrid Assay in Yeast—Study of interactions between Tax and hScrib PDZ domains was carried out by two-hybrid assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 as previously described (34Basbous J. Bazarbachi A. Granier C. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13028-13035Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Strain Y190 possesses the E. coli lacZ gene driven by the GAL4-responsive GAL1 promoter. Protein Procedures—For Western blotting analysis of endogenous hScrib, uninfected or HTLV-1-infected cells (5 × 106) were concentrated by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein extracts were then electrophoresed on SDS-9% polyacrylamide gel and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blot was incubated 1 h at room temperature with a blocking solution (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% milk) prior to the addition of the goat anti-hScrib antibody (C-20). After 1 h, the blot was washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with anti-goat immunoglobulin-peroxydase conjugate. After three washes, the membrane was incubated with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then exposed to hyper-films-ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation of hScrib, uninfected or infected cells (5 × 106) were washed twice with PBS, and protein extracts were prepared as described above. The proteins were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of antibodies from extracts (500 μg of total proteins) as already described (33Audebert S. Navarro C. Nourry C. Chasserot-Golaz S. Lécine P. Bellaiche Y. Dupont J.L. Premont R.T. Sempéré C. Strub J.M. Dorsselaer VanA. Vitale N. Borg J.P. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 987-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Bound fractions were washed three times in lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton and then electrophoresed on SDS, 9% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h before transfection, the cells were seeded onto glass slides. For the transfections, we used the jet-PEI™ transfection reagent (Qbiogene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and, after 48 h, they were washed with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. If necessary, the fixed cells were first incubated with a blocking solution (PBS containing 1% gelatin) and then with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were washed with PBS, 1% gelatin and then incubated with secondary antibody coupled to Texas Red (Pierce), Alexa Fluor 488, or Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield containing 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Abcys) for direct observation. Fluorescence images were acquired by fluorescence microscope (model DM R; Leica), and analysis of the green, red, and yellow fluorescence for colocalization experiments was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. For CEM and HTLV-1-infected T cell lines, the cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 107 cells were electroporated according to the previously published procedure (32Gachon F. Thebault S. Peleraux A. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were pelleted and washed twice in PBS, and one drop of concentrated cells was put down onto glass slides. Then the cells were fixed and permeabilized by treatment with cold methanol-acetone (1:1 v/v) for 5 min and incubated with primary antibody and with secondary antibody coupled to Red, Alexa Fluor 488, or Alexa Fluor 568 as already described. The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield without 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole for observation by confocal microscope. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Jurkat cells (107) were electroporated as described above with the indicated quantities of pHA-hScrib (36Navarro C. Nola S. Audebert S. Santoni M.J. Arsanto J.P. Ginestier C. Marchetto S. Jacquemier J. Isnardon D. Le Bivic A. Birnbaum D. Borg J.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4330-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and 2 μg of NFAT reporter plasmid. 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-lacZ (β-galactosidase-containing reference plasmid) was included in each transfection for controlling of the transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was the same, the balance being made up with empty plasmids. 48 h after transfection, half of the cells were stimulated for 6 h with mouse anti-human CD3 and anti-human CD28 monoclonal antibodies (Immunotech Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France) immobilized on a 6-well plate. The cells were then concentrated by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), incubated in liquid nitrogen until frozen, and thawed at 4 °C. The cell extracts equalized for protein contents were used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays, and the luciferase values were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase assays were performed in an automated luminometer with the Genofax A kit (Yelen, Ensue la Redonne, France). Tax Binds to the hScrib PDZ Domains 2 and 4 (PDZ2 and PDZ4)—In a previous yeast two-hybrid screening (30Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) performed with Tax as a bait, we isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the human myeloblast KIAA0147 gene (Gen-Bank™ accession number D63481) that in fact encoded an incomplete hScrib sequence (31Dow L.E. Brumby A.M. Muratore R. Coombe M.L. Sedelies K.A. Trapani J.A. Russell S.M. Richardson H.E. Humbert P.O. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9225-9230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). hScrib contains a set of leucine-rich repeats near its N terminus and four PDZ domains (Fig. 1) distributed throughout the remainder of the protein (PDZ1 from residues 752 to 811, PDZ2 from residues 874 to 947, PDZ3 from residues 1015 to 1090, and PDZ4 from residues 1114 to 1189). The characterized clones corresponded to two different hScrib cDNAs, both coding for at least two PDZ domains (either PDZ1 + 2, or PDZ3 + 4), as shown in Fig. 1A. To eliminate the possibility that the binding of Tax to hScrib PDZ domains may be indirect and dependent on yeast components, fusion proteins of various regions of hScrib with GST (Fig. 1B) were produced in E. coli, and their binding to 35S-labeled Tax produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was analyzed. Tax bound to the hScrib domains corresponding to PDZ1 + 2 and PDZ3 + 4 (Fig. 2A), as already found by the two-hybrid approach. On the other hand, Tax did not significantly interact with the negative control corresponding to the hScrib C-terminal region fused to GST (Fig. 2A). We also analyzed the interaction between the hScrib PDZ domains and a Tax mutant without its PBM. This mutant was effectively unable to bind to the PDZ domains (data not shown). Moreover, we also found no interaction between the hScrib PDZ domains and the HTLV-2 Tax protein, Tax2 (Fig. 2A), which does not possess a C-terminal PBM (9Xie L. Yamamoto B. Haoudi A. Semmes O.J. Green P.L. Blood. 2006; 107: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our results show that Tax is capable of interacting with hScrib PDZ domains in vitro. To map more precisely the Tax-binding domain of hScrib, each PDZ domain fused to the GAL4 activation domain of the pACT2 plasmid (Fig. 1C) was tested for interaction with Tax by two-hybrid assay in yeast. As shown in Fig. 2B, Tax bound to PDZ2 and PDZ4. We also analyzed the interaction between the hScrib PDZ domains and the Tax mutant without its PBM, TaxΔPBM. This mutant was effectively unable to bind to the PDZ domains (Fig. 2B). In conclusion, these data indicate that the hScrib PDZ2 and PDZ4 are the targets of Tax. Tax Interacts with hScrib in Vivo—To confirm the in vivo relevance of the binding of Tax to hScrib, the subcellular localization of both proteins expressed either separately or together was examined in transfected COS cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. As previously described, Tax was shown to be localized in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (35Meertens L. Chevalier S. Weil R. Gessain A. Mahieux R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43307-43320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38Alefantis T. Barmak K. Harhaj E.W. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21814-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, EGFP-hScrib mainly showed a diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm, whereas only a small proportion was found to be cell membrane-associated (Fig. 3A). A similar pattern has been observed for Erbin (a cellular protein also containing both leucine-rich repeat and PDZ domains) in HeLa cells transfected by pEGFP-Erbin (39Legouis R. Bastard F.J. Schott S. Navarro C. Borg J.P. Labouesse M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, when hScrib was cotransfected with Tax, the staining pattern of hScrib was modified because both proteins colocalized in particular spots exhibiting a granular distribution (100% of cotransfected cells), mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, Tax did not modify the staining pattern of the EGFP control (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the presence of EGFP-hScrib can also change the subcellular localization of Tax, suggesting that hScrib might have affected some Tax functions. In conclusion, our observations support the notion that Tax and hScrib interact in vivo and that Tax might entail a subcellular redistribution of hScrib. To be sure that other cellular Tax-binding proteins are not involved, the subcellular localization of hScrib was examined in the presence of different Tax mutants. COS cells were first cotransfected with pEGFP-hScrib and pSG-TaxM22 or pSG-TaxM47. M22 and M47, respectively, are NF-κB-defective or CREB-defective Tax mutants, but both mutants contain the C-terminal PBM. As shown in Fig. 3C, the staining pattern of hScrib can also be modified in the presence of both mutants, still exhibiting a granular distribution. These results demonstrate that M22 and M47 are also able to modify the localization of hScrib in transfected COS cells. We next studied the intracellular distribution of hScrib in the presence of TaxΔPBM and Tax2, which does not interact with hScrib. However, when the last six C-terminal amino acid residues of Tax were deleted, our anti-Tax antibody was no longer able to detect the Tax mutant in transfected cells (data not shown). As a previous report demonstrated that EGFP-Tax and EGFP-Tax2 have the same cellular distribution as the non-tagged Tax proteins (35Meertens L. Chevalier S. Weil R. Gessain A. Mahieux R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43307-43320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that EGFP-Tax, -TaxΔPBM, and -Tax2 could be used for analyzing their interactions with HA-tagged hScrib (36Navarro C. Nola S. Audebert S. Santoni M.J. Arsanto J.P. Ginestier C. Marchetto S. Jacquemier J. Isnardon D. Le Bivic A. Birnbaum D. Borg J.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4330-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Effectively, as shown in Fig. 4(panels d-f), EGFP-Tax and HA-Scrib colocalized in spots formed by the viral protein. On the other hand, the staining pattern of the HA-Scrib was not modified in the presence of EGFP-TaxΔPBM (Fig. 4, panels g-i) and EGFP-Tax2 (Fig. 4, panels j-l). Having demonstrated that Tax can interact with hScrib, we also examined the subcellular localization of end"

The identity of some of the cellular determinants that mediate such interactions has emerged, shedding light on mechanisms underlying cell differentiation. For example, we know now that Notch signaling mediates the influence of the microenvironment on states of commitment of the progenitors by activating transcriptional repressors. Cell intrinsic factors such as the proneural basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain transcription factors regulate a network of genes necessary for cell differentiation and maturation. What is missing from this picture is the role of developmental chromatin remodeling in coordinating the expression of disparate classes of genes for the differentiation of retinal progenitors. Here we describe the role of Brm, an ATPase in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in the differentiation of retinal progenitors into retinal ganglion cells. Using the perturbation of expression and function analyses, we demonstrate that Brm promotes retinal ganglion cell differentiation by facilitating the expression and function of a key regulator of retinal ganglion cells, Brn3b, and the inhibition of Notch signaling. In addition, we demonstrate that Brm promotes cell cycle exit during retinal ganglion cell differentiation. Together, our results suggest that Brm represents one of the nexus where diverse information of cell differentiation is integrated during cell differentiation.

Cell fate specification and subsequent cell differentiation in the nervous system are orchestrated and finessed by interplay between cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic factors. This process is exemplified during the development of the retina, an excellent model of the central nervous system. Recent evidence suggests that disparate transcription factors belonging to basic helixloop-helix, homeodomain, and zinc finger classes cooperate toward lineage specification and differentiation (1Bertrand N.

For example, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Math5, and the homeodomain transcription factor, Pax6, have been shown to cooperate during the specification of retinal progenitors into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) 2The abbreviations used are: RGC, retinal ganglion cell; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Rb, retinoblastoma; BrdUrd, bromo-2-deoxyuridine; siRNA, short interfering RNA; E, embryonic day; RT, reverse transcription; Tunel, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PN, postnatal; LM, ligation-mediated. 2The abbreviations used are: RGC, retinal ganglion cell; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Rb, retinoblastoma; BrdUrd, bromo-2-deoxyuridine; siRNA, short interfering RNA; E, embryonic day; RT, reverse transcription; Tunel, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PN, postnatal; LM, ligation-mediated.

As progenitors are committed along RGC lineage, Wt1, a zinc finger transcription factor, and Brn3b, a homeodomain transcription factor of POU class, are expressed and ultimately promote the differentiation and maturation of the specified progenitors into RGCs (10Mu X. Klein W.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The progress in the identification of intrinsic factors has been paralleled by the characterization of extrinsic factors and intercellular signaling pathways, e.g. Notch pathway, that mediates the regulatory influence of the microenvironment on retinal progenitors' maintenance and their differentiation into RGCs (11Ahmad I. Dooley C.M. Polk D.L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Austin C.P. Feldman D.E. Ida Jr., J.A. Cepko C.L.

There are two major classes of chromatin remodeling complexes, that are associated with specific enzymes that remodel chromatin by changing nucleosome structure or position (16Imbalzano A.N. Xiao H. Adv. Protein. Chem. 2004; 67: 157-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). The first class includes complexes consisting of histone acetyltransferase or histone deacetylase that covalently modify chromatin by adding and removing acetyl groups from the amino terminus of the four core histones, respectively. The second class includes SWI/SNF complexes that utilize the energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt nucleosomal structure or position. The mammalian SWI/SNF complexes consist of 10-12 proteins, including the homologous but mutually exclusive ATPases, Brahma (Brm) and Brm related gene 1 (Brg1) (16Imbalzano A.N. Xiao H. Adv. Protein.

Brm is expressed in the developing rat retina, and its temporal and spatial patterns of expression correlate with retinal histogenesis. Using perturbation of expression and function analyses, we demonstrate that Brm influences the differentiation of retinal progenitors into RGCs by facilitating Brn3b expression and function and inhibiting Notch signaling. In addition, we demonstrate that Brm may influence differentiation generically by promoting cell cycle exit. Together, our results suggest that chromatin remodeling by Brm may represent one of the nexus where cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic influence may be integrated toward the differentiation of retinal progenitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProgenitor Cell Culture—Timed-pregnant (E14) Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Sasco (Wilmington, MA). The gestation day was confirmed by the morphological examination of embryos (32Christie G.A. J. Morphol. 1964; 114: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fertilized hen eggs were incubated in a humidified chamber at 38 °C, and embryos were staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (33Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9958) Google Scholar). Embryos were harvested at appropriate gestation periods, and eyes were enucleated. Retina were dissected out and dissociated as described previously (34Ahmad I. Dooley C.M. Thoreson W.B. Rogers J.A. Afiat S. Brain Res. 1999; 831: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RCM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 1× N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) containing FGF2 (10 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), and 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 5 days to generate clonal neurospheres. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (10 μm) was added to the culture for the final 24 h. For co-culture, neurospheres were collected, washed extensively to remove BrdUrd, and plated on poly-d-lysine- and laminin-coated glass coverslips with E3 chick/PN1 rat retinal cells in 1% fetal bovine serum. For RT-PCR analysis co-culture was performed across a 0.4-μm membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Cells were either frozen for RNA extraction or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C for immunofluorescence analysis.Immunofluorescence Analysis—Immunocytochemical analysis for detection of cell-specific markers and BrdUrd was performed as described previously (35Das A.V.

Briefly, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells/sections were incubated in 1× phosphatebuffered saline containing 5% Normal Goat Serum and 0.2-0.4% Triton X-100 followed by an overnight incubation in appropriate dilutions of antibodies against Brm (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Notch1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Shh (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), Brn3b (Covance), RPF1 (36Zhou H. Yoshioka T. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2261-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and BrdUrd (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp.) at 4 °C. Cells/sections were examined for epifluorescence after incubation with IgG, conjugated to Cy3/fluorescein isothiocyanate. Images were captured using a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) and Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA).Cell Cycle Analysis—The DNA content of the retinal cells was measured by flow cytometry using propidium iodide as described (37Ringel J.

Cell cycle analysis was done using a FACStar flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from frozen cells or explants using Qiagen RNA isolation kit (Valencia, CA), and cDNA synthesis was performed as described previously using ∼5 μg of total RNA (38James J. Das A.V. Bhattacharya S. Chacko D.M. Zhao X. Ahmad I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8193-8203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific transcripts were amplified with gene-specific forward and reverse primers using a step-cycle program on a Robocycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for less than 30 cycles to keep the amplification within the range of linearity.

Briefly, ∼2 μg of poly(A) RNA, isolated from adult retina, was electrophoresed on a 1.2% formaldehyde gel and transferred to Nytran Plus. Hybridization was carried out using a 32P-labeled rBrm cDNA probe overnight at 65 °C. Blot was washed sequentially with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min, then twice with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and finally with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min, followed by autoradiography.siRNA Electroporation—Brm siRNA sequence was cloned into pSuper vector (Oligogene) according to the vendor's protocol. Electroporation was carried out according to a modified protocol of Matsuda and Cepko (40Matsuda T. Cepko C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Briefly, E14 retinas were dissected out and collected in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing pSuper-Brm and pEGFP-C3. The explants were placed in wells made in a 2% agarose gel. Electroporation in agarose gel reduced the shock, and thereby cell death. It also prevented aggregation of explants with one another. Electroporation was carried out by applying 5 pulses at 40 V for 50-ms durations with 950-ms intervals using gold-plated electrodes and an Electro Square Porator (BTX Inc.). The efficiency of electroporation was monitored by green fluorescent protein epifluorescence, and the explants were cultured in RCM containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 4 days. The effect of siRNA was ascertained by analyzing the Brm/β-actin protein and mRNA levels by Western and RT-PCR analyses, respectively.Recombinant Virus Preparation and Infection—Brm (pBabe-Brm), dominant negative Brm (pBabe-dnBrm), and empty (pBabe) retrovirus were made in BOSC-23 cells using the calcium phosphate method, as described previously (27de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Neurospheres/RGC-5 cells, at ∼60% confluency, were exposed to retrovirus containing medium for 24 h. After infection, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium.Reporter Assay—RGC-5/293T cells, transduced with pBabe/pBabe-Brm/pBabe-dnBrm were transfected with pGL2-Brn3b-luciferase (RGC-5 cells) and pGV-B-Hes1/Hes5 luciferase constructs (293T cells) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was examined by co-transfecting cells with pGFP-C3 (Clontech). For luciferase assay, cells were lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and 100 μl of lysate was diluted five times using assay reagent (Promega). Diluted samples (100 μl) were analyzed for luciferase activities using a luminometer (Pharmingen).Co-immunoprecipitation—Total protein was extracted from RGC-5 cells using a M-PER protein extraction kit (Pierce). Five hundred micrograms of total protein in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate) was incubated with 5 μg of antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein-antibody complex was precipitated by incubating with protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein-antibody-Sepharose complex was precipitated by centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 1 min, and precipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and the final pellet was resuspended in appropriate volume of loading buffer. The mixture was boiled to dissociate the complex and electrophoresed in a 7-9% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Negative controls included reactions carried out without the antibody and with IgG.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was done as described previously (39Dooley C.M. James J. Jane McGlade C. Ahmad I. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Samples from co-immunoprecipitation or protein isolated from siRNA-transfected retinas were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, following electrophoresis. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and incubated with anti-Brm/antiNotch (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:500 in TBST overnight at 4 °C with shaking. After incubating with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase, the blots were washed with TBST, and immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (RPN 2108, Amersham Biosciences). The blots were then exposed to x-ray film to visualize immunoreactive bands.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was done using a modified procedure from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Briefly, transduced (pBabe/pBabe-Brm) or transfected (pSuper-Brm siRNa/Wt1 (KTS−)) RGC5 cells were grown until they reached confluency, and histones were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde directly to culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubating for 10 min at room temperature on a rocking platform. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline containing protease inhibitors. Cell pellets were resuspended in prewarmed SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1). To reduce the nonspecific background, the samples were pre-cleared using 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry at 4 °C for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 100 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and the immunoprecipitating antibody was added, and incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. For a negative control, we used no antibody or IgG. The histone-antibody complex was precipitated using 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA and protein A-Sepharose (Upstate) for 1 h at 4°C. Precipitates were washed sequentially at room temperature for 5 min, once with low salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and lithium salt immune complex wash buffer (2.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid-sodium salt, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). After completely removing the TE buffer, the precipitate was resuspended and extracted twice in 250 μl of freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). To reverse the histone-DNA cross-linking, samples were heated at 65 °C for 4 h. 200 μl of initial sonicated sample was reverse cross-linked and used as an input. After removing the antibodies by protease digestion of the samples, DNA was recovered and column-purified. PCRs were performed using gene-specific primers.Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Assay—Restriction enzyme accessibility using LM-PCR assay was carried out as described previously (41Hempel W.M. Ferrier P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 287: 53-63PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 nuclei from pBabe/pBabe-Brm transduced RGC5 cells were subjected to BglII (75-100 units) restriction enzyme digest for 30 min at 37 °C. First strand synthesis of genomic DNA (100 ng) was carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and gene-specific forward primer (5′-acccacgtctttctgcactag-3′). Following linker ligation, using T4 DNA ligase overnight at 17 °C, PCR was carried out on the ligated products using the gene-specific forward primer and linker-specific reverse primer (5′-ccgggagatctgaattcgat-3′) for 25 cycles at an annealing temperature at 65 °C. The PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gel followed by Southern analysis using a PCR product corresponding to a sequence between the second TaqI site and the BgllII site in proximal Brn3b promoter as a probe (Fig. 6D).Statistics—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. Statistical analyses were done using Student's t test to determine the significance of the differences between the various conditions.RESULTSExpression of Brm in the Developing Retina—Emerging evidence suggests that Brm plays an important role in cell differentiation (27de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 42Roy K. De La Serna I.L. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33818-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether or not Brm has a similar role in retinal development, we examined the temporal patterns of Brm expression during early (E12-E18) and late (E18-PN6) retinal histogenesis by RT-PCR analysis. Retinal cells are born in an evolutionarily conserved temporal sequence; RGCs, cone photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and a majority of amacrine cells are born during early histogenesis, whereas rod photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and Müller glia are generated during late histogenesis (43Sidman R.L. Smelser G. Structure of the Eye. Academic Press, New York1961: 487-506Google Scholar, 44Young R.W. Anat. Rec. 1985; 212: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). We observed that levels of Brm transcripts increased at E14 stage, compared with those at the E12 stage (Fig. 1, A and B). The stages between E12 and E14 represent the period of active neurogenesis when the majority of RGCs, horizontal cells, and cone photoreceptors are born (45Rapaport D.H. Wong L.L. Wood E.D. Yasumura D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 474: 304-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The decrease in the expression of Brm at stage E16 is likely because of the fact that E16 represents a stage of relative quiescence during early histogenesis (12Austin C.P. Feldman D.E. Ida Jr., J.A. Cepko C.L. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3637-3650PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, during late histogenesis, there was a significant increase in levels of Brm transcripts at PN1 and PN3, compared with those at E18 when the majority of rod photoreceptors, which constitute ∼80% of total cells in rodent retina, are born (45Rapaport D.H. Wong L.L. Wood E.D. Yasumura D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 474: 304-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The Brm expression persisted through postnatal stages and its levels were highest in adult retina, compared with all stages examined. In addition, the specificity of Brm expression was determined by sequencing PCR products and Northern analysis of RNA from the adult retina, which revealed a 5.8-kb band corresponding to full-length Brm transcripts (46Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Together, these results suggested that Brm expression is associated with retinal histogenesis. To obtain further insight into the involvement of Brm with the process of cell differentiation in retina, we examined the cell-specific expression of Brm in the retina of E14 and E18 embryos. We observed that Brm immunoreactivities were distributed toward the scleral and ventricular sides in the developing retina (Fig. 1, D-I). In both E14 and E18 retina, Brm immunoreactivities were predominantly localized toward the scleral side where differentiating precursors are located. As reported previously, Brm immunoreactivities had nuclear as well as cytoplasmic localization (47Fukuoka J. Fujii T. Shih J.H. Dracheva T. Meerzaman D. Player A. Hong K. Settnek S. Gupta A. Buetow K. Hewitt S. Travis W.D. Jen J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4314-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Next, to test whether or not Brm expression is associated with differentiating precursor population, we examined the cellular distribution of Brm immunoreativities in the retina of E14 and E18 embryos, pre-exposed to BrdUrd in utero to identify proliferating (BrdU+) cells (Fig. 1J). We observed that Brm immunoreactivities were associated with both BrdU+ and BrdU− cells. However, in the total cell population at E14, the proportion of BrdU−Brm+ cells (6.8 ± 0.23) was significantly higher than those of BrdU+Brm+ cells (4.09 ± 0.23), suggesting that Brm expression was predominantly associated with post-mitotic cells (Fig. 1L). A comparison of different classes of cells at the two different stages revealed that the proportion of BrdU−Brm+ cells increased ∼2-fold in E18 retina relative to that in E14 retina (12.43 ± 0.75 versus 6.8 ± 0.23, p < 0.05), demonstrating a progressive association of Brm with post-mitotic cells as development progressed. Together, these observations suggested that the expression of Brm correlated with the process of differentiation of retinal stem cells/progenitors.FIG"

FSCB was identified as a binding partner of CABYR, a calcium-binding protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated during capacitation. Orthologous genes of FSCB are present in other mammals, including rat and human, and conserved motifs in FSCB include PXXP, proline-rich and extensin-like regions. FSCB is phosphorylated by protein kinase A as shown by in vitro phosphorylation assay and also by determining phosphorylation sites in native FSCB from mouse sperm. Calcium overlay assay showed that FSCB is a calcium-binding protein from sperm. FSCB is a post meiotic protein first expressed at step 11 of mouse spermatogenesis in the elongating spermatids, and it subsequently incorporates into the flagellar principal piece of the sperm. Ultrastructurally, FSCB localized to a cortical layer of intermediate electron density at the surface of the ribs and longitudinal columns of the fibrous sheath. Due to its temporal appearance during spermiogenesis and location at the cortex of the fibrous sheath, FSCB is postulated to be involved in the later stages of fibrous sheath assembly.

Hyperactivated motility along with changes in the sperm head that confer the capacity to fertilize an oocyte result from a series of time-dependent processes collectively referred to as capacitation (1Austin C.R. Aust. J. Sci. Res. 1951; 4: 581-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chang M.C. Nature. 1951; 168: 697-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying capacitation, including hyperactivation, are incompletely understood, some fundamental processes related to capacitation have been elucidated.The presence of a protein source such as albumin, bicarbonate, and Ca2+ and an energy substrate such as glucose, pyruvate, or lactate are essential to achieve in vitro capacitation (3Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capacitation is also marked by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation through a unique signal transduction cascade involving a sperm-specific soluble adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A (PKA), 3The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CABYR, calcium-binding tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated protein; CABYR CR-A, coding region A of CABYR; AKAP, a kinase-anchoring protein; FSCB, fibrous sheath CABYR-binding; EST, expressed sequence tags; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; aa, amino acid(s); MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JAK1, Janus tyrosine kinase 1. 3The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CABYR, calcium-binding tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated protein; CABYR CR-A, coding region A of CABYR; AKAP, a kinase-anchoring protein; FSCB, fibrous sheath CABYR-binding; EST, expressed sequence tags; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; aa, amino acid(s); MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JAK1, Janus tyrosine kinase 1. and tyrosine kinase(s). A variety of factors, including Ca2+, HCO–3, and H2O2 stimulate soluble adenylyl cyclase leading to increased cytosolic levels of cAMP (4Visconti P.E. Tezon J.G. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 40: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This increase in cAMP then activates PKA, and the consequence is a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of protein substrates localized in the flagellum such as AKAP3, AKAP4, CABYR, hsp-90, ODF2, and tubulin (3Visconti P.E.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3182-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).The fact that PKA is a key regulator of capacitation-associated changes such as protein phosphorylation and hyperactivation has been well established. Pharmacological stimulants that elevate intracellular cAMP, such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, caffeine, and pentoxifylline, enhance hyperactivated motility of sperm (13Yovich J.M. Edirisinghe W.R. Cummins J.M. Yovich J.L. Fertil. Steril. 1990; 53: 715-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). cAMP agonists can accelerate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm, whereas antagonists of PKA inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation and capacitation (14Galantino-Homer H.L. Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Mice in which sperm-specific PKAα is knocked out are infertile, owing to the complete absence of normal sperm movement, including hyperactivated motility (15Nolan M.A. Babcock D.F. Wennemuth G. Brown W. Burton K.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13483-13488Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, these mice demonstrated no increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation. Recently, using antibodies against the phosphorylated form of the consensus target sequence, the role of PKA-dependent phosphorylation has further been established in human (16Moseley F.L. Jha K.N.

Increased phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the initiation of hyperactivated movement, a key attribute of the capacitated state (19Si Y. Okuno M. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Yeung C.H. Weinbauer G.F. Cooper T.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Calcium is absolutely required for capacitation and hyperactivated sperm motility. Ca2+ can increase flagellar bend amplitude in demembranated sperm (21Lindemann C.B. Goltz J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 10: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Okuno M. Brokaw C.J. Cell Motil. Cystoskeleton. 1981; 1: 349-362Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ is increased in hyperactivated sperm in both the head and tail, and Ca2+ oscillates with each flagellar bend (23Suarez S.S. Varosi S.M. Dai X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4660-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which indicate a direct relationship between intracellular calcium and hyperactivation. Four ion channel proteins, CatSper 1–4, have been shown to reside in the membrane of the principal piece of the sperm tail and to interact with one another (24Qi H. Moran M.M. Navarro B. Chong J.A. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Kirichok Y. Ramsey I.S. Quill T.A. Clapham D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Their deletion, although resulting in sperm of apparent normal morphology, causes male infertility by preventing hyperactivated motility. Thus sperm flagellar function is characterized by complicated inter-relationships between Ca2+, membrane cation channels, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and hyperactivated motility. Although several calcium channels in the membrane of the principal piece are now defined and it is shown that intracellular calcium oscillates with each flagellar beat (23Suarez S.S. Varosi S.M. Dai X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4660-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), little is known about the proteins with which calcium interacts intracellularly in the flagellum.In light of the biological importance of phosphorylation events during capacitation, identification of phosphoproteins and their interactions with potential binding partners represent important areas of study for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying capacitation. In this context, the fibrous sheath is well positioned to play a role in the regulation of sperm motility. It functions not only as an important mechanical component of flagella, but also serves as a scaffold for both glycolytic enzymes that provide energy for sperm motility and for constituents of signaling cascades involved in regulating sperm maturation, motility, capacitation, hyperactivation, and/or acrosome reaction (25Eddy E.M.

Gene (Amst.). 2003; 310: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).To further understand the function of this specific protein in the signal transduction cascade, we hypothesized that CABYR binds to an array of interacting proteins in the fibrous sheath and used co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry strategies to study the interactome of CABYR. The present study describes the sequencing, cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel testis- and sperm-specific, calcium-binding protein, termed FSCB, that is expressed during the late steps of spermiogenesis, localizes in the fibrous sheath of the flagellum, and is a phosphorylation target for PKA in sperm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESImmunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of CABYR-binding Proteins—Immunoprecipitations were performed with an immunoprecipitation kit (Roche Applied Science) using 2 × 108 sperm for each tube and 20 μl of polyclonal anti-CABYR CR-A (CABYR coding region A protein) or pre-immune serum following instructions from the manufacturer. The protein A-agarose was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 20 s at room temperature. Immune complexes were dissociated in 200 μl of Celis buffer (9.8 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) with a protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 20 min with gentle shaking, and then separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotted. Immune complexes from a duplicate set of the immunoprecipitations (including anti-CABYR CR-A and pre-immune serum) were sent for mass spectrometry. These samples were washed three times with digestion buffer to remove any remaining Nonidet P-40, then reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide before adding 1 μg of Promega-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at room temperature. The samples were acidified to 5% acetic acid and then desalted on a C18 column. ∼20% of the sample was injected onto the Finnigan LTQ-FT mass spectrometer and analyzed using the double play capability of the instrument acquiring full scan mass spectra to determine peptide molecular mass and product ion spectra to determine amino acid sequence in sequential scans. The data were analyzed by data base search using the Sequest search algorithm against the NR data base.Cloning, Sequencing, and Analysis of cDNAs—Among the microsequences obtained in the anti-CABYR CR-A immunoprecipitates was a novel peptide, DDQISTFK, which did not match any known protein. Data base screening showed that this peptide might come from one of two hypothetical mouse proteins noted in the mouse genome. The accession numbers of these two hypothetical proteins are XP_991269 or XP_892576 (these represent the same hypothetical protein) and XP_ 921314. Their reference DNA sequences are XM_986175 or XM_887483 and XM_916221. Based on the genomic sequences, two pairs of primers were designed to amplify and clone truncated and full-length genes, respectively.The primers for the truncated FSCB gene were designed to create an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and an XhoI site at the 3′-end. The forward primer was: 5′-CGG AAT TCG CCA TCC TTT GAG AAG GCT CC-3′; the reverse primer was: 5′-CCG CTC GAG GTT CTT TAA CTC TAT TTT AAT GG-3′. The primers for the full-length FSCB gene cloning were designed to create an NdeI site at the 5′-end and an XhoI site at the 3′-end. The forward primer was: 5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GGA AGA ATG TGA AGA ACC TGA AG-3′; the reverse primer was: 5′-CCG CTC GAG GTT CTT TAA CTC TAT TTT AAT GG-3′. PCR reactions were performed with 0.2 ng of the cloned mouse testicular Marathon-ready cDNA library (BD Biosciences-Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in a 50-μl assay system for 35 cycles using a program of one 5-min cycle at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and elongation at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 68 °C for 2 min. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, subcloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector, and sequenced in both directions using vector-derived primers.Northern and Multiple Tissue Expression Array Analyses—Northern blots containing ∼2 μg of poly (A)+ RNA per lane from 8 different mouse tissues and a dot blot containing a normalized loading of poly(A)+ RNA (65–874 ng/dot) from 22 different mouse tissues and 7 different control RNAs and DNAs were obtained from BD Biosciences-Clontech. One Northern blot was probed with 20 ng of a 32P-labeled 885-bp DNA corresponding to bp 2338–3222 of the mouse FSCB cDNA open reading frame prepared by random oligonucleotide labeling. Hybridization was performed in ExpressHyb solution (BD Biosciences-Clontech) at 68 °C overnight followed by two washes in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at 22 °C and two washes in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. The same membrane was stripped by incubating in sterile H2O containing 0.5% SDS at 100 °C for 10 min, after which the membrane was re-probed with a 32P-labeled human β-actin cDNA (20 ng), using hybridization and washing conditions described above. Blots were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen at 22 °C for 16–24 h. The phosphorimaging scans were performed on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).The mouse multiple tissue expression array was also probed with 20 ng of 32P-labeled 885-bp DNA corresponding to bp 2338–3222 of the mouse FSCB cDNA open reading frame. The blot was hybridized in ExpressHyb containing sheared salmon testes DNA and Cot-1 DNA, incubated overnight at 65 °C, and then washed four times in 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min followed by two additional washes in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. The blot was exposed to the phosphorimaging screen at 22 °C for 16–24 h.Expression and Purification of the Recombinant FSCB Protein and Antibody Production—cDNAs encoding truncated and full-length FSCB were cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites and NdeI-XhoI sites of the pET-28b(+) and pET-22b(+) expression vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI), respectively. Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) and Rosetta were transformed with the plasmid with resulting constructs containing six residues of histidine on both the N and C termini of the proteins. The expression plasmid constructs were sequenced at the 5′- and 3′-ends to verify the reading frames.A single positive colony from each of the recombinant strains was used to inoculate 5 liters of LB broth with 25 ng/ml kanamycin for BL21(DE3) and 25 ng/ml ampicillin for Rosetta and grown at 37 °C until the absorbance (A600) reached 0.6–1.0. Recombinant protein expression was induced for 3 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were then transferred to 1× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme on ice for 30 min, and were sonicated briefly. The insoluble pellet resulting from centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min was dissolved in 8 m urea in 1× binding buffer for 1 h on ice. After recentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the urea-soluble fraction was loaded onto an Ni2+-activated His-binding resin column (Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and the recombinant protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in 1× binding buffer containing 8 m urea. The affinity-purified recombinant proteins were purified further by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using the Prep Cell (BioRad). The truncated recombinant protein was used for immunization of female Lewis guinea pigs (100 μg/guinea pig) in Freund's complete adjuvant. Animals were boosted three times at intervals of 14 days with 50 μg of recombinant truncated protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, and sera were collected 10 days after the last boost.Western Blot Analysis of Recombinant and Native FSCB in Testis and Sperm—The truncated and full-length recombinant FSCB proteins, mouse sperm extracts, and testis extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples (20 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% Criterion gel (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blotting was carried out as described previously (8Naaby-Hansen S. Mandal A. Wolkowicz M.J. Sen B. Westbrook V.A. Shetty J. Coonrod S.A. Klotz K.L. Kim Y.H. Bush L.A. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 236-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Following blocking, the membranes were incubated with 1:8000 dilution of the guinea pig antiserum against FSCB in PBS-T (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Control pre-immune serum from the guinea pig was used at the same dilution as the immune serum in all experiments. The membranes were washed three times with PBS-T and then incubated with the secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. The signal was detected either using an Enhanced Chemiluminescent Kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described (33Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) or using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). Multiple mouse tissue protein extracts were also used to examine the pattern of tissue expression of FSCB protein by Western blotting using 20 μg of total proteins in each lane. One membrane was stripped and re-probed with anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (clone E7, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) as a sample loading control.Indirect Immunofluorescence Localization of FSCB in the Seminiferous Tubules of Mouse Testis and in the Epididymal Duct—Testes and epididymides were obtained from adult male Swiss mice. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and testes and epididymides were removed and fixed in Bouin's solution overnight at room temperature. The tissues were embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned at 5 μm, and the sections were placed on slides to dry. For staging of tubule sections, after deparaffination in xylene and rehydration in a decreasing ethanol series, periodic acid-Schiff staining was performed following a standard protocol with minor modifications. Slides were rinsed in PBS for 5 min, and then placed in 0.5% periodic acid for 10 min. After a 10-min wash in distilled H2O, followed by incubation for 1 h in Schiff reagent in the dark, the slides were placed in 1% potassium metabisulfite for 2 min. The slides were then washed in distilled H2O, stained with hematoxylin for 3 min, rinsed with tap water, and placed in lithium carbonate (1.38 g/100 ml of distilled H2O) for 3 s. After washes in an increasing ethanol series and xylene, the slides were mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).For immunofluorescence staining, after deparaffination and rehydration, adjacent sections were incubated in 2 n HCl for 20 min, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and incubated in blocking solution containing 10% normal goat serum in PBS-T for 30 min. The specimens were then incubated with anti-FSCB serum or pre-immune serum (1:400 dilution) in PBS-T containing 1% BSA (PBS-T-BSA) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS-T, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG (1:400 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS-T-BSA for 1 h, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS-T, and mounted with Slow Fade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Periodic acid-Schiff stained sections were observed by light microscopy to determine the exact stage of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium for individual seminiferous tubules, and then the same tubule in the adjacent section was studied by fluorescence microscopy to determine the corresponding FSCB staining pattern. Individual green fluorescence images were obtained using a digital camera (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and compiled using Openlab software (Improvision, Inc., Boston, MA).Indirect Immunofluorescence Localization of FSCB in Mouse Sperm—Caudal epididymal sperm were collected and counted using a hemocytometer and diluted to a concentration of 1 × 106 sperm/ml. Sperm were capacitated for 1.5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 following the protocol described previously (3Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capacitation medium contained 5 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm NaHCO3. These two media constituents are known to induce capacitation, and the capacitation state is routinely assessed in our laboratory by checking motility (>80%) and capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Non-capacitated sperm were collected in the same media but lacking BSA and NaHCO3. A 20-μl aliquot of non-capacitated and capacitated sperm suspension containing ∼2 × 104 sperm was added per well onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The slides were dried at 40 °C and then fixed in methanol for 10 min. In some experiments no fixation was performed, and the sperm were simply air-dried onto the slide. After washing 3 × 5 min in PBS-T, the samples were blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS-T for 30 min. The guinea pig anti-FSCB serum or the pre-immune serum was diluted (1:2000) with PBS-T-BSA and incubated with the specimen for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 × 5 min, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG (1:400 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS-T-BSA, washed 3 × 5 min, and mounted with Slow Fade (Molecular Probes). Antiserum to mouse CABYR CR-A protein and the corresponding pre-immune serum were also used (1:400 dilution) for comparison with the FSCB staining. The secondary antibody was Cy3-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG (1:400 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch).Localization of FSCB in Mouse Sperm by Immunoelectron Microscopy—Caudal sperm from adult Swiss mice were washed twice by centrifugation at 550 × g in wash buffer (Ham's F10 Nutrient Mixture (Invitrogen) with 3% sucrose). The washed sperm were resuspended in fixative consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in a wash buffer for 15 min at room temperature. After removing fixative by centrifugation and washing three times with a wash buffer, the sperm were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols, from 40% to 100%. The cells were infiltrated with and embedded in Lowicryl K4M (EM Science, Fort Washington, PA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The blocks were polymerized with UV light for 72 h at –20 °C, and Ultrathin sections of 100 nm thicknesses were cut. Nonspecific sperm antibody interactions were blocked by incubating the sections in undiluted normal goat serum for 15 min at room temperature and washing once with a wash buffer. Guinea pig antiserum against FSCB and the pre-immune serum were diluted (1:100) in a wash buffer with 1% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20. Lowicryl sections were incubated with diluted anti-FSCB serum or pre-immune serum at 4 °C for 16 h. After washing four times in a wash buffer, they were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with 5 nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody, goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Goldmark Biologicals, Phillipsburg, NJ), diluted (1:50) in a wash buffer. The sections were washed with distilled water, silver enhanced for 20 min (Aurion R-Gent SE-EM, EM Science), and stained with uranyl acetate before examination with a 100CX electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA).Calcium-binding Ove"
https://openalex.org/W1997655885,"The lymphatic vascular system regulates tissue fluid homeostasis and the afferent phase of the immune response, and it is also involved in tumor metastasis. There is increasing evidence that lymphatic vessels also mediate acute and chronic inflammation. However, the mechanisms and functional consequences of lymphangiogenesis under inflammatory conditions are largely unknown. Here, we show that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) specifically express the alpha1beta1 isoform of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), that vascular endothelial growth factor-A potently induces sGCalpha1beta1, and that nitric oxide (NO) -induced LEC proliferation, migration, and cGMP production in LECs are specifically dependent on sGCalpha1beta1. Moreover, the specific sGC inhibitor NS-2028 completely prevents ultraviolet B-irradiation-induced lymphatic vessel enlargement, edema formation, and skin inflammation in vivo. These findings identify a crucial role of the NO/sGCalpha1beta1/cGMP pathway in modulating lymphatic vessel function. The blockade of sGCalpha1beta1 signaling might serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for inhibiting lymphangiogenesis and inflammation, in addition to its effects on the blood vasculature."

Here, we report that quail Sulf1 (QSulf1) is an asparagine-linked glycosylated protein. Domain mapping studies in combination with a protein glycosylation prediction program identified multiple asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in the enzymatic and C-terminal domains. Glycosylation inhibitor studies revealed that glycosylation of QSulf1 is essential for its enzymatic activity, membrane targeting, and secretion. Furthermore, N-glycanase cleavage of asparagine-linked sites in native QSulf1 provided direct evidence that these N-linked glycosylation sites are specifically required for QSulf1 heparin binding and its 6-O-desulfation activity, revealing that N-linked glycosylation has a key role in the control of sulfatase enzymatic function."

https://openalex.org/W1993288731,"Mammalian small intestinal lipid absorption requires the coordinated interactions of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp). The observation that apoB100 displays greater dependence on Mttp availability than does apoB48 prompted us to examine the phenotype of Mttp deletion in an Apobec-1-/- background (i.e. apoB100 Mttp-IKO). 20% apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice died on a chow diet, and >90% died following high fat feeding (versus 0 and 11% apoB48 Mttp-IKO mice, respectively). Intestinal adaptation occurred in apoB48 Mttp-IKO mice in response to high fat feeding, evidenced by increased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and villus lengthening, changes that did not occur in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice. There was an exaggerated unfolded protein response (UPR), which became more pronounced in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice. To examine the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the UPR in the lipotoxic effects of Mttp deletion, we administered tauroursodeoxycholate to apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice upon initiation of high fat feeding. Tauroursodeoxycholate administration abrogated the UPR but produced an unexpected acceleration in the onset of lethality in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice. The findings demonstrate that there is activation of the UPR with lethal lipotoxicity in conditional intestinal apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice.

These include the structural protein apolipoprotein B (apoB) and the resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp) (1Davidson N.O. Shelness G.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Proper lipidation of apoB is achieved through the lipid transfer functions of Mttp, and this step is essential to maintaining the conformational integrity of the nascent apoB protein as it enters the luminal ER and initiates nascent lipoprotein biogenesis (1Davidson N.O. Shelness G.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Limiting lipid availability or defective expression and/or function of Mttp leads predictably to a failure of lipidation of the nascent apoB polypeptide, which in turn causes its misfolding and presecretory degradation (reviewed in Ref. 2Hussain M.M. Fatma S. Pan X. Iqbal J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of this pathway is illustrated by the phenotype associated with abetalipoproteinemia where mutations in the MTTP gene are associated with failure of lipid export from both enterocytes and hepatocytes and serum levels of apoB are extremely low or undetectable (3Di Leo E. Lancellotti S. Penacchioni J.Y. Cefalu A.B. Averna M. Pisciotta L. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Gabelli C. Tarugi P. Atherosclerosis. 2005; 180: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The requirements for Mttp-mediated lipidation of the apoB protein exhibit an important pattern of isoform dependence. Studies in hepatoma cells and in primary murine hepatocytes using pharmacological inhibitors of Mttp have demonstrated that apoB100 is dramatically more susceptible to presecretory degradation with limiting Mttp than is the shorter isoform, apoB48 (4Wang Y.

These findings were reproduced in mice with conditional genetic deletion of Mttp in which apoB100 secretion from isolated hepatocytes was virtually eliminated with minimal effects on the secretion of apoB48 (6Larsson S.L.

Liao W. Li L. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These findings collectively imply a functional, isoform-specific divergence in the environmental modifiers and genetic interactions of apoB with Mttp that has important ramifications for intestinal lipid transport. The species- and tissue-specific production of two apoB isoforms in mammals is the result of post-transcriptional C to U RNA editing of the nuclear apoB mRNA (9Smith H.C. Gott J.M. Hanson M.R.

However, despite considerable work on the developmental and nutritional regulation of apoB mRNA editing, the biological significance of this adaptation remains unknown. Targeted deletion of Apobec-1 yielded apoB100-only mice that appear phenotypically unremarkable (18Hirano K. Young S.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Ng J. Sande E. Warburton C. Powell-Braxton L.M. Davidson N.O.

We recently generated mice with conditional deletion of intestinal Mttp in a wild-type Apobec-1 background (i.e. apoB48 Mttp-IKO) and showed that enterocytes were grossly lipid filled along with decreased (but not eliminated) secretion of apoB48 (22Xie Y.

On a chow diet, these animals gain less weight than littermate controls but survive for several months following induction of the conditional deletor allele. In view of the isoform-specific dependence on Mttp availability in modulating the presecretory degradation of apoB100 versus apoB48, we undertook to examine the phenotype of conditional Mttp deletion in the Apobec-1-/- background (i.e. apoB100 Mttp-IKO). We reasoned that targeted deletion of Mttp in the apoB100-only background might exacerbate intestinal lipid accumulation even beyond what was observed previously in the apoB48 Mttp-IKO line (22Xie Y. Newberry E.P. Young S.G. Robine S. Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Luo J. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4075-4086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We further examined the effects of exposure to high fat intake either in the adult setting or during suckling in both the apoB48 Mttp-IKO and apoB100 Mttp-IKO lines. The results of these studies suggest that Mttp insufficiency produces conditional intestinal lipotoxicity, which was markedly exaggerated in the apoB100-only background. The findings collectively provide the first biological evidence for a survival advantage to apoB mRNA editing in the mammalian intestine. Animals—Mttpflox/floxvillin-Cre-ERT2 deletor mice were generated as previously described (22Xie Y. Newberry E.P. Young S.G. Robine S. Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Luo J. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4075-4086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and maintained in a mixed genetic background (∼75% C57BL/6, ∼25% 129/SvJ) and referred to hereafter as apoB48 Mttp-IKO mice. This line was crossed into the Apobec-1-/- background (18Hirano K. Young S.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Ng J. Sande E. Warburton C. Powell-Braxton L.M. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9887-9890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which is maintained in a congenic C57BL/6 background, to generate apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice, again in a mixed genetic background (∼75% C57BL/6, 25% 129/SvJ). Genotyping was performed as previously detailed (22Xie Y. Newberry E.P. Young S.G. Robine S. Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Luo J. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4075-4086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cre recombinase expression in villus enterocytes was induced in adult mice by injection of tamoxifen (Sigma, 50 μg/g body weight daily for 5 days) as previously described (22Xie Y. Newberry E.P. Young S.G. Robine S. Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Luo J. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4075-4086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This injection protocol was modified for the neonatal mice, because 100% wild-type pups died following either five or three daily injections of tamoxifen (data not shown). As illustrated in the legend to Fig. 1, we settled on a single dose of 20 μg/g tamoxifen, because this was tolerated by Mttp wild-type mice. Animals consumed a regular low fat mouse chow (PicoLab rodent chow) or, where indicated, a high fat Western diet containing 20% milk fat and 0.15% cholesterol (Harlan Teklad, TD 88137), a high polyunsaturated fat diet containing 20% safflower oil (ICN Research Diets, 960244), or a chow diet supplemented with 2% cholesterol (ICN Research Diets, 904691). In selected animals, where indicated in the figure legend, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, Calbiochem, 580549) was administered by daily intraperitoneal injection (250 mg/kg (23Ozcan U. Yilmaz E.

Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar) twice daily upon initiating high fat intake and continued for the duration of the experiment. Animals were studied at 10 days, and the indicated tissues were harvested for study. BrdUrd Incorporation and Histological Analysis—Animals were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (120 mg/kg) and 12 mg/kg fluorodeoxyuridine 2 h prior to sacrifice. Intestinal samples were taken from corresponding regions of the proximal and distal small intestine in mice of all genotypes to make appropriate comparisons. Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in 2% agar for optimal orientation prior to sectioning and staining with hematoxylin. BrdUrd incorporation was assessed by immunostaining with anti-BrdUrd IgG (Accurate Chemical, H8365) and secondary staining with anti-rat IgG (Jackson Laboratories). Quantitation was conducted by counting stained nuclei in fully visualized crypts, by individuals blinded to the genotype. Villus length was quantitated using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software and reflected assessment of at least 50 individual villi per mouse from representative (generally three to four mice per genotype) animals by an individual blinded to genotype. Lipid Determinations and Western Blotting—Mucosal scrapings were prepared from the small intestine and frozen at -80 °C until analyzed. Aliquots of frozen tissue were extracted, and individual lipid classes were assayed as previously detailed (22Xie Y. Newberry E.P. Young S.G. Robine S. Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Luo J. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4075-4086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mucosal samples were also subjected to protein analysis following denaturing preparation of tissue lysates and SDS-PAGE. Samples were probed for Mttp and apoB abundance as previously described (22Xie Y. Newberry E.P. Young S.G. Robine S. Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Luo J. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

(catalog numbers 9722 and 3597). Real-time Q-PCR—RNA was extracted from mucosal scrapings using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as previously detailed, and cDNA was generated using the SuperScript II first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real-time Q-PCR was performed in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System using SYBR green and the commercial Master Mix. The relative mRNA abundance of individual genes was normalized to 18 S RNA using primers detailed in Table 1.TABLE 1Oligodeoxyribonucleotide primer sequences for real-time Q-PCRGeneForward primerReverse primerAtf45′-cgagttaagcacattcctggaatc-3′5′-ttcgctgttcaggaagctcat-3′Bax5′-gatgcgtccaccaagaagct-3′5′-agctccatattgctgtccagttc-3′Casp35′-ctggactgtggcattgagaca-3′5′-gcctccaccggtatcttctg-3′Chop5′-ccaccacacctgaaagcagaa-3′5′-aggtgaaaggcagggactca-3′Grp785′-accccgagaacacggtctt-3′5′-gctgcaccgaagggtcatt-3′Ireα5′-cggcaggccaacatcct-3′5′-caatgacgtcctcatgcttgtc-3′Ireβ5′cgcagctctgatggtgtcttc-3′5′-ccctgactcagggtccactaca-3′Xbp-1(s)5′-gagtccgcagcaggtg-3′5′-gtgtcagagtccatggga-3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analyses—Survival analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier statistics and performed using Prism 4.0 (Graph-Pad, San Diego, CA).

All data are presented as means ± S.E. for the indicated number of independent observations. High Fat Feeding Exacerbates Conditional Lethality in ApoB100-Mttp IKO Mice—We observed that 20% of apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice (2 of 10) died within ∼2 weeks following Cre induction while consuming a low fat chow diet (Fig. 1A). However, there was a striking phenotype associated with intake of a high fat (Western) diet where >90% apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice (17 of 18) died, compared with ∼11% mortality in the apoB48 Mttp-IKO mice (where only 2 of 18 died) (Fig. 1B). The effect of Western diet feeding on the mortality observed in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice was reproduced by feeding a high polyunsaturated fat diet (Fig. 1C), suggesting that either saturated or unsaturated fat feeding yield similar phenotypes in this background. By contrast, intake of a 2% cholesterol diet appeared to be well tolerated by apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice (Fig. 1D), suggesting that augmented cholesterol intake is not responsible for the toxic effects of the Western diet. We further examined the effects of conditional Mttp deletion in neonatal mice. This proved to be technically challenging owing to the toxic effects of tamoxifen in all genotypes of neonatal mice (data not shown). However, using a dosing schedule that was tolerated in wild-type animals, we found that there was increased sensitivity to Mttp deletion in the apoB100 genotype, resulting in increased lethality (Fig. 1E). Conditional Lipotoxicity in ApoB100-Mttp IKO Mice Does Not Reflect Differences in Intestinal Lipid Content—In seeking to understand the mechanisms underlying the lethality associated with Mttp deletion in the apoB100 background, we reasoned that the previously described isoform-dependent differences in apoB degradation with limiting Mttp might be reflected by augmented lipid accumulation in small intestinal mucosa from apoB100-Mttp IKO mice. However, this was not the case. Mucosal samples from animals of the four genotypes analyzed at 7, 14, and 28 days following high fat intake revealed a consistent pattern of increased TG in the setting of Mttp deletion, but with no differences between the apoB genotypes (Fig. 2, A-C). The values for mucosal TG content in these high fat fed animals (∼600-1000 μg/mg) are comparable to those seen previously in chow fed Mttp-IKO mice (22Xie Y. Newberry E.P. Young S.G. Robine S. Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Luo J. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4075-4086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is an apparent threshold for enterocyte TG accumulation. Mucosal cholesterol and free fatty acid content increased at later times following Mttp deletion, but again there was no striking difference by apoB genotype (Fig. 2, A-C). These findings suggest strongly that quantitative differences in intestinal lipid accumulation alone are unlikely to account for the toxicity observed in apoB100-Mttp IKO mice. Intestinal Adaptation Is Defective in ApoB100-Mttp IKO Mice—We were intrigued by the possibility that differences in intestinal adaptation might account for the phenotypes observed in the setting of fat malabsorption following Mttp deletion. To pursue this possibility, we turned to an examination of BrdUrd incorporation along with morphometric evaluations of villus length in high fat fed animals of the various genotypes. The findings demonstrate a significant increase in crypt proliferation in apoB48 Mttp-IKO mice versus their littermate apoB48 controls (Fig. 3). By contrast, crypt proliferation as revealed by BrdUrd incorporation was not increased in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice (Fig. 3), suggesting that intestinal adaptation fails to occur in this genotype. These findings were confirmed independently by quantitating villus length in comparable regions of the proximal small intestine from animals of the various genotypes. There was a striking increase in villus length in the apoB48 Mttp-IKO mice (Fig. 4C) where the average length was 656 ± 8 μm versus littermate apoB48 control mice (Fig. 4A, 474 ± 18 μm) or Apobec-1-/- mice (Fig. 4B, 517 ± 19 μm). Villus length in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice, by contrast, was not significantly different from control (Fig. 4D, 542 ± 26 μm). These findings, summarized in Fig. 4E, collectively suggest that there is a failure of intestinal adaptation in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice fed a high fat diet. To explore the basis for this defective adaptation, we examined expression of genes involved in regulating intestinal apoptosis and villus enterocyte shedding, which is a key pathway in the response to intestinal adaptation in other models of injury and repair (24Rubin D.C. Levin M.S. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1291-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Tang Y. Swartz-Basile D.A. Swietlicki E.A. Yi L. Rubin D.C. Levin M.S. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The findings demonstrate increased expression of the pro-apoptotic genes caspase 3 and Bax in the surviving apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice at 4 weeks, but revealed no informative differences at earlier time points in Mttp-IKO mice of either apoB genotype (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that alterations in villus apoptosis do not account for the differences in adaptation observed at 7 days in Mttp-IKO mice.FIGURE 4Intestinal morphology in animals fed a Western diet for 7 days.

We reasoned that the presence of incompletely lipidated apoB would result in the accumulation of degradation products that would in turn trigger an UPR and contribute to the lipotoxicity observed in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice. Accordingly, we examined the expression of several of the known effector genes involved in this response (26Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 27Zhang K. Kaufman R.J.

The findings demonstrate induction of Atf4, Chop, and Grp78 mRNA in Mttp-IKO mice of both apoB genotypes at both 7 and 14 days (Fig. 6, A and B). Additionally, there was a striking induction of these three genes in the surviving apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice at 4 weeks (Fig. 6C), suggesting that there is a progressive increase in the UPR in these few surviving animals. In addition, there was increased intestinal mRNA abundance of the Xbp-1 spliced form (Xbp-1s) noted in the apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice at 7 days and which was significantly elevated at 14 days (Fig. 6, A and B). These findings suggest that there is a distinctive and sustained pattern of UPR in the apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice that may contribute to the phenotype observed following high fat feeding. Further evidence in support of this suggestion is the increase in phospho-eIF2α in the mucosa of apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice at 14 days (Fig. 6D). Alleviating ER-associated Stress and the UPR Exacerbates Lipotoxicity in ApoB100 Mttp-IKO Mice—Recent work in ob/ob mice has indicated that alleviation of ER stress produces abrogation of the UPR, which is accompanied by improvements in the metabolic profile of these animals, including decreased hepatic steatosis (23Ozcan U.

In view of the findings above demonstrating induction of the UPR in apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice, we administered TUDCA to these (apoB100 Mttp-IKO) mice upon initiation of high fat feeding with the anticipation that alleviating ER stress would abrogate the lethality observed following intake of the Western diet. Surprisingly, the findings demonstrated quite the opposite. ApoB100 Mttp-IKO mice treated with TUDCA died earlier than untreated mice (Fig. 7A). TUDCA was effective in abrogating the UPR as inferred by the reduction in mRNA abundance for Xbp-1s in the treated apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice (Fig. 7B). However, pharmacological alleviation of ER stress accompanying TUDCA treatment was accompanied by decreased BrdUrd incorporation into intestinal crypts of apoB100 Mttp-IKO mice (Fig. 7C) and gr"

COX-2 is an inducible isoform of this enzyme, which is believed to play important roles in the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. We found that COX-2 expression rapidly increases in response to various signaling events, including activation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway. Activation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells leads to c-Src-dependent stabilization of COX-2 mRNA requiring an AU-rich region within the 3′-untranslated region of this transcript. This regulation correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of the RNA-associated protein, CUG-binding protein 2 (CUGBP2), which appears to enhance its interaction with COX-2 mRNA. Site-directed mutagenesis of putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites in CUGBP2 identified tyrosine 39 as a c-Src target, and a CUGBP2 with a mutated tyrosine 39 displayed an attenuated ability to bind COX-2 mRNA. We further show that silencing of CUGBP2 with specific small interference RNAs significantly reduces PDGF-dependent induction of COX-2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, forced expression of CUGBP2 or constitutively active c-Src leads to stabilization of co-expressed COX-2 mRNA. Finally, in vitro RNA decay assay demonstrates that CUGBP2 is functionally required for the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA.

Prostaglandins such as prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 act as autocrine mediators that play important roles in inflammation and in the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease as well as the regulation of vascular contractility (1Raines E.W. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Upon injury or exposure to environmental stress within vascular structures, mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and other factors are released by platelets, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (1Raines E.W.

Consequently, the levels of COX-2, an inducible cyclooxygenase isoform, are rapidly increased within the vasculature in response to these various stimuli, including mitogens, cytokines, growth factors, and inflammatory signals. Increased expression of COX-2 is found in plaque lesions, and this is hypothesized to promote the development of early atherosclerotic disease (5Burleigh M.E. Babaev V.R. Oates J.A. Harris R.C.

A more recent study demonstrates that CUG-binding protein 2 (CUGBP2) also binds to AREs in the COX-2 3′-UTR and protects COX-2 mRNA from degradation (21Mukhopadhyay D. Houchen C.W. Kennedy S.

A few RNA-binding proteins have been shown to serve as kinase targets in response to activation of certain signaling pathways, and this phosphorylation, in some cases, may modulate their activity in binding to specific mRNA targets (23Briata P.

However, the RNA-binding protein(s) required for the mitogen/cytokine signaling-induced COX-2 mRNA stabilization and the molecular mechanisms that modulate these interactions with their mRNA targets remain unknown. In this study, we report that c-Src is functionally required for the PDGF-induced COX-2 mRNA stabilization. Furthermore, activation of PDGFR causes c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CUGBP2, which enhances its ability to bind COX-2 mRNA. Because CUGPB2 is essential for maintaining the stability of the COX-2 mRNA, c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of this RNA-binding protein is shown as a novel transacting pathway underlying the post-transcriptional mechanism of PDGF-induced increases in COX-2 expression. Growth Factors, UTP, and Kinase Inhibitors Used—PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml, Calbiochem) was used to stimulate the various cell types. 100 mm UTP stock solution was made in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Kinase inhibitors against PDGFR (STI571, kindly provided by Dr. Jean Y. J. Wang, University of California at San Diego) and c-Src (SU6656, Calbiochem) were made in concentrated Me2SO stock solutions. Working concentrations of each inhibitors used in the experiments are noted in the figure legends. Vehicle (Me2SO only) was used as a negative control where noted. Cells Used and Culture Conditions—Rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle (RASM) cells were harvested and grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum, as previously described in detail (27Wang X. Nickenig G. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were typically used between passages 7 and 16. Prior to experiments involving addition of PDGF, the RASM cells were serum-starved (no serum) in DMEM for 24 h. Phoenix (amphotropic retroviral packaging line) and HEK293 cells were also grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Introduction of Virus, Plasmids, and siRNA into Cells—For the retroviral infection experiments, Phoenix cells were transfected with each retroviral vector by a CaPO4 precipitation method described previously (28Xu K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7604-7611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The RASM cells were successively infected with conditioned supernatants from these retroviral packaging cells three times at ∼12-h intervals. For transient transfection of HEK293, expression constructs were introduced into HEK293 cells by standard CaPO4 transfection techniques or using Hyfect transfection reagent (Denville Scientific Inc.). For transient transfection of RASM cells, expression constructs were introduced into the cells using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 40 h after transfection, the cells were used for the indicated experiments. A custom-designed siRNA oligonucleotide (siRNA1) targeting the amino terminus of rat CUGBP2 (5′-AACGCTGTGGAAGACCGAAAA-3′) was designed with the assistance of and purchased from Qiagen. A predesigned siRNA (siRNA2) targeting the different region of rat CUGBP2 (Rn_Cugbp2_4_HP siRNA) was also purchased from Qiagen. The Stealth RNA interference medium GC duplex negative control (Invitrogen) was used to control for sequence-independent effects of introducing short RNA duplexes into cells. For siRNA delivery, RASM cells were grown in 6-well plates to ∼80% confluence and transfected with the CUGBP2-specific siRNAs or control-scrambled siRNA using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 40 h after transfection, cells were used in the indicated experiments. Transfection efficiency was confirmed by visualization of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression on an inverted fluorescent microscope. Plasmids Used—The kinase-inactive c-Src (Src I) and constitutively active c-Src (Src A) inserted in the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were kindly provided by Dr. Yue Feng (Emory University) (26Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An XbaI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis changing GCG to AGA at bases 139–141 of the 5′-UTR of rat COX-2 cDNA to allow discrimination between recombinant and endogenous COX-2 on RPA analysis. The resulting COX-2 cDNA, referred to as full-length recombinant COX-2 cDNA, was subcloned downstream of the CMV promoter in an MuLV-based retroviral vector to create pKX104 (28Xu K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7604-7611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 356-base most distal portion of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 cDNA was removed by digestion with HpaI and XhoI to create pKX104A. The 2219-base most distal portion of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 cDNA was removed by digestion with EcoRV and XhoI to create pKX104B. To remove the entire 3′-UTR, the AccI site at base 1961 of COX-2 cDNA was converted to SalI site by site-directed mutagenesis, and the entire 3′-UTR, including the proximal region, was removed by digestion with SalI and XhoI to create pKX104C. Rat CUGBP2 cDNA was generated by RT-PCR with the following primers, L18 (forward primer): 5′-ACGCGTATGAACGGAGCTTTGGATCA-3′ with MluI site (in italics) and L21 (reverse primer): 5′-AAATAAGAGCAGGGAGCTTCTGGG-3′, and then inserted by TA cloning into pCR2.1 to make a new plasmid denoted pKMX26. The integrity of this rat CUGBP2 was verified by full-length sequencing of the cDNA. The CUGBP2 cDNA was excised from KMX26 by BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28a(+) to allow production of a His-tagged CUGBP2 that permits purification of this bacterially produced fusion protein with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The FLAG epitope sequence was also introduced between BamHI and MluI in pKMX26 to create a FLAG-tagged CUGBP2 cDNA that was subsequently subcloned into an MuLV-based retroviral vector downstream of the CMV promoter. The resulting construct was named pKMX31A. The putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites of CUGBP2 at Tyr-453, Tyr-410, Tyr-384, and Tyr-39 were mutated into alanine or phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNAs of mutant CUGBP2s (Y453A, Y410A, Y384A, and Y39F) were subsequently subcloned into the same retroviral vector used above and referred to as pKMX31A1, -A2, -A3, and -A5, respectively, or subcloned into pcDNA3 vector and referred to as pcDNA31A1, -A2, -A3, and -A5, respectively. To make RNA for the in vitro RNA decay assay, an MluI site was first introduced into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by adding XhoI-HindIII-MluI-KpnI oligonucleotide between the XhoI and KpnI sites of pBluescript and then a 25-mer poly(A) sequence with XhoI and MluI sequences on the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was cloned between XhoI and MluI in the modified pBluescript. The 831-base proximal COX-2 3′-UTR was excised with AccI/HindIII and subcloned upstream of the poly(A) sequence at SalI/HindIII in the modified pBluescript. A 104-bp sequence of cyclophilin cDNA was similarly subcloned upstream poly(A) in this vector and used as a control, unregulated mRNA sequence. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Assays—In the HEK293 cell experiments, 293 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes at ∼70% confluence 1 day before transfection. Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 μl of phosphatase inhibitor mixture 11 and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged CUGBP2 was performed from these protein extracts using 20 μl of anti-FLAG-M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma). The bound FLAG-tagged CUGBP2 was eluted in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 μg of FLAG peptide at 4 °C for 2 h. In the RASM cell experiments, RASM cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes and lysed for immunoprecipitation as described above. For immunoblotting experiments, either immunoprecipitations or total lysates (prepared using standard boiling SDS lysis) were used and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with antibodies against CUGBP2 (Orbigen, San Diego, CA), phosphorylated-PDGFR-β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphotyrosine (PY20, Upstate Biotechnology, subsidiary of Millipore, Charlottesville, VA), Stat3/phosphorylated-Stat3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and ERK1/2/phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology). The bound proteins were visualized with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences, subsidiary of GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNase Protection Assay—The protocol used for RPA has been described previously (28Xu K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7604-7611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Riboprobe template for recombinant COX-2 is a 567-base run-off transcript from the vector termed pKXCOX524mut containing mutations at base 139–141 of COX-2 cDNA from base 1–524, as previously described. Thus, this probe can distinguish the recombinant and endogenous COX-2 mRNAs. The protected fragment size for recombinant COX-2 mRNA is 524 bases, whereas those for endogenous COX-2 mRNA are 137 and 385 bases. Cyclophilin was used as an internal control. Its Riboprobe template for detection of cyclophilin was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). The Riboprobe template for EGFP is a 372-base run-off transcript from the vector termed pKX44, as previously described (28Xu K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7604-7611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protected Riboprobes were resolved on denaturing urea polyacrylamide gels and detected by exposure to a phosphorimaging screen. Signals were quantified by using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, subsidiary of GE Healthcare). The cyclophilin mRNA signals were used to normalize the COX-2 mRNA signals. In Vivo 32P-Labeling—RASM31A cells (stably expressing FLAG-tagged CUGBP2) were grown to 80% confluence in 60-mm dishes and serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were rinsed three times in phosphate-free DMEM and subsequently incubated in 1.5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM containing 100 μl of 32P (specific activity = 3000 Ci/mmol) for 3 h followed by stimulation with or without 10 ng/ml PDGF for 1 h. After stimulation, lysates were prepared by addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer, as described above. FLAG-CUGBP2 was immunoprecipitated, as previously described, and resolved on SDS-PAGE for either autoradiography to detect 32P-labeled CUGBP2 or immunoblot analysis to determine the total amount of CUGBP2 protein in the immunoprecipitates. In Vitro Src Kinase Assay—Bacterially produced His-tagged CUGBP2 was purified, as previously described, and added to the kinase reaction with commercially available, purified active Src protein (Upstate Biotechnology). The reaction was performed in 1× kinase reaction buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) containing 50 ng of Src, 200 ng of CUGBP2, and 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After reaction completion, samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. In Vitro RNA Decay Assay—RNAs for this assay was produced from the plasmids described earlier that permits generation of the 831-base proximal COX-2 3′-UTR and the 104-base cyclophilin cDNA sequences. The in vitro run-off transcription reactions involved using the appropriate plasmids linearized at MluI and performing the reaction with T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. Capped transcripts were generated by using a 4:1 ratio of m7G5′pppG to GTP. The in vitro RNA decay assay, including preparation of the S100 extract, was performed, as previously described in literatures (29Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To immunodeplete CUGBP2, S100 extract was subjected to three rounds of immunoprecipitation at 4 °C for 1 h each. Both anti-CUGBP2 IgG and normal rabbit serum (negative control) was used in the depletion reactions. Briefly, for the RNA decay assay procedure, 1 μl of COX-2 RNA (∼50,000 cpm), 1 μl of cyclophilin RNA(∼50,000 cpm), and 8 μg of S100 extracts were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. After completion of the incubation, 100 μl of stop buffer was added to each reaction. The labeled RNAs were isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, resolved on a denaturing urea gel, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for detection of the resolved RNA bands. RNA·Protein UV Cross-linking Assay—The 32P-labeled 3′-UTR transcript of COX-2 described earlier is used for the RNA·protein UV cross-linking assay, as described previously (15Xu K. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23012-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated CUGBP2 from untreated and PDGF-treated RASM cells was incubated with 32P-labeled COX-2 3′-UTR transcripts for 30 min at 30 °C, cross-linked by exposure to UV light for 30 s, and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting gel was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. CUGBP2 immunoblot analysis was performed on the immunoprecipitation reactions to confirm that equal amounts of CUGBP2 proteins were used in the UV cross-linking assay. Src Family Kinases Are Required for PDGF-induced COX-2 Expression—Our and other's previous studies show that PDGF stimulation causes a rapid increase in COX-2 mRNA levels in RSAM cells and NIH3T3 cells (9Robida A.M. Xu K. Ellington M.L. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Englesbe M.J. Deou J. Bourns B.D. Clowes A.W. Daum G. J. Vasc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Activation of PDGFR signaling leads to activation of many downstream kinases, including the Src family kinases. To determine the contribution of Src family kinases to PDGF-induced COX2 expression, we examined PDGF-induced COX-2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in the presence of the PDGFR kinase inhibitor STI571 and the Src family kinase-selective inhibitor SU6656 (33Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). As expected, pretreatment of RASM cells with STI571 reduced PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of PDGFR-β and, in parallel, expression of COX-2 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner with 5 μm STI571 being able to completely block both of these processes (Fig. 1A). This result demonstrates that the PDGFR kinase mediates PDGF-induced COX-2 expression. To explore the role of the Src family kinases in PDGF-induced COX-2 induction, SU6656, a small molecule Src family kinase inhibitor with good selectivity for the c-Src kinase over the PDGFR kinase, was used (33Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). First, we determined the effective concentration of SU6656 required for inhibition of c-Src kinase activity but not PDGFR kinase activity in our system. Stat3 phosphorylation is a good surrogate for c-Src function because Stat3 has been shown to be a cellular substrate of c-Src kinase in the PDGF-signaling cascade (34Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and can be phosphorylated by c-Src in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (36Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Through immunoblot analysis, we found that, although 10 μm SU6656 was still insufficient to inhibit PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of PDGFR-β and its downstream kinase ERK1/2, signaling to Stat3 (as evidenced by its phosphorylation), a process known to be dependent on c-Src activity, was reduced significantly after treatment with 1 μm of SU6656 and completely blocked by 5 μm of drug (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that, in RASM cells, c-Src kinase activity can be partially or completely blocked with 1 or 5 μm SU6656, respectively, whereas these concentrations had no detectable effect on PDGFR phosphorylation status. Thus, the effective concentration of SU6656 required for blocking c-Src activity but not PDGFR kinase activity is between 1 and 5 μm in RASM cells, consistent with previous results obtained using other cell lines (33Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). RNA analysis by RPA showed that SU6656 blocked PDGF-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA in a dose-dependent fashion with 5 μm drug being sufficient to completely inhibit this induction (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our RPA results, immunoblotting analysis using anti-COX-2 antibody confirmed that COX-2 protein level was significantly increased following PDGF stimulation, and this induction was nearly completely blocked by 5 μm SU6656 (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that PDGF-induced COX-2 expression is dependent on PDGFR and Src family kinases. Previously, we demonstrated that stimulation with PDGF results in increased transcription of COX-2 mRNA (9Robida A.M. Xu K. Ellington M.L. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, given the degree of COX-2 promoter activation, we determined that the increased transcription rate was not sufficient to fully account for the robust induction of COX-2 mRNA that was observed. Therefore, we hypothesized that PDGF-induced stabilization of COX-2 mRNA likely also contributes to the observed rapid accumulation of COX-2 mRNA. To confirm this hypothesis, RASM cells were stimulated with UTP for 1 h to induce COX-2 mRNA, and then transcription was stopped with addition of actinomycin D. RNA was isolated at different time points after treatment with actinomycin D and subjected to RPA. As shown, treatment with PDGF caused a significant increase in the half-life of COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Actinomycin D has been shown to artificially stabilize some mRNAs, likely due to sequestration of key mRNA export factors (28Xu K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7604-7611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2052162690,"The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP)-binding protein Fe65 is involved in APP nuclear signaling and several steps in APP proteolytic processing. In this study, we show that Fe65 stimulates γ-secretase-mediated liberation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The mechanism of Fe65-mediated stimulation of AICD formation appears to be through enhanced production of the carboxyl-terminal fragment substrates of γ-secretase and direct stimulation of processing by γ-secretase. The stimulatory capacity of Fe65 is isoform-dependent, as the non-neuronal and a2 isoforms promote APP processing more effectively than the exon 9 inclusive neuronal form of Fe65. Intriguingly, Fe65 stimulation of AICD production appears to be inversely related to pathogenic β-amyloid production as the Fe65 isoforms profoundly stimulate AICD production and simultaneously decrease Aβ42 production. Despite the capacity of Fe65 to stimulate γ-secretase-mediated APP proteolysis, it does not rescue the loss of proteolytic function associated with the presenilin-1 familial Alzheimer disease mutations. These data suggest that Fe65 regulation of APP proteolysis may be integrally associated with its nuclear signaling function, as all antecedent proteolytic steps prior to release of Fe65 from the membrane are fostered by the APP-Fe65 interaction.

Previous work has demonstrated that Fe65 is involved in the regulation of APP processing. The intracellular interaction between APP and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the low density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP) is mediated by Fe65 via its two PTB domains (10Pietrzik C.U. Yoon I.S. Jaeger S. Busse T. Weggen S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4259-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The LRP interaction with APP, mediated by Fe65, may coordinate numerous aspects of APP proteolytic processing, including APP carboxyl-terminal fragment generation and β-amyloid secretion (11Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). APP is processed in a sequential fashion, in which either α-or β-secretase proteolytic cleavage is a prerequisite for γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis. Consequently, Fe65 regulation of APP proteolytic processing could play a fundamental role in numerous aspects of APP function. Previous work implicating Fe65 in modulation of β-amyloid secretion (10Pietrzik C.U. Yoon I.S. Jaeger S. Busse T. Weggen S. Koo E.H. J.

Consistent with the connection between Fe65 and AD etiology, epidemiological studies have suggested that a specific isoform of Fe65 may be protective against late onset sporadic AD. A careful examination of Fe65 isoforms expressed in AD patients and unafflicted controls isolated an allele of the Fe65 gene in which a CTA element in intron 13 was deleted adjacent to the splice donor site (13Hu Q. Kukull W.A. Bressler S.L. Gray M.D. Cam J.A. Larson E.B. Martin G.M. Deeb S.S. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The deletion results in differential splicing of the nascent Fe65 transcript, leading to an alternative coding sequence at the carboxyl-terminal portion of the Fe65 protein (14Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The alternative allele is referred to as the a2 allele and is reported to confer resistance to the late onset form of AD (13Hu Q. Kukull W.A. Bressler S.L. Gray M.D. Cam J.A. Larson E.B. Martin G.M.

In neuronal cell types, the six nucleotide exon 9 is incorporated into Fe65 transcripts, resulting in the insertion of Arg-Glu into the first PTB domain (16Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Jin L.W. Bressler S.L. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The role of the a2 and neuronal (exon 9 inclusive) Fe65 isoforms in regulating APP proteolytic processing is explored in this work, which demonstrates that all Fe65 isoforms promote γ-secretase-mediated AICD release, but with the neuronal form of Fe65 being the least efficacious. Cell Culture and Transfection Conditions—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Stock plates of COS7 cells were grown to 50–80% confluence prior to splitting cells for transient transfection experiments. All transactivation assays were done using cells seeded onto 24-well plates. The plates were grown to ∼90% confluence prior to transfection. All transfections employed Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), using 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 per well and transfection medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum lacking antibiotics. NIH 3T3 cells, HEK293 cells, and JEG3 cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium and were transfected using the same methods as employed for COS7 cells. The transfection mix was incubated on the cells for 2–4 h prior to replacement of the transfection medium with fresh growth medium described above. In all transactivation assays, 1.5–2 μg of DNA was used per well. APPGV16 concentrations are defined in each experiment in which titration assays are done. If it is not otherwise specified, then 250 ng/well of APPGV16 DNA was used. In all transactivation assays in which Fe65 values are not stated, 1000 ng per well of Fe65 DNA were employed for an APP:Fe65 vector ratio of 1:4. In all experiments with Fe65, the vector preparations used for the transfection were measured and double checked by comparative gel electrophoresis. To ensure that none of the observed effects were because of undetectable variations in vector preparation quality, all experiments were replicated with different preparations of Fe65 vectors. In all experiments, the promoter concentration was held constant by the addition of either pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to normalize cytomegalovirus promoter concentrations or pCEFL to normalize the amount of EF1α promoter present in each condition. In experiments in which APPGV16 was titrated across the experiment, pCEFL was counter-titrated to ensure that there would not be any promoter competition or variation because of promoter saturation across conditions. The pFRluc (Invitrogen) Gal4-luciferase reporter was transfected at 400 ng/well to measure the Gal4VP16-mediated transactivation levels. In experiments also overexpressing PS1 isoforms, 150 ng/well of the PS1 construct was used. Normalization was done using 50 ng/well of the EF2-βGal construct previously described (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For experiments unaccompanied by transactivation assays, cells were grown in 6-well plates, and 1000 ng/well of the APP-derived constructs and 4000 ng/well of the Fe65 vectors were used to maintain the 1:4 APP:Fe65 vector ratio. The 6-well plates were transfected using 7.5 μl/well of Lipofectamine 2000. The transfection times and other conditions were identical. All experiments were assayed 24–48 h following the transfection. Plasmid Generation and Mutagenesis—All of the APP vectors use PCR amplification of the human APP695 cDNA fused in-frame to Gal4-VP16 driven by the elongation factor 1α promoter (EF1α). The original APP-Gal4VP16 (APPGV16) vector generation has already been described (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and all of the subsequent vectors used the same strategy. 5′ primers were generated that contain a HindIII restriction site and a start codon in front of the coding portion of the cDNA representing the 5′ end of C99, C83, or C50. The 3′ primer used for all of the APP constructs was identical to that used to make APPGV16, in which a 5′ XbaI site resides in front of the complementary sequence at the 3′ end of APP695 with the stop codon deleted. Following PCR amplification of C99, C83, and C50, the PCR product was isolated, digested with HindIII and XbaI, and subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the EF1α-APPGV16 vector from which the HindIII-XbaI APP coding cassette had been removed. This resulted in C99, C83, and C50 vectors driven by the identical portion of the EF1α promoter cloned in-frame with Gal4VP16. The APPGV16 682YENPTY687 point mutants were generated by the method employed previously (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutagenic primers were designed with changes in the coding sequence to alter either Tyr682 or Tyr687 to alanine and insert a silent restriction site using the standard QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis approach (Stratagene). The resulting APPGV16 Y682A and Y687A vectors were mapped and sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation. The Myc epitope-tagged Fe65 vectors were generously provided by Dr. Qubai Hu and Dr. George Martin. The generation of the pcDNA3.1-Fe65myc vectors has been reported previously (14Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Hu Q. Wang L. Yang Z. Cool B.H. Zitnik G. Martin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12548-12558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereby the human neuronal, non-neuronal, and non-neuronal a2 sequence is cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) B at the BamHI and NotI sites (Invitrogen). Untagged versions of these vectors were also generated by leaving the stop codon intact following the subcloning of the cDNA. The amino-terminally truncated Fe65 M260Fe65M327L vector was also provided by the laboratory of Dr. George Martin, encoding the human neuronal form of Fe65 cDNA beginning at Met260 and containing an M327L mutation cloned into pcDNA3.1. The set of Fe65 truncation/deletion mutations was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. T. Sudhof and has been described previously (2Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The BACE expression vector was obtained from Curagen Corp., in which the human BACE cDNA was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. The human presenilin 1 wild-type and FAD mutant expression vectors were described previously (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cleavage Assay, Protein Preparation, and Inhibitor—Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed by standard methods as reported previously (16Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Jin L.W. Bressler S.L. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The APPGV16 protein is cleaved by γ-secretase, liberating the APP AICD-Gal4VP16 moiety to transactivate the pFRluc Gal4-luciferase construct as described previously (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed on ice 24–48 h post-transfection, and luciferase assays were performed and point to point normalized to β-galactosidase values driven by the EF2-βGal vector. For the assays in which parallel protein concentration levels were assessed, see below for details on protein preparation. All measurements were performed on an EG&G Berthold LB 96V luminometer. The γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Sigma) was used at 10 μm, unless otherwise stated, and the cells were treated with inhibitor ∼24 h post-transfection. Western Blots, Aβ ELISA, and Antibodies—Western blots examining protein levels in parallel with transactivation assays used 30 μl per well (90 μl total) of lysates, placed into 180 μl of 1× RIPA with 1× proteosome inhibitor mixture (Sigma) or a separate well from the same transfection experiment lysed in 1× RIPA supplemented with 1× proteosome inhibitor mixture. The lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 10 min and spun down and prepared for loading. The samples were run on NOVEX 4–12% NuPAGE gradient gels and probed using the rabbit anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain antibody (Calbiochem), the rabbit APP carboxyl-terminal antibody (Cell Signaling), mouse c-Myc antibody (BD Biosciences), and the FE518 Fe65 antibody (14Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western blots employing 6-well plates were transfected and assayed 48 h following transfection. The cells were lysed in 1× RIPA with 1× proteosome inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and prepared as described above. The Aβ40 and Aβ42 sandwich ELISA measurements were performed using the media drawn off of the transiently transfected cells, 48 h post-transfection. The ELISA procedure was performed as reported previously (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fe65 Overexpression Stimulates Liberation of the APP Intracellular Domain—The pivotal role of Fe65 in mediating the interaction between APP and LRP (10Pietrzik C.U. Yoon I.S. Jaeger S. Busse T. Weggen S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4259-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) led us to examine its role in the modulation of γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP. It is difficult to quantify the total extent of cleavage of APP by direct biochemical means, because the amino-terminal product of the cleavage is a heterogeneous mix of multiple Aβ-related peptides, and the labile carboxyl-terminal product (AICD) does not accumulate to appreciable levels. Consequently, for many experiments, we employed a system in which cleavage of a carboxyl-terminally modified APP drives transcription of a luciferase reporter plasmid, as we have described previously (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that Fe65 promoted γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP. Consequently, this brought up the question of whether different splice variant products of Fe65 would differ in ability to promote proteolytic liberation of AICD. To assess the role of the neuronal specific exon 9/E9 Arg-Glu insertion into PTB1 domain, we employed Myc-tagged versions of the neuronal and non-neuronal forms of human Fe65 (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Because a second splice variation occurs that alters the carboxyl terminus of Fe65, via incorporation of an alternative exon 14, a Myc-tagged version of the non-neuronal expression vector incorporating the a2 allele was also implemented in this work. Throughout these experiments, a three-way comparison is made between human Fe65 neuronal (E9), Fe65 non-neuronal, and Fe65 non-neuronal a2 to compare the relative efficacy of the PTB1 insertion (neuronal versus non-neuronal) and the a2 allele (non-neuronal versus non-neuronal a2). These vectors were overexpressed in COS7 cells in concert with a titrated range of APPGV16 concentrations which, once cleaved, activates the Gal4-luciferase reporter. Luciferase expression is normalized to constitutively expressed EF2-βGal. This methodology has been described previously (17Wiley J.C. Hudson M. Kanning K.C. Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous experiments, we observed that increasing levels of APPGV16 resulted in a plateau in the transactivation of the Gal4-luciferase reporter. All three isoforms of Fe65 substantially increased the proteolytic liberation of AICD-GV16 from the membrane at statistically significant levels (Fig. 1A). However, the three Fe65 isoforms demonstrated significantly different stimulatory capacity, as the neuronal form was considerably less efficacious in promoting cleavage than either the non-neuronal or a2 isoform (Fig. 1A, upper two curves represent the non-neuronal and a2 isoforms). Although in some experiments the a2 allele promoted slightly greater AICD-GV16 liberation than the non-neuronal, this difference was not consistently observed across experiments.FIGURE 1Fe65 isoforms differentially promote AICD-GV16 liberation. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with titrated levels of the APPGV16 expression vector with or without vectors encoding the three Fe65 isoforms. The concentrations used in the titration were 0, 25, 100, and 500 ng of expression vector per transfected well. The Fe65 expression vectors were co-transfected at 1000 ng/well. A, the Gal4-luciferase data resulting from transactivation of the pFRluc reporter is plotted for all four conditions. All statistical analysis employed the GraphPad Prism software. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA to compare differences between conditions in which Fe65 is present and absent across the APPGV16 titration. APPGV16 expression alone compared with co-expression with Fe65 neuronal resulted in statistically significant difference at p < 0.0001. The 2-ANOVA analysis performed between Fe65 neuronal and Fe65 non-neuronal resulted in a significant difference at p < 0.0001. The two-way ANOVA between the Fe65 non-neuronal and a2 co-transfected titration curves demonstrated slight statistical significance at p < 0.05. However, this difference is attributable to a divergence exclusively at the 100 ng of APPGV16 concentration. Studentŉs t test analysis shows a p = 0.01 value for the 100-ng conditions. However, no other point in the titration is statistically different between Fe65 non-neuronal and a2 isoforms by point by point t test analysis. B, Western blots were performed using the lysates from the transactivation assay. The top two blots were probed for APPGV16 using APP carboxyl-terminal antibody and the Gal4 antibody. The bottom two blots were probed for Fe65. The first Fe65 blot used the Myc antibody targeting the Myc tag epitope on the carboxyl terminus of Fe65, whereas the second blot employed the FE518 Fe65 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that Fe65 stimulation of APP proteolytic liberation was not because of variation in expression following transfection, a portion of the lysates generated for the transactivation assay was employed for immunoblot analysis. Consistently, APPGV16 expression increased across the vector titration. To obviate small differences that might appear within individual blots, the lysates were run and probed with two separate antibodies to interrogate APPGV16 and Fe65 expression levels (Fig. 1B). We did not observe any difference in APPGV16 expression levels within the different Fe65 isoform transfection conditions. Conversely, we were surprised to see that increasing levels of APPGV16 resulted in a consistent decrement in Fe65 protein levels for all isoforms (Fig. 1B, bottom two blots). Although no strict quantitation was performed, it appears that APPGV16 may result in a greater decrement of the Fe65 neuronal form across the titration. Fe65-mediated Stimulation Is γ-Secretase-mediated—The assay system employed in this work detects release of the AICD-GV16 moiety from the membrane. In previous work, we have shown this to be γ-secretase-dependent. However, the intracellular domain of APP contains a known caspase cleavage site (19Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S.

To ensure that Fe65 was stimulating proteolytic release of AICD-GV16 through the γ-secretase processing pathway, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with APPGV16 and the Fe65 isoforms in the presence or absence of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Consistently, all Fe65 isoforms promote statistically significant increases in AICD-GV16 production, and the non-neuronal and a2 isoforms are more efficacious than the neuronal form (Fig. 2). The blockade of transactivation observed in the presence of DAPT confirms that Fe65 stimulation of AICD-GV16 is dependent on γ-secretase, and, consequently, is not likely to be mediated by caspase cleavage. This result was confirmed by comparing effects of transfected Fe65 isoforms on cleavage of AICD-GV16 in wild-type primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from PS1–/–/PS2–/– mice. Fe65 isoforms promoted APPGV16-mediated transactivation exclusively in the wild-type cells (data not shown). Fe65 Stimulation of APP Proteolysis Requires Direct Protein Interaction—Given the demonstrated role of Fe65 in transcriptional regulation (2Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 3Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Fe65 association with APP is mediated by the interaction of the phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB2) with the tyrosine residues within the YENPTY motif (7Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 9Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Consequently, APP-Gal4VP16 mutants were made that contain alanine substitutions at either of the two tyrosine residues within the YENPTY motif. The resulting mutations APPGV16 Y682A and Y687A were transfected into COS7 cells either alone or in the presence of the Fe65 isoforms. The Fe65 isoforms stimulated cleavage of the wild-type APPGV16, yet all three isoforms failed to stimulate cleavage of APPGV16 Y682A or APPGV16 Y687A (Fig. 3). These data confirm that direct association between APP and Fe65 is necessary for Fe65 to promote γ-secretase-mediated AICD release. The observation that both tyrosine mutations completely blocked transactivation was surprising, as each tyrosine residue has been demonstrated to contribute to the interaction with Fe65. Blockage of Fe65 stimulation of APP proteolysis by mutations to either Tyr residue in the YENPTY motif suggests that both residues are essential for the functionally effective association of Fe65. Fe65 Stimulation of APP Proteolysis Is Dependent on PTB1—Based upon the above observation that direct physical interaction between APP and Fe65 is critical for Fe65 enhancement of γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis, we sought to identify the critical Fe65 domains. Fe65 has three functional domains, an amino-terminal WW domain (8Ermekova K.S."

The dodecin monomers adopt a simple βαββ-fold and assemble to hollow sphere-like dodecameric complexes. Flavin binding by the dodecin from Thermus thermophilus showed a 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent dissociation constants in the submicromolar to nanomolar range as characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence titrations.

Electron paramagnetic resonance studies demonstrated that upon reduction the excess electron is localized only on one flavin, thus making dodecin-bound flavins highly refractory to redox chemistry. Besides FMN dimers, trimers of coenzyme A are additionally bound to this eubacterial dodecin along the 3-fold symmetry face II of the dodecin complex. Therefore, dodecins can act as bifunctional cofactor storage proteins that sequester catalytic cofactors in prokaryotes very efficiently in an aggregated and unreactive state.

Therefore, dodecins can act as bifunctional cofactor storage proteins that sequester catalytic cofactors in prokaryotes very efficiently in an aggregated and unreactive state. Flavoproteins are ubiquitous proteins using flavins as pros-thetic groups. Because riboflavin (vitamin B2) serves mostly as a biosynthetic intermediate, FMN and FAD are the principal flavin cofactors (1Vitreschak A.G. Rodionov D.A. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). They are involved in the catalysis of a wide range of biological redox reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of NAD(P)H, lipid esters, and d-amino acids, the oxidation of amines to imines, the formation and cleavage of disulfide bonds, the hydroxylation of aromatic substrates, or the activation of molecular oxygen. Furthermore, flavoproteins serve as electron transmitters in electron transfer processes like oxidative phosphorylation. Here, they act as mediators between typical 2-electron donors like NADH and 1-electron acceptors like the heme group. This versatility to engage in one- and two-electron transfer reactions is due to their isoalloxazine moiety that adopts either an oxidized, a semiquinoid, or fully reduced redox state (2Massey V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flavins are not only involved in redox reactions but also in the sensing of blue or ultraviolet light (3Kita A. Okajima K. Morimoto Y. Ikeuchi M. Miki K. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In crypto-chromes, flavin chromophores mediate the flowering and daily light/dark cycles in plants (4Essen L.O. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), in phototropins they regulate phototropism (5Crosson S. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and in photolyases they are involved in DNA repair (6Mees A. Klar T. Gnau P. Hennecke U. Eker A.P. Carell T. Essen L.O. Science. 2004; 306: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Beside catalytic or sensoric actions, flavoproteins are also involved in the binding or transport of flavins. During pregnancy, a specific carrier system evolves in vertebrates including the riboflavin-binding proteins (RCPs or RfBPs), since adequate amounts of vitamin B2 are essential for the normal fetal development (7Monaco H.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Dodecins are a novel family of flavin-binding proteins of unknown function that were discovered in the Archaea Halobacterium salinarum during an inverse structural genomics project on halophilic proteins (8Bieger B. Essen L.O. Oesterhelt D. Structure. 2003; 11: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). So far it is the smallest known flavoprotein with only 68 amino acids. Apart from halo-archaea, dodecins are found in many eubacterial genomes, as 16% of all completely sequenced eubacteria possess dodecin encoding genes (84 of 520 total, as of July 2007). These organisms constitute mainly proteobacteria (64 of 273) but also acti-nobacteria (14 of 47), chlorobi (4 of 16), and deinococcus/thermus species (2 of 4), which thrive either in soil or aquatic habitats or as parasites in host organisms. Interestingly, dodecins occur in a large variety of pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) as well as in organisms known for their biotechnological and environmental relevance (e.g. Chlorobium tepidum, Geobacter sulfurreducens). Based on sequence conservation, dodecins can be divided into two groups; whereas eubacterial dodecin sequences share an average sequence identity of 53%, the archaeal dodecin sequences cluster separately with only 31% sequence identity to the eubacterial dodecins. The crystal structure of the halophilic dodecin complexed to riboflavin shows a dodecameric hollow sphere-like arrangement of monomeric subunits with cubic 23 symmetry. Flavins are bound as dimers along the interfacial surfaces of the dodecameric complex. The main stabilizing interactions between the flavin dimer and the dodecin complex occur via an aromatic tetrade involving the isoalloxazine groups of the flavin dimer and the indole groups of two neighboring tryptophan residues. The dodecin monomer exhibits a new protein fold adopting a simple βαββ topology, where the amphipathic α-helix is partly enwrapped by the three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. Structural studies and fluorescence-based binding experiments for the H. salinarum dodecin (9Grininger M. Zeth K. Oesterhelt D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed the binding of several kinds of flavins and flavin-like molecules. Furthermore, lumiflavin and lumichrome bind like FMN and riboflavin as stacked dimers in the flavin binding pockets with 1:1 stoichiometries, whereas FAD is bound in a U-shaped locked conformation with an apododecin/ligand ratio of 2:1 (10Grininger M. Seiler F. Zeth K. Oesterhelt D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Binding constants obtained by fluorescence titrations indicate preferred binding of small flavins and flavin-like molecules such as lumiflavin and lumichrome compared with the bulkier flavins FMN and FAD. We have characterized the dodecin from Thermus thermophilus, previously assigned as hypothetical protein TTHA1431, in terms of its structure and flavin binding characteristics. Besides a surprisingly different mode of flavin dimer binding compared with the H. salinarum dodecin, the binding of an additional cofactor, coenzyme A, was observed in T. thermophilus dodecin suggesting that dodecins have evolved to form highly efficient storage proteins for sequestering multiple cofactors in prokaryotic organisms. Using T. thermophilus HB8 genomic DNA and a set of primers (5′-GCGGCCATGGGCAAGGTCTACAAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CGGCTCGAGCTAAGTCTCTTCCAAGCGGAAC-3′) the dodecin gene (GenBank™ accession number 3168700) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET-28a(+) vector (Invitrogen) via the NcoI/XhoI sites. The R45A and R65A mutants were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutagenesis primers 5′-CGCCTCGCCGATGGTACCCGCGATCTCCTTCACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGAAGGAGATCGCGGGTACCATCGGCGAGGCG-3′ for the R45A mutant and the primers 5′-CTAAGTCTCTTCCAAGGCGAACCCCACCTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGAGGTGGGGTTCGCCTTGGAAGAGACTTAG-3′ for the R65A mutant. After verification by DNA dideoxy-sequencing, mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described for the wild type protein. For recombinant T. thermophilus dodecin production, Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)Gold was transformed with the appropriate plasmid and selected with 35 μg/ml kanamycin. 2 liters of LB medium were inoculated with 50 ml of an overnight culture and grown at 150 rpm and 37 °C for 20 h until an A595 of 4.5 was reached to promote autoinduction (11Grossman T.H. Kawasaki E.S. Punreddy S.R. Osburne M.S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and stored at -80 °C. The frozen cells were thawed and disrupted by a French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 30 min), and the supernatant was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. Heat-denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 30 min), and the supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, overnight. The protein was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose high performance (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the T. thermophilus dodecin were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column (120 ml) that was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. Fractions of the dodecameric dodecin with more than 90% purity were concentrated to about 10 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Apododecin was prepared by an unfolding/refolding protocol. The T. thermophilus dodecin obtained from anion exchange chromatography was denatured at a concentration of 1 mg/ml with 6 m guanidinium chloride and dialyzed 3 times against 6 m guanidinium chloride, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and refolded by dialyzing two times against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Alternatively, the protein was precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid followed by dissolving the pellet in 6 m guanidinium chloride, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed stepwise against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. In both cases aggregated protein was removed by size exclusion chromatography. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were taken with an Agilent 1100 Series mass spectrometer to obtain the molecular mass of the dodecin monomer. The apparent molecular mass of the oligomeric assembly was determined by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. Here, 200 μl of T. thermophilus dodecin with a concentration of 1.1 mg/ml were loaded onto the column and eluted with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To obtain a calibration line, mixtures of various size standards (Amersham Biosciences) were loaded. Bound flavin cofactors were identified by HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; ENDOR, electron-nuclear double resonance; mT, milli-Tesla. /electrospray ionization-time-of-flight. After releasing the cofactor by denaturing a dodecin solution with 6% trichloroacetic acid, the cofactor extracts as well as FMN and riboflavin standards were loaded onto a Nucleodur 2 × 125-mm C18 gravity column with a particle size of 3 μm (Macherey & Nagel) and eluted with a water/methanol gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The elution was monitored by UV absorption at 215 nm, and masses were analyzed by electrospray ionization-time-of-flight using a Q-Star pulser (Applied Biosystems). Cofactor concentrations were determined spectroscopically using the following molar extinction coefficients: 11,300 m-1cm-1 at 450 nm for FAD, 12,600 m-1cm-1 at 448 nm for FMN, 12,300 m-1cm-1 at 448 nm for riboflavin, 10,900 m-1cm-1 at 444 nm for lumiflavin (12Koziol J. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 253-285Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and 8,200 m-1cm-1 at 354.5 nm for lumichrome (9Grininger M. Zeth K. Oesterhelt D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To obtain cofactor-reconstituted dodecin, a saturated flavin solution was added to the protein solution in a concentrator cell (Vivascience) until the flow-through became yellow. Reconstituted T. thermophilus dodecin was separated from the excess of flavin by gel filtration chromatography. For an estimation of the cofactor concentration, the protein was precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid, and the absorption of the supernatant at A448 was measured. Using the extinction coefficient of free FMN and a modified extinction coefficient of FMN in 6% trichloroacetic acid (ϵ448 = 10,400 m-1cm-1) the extinction coefficient of dodecin-bound FMN was determined to be 9,500 m-1cm-1. A calculated FMN:protein ratio of 1:1.2 was consistently obtained for different preparations indicating that FMN was bound in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Light orange-colored crystals of non-reconstituted T. thermophilus dodecin were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion techniques at 20 °C from 7 mg/ml protein solution in gel filtration buffer. Crystals were obtained by equilibration of a mixture containing 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.2 m magnesium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) against 750 μl of reservoir solution. Tetragonally shaped crystals (space group P41212, a = b = 65.76 Å, c = 202.14 Å, one hexamer per asymmetric unit) appeared within several weeks. FMN-reconstituted dodecin (5 mg/ml with 5% glycerol) was crystallized in 0.2 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 400. Dark orange crystals (P212121, a = 67.48 Å, b = 98.04 Å, c = 137.60 Å, one dodecamer per asymmetric unit) appeared within a few weeks of incubation. The FMN-reconstituted R45A mutant (7.5 mg/ml) crystallized in 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.05 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 15% polyethylene glycol 8000. Here the space group was P212121 (a = 67.29 Å, b = 68.49 Å, c = 229.89 Å), with one dodecamer per asymmetric unit. Orange-colored, hexagonally shaped crystals of the FMN-reconstituted R65A mutant (P3221, a = b = 67.59 Å, c = 169.19 Å, half a dodecamer per asymmetric unit) appeared under sitting-drop conditions within a few weeks. The sitting drop consisted of 300 nl of 26 mg/ml dodecin and 300 nl of reservoir solution (0.4 m ammonium phosphate), and the reservoir volume was 100 μl. Data sets of the wild type dodecins and the R45A mutant were collected at 100 K from flash-frozen crystals using a Bruker-Nonius FR591 (50 kV, 80 mA)-rotating CuKα anode with a MAR imaging plate (MAR-Research). For the R65A mutant, a 1.4-Å dataset was collected at beamline BW7A at EMBL outstation, Hamburg. For the non-reconstituted dodecin, a 2.4-Å data set was recorded, and the crystals of the reconstituted dodecin diffracted up to 2.6 Å (Table 1). The data sets were processed using MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA (13P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). All structures were solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (14Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Absorption spectra from 200 to 700 nm were recorded using an Ultrospec 3100 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature with a scan rate of 350 nm/min and 0.5-nm steps. Buffer spectra were recorded under identical conditions and subtracted afterwards. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a FP-6500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco) equipped with a Jasco ETC-273T Peltier-type temperature control system at 20 °C using a 200-μl quartz cuvette with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and an emission wavelength of 460-700 nm. Spectra were taken with a scan rate of 1000 nm/min in 0.5-nm steps. For fluorometric measurements, filtered protein and cofactor solutions with a concentration of 5 μm (related to flavin concentration) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl were used. Circular dichroism measurements were carried out on a J-810 (Jasco) equipped with a PTC-423S Peltier type temperature control system using quartz cuvettes with 0.1-cm path lengths. Protein samples had concentrations of 12.5 μm in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Data were recorded from 190 to 280 nm with 0.2-nm steps at a scan rate of 100 nm/min and averaged from 3 to 5 scans recorded at 20 °C. The base line was corrected by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer collected under the same conditions. Thermal unfolding curves were measured by following the ellipticity change at 198 nm during continuous heating from 20 to 95 °C at a scan rate of 2 °C/min. Flavins (Sigma) with a purity of >95% were used without further purification. Lumichrome (Sigma) required further purification by HPLC. Samples were separated on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system using a Nucleodur 125/2 C18ec column with a 3-μm particle size at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and a column temperature of 40 °C with a linear gradient of 10-80% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid within 25 min. Pooled fractions of interest were lyophilized. Dissociation constants of flavin-dodecin complexes were determined by fluorescence titrations, where the fluorescence quench of the flavin ligand upon binding to the T. thermophilus dodecin was monitored with a FP-6500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco) equipped with a PTC-423S Peltier-type temperature control system. In this experiment 11.5 μm dodecin containing endogenously bound FMN was used to avoid the kinetic effect observed before by ITC measurements and fluorescence titrations where apododecin was used. Ligand concentrations were 200 nm (FAD, lumichrome), 203 nm (riboflavin), 198 nm (FMN), and 232 nm (lumiflavin). All solutions were sterile-filtered and pre-equilibrated at 20 °C in the dark. Measurements were made in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. Fluorescence titrations were performed at 20 °C in a 2-ml round cuvette. In a typical titration experiment, 1000 μl of flavin solution was titrated with 4-μl aliquots of dodecin every 2 min under stirring until an end point was reached. For riboflavin, FMN and lumiflavin, emission at 529 nm after excitation at 450 nm was measured with medium sensitivity and slit widths of 10 nm for emission and excitation. In the titration using FAD, the parameters were set to 450/532 with slid widths of 5 nm (excitation) and 10 nm (emission) and high sensitivity due to low FAD fluorescence at pH 8.0. In the case of lumichrome, the emission at 460 nm after excitation at 380 nm with slid widths of 5 nm (excitation) and 10 nm (emission) were measured. For the correction of the fluorescence of endogenously bound FMN, the protein was titrated into buffer under the same conditions as in the binding experiments. The fluorescence was normalized to the fluorescence starting point of the ligand and corrected for the fluorescence of prebound FMN. With regard to dilution of ligand fluorescence, the data were plotted against the concentration of free dodecin. The apparent KD values were obtained by fitting these curves against the following one-site binding equation. Fmeas=ctotal·Ffree+((rtotal+ctotal+KD)24−ctotal·rtotal−rtotal+ctotal+KD2)·(Ffree−Fbound) ctotal and rtotal are the ligand and total-protein concentrations after each titration point, respectively, Ffree is the fluorescence of the free cofactor, Fmeas is the corrected fluorescence readout, and Fbound is the fluorescence of bound cofactor. KD is the dissociation constant. The listed KD values have been averaged from at least three titration experiments and were corrected for dilution effects as well as for FMN fluorescence of the first dimer. For a measurement of the time-dependent effect of FMN binding, 600 μl of FMN (2 μm) were titrated with 100 μl of dodecin solution (100 μm), which was equilibrated with 2 μm FMN overnight at 20 °C in the dark. Fluorescence emission spectra were taken before injection and every 30 min after injection with slid widths of 5 nm (excitation) and 5 nm (emission) with medium sensitivity and a scan speed of 1000 nm/min. For the determination of the kinetic effect, measurements were done at 20, 37, 50, and 65 °C. Half-life periods were calculated by fitting the experimental data against the exponential decay formula. ITC was performed at 25 °C in a MCS MicroCal instrument with a reaction cell volume of 1.351 ml. Before use, solutions were degassed under vacuum to eliminate air bubbles. Titration experiments consisted of 25 injections of FMN with a concentration of 375 μm into a 110 μm dodecin solution. The volume of the first injection was 1.495 μl, and the subsequent injection volumes were 10.021 μl. Nonspecific heat effects were estimated from the magnitude of the peaks appearing after complete saturation. Raw data were integrated, corrected for nonspecific heats, and analyzed according to a 1:1 binding model using Origin™ 5.0 scientific plotting software. EPR/Electron-nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) Instrumentation—X-band-pulsed ENDOR spectra were recorded using a Bruker E580 pulse EPR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH) in conjunction with a Bruker ER 4118X-MD5-EN dielectric-ring ENDOR resonator. For Davies-type ENDOR (17Davies E.R. Phys. Lett. A. 1974; 47: 1-2Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar), a microwave pulse-sequence π-t-π/2-τ-π using 64 and 128-ns π/2 and π pulses, respectively, and a radio frequency pulse of 10-μs duration starting 1 μs after the first microwave pulse were used. The separation times t and τ between the microwave pulses were set to 13 μs and 348 ns, respectively. To avoid saturation effects due to long relaxation times of flavin radicals, the entire pulse pattern was repeated with a frequency of only 400 Hz. EPR Sample Preparation—For EPR studies, the dodecin-bound FMN (246 μm) was reduced with titanium(III) citrate (480 μm) directly in an EPR tube (3 mm inner diameter) under anaerobic conditions. Results were checked photometrically. Expression and Purification—The gene coding for T. thermophilus dodecin was cloned by PCR from T. thermophilus strain HB8 and heterologously overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)Gold. After purification by heat denaturation to remove most E. coli proteins, the T. thermophilus dodecin was purified to homogeneity as an orange-colored homo-oligomer by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1A). Overall yields were 17 mg of T. thermophilus dodecin per liter of culture with a purity greater than 95% (Fig. 1B). Mass spectrometric analysis of the recombinant T. thermophilus dodecin revealed a molecular mass of 7618.1 Da compared with 7616.6 Da as calculated for residues Gly-2 to Thr-69. Accordingly, the N-terminal formyl-methionine was removed by post-translational modification. Spectroscopic Characterization of the Dodecin-Flavin Complex—UV/VIS spectroscopy of the orange-colored T. thermophilus dodecin complex showed the characteristic absorption spectrum of oxidized flavin species with absorption maxima at 270, 380, and 450 nm (Fig. 1C). An additional slightly red-shifted shoulder was observed in the range of 475-480 nm, indicating vibrational fine structure resulting from tight cofactor binding in the protein environment. Moreover, there is significant absorbance up to 600 nm representing charge-transfer interactions of the isoalloxazine rings with neighboring aromatic residues. According to fluorescence spectroscopy, the flavin fluorescence was quenched by >98% when compared with flavins in free solution (see Fig. 3A). Because the residual fluorescence was indistinguishable from free flavin, it is obvious that the binding of flavins to the dodecin oligomer almost completely quenches the endogenous flavin fluorescence. Likewise, attempts to induce a triplet state of the dodecin-bound flavin species in the frozen state failed when the dodecin complex was excited by a continuous 450-nm pump laser with triplet formation being followed by EPR (data not shown). Ultrafast UV-visible spectroscopy on defined flavin-dodecin complexes finally showed that a rapid electron transfer from neighboring tryptophan residues to the isoalloxazines takes place in the excited singlet state, thus avoiding consequent intersystem crossing and causing the efficient quench of flavin fluorescence. 3G. G. Gurzadayan, B. Meissner, L. O. Essen, and M. E. Michel-Beyerle, manuscript in preparation. Cofactor Binding and Oligomerization of the Dodecin Complex—The electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy analysis of the flavin cofactor extracted under denaturing conditions from the dodecin complex showed by comparison with FMN, riboflavin, and FAD standards that the recombinant T. thermophilus dodecin predominantly binds the negatively charged FMN. This finding contrasts with the characterization of the previously discovered dodecin from H. salinarum, which was found to copurify exclusively with stoichiometrically bound riboflavin when being isolated from the cytosol of this haloarchaeon (8Bieger B. Essen L.O. Oesterhelt D. Structure. 2003; 11: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The purified T. thermophilus dodecin complex exhibited a protein:cofactor ratio of 1:0.2, indicating substoichiometric flavin binding to the recombinant T. thermophilus dodecin, most likely due to the lack of sufficient flavin supply in the E. coli cytosol. However, the dodecin complex could be reconstituted afterward in vitro with either FMN, FAD, or riboflavin as shown by apparent cofactor:protein ratios of 1:1.2 after size exclusion chromatography, suggesting the formation of stoichiometric dodecin·flavin complexes. To determine the oligomeric state of the dodecin complex, analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed as shown in Fig. 1A. Peak 1 indicated a molecular mass of 96.4 kDa, whereas peak 2 corresponded to a molecular mass of 39.8 kDa, suggesting that dodecameric T. thermophilus dodecin is in equilibrium with a hexameric state, if only substoichiometric amounts of FMN are bound. Reconstitution with FMN or riboflavin caused the disappearance of peak 2 indicating a stabilization of the dodecameric complex. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified dodecin showed a high resistance against denaturation by SDS or heat. Even after boiling the protein samples for 5 min in gel-loading buffer comprising 4% (w/v) SDS, the monomer band was accompanied in the SDS-PAGE by an oligomeric band at the apparent molecular weight of a hexameric protein species (Fig. 1B). Whether this band corresponds to a pa"

Chemical shift perturbation experiments allowed the precise definition of the heparan sulfate (HS) binding site of CypB. The N-terminal extremity of CypB, which contains a consensus sequence for heparin-binding proteins was modeled on the basis of our experimental NMR data. Because the HS binding site extends toward the CypB catalytic pocket, we measured its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity in the absence or presence of a HS oligosaccharide toward a CD147-derived peptide. We report the first direct evidence that CypB is enzymatically active on CD147, as it is able to accelerate the cis/trans isomerization of the Asp179-Pro180 bond in a CD147-derived peptide. However, HS binding has no significant influence on this PPIase activity. We thus conclude that the glycanic moiety of HSPG serves as anchor for CypB at the cell surface, and that the signal could be transduced by CypB via its PPIase activity toward CD147.

Members of this class such as the predominantly cytoplasmic CypA, the secreted CypB, and the mitochondrial CypD are small ubiquitous proteins sharing a high sequence homology (65% identity between human CypA and CypB), that translates into a closely related three-dimensional fold. Indeed, the NMR and crystal structures of CypA free and in complex with CsA (3Ke H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4Mikol V. Kallen J. Pflugl G.

Whereas the nearly identical active site and CsA binding pocket further underscore their close relationship, both proteins do differ in their N and C termini, CypB containing two peptides of some 10 residues long that are lacking in CypA. CypA and CypB act in the progression of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, but are equally involved in the first steps of certain viral infections (8Bukrinsky M.I.

Their inflammatory activity is conditioned by their interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the membrane receptor CD147, two binding partners at the cell surface of T cell lymphocytes, granulocytes and macrophages (11Allain F.

Significantly, both molecular partners have equally been described as co-receptors for the HIV-1 virus (10Sokolskaja E. Luban J. Curr. Opin.

Both intact prolyl cis/trans activity of the cyclophilins and the presence of the Pro180 residue of CD147, located on one of the two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, are required for its chemotactic activity, raising the possibility that isomerization of the accessible Asp179–Pro180 peptide bond might be the molecular signal that translates ultimately in chemotactic activity (14Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol.

Such a cyclophilin-dependent mechanism of regulation has already been demonstrated for the tyrosine kinase Itk (18Andreotti A.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9515-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), where CypA catalyzes the isomerization of the Asn286–Pro287 peptide bond. According to the isomerization state in trans or cis of this peptide bond, the Itk SH2 domain interacts with either its natural phosphotyrosine substrate or with its own SH3 domain (19Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Both CypA and CypB in vitro induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2 phosphorylation, calcium flux generation and chemotaxis of responsive cells, although CypB is a more potent agonist and uniquely triggers integrin-mediated adhesion of T lymphocytes to fibronectin (11Allain F.

Tight binding of CypB to HS moieties of proteoglycans is one source for this increased potency, as mutations in the N-terminal 3KKK6 and 15YFD17 tripeptide motifs not only affect HS binding (16Carpentier M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but equally reduce CypB chemotaxis and abolish integrin-mediated adhesion (11Allain F. Vanpouille C.

Vanpouille C. Haendler B. Spik G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5222-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutants deprived of enzymatic activity still bind to the cell surface of T lymphocytes, but are unable to induce biological responses, indicating that CypB has to interact simultaneously with both CD147 and HSPGs. Very recently, the interaction of CypB with the HS moieties of syndecan-1 was shown to promote and/or stabilize the complex between syndecan-1 and CD147, resulting in mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and subsequent pro-adhesive activity (20Pakula R. Melchior A. Denys A. Vanpouille C. Mazurier J. Allain F. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The minimal motif of HS interacting with CypB was mapped to an octasaccharide (21Vanpouille C. Denys A. Carpentier M. Pakula R. Mazurier J. Allain F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the length is not the sole parameter defining the complexity of the sugar chains of HSPGs, as the exact sulfation pattern and the conformation of the glycanic moieties equally may contribute to the specificity of the interaction (22Vanpouille C. Deligny A. Delehedde M. Denys A. Melchior A. Lienard X. Lyon M. Mazurier J. Fernig D.G. Allain F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar, 23Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chemie. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 24Delehedde M. Allain F. Payne S.J. Borgo R. Vanpouille C. Fernig D.G. Deudon E. Curr. Med.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest that the high-affinity binding of CypB to specialized HS moieties stabilizes the interaction with its substrate or directly modulates its PPIase activity, resulting in an enhanced intracellular signaling via CD147. We examine here by NMR spectroscopy the interaction between heparin-derived oligosaccharides and CypB. Whereas we confirm the direct implication of the N-terminal extension that distinguishes CypB from CypA in the HS binding, NMR chemical shift mapping and NOE data indicate a binding site of heparin directed toward the catalytic site rather than to the N-terminal β-strand containing the 15YFD17 motif. This novel identification of a HS binding patch close to the active site raises the possibility of a functional coupling between HS binding and prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. We use EXSY spectroscopy in the absence or presence of an oligosaccharide to quantify the CypB isomerization efficiency toward the Asp179–Pro180 bond in a CD147-derived peptide. Finally, the N-terminal peptide responsible for the CypB-specific induction of T-lymphocyte adhesion to the extracellular matrix being absent from the x-ray structure due to proteolytic cleavages during the CypB purification procedure (7Mikol V. Kallen J. Walkinshaw M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5183-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we derive its structure based on NMR parameters, and investigate whether the heparin binding consensus sequence (3EKKKGPKV10 in CypB) adopts any regular heparin binding structure (23Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chemie. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Cyclophilin B—A recombinant plasmid, pET15b-CypB, was constructed to increase the production of recombinant human CypB. The sequence coding CypB was amplified from the previously described plasmid PCGF (27Spik G. Haendler B. Delmas O. Mariller C. Chamoux M. Maes P. Tartar A. Montreuil J. Stedman K. Kocher H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10735-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the following forward primer 3′-acttccatggccgatgagaagaag-5′ and the reverse primer 5′-acaaggatcctactccttggcgat-3′ and then inserted in a pET15b plasmid (Merck-NOVAGEN, Darmstadt) between restriction enzyme sites NcoI and BamHI. The 24 first amino acids corresponding to the signal sequence were not included in recombinant CypB. Recombinant CypB starts with Ala1 and ends with Glu184. Our numbering is as in the x-ray Protein Data Bank file 1CYN (7Mikol V. Kallen J. Walkinshaw M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5183-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The pET15b-CypB plasmid was introduced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (NOVAGEN), and a 15N-13C-labeled sample was prepared by growing cells in M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl and 13C glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. The 15N-2H-labeled sample was prepared by growing cells in a semi-rich deuterated medium (M9 medium in 99.5% D2O with 15NH4Cl, 2H7-glucose (2 g/liter) and 20% of deuterated 15N-rich medium (v/v) (Isogro, Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories). The cells were grown at 37 °C to reach an A600 = 0.8 and expression was induced at 20 °C with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested after overnight induction and disrupted in lysis buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, Proteases inhibitor mixture (Roche), DNase I, RNase A) by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, then DNA was precipitated with streptomycin sulfate. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min the supernatant was dialyzed (6–8 kDa cut-off) overnight against 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.85. The recombinant CypB was sequentially purified by ion exchange (SP Sepharose Fast Flow) and gel filtration (Superose 12 Prep Grade) chromatography. Finally the protein was dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.3, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated by ultrafiltration (cut-off 10 kDa). Recombinant CypB was filtered (0.2μ) and stored at -20 °C. Preparation of Heparin-derived Oligosaccharides—The heparin-derived oligosaccharides were prepared as previously described (21Vanpouille C. Denys A. Carpentier M. Pakula R. Mazurier J. Allain F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, heparin was enzymatically digested with heparinase I at 30 °C. The resulting digestion mixture was desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (GE Healthcare), then fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on Bio-Gel P-6 (Bio-Rad) in 0.2 m NH4Cl, pH 3.5. The fractions corresponding to increasing dp oligosaccharides were desalted and then freeze dried. The heparin-derived oligosaccharide fractions were kept at -20 °C until used. Peptide from CD147—A 15-amino acid long peptide of CD147 centered around Pro180 (sequence 173NLNMEADPGQYRCNG187) was synthesized by classical solid phase chemistry (Neosystems, Strasbourg, France), and purified to homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography. Upon dissolving this peptide in a phosphate buffer to a 1 mm concentration, some precipitate was observed. Comparison with NMR spectra of soluble peptides allowed an estimation of the concentration of the soluble fraction at 0.5 mm. NMR Spectroscopy—All spectra were recorded on either a Bruker Avance 800 MHz spectrometer with standard triple resonance probe or a Bruker Avance 600 MHz equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe head, at 25 °C (Bruker, Karslruhe, Germany). The proton chemical shifts were referenced using the methyl signal of TMSP (sodium 3-trimethyl-silyl-[2,2,3,3-d.4]propionate) at 0 ppm. The spectra were processed with the Bruker TOPSPIN software package and in-house routines with the SNARF program (van Hoesel FHJ, 2000 SNARF version 0.8.9, University of Groningen, The Netherlands). Resonance assignment of the CypB protein residues was performed by using the classical strategy of paired triple resonance experiments (28Grzesiek S. Bax A. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Tjandra N. Wingfield P.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1248-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) on a 15N/13C CypB sample at 0.25 mm in a 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.3, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer using standard Bruker pulse programs. HNCACB/CBCAcoNH spectra were recorded with 512/52/71 complex points for 1H/15N/13C windows of 13.9/36/70 ppm centered at 4.8/118/37.4 ppm, respectively. HNCO and HN(CA)CO spectra were recorded with 512/52/24 complex points for 1H/15N/13C windows of 13.9/36/20 ppm centered at 4.8/118/172.5 ppm, respectively. A three-dimensional NOESY-(1H-15N HSQC) spectrum with a mixing time of 400 ms on a 350 μm sample of 2H-15N CypB in the presence or absence of dp12 was acquired with 512/32/148 complex points in the 1H/15N/1H dimensions. All spectra were zero filled to 1k/256/256 complex points and multiplied by a shifted square sine bell function prior to Fourier transformation. The heteronuclear NOE effect was measured with standard refocused HSQC pulse sequence in the presence or absence of proton decoupling during the 5-s relaxation delay, on a 250 μm sample of 15N-CypB in the absence or presence of dp12. Hetero-NOE values were derived from the intensity ratios of the cross-peak with and without proton decoupling. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were collected on CypB and CypB-dp12 complex at 0.2 mm in 95% H2O, 5% D2O, 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.3, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 85 μm TMSP-D4 (trimethyl-silyl propionate). RDCs were acquired on these uniformly 15N-labeled samples suspended in a liquid crystalline medium consisting of 5% (w/v) polyoxyethylene 5-lauryl ether (C12E5) and 1-hexanol (Sigma) with a molar ratio of 0.85 (29Otting G. Ruckert M. Levitt M.H. Moshref A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 1DNH dipolar couplings were measured at 600 MHz and obtained using two-dimensional TROSY-type experiments (30Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 31Rance M. Loria J.P. Palmer III, A.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 136: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions of the multidimensional experiments was achieved by the echo/antiecho detection scheme for 15N, and by the TPPI States method for 1H. 64 scans were recorded per (t1, t2) increment. Data processing and peak picking were performed using the software SNARF (van Hoesel FHJ, 2000 SNARF version 0.8.9. University of Groningen, The Netherlands). Because the complex was partially precipitated, RDC values on the isolated CypB were of better quality, and were used for the refinement of the core region (see below). The PPIase activity of CypB on the CD147 peptide was assessed on a sample of 0.5 mm CD147 peptide and 25 μm CypB, in the absence or presence of dp14. EXSY spectra were acquired at 800 MHz with mixing times of 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 ms, and 2k/256 complex points in the direct and indirect proton dimension, and Fourier transformed to 4k/1k complex frequency points after zero filling. Spectra at 100, 200, and 400 ms were repeated on an independent sample to evaluate the error margins. Because the exchange cross-peaks are close to the diagonal, the maximal peak intensity rather than the peak integral was measured for the Asp179 cis/trans cross-peaks, and normalized to the corresponding diagonal peak intensity. The exchange rate kexch (s−1) was calculated by fitting the theoretical curve given by Equation 1 (32Kaplan J.L. Fraenkel G. NMR Chemically Exchanging Systems. Academic Press, New York1980Google Scholar) to the experimental data, where %[cis → trans], expressed as the intensity of the exchange cross-peak to the diagonal peak, corresponds to the fraction of molecules that undergoes a transition from cis to trans conformation during the mixing time, and 1/a is the excess of trans over cis forms, determined on the basis of the one-dimensional spectra of Fig. 1C. %[cis→trans]=a1-exp(-(1+1/a)kexch)×MT1+exp(-(1+1/a)kexch)×MT(Eq. 1) Modeling of CypB Structure in Its Complex with dp12—The peptide ADEKKK was manually constructed and added at the N terminus of the x-ray structure of CypB (PDB code 1CYN). This completed structure formed the starting point for the refinement procedure. Briefly, the core region (residues 15–173) was first refined using the RDC values obtained on the isolated CypB as input for the XPLOR-NIH program (33Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Clore G.M. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 2006; 48: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 34Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Using the program MODULE (35Dosset P. Hus J.C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and the RDC values obtained on the CypB-dp12 complex, we calculated the alignment tensor for the complex. This tensor was then fixed in a second refinement step for the full structure. Input data were back-calculated NOEs, backbone dihedral angles, and hydrogen bonds for the core region, and the experimental NOEs, dihedral angle constraints from the 13C chemical shifts and RDC values for the N and C termini. A total of 250 structures was calculated, of which we analyzed in detail the 20 structures of lowest energy. Further details of the refinement steps can be found in supplemental materials. The PyMol software was used for molecular graphics (DeLano, W. L., The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (www.pymol.org)). Molecular Characterization of the Partners—Based on its high isoelectrical point, the recombinant human cyclophilin B, 184 amino acids residues, was purified in one step by ion exchange chromatography to above 95% based on SDS-PAGE. The protein eluted from gel filtration chromatography as a single peak with an elution volume corresponding to a monomer of 20 kDa, and the good dispersion of the methyl groups in the one-dimensional NMR spectrum indicated a globular tertiary folding (Fig. 1A). A doubly labeled 15N-13C CypB was used for the NMR assignment strategy and all backbone resonances (except for Ala1 and Lys52) and Cβ carbons were fully assigned. 4I. Landrieu, F. Bonnachera, N. Sibille, X. Hanoulle, G. Vugniauk, A. Sillen, A. Melchior, B. Parent, J.-M. Wieruszeski, A. Denys, A. Hamel, F. Allain, D. Horvath, and G. Lippens, manuscript in preparation. To observe potential NOE contacts with heparin (see below), a deuterated 2H-15N CypB was prepared. From the one-dimensional spectrum (Fig. 1A), the deuteration level was estimated to be around 95%. Even after 1 week in aqueous buffer, several amide functions from the core of the protein still did not exchange with protons from the solvent, thereby defining the rigid central core of the protein. Previous gel mobility shift assays studies had determined an octasaccharide as the minimal length required for efficient binding of heparan sulfate to CypB (21Vanpouille C. Denys A. Carpentier M. Pakula R. Mazurier J. Allain F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we only considered oligosaccharides with a higher degree of polymerization in this work, and present the results with dp12 or dp14 oligosaccharides. As these molecules come from enzymatic digestion of heparin with heparinase I, there are several sources of heterogeneity, at the level of the sequence and the sulfation pattern. To minimize these heterogeneities for the NMR experiments, we selected for those dp12 oligosaccharides species that interact most tightly with CypB by mixing an excess of dp12 with CypB followed by purification of the complex by gel filtration chromatography. An even more stringent selection criterion was introduced by incubation of the oligosaccharide/protein mixture in 400 mm NaCl before and during the gel filtration (Fig. 1B). As the interaction between CypB and heparan sulfates is expected to be essentially driven by electrostatic forces, the high ionic strength should preclude binding of oligosaccharides species that weakly interact with CypB. Following the gel filtration, the buffer was exchanged to reduce the salt concentration to 40 mm. Despite this stringent procedure, we cannot exclude that our heparin oligosaccharides still contain some degree of structural heterogeneity. To assess a potential enzymatic activity of CypB toward CD147 and quantify the modulation of this activity by the heparin oligosaccharides, we used a synthetic peptide of 15 amino acids, 173NLNMEADPGQYRCNG187, centered around the Pro180 CD147 residue. This CD147 peptide was characterized by homonuclear NMR spectroscopy, and both the absence of long range NOE contacts and JHN-Hα constants around 6 Hz indicate the absence of stable secondary structure. Both the trans and cis forms of the central Pro180 could be identified, and from the intensity of the cis and trans forms of the Asp179 amide proton, we estimate a cis/trans ratio of 6% (Fig. 1C). The dual proline conformation shows up not only as distinct resonance frequencies of the flanking amide protons, but also as far as the Tyr184 amide group (supplemental Fig. S1). Definition of the CypB Zone in Interaction with Oligosaccharide dp12—A first complex between 15N-labeled CypB and dp12 was obtained by mixing the two molecules in 400 mm NaCl to a molar ratio of 1:10, to ensure the ligand saturation of CypB (21Vanpouille C. Denys A. Carpentier M. Pakula R. Mazurier J. Allain F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This complex was then purified by gel filtration chromatography using the same high ionic strength buffer (400 mm NaCl) to preferentially keep those dp12 species that strongly interact with CypB. To define the CypB residues involved in the interaction with heparin-derived dp12 oligosaccharides, we compared 1H-15N HSQC spectra of CypB alone and CypB in complex with dp12. Only a limited subset of CypB residues were affected by interaction with the dp12 oligosaccharide, excluding major conformational changes upon complex formation (Fig. 2). Previously, two CypB motifs, 4KKK6 and 15YFD17 (16Carpentier M. Allain F. Haendler B. Denys A. Mariller C. Benaissa M. Spik G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), had been proposed to be directly involved in the interaction with heparan sulfates. Mapping the chemical shift changes along the sequence using our sequence-specific assignment confirmed the N-terminal 4KKK6 motif as an effective part of the heparin binding site. The HN resonances of these three lysine residues undergo the most important shift upon heparin binding (Fig. 2A). However, the binding of dp12 to CypB had no influence on the NMR signals corresponding to the residues of the 15YFD17 motif (Fig. 2B), despite the fact that a 15YFD17 deletion mutant was previously found unable to bind efficiently heparan sulfates (16Carpentier M.

We did several additional chemical shift mapping experiments with CypB and different heparin-derived oligosaccharides (dp8, dp12, and dp14), but were unable to detect any perturbation of these YFD motif resonances. These data suggest an indirect participation of the YFD motif in the binding of the heparan sulfates, probably through destabilization of the N-terminal β sheet. Beyond the N-terminal K"

ENaC maturation involves transit through the Golgi complex where Asn-linked glycans are processed to complex type and the channel is activated by furin-dependent cleavage of the α and γ subunits. To identify signals in ENaC for ER retention/retrieval or ER exit/release, chimera were prepared with the interleukin α subunit (Tac) and each of the three cytoplasmic carboxyl termini of mouse ENaC (Tac-Ct) or with γ-glutamyltranspeptidase and each of the three cytoplasmic amino termini (Nt-GGT). By monitoring acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance after metabolic labeling, we found no evidence of ER retention of any chimera when compared with control Tac or GGT, but we did observe enhanced exit of Tac-αCt when compared with Tac. ER exit of ENaC was assayed after metabolic labeling by following the appearance of cleaved α as cleaved α subunit, but not non-cleaved α, is endoglycosidase H-resistant. Interestingly ER exit of epitope-tagged and truncated α (αΔ624–699-V5) with full-length βγ was similar to wild type α (+βγ), whereas ER exit of ENaC lacking the entire cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of α (αΔ613–699-V5 +βγ) was significantly reduced. Subsequent analysis of ER exit for ENaCs with mutations within the intervening sequence 613HRFRSRYWSPG623 within the context of the full-length α revealed that mutation αRSRYW620 to AAAAA significantly reduced ER exit.

There is also clear evidence that ENaC transits the Golgi complex during its maturation.

Furin is a well characterized proprotein convertase that is localized primarily in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), although it shuttles between the TGN and plasma membrane, and prostasin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored serine protease likely found on the cell surface (22Jean F.

Although ER exit signals for transmembrane cargo that interact with the prebudding coat protein complex II (COPII) (Sar1p, Sec23p, and Sec24p) are diacidic motifs, dibasic motifs, short hydrophobic motifs, or combinations of these, the signals for ER exit of multitransmembrane proteins and/or multisubunit proteins are more complex using a hierarchy of arginine-based ER retention signals and diverse ER exit (release) signals (for reviews, see Refs. 25Bonifacino J.S.

Thus, factors that regulate the assembly, retention, and release of ENaC from the ER could represent key regulatory steps in the ability of cells to modulate Na+ transport. As a first step toward understanding how ER exit of ENaC is regulated, we followed the acquisition of Endo H resistance for chimera made with each of the six cytosolic domains of α, β, and γ mouse ENaC subunits. Although we found no evidence for a retention signal in any of the cytoplasmic domains, an ER exit signal was clearly present within the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit. We then analyzed ER exit of ENaC containing wild type or mutant α subunits and found that an ER exit signal is present within a short peptide motif of the α cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail. Vector Preparation—Chimeras of mouse ENaC cytoplasmic domains were constructed in pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen) using a two-step PCR method (34Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Protease inhibitor mixture set III from Calbiochem was added to the lysis buffer as directed by the manufacturer. Extracts were centrifuged for 7 min at 14,000 rpm in a centrifuge at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel with either mouse monoclonal anti-Tac antibody (anti-CD25, Ancell, Bayport, MN) or goat anti-GGT antibody (40Joyce-Brady M.

MDCK cells expressing αβγENaC (using either double tagged αWT, α624, α613, αHRF, αRSRYW, or αSPG) were starved for Met and Cys for 30 min, pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 20 min, and chased in DMEM (with 10% fetal bovine serum) containing excess Met (2.5 mm) for varying times. After extraction in lysis buffer and removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, 10% SDS was added to a final concentration of 2.5% to dissociate the channel into individual subunits. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and diluted with lysis buffer to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.73% prior to immunoprecipitation of the α subunit (95-kDa uncleaved and 65-kDa cleaved forms) with mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibodies (Serotec, Oxford, UK) and protein A conjugated to Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.).

In some cases, samples were treated overnight with or without Endo H (0.04 unit, Roche Diagnostics) or peptide N-glycanase-F (500 units, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Proteins were recovered by heating the immunoprecipitates for 3.5 min at 95 °C in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer containing fresh 0.14 m β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Criterion Tris-HCl precast 4–15% acrylamide gradient gels from Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45-μm pore size Immobilon-NC membrane from Millipore, Bedford, MA). Radioactive protein bands were imaged and quantitated using a Molecular Imager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting of proteins on nitrocellulose was carried out with anti-V5 antibodies from Serotec as described previously (10Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A.

None of the constructs had epitope tags. 24–36 h after injection, channels at the cell surface were blocked with 1 mm MTSET for 4 min, resulting in a covalent modification of the channel that causes an ∼80% reduction of current. After removal of MTSET from the bath, Na+ current was measured by two-electrode voltage clamp at -100 mV every 30 s for 10 min to monitor current recovery. The initial rates of reappearance of amiloride-sensitive currents were determined from the linear portion of the current recovery curve (0–2 min). ENaC endocytosis rates were determined from oocytes injected with cRNA for wild type β, mutant γG542C, and α with (αWT) or without (α613) its carboxyl cytoplasmic tail. 24–36 h after injection, amiloride-sensitive currents were determined by two-electrode voltage clamp before and after 2, 4, and 6 h of incubation with 5 μm brefeldin A. Amiloride-sensitive currents were expressed relative to the initial amiloride-sensitive current, and data for the current declines were compared. Identification of an ER Exit Signal in the Carboxyl Cytoplasmic Tail of αENaC—To identify potential ER retention or exit signals present in the cytoplasmic domains of ENaC subunits, chimeras were designed to individually characterize functional sequences within the Nt or Ct cytoplasmic tails of the α, β, and γ subunits. To maintain the correct orientation of the tails with respect to the ER membrane, Nt and Ct were attached to the transmembrane and ectodomains of the type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (Nt-GGT) and the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein interleukin receptor α subunit referred to as Tac (Tac-Ct), respectively. Because both GGT and Tac ectodomains exhibit Asn-linked glycosylation (35Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 426-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Marks M.S. Roche P.A. van Donselaar E. Woodruff L. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the rate of chimera exit from the ER was measured in pulse-chase experiments by following the acquisition of Endo H resistance. Glycoproteins with Asn-linked glycans are sensitive to cleavage by Endo H prior to reaching the medial Golgi complex, and most glycans become resistant to cleavage after Asn-linked glycans are trimmed by mannosidase II in that compartment (for reviews, see Refs. 43Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar and 44Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). To measure ER exit of the proteins, Chinese hamster ovary flip-in cell lines stably expressing GGT (residues 1–568), Tac (residues 1–266), or one of the six chimeras were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]Met/Cys and chased for 10–30 min. GGT, Tac, and the six chimeras were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti-ectodomain antibodies, and duplicate samples were treated with or without Endo H and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands with altered mobility after Endo H treatment due to removal of Asn-linked glycans represented immature chimera (from markings ◂ to ◃), whereas bands that did not shift after Endo H treatment represented mature chimera with processed Asn-linked glycans (arrow) (see Fig. 1, A–D and F–I). The mature forms of the chimera also exhibited slower mobility than the immature forms consistent with processing of Asn-linked glycans to more complex types, and their levels increased with time of chase consistent with a precursor-product relationship. We observed a significant increase in maturation (ER exit) of Tac-αCt when compared with Tac (20 and 30 min of chase, p < 0.001) and a small but significant increase in maturation of Tac-γCt when compared with Tac (30 min, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1E). The increase in maturation of Tac-βCt when compared with Tac was not statistically significant. There was no apparent difference in the rate of maturation between GGT and any of the Nt-GGT chimeras (Fig. 1J). Therefore, there appeared to be a strong ER exit signal present in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail of αENaC but no ER retention signal in any of the six cytoplasmic tails. Only a Small Fraction of the α Subunit Is Assembled into a Channel That Transits the Golgi Complex and TGN—We previously showed that the α and γ subunits of αβγENaC complex are cleaved by the resident TGN protease furin during transit through the Golgi complex where Asn-linked glycans are terminally processed to complex type (28Hughey R.P.

https://openalex.org/W1560578413,"Acetylcholine signaling through muscarinic type 2 receptors activates atrial G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir3) channels via the betagamma subunits of G proteins (Gbetagamma). Different combinations of recombinant Gbetagamma subunits have been shown to activate Kir3 channels in a similar manner. In native systems, however, only Gbetagamma subunits associated with the pertussis toxin-sensitive Galpha(i/o) subunits signal to K(+) channels. Additionally, in vitro binding experiments supported the notion that the C terminus of Kir3 channels interacts preferentially with Galpha(i) over Galpha(q). In this study we confirmed in two heterologous expression systems a preference of Galpha(i) over Galpha(q) in the activation of K(+) currents. To identify determinants of Gbetagamma signaling specificity, we first exchanged domains of Galpha(i) and Galpha(q) subunits responsible for receptor coupling selectivity and swapped their receptor coupling partners. Our results established that the G proteins, regardless of the receptor type to which they coupled, conferred specificity to Kir3 activation. We next tested signaling through chimeras between the Galpha(i) and Galpha(q) subunits in which the N terminus, the helical, or the GTPase domains of the Galpha subunits were exchanged. Our results revealed that the helical domain of Galpha(i) (residues 63-175) in the background of Galpha(q) could support Kir3 activation, whereas the reverse chimera could not. Moreover, the helical domain of the Galpha(i) subunit conferred Galpha(i)-like binding of the Kir3 C terminus to the Galpha(q) subunits that contained it. These results implicate the helical domain of Galpha(i) proteins as a critical determinant of Gbetagamma signaling specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2013557061,"Lymphocyte apoptosis is a hallmark of sepsis and contributes to disease mortality. In other acute injuries, such as myocardial and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, apoptosis plays a significant role in disease-associated morbidity and mortality. We previously showed that constitutive activation of the potent antiapoptotic Akt/protein kinase B signaling pathway in lymphocytes both reduces sepsis-induced lymphocyte apoptosis and confers a significant survival advantage compared to wild-type littermates. Here, we demonstrate a therapeutic approach to acutely augment Akt activity in a wild-type animal. A cell-permeable peptide conjugated to the Akt-binding domain of the endogenous Akt coactivator, Tcl-1, prolongs Akt activity, activates extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and protects lymphocytes from numerous apoptotic stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. Molecular approaches to activate the antiapoptotic Akt and ERK signaling pathways may provide a novel tool to study these signaling pathways, as well as a new antiapoptotic strategy for the treatment of sepsis and other acute injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2004119143,"Efflux pumps of the small multidrug resistance family bind cationic, lipophilic antibiotics and transport them across the membrane in exchange for protons. The transport cycle must involve various conformational states of the protein needed for substrate binding, translocation, and release. A fluorescent substrate will therefore experience a significant change of environment while being transported, which influences its fluorescence properties. Thus the substrate itself can report intermediate states that form during the transport cycle. We show the existence of such a substrate-transporter complex for the EmrE homolog Mycobacterium tuberculosis TBsmr and its substrate ethidium bromide. The pH gradient needed for antiport has been generated by co-reconstituting TBsmr with bacteriorhodopsin. Sample illumination generates a DeltapH, which results in enhanced ethidium fluorescence intensity, which is abolished when DeltapH or DeltaPsi is collapsed or when the essential residue Glu-13 in TBsmr is exchanged with Ala. This observation shows the formation of a pH-dependent, transient substrate-protein complex between binding and release of ethidium. We have further characterized this state by determining the K(d), by inhibiting ethidium transport through titration with nonfluorescent substrate and by fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Our findings support a model with a single occluded intermediate state in which the substrate is highly immobile."
