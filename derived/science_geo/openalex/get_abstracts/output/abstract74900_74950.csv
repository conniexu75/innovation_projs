https://openalex.org/W1508143080,"The oxidation of Fe(II) by serum was studied at pH 7.35 and at various oxygen concentrations which approach the physiological conditions of human serum. The nonenzymic oxidation of Fe(II) was estimated to be insufficient to account for a rate of Fe(III)-transferrin formation necessary to provide an adequate iron supply for hemoglobin and other biosyntheses if Fe(II) is a relevant source of serum iron. The results suggested that an appreciable catalytic activity was involved in Fe(II) oxidation in serum. The ferroxidase activity of various normal human sera correlates precisely with the p-phenylenediamine oxidase activity of these sera. This catalytic activity is inhibited by azide and cyanide, and is low in sera with reduced ceruloplasmin levels. Fe(II) oxidation is also associated with the ceruloplasmin fraction on diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography of serum. The oxidation of Fe(II) by ceruloplasmin is zero order with respect to oxygen (10 to 200 µm), whereas the nonenzymic oxidation is first order. A biological role for the ceruloplasmin of serum in promoting the rate of iron saturation of transferrin and in stimulating iron utilization and the designation of the enzyme as serum ferroxidase is proposed."

Densities and viscosities of similar solutions containing additional solutes (buffers, NaCl, β-mercaptoethanol) have been measured, and the possibility of predicting these results from information on solutions containing each solute separately is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1517075555,"Abstract From measurements of tritium incorporation following the perfusion in situ of livers with blood enriched in 3H2O, the rate of hepatic fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis in young nonfasted rats was found to be 7.0 and 0.09 µmoles per g of liver per hour, respectively. Newly synthesized fatty acids were utilized by liver in the same manner as has been shown by others for preformed fatty acids arriving in liver via plasma; at the end of 3 hours, 37% were found in liver phospholipids, 34% in liver neutral lipids, and 29% had been released into the perfusate, nearly all as triglycerides. At least two pools of liver triglycerides could be shown. Depriving a rat of food for 48 hours reduced hepatic fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis to less than 2% the rate in nonfasted controls. Feeding rats 1% orotic acid reduced hepatic fatty acid synthesis, stimulated cholesterolgenesis, and almost completely blocked the transfer of hepatic lipids into perfusate. From whole animal studies with Triton, the block in lipid secretion was found to increase in severity during the first week of orotic acid feeding, and could be rapidly reversed by inclusion of 0.25% dietary adenine sulfate. Accumulated liver triglyceride was seen only after 3 days of continuous orotic acid feeding."

Acetylated chymotrypsinogen was prepared by the reaction of crystallized chymotrypsinogen with acetic anhydride at pH 6.7 and 4°, and purification of the product. End group analysis and Van Slyke amino nitrogen determination indicated that all the free e- and α-amino groups of the chymotrypsinogen molecule had been blocked by acetylation. 2. Activation of acetylated chymotrypsinogen by trypsin, followed by chromatography, yielded acetylated δ-chymotrypsin. Quantitative end group determination indicated that the molecule had a single amino group, the NH2-terminal α-amino group of an isoleucine residue. In the catalytic hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tryptophan amide, the steady state kinetic parameters were found to be the same, in the pH region 6 to 10, with acetylated δ-chymotrypsin and with δ-chymotrypsin. 3. The activation of acetylated chymotrypsinogen to acetylated δ-chymotrypsin was found to be accompanied by the appearance of a single new ionizing group, titratable in the pH region 5 to 10.5, with a pK(app) of 8.3. 4. The specific rotation of acetylated δ-chymotrypsin was found to vary with pH in the pH region 6 to 10.5, the change in specific rotation following the ionization of a single group with pK(app) of 8.3. Above pH 10 the specific rotation of the zymogen and the enzyme were found to be the same at the three different wave lengths investigated. 5. Previous investigations in this and other laboratories of the pH dependence of the quotient of the steady state kinetic parameters, kcat [Km(app)]-1 —a function which yields the ionization constants of the catalytically importance ionizing groups of the free enzyme—have indicated the importance of an ionizing group with pK(app) ∼ 8.5 in all α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed reactions studied, and in the δ- or acetylated δ-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tryptophan amide. 6. An interpretation of these results that is consistent with all available experimental information is that the conversion of catalytically inactive chymotrypsinogen to active enzyme is accompanied by the appearance of a new ionizing group (a group that has a pK(app) of 8.3 in acetylated δ-chymotrypsin) which controls the conformation and thereby the activity of the enzyme. Molecules in which this ionizing group is unprotonated are in a catalytically inactive conformation, resembling that of chymotrypsinogen, and molecules in which this ionizing group is protonated are in a catalytically active conformation. A diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-induced protein isomerization involves only the enzyme molecules that are in the catalytically active conformation. This interpretation leads to a prediction that in the presence of DFP there will be an increase in pK(app) of the ionizing group. Such an increase in pK(app) was previously observed, and accounts for the proton uptake and the change in specific rotation of the enzyme observed in its reaction with DFP. 7. All evidence obtained so far suggests that the group with pK(app) ∼8.5 is an NH2-terminal isoleucyl α-amino group."

https://openalex.org/W1594081910,"The purification, crystallization, and biological activity of flavodoxin is reported. It is a new electron transport protein and has been isolated from extracts of cells of Clostridium pasteurianum grown on nitrogen gas or ammonia and in an iron-deficient medium. Flavodoxin forms yellow crystals from ammonium sulfate solution, has a molecular weight of 14,600, absorption maxima of the oxidized form at 272, 372, 443 mµ with a shoulder at 472 mµ, and contains no iron, molybdenum, cobalt, or labile sulfur. In equimolar amounts, it will substitute for ferredoxin in the metabolism of hydrogen and pyruvate and in the fixation of nitrogen by extracts of C. pasteurianum with an effectiveness of 70, 40, and 30%, respectively. It is suggested that flavodoxin replaces ferredoxin as an electron carrier in cells of C. pasteurianum grown in an iron-deficient medium since these cells contain less than 5% of the ferredoxin found in cells grown in an iron-sufficient medium."
https://openalex.org/W1565889531,"Abstract The major glycolipid of Micrococcus lysodeikticus has been isolated in pure form and has been shown to have the structure of α-d-mannosyl-(1 → 3)-α-d-mannosyl-(1 → 3)-diglyceride. The presence of two enzymes involved in glycolipid biosynthesis in M. lysodeikticus has been established. One of the enzymes is associated with the particulate cell fraction and catalyzes the formation of α-d-mannosyl-(1 → 3)-diglyceride from guanosine diphosphate mannose and 1,2-diglyceride. The enzyme is specific for 1,2-diglyceride and manifests maximal activity on 1,2-diglycerides containing branched chain fatty acyl groups. The reaction is stimulated by Mg++ ion and shows an absolute requirement for an anionic surface active agent. Although long chain alkyl surface-active agents and straight chain fatty acid salts stimulate the reaction, the most effective surface-active agents are the branched chain fatty acids common to M. lysodeikticus. A second enzyme present in the soluble cell fraction catalyzes the conversion of enzymatically prepared α-d-mannosyl-(1 → 3)-diglyceride to α-d-mannosyl-(1 → 3)-α-d-mannosyl-(1 → 3)-diglyceride."
https://openalex.org/W1550931629,"Abstract Some of the properties of a 70-fold purified bovine milk lactose synthetase have been determined. The enzyme preparation appears to be specific for uracil nucleoside diphosphate d-galactose derivatives. Adenosine, thymidine, cytidine, or guanosine diphosphate derivatives cannot serve as galactosyl donors for d-glucose to form lactose. The enzyme preparation will not transfer the galactosyl residue from uridine diphosphate d-galactose to α-d-glucose 1-phosphate, α-d-galactose 1-phosphate, d-xylose, maltose, α-methyl-d-glucoside, or l-glucose. N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine can serve as an acceptor for d-galactose but is only 25% as effective as d-glucose; the product of this reaction appears to be an analogue of lactose in which N-acetyl-d-glucosamine is substituted for d-glucose. It is not known whether these galactosyl transfer reactions are catalyzed by the same or a different enzyme. No reversal of the enzymatic reaction could be shown when lactose and UDP were used as substrates. The bovine milk lactose synthetase is activated by several divalent cations. The enzyme shows a maximum activation by Mn++, and an inhibition by ethylenediaminetetraacetate or Hg++. The enzyme has a 42° temperature optimum, and a pH optimum of 7.5, with maximum activity in sodium cacodylate-HCl or β,β'-dimethylglutarate-NaOH buffer. Phosphorylated compounds structurally related to the nucleoside diphosphate moiety of UDP-d-galactose strongly inhibit the enzymatic reaction whereas neutral hexoses or hexose phosphates produce little or no inhibition. The Km for UDP-d-galactose is 5.0 x 10-4 m, and that for d-glucose is 2.5 x 10-2 m."
https://openalex.org/W1485620510,Inactivation of transglutaminase by 14C-iodoacetamide is accompanied by a proportional uptake of 14C-carbamidomethyl. Incorporation of 1 mole of this group per mole of enzyme results in complete inactivation. Proteolytic digestion of 14C-carbamidomethyl-labeled enzyme yields two related radioactive peptides containing the S-(14C-carbamidomethyl)cysteinyl residue. The amino acid sequences of these peptides have been determined as Gly-Gln-S-(carbamidomethyl)cysteine-Trp and Tyr-Gly-Gln-S-(carbamidomethyl)cysteine-Trp.

Upon the addition of hydroperoxides, crystals of the enzyme were readily converted to those of Complex ES without modification of their crystalline form. As judged from their size, shape, and stability, these crystals of cytochrome c peroxidase and Complex ES appear to be a suitable material for biophysical studies of a single crystal."
https://openalex.org/W1561339713,"Abstract The extent of reduction of the disulfide groups in thyroglobulin by β-mercaptoethanol has been investigated as a function of pH in aqueous media and in 8 m urea. The products of reduction of thyroglobulin in dilute urea and in concentrated urea and guanidine solutions have been characterized by sedimentation and viscosity. Cleavage of a few disulfide bonds produces a smaller molecule of the same molecular weight as that obtained by quantitative reduction of all the bonds. On reduction in 5m guanidine, the 12 S subunit of thyroglobulin of ⅓ million molecular weight is cleaved into two equal or similar sized molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1552971764,"Abstract A detailed analysis is presented of the spectral changes produced in solutions of aminotransferases under the following experimental conditions: (a) the keto acid concentration is held constant; (b) the keto acid concentration; is made to be proportional to the free amino acid concentration; (c) no keto acid is added; (d) in places of keto acid, another amino acid substrate or substrate analogue is added which will react with either the phosphopyridoxal or phosphopyridoxamine form of the enzyme to form a complex absorbing at a unique wave length where neither free form absorbs. When these methods were used to determine the dissociation constants for glutamate and ketoglutarate complexes with the α isomer of the pig heart extramitochondrial glutamic-aspartic transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1), consistent results were obtained. erythro-β-Hydroxy-l-aspartate was shown to have a high affinity for the phosphopyridoxamine form of this enzyme. This behavior is unique, for neither l-aspartate nor l-glutamate reacts similarly. The phosphopyridoxamine form of the enzyme could be prepared, free of bound substrate, by dialysis first against radioactive glutamate and then against buffer. The spectra of enzyme-substrate complexes were compared for four different substrates. It is suggested that at least four species are indicated. If there are several species, the equilibria between them are not pH-sensitive. All of the results which were obtained were consistent with the pyridoxal-pyridoxamine enzyme hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1541395703,"Beef liver mitochondrial monoamine oxidase was purified as much as 58-fold by a procedure involving disruption of the mitochondria by homogenization and Triton X-100 treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, alumina gel Cγ treatment, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The procedure yielded preparations of the enzyme which were soluble and others which still required detergent for solubility in aqueous solutions. The substrate specificity, pH optimum, sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents, and other properties indicated that the purified enzyme is the classical mitochondrial monoamine oxidase. From the metal analyses of the purified preparations of the enzyme, it was demonstrated that the beef liver monoamine oxidase is a copper-containing protein. The purest preparations contained about 0.07% copper. Other metals known to be present in oxidative enzymes were present in insignificant amounts. The copper was shown to be in the cupric state. Known copper-chelating agents inhibited the enzyme, and cuprizone was shown to be a mixed inhibitor of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1523675443,"Abstract Stability constants for the manganese complexes of various components of the creatine kinase reaction, including possible buffers, have been determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). EPR and proton relaxation rate (PRR) studies indicated that such interaction as occurred between manganese and creatine kinase was nonspecific and relatively weak, unlike the interaction between manganese and pyruvate kinase (12). The maximum enhancement of the PRR induced by binding of manganese to the enzyme was estimated to be 1.5, and this was considerably reduced at high ionic strength. Enhancements of the PRR of 19.4 at 25 mc per sec for the ternary complex, creatine kinase-manganese-adenosine diphosphate, at pH 8.0 and 24° and of 9.8 at 25 mc per sec for creatine kinase-manganese-ATP at pH 7.5 and 24° were obtained. Values of the dissociation constants of the metal nucleotides from the ternary complexes were obtained with the use of PRR data alone or by a combination of PRR and EPR data. It was also possible to obtain estimates of the dissociation constants of the free nucleotides from their binary complexes with the enzyme. The values for the dissociation constants were in satisfactory agreement with those derived from a limited study of the activation of creatine kinase by manganese, consistent with the enzymatic reaction obeying equilibrium kinetics. The values agreed with the results obtained by J. F. Morrison and M. L. Uhr (personal communication) for the manganese-activated reaction and were similar to the dissociation constants obtained previously from kinetic and thermodynamic data with magnesium as the activating ion. It was concluded that the equilibria measured by magnetic resonance methods corresponded to the equilibria among the kinetically active species. Pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate also formed ternary complexes with low values of ϵt 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. No evidence could be found for the formation of ternary complexes with AMP, inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine or creatine. However, evidence for the formation of the abortive quaternary complex, manganese-ADP-creatine kinase-creatine, was obtained. The enhancement, ϵq, of the quaternary complex was less than ϵt under the conditions measured. The difference between ϵt and ϵq was found to increase as the temperature decreased, since the PRR of the ternary complex had a negative temperature coefficient and the PRR of the quaternary complex had a positive temperature coefficient. From the magnitude of the relaxation rates of the ternary and quaternary complexes and the magnitude and signs of the temperature coefficients, approximate calculations indicated that the large enhancement of PRR in these complexes results predominantly from the fact that the rotational motion of water in the coordination sphere of the metal ion is greatly hindered in both complexes. On the other hand, the decrease in the magnitude of the PRR between the ternary and quaternary complexes appears to be caused by a decrease in the rate of water exchange between the metal coordination sphere and the solvent for the quaternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1603571383,"Abstract When 1,2-propanediol-1-3H is converted to propionaldehyde in the presence of dioldehydrase and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide 5'-deoxyadenosine, 2 hydrogen atoms per mole of the coenzyme are replaced by tritium. The tritiated coenzyme so obtained transfers tritium to the product when it is added to unlabeled 1,2-propanediol and dioldehydrase. The coenzyme containing tritium at C-5' of the adenosyl moiety was prepared synthetically; when it was added to dioldehydrase and unlabeled 1,2-propanediol, all of the tritium initially present in the coenzyme was found in the propionaldehyde. From these results we concluded that the hydrogen transfer that occurs in the conversion of 1,2-propanediol to propionaldehyde involves two steps: transfer of hydrogen from C-1 to the carbon bonded to the cobalt of the coenzyme and, from this position, to C-2 of the product."
https://openalex.org/W1597903409,"An attempt has been made to determine the mechanisms involved in regulating citrate levels in the rat heart. Citric acid cycle intermediates have been measured in perfused and nonperfused hearts of normal and alloxan-diabetic rats. Levels of citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, and malate were found, in general, to be elevated by diabetes and by perfusion with octanoate, acetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate. Octanoate also caused a large increase in the concentration of acetyl coenzyme A. This latter effect was greatly diminished by anoxia, and anoxia likewise prevented any large effect of octanoate on citrate and isocitrate levels. In the absence of octanoate, anoxia resulted in a slight fall in citrate, no change in isocitrate, a 90% decrease in α-ketoglutarate, and a doubling of malate. The increased concentration of citrate in hearts perfused with octanoate was not dependent upon the presence of glucose or bicarbonate in the perfusion medium. In hearts perfused with 14C-bicarbonate the specific activity of citrate was many times that of malate, suggesting that the immediate product of CO2 fixation under these conditions was not oxalacetate or malate. Under all conditions in which fatty acids or β-hydroxybutyrate induced a rise in citrate there was a fall in aspartate and, in most instances, a rise in glutamate. In hearts perfused with 14C-aspartate, radioactivity was incorporated into citrate, and this incorporation was greatly increased when octanoate was added to the perfusion medium. It is concluded that elevated levels of citric acid cycle intermediates in hearts of diabetic rats and in normal hearts perfused with fatty acids and ketone bodies are due largely to increased availability of acetyl-CoA. It is proposed that the oxalacetate required for extra citrate synthesis is derived to a major extent from aspartate by transamination. Carbon dioxide fixation, perhaps by α-ketoglutarate or changes in the aconitase equilibrium, or both, may be factors in determining the citrate level. Altered activity of dehydrogenase enzymes associated with the cycle may also contribute to changes in the concentration of intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1584154675,"Abstract The manganese-enzyme-substrate complexes of a number of nucleoside diphosphate substrates of creatine kinase showed a range of enhanced values of the longitudinal proton relaxation rate of water with respect to the manganous aquocation, although the small enhancement factors, ϵa, of all the binary manganese-nucleotide complexes were the same, approximately 1.6. The order of the values of ϵt, the enhancement factor of the respective ternary enzyme-metal-substrate complexes, was: manganese-adenosine diphosphate (19.4) g Mn-3'-dADP (7.7) g Mn-2'-dADP (6.7) g manganese-inosine diphosphate (5) g manganese-guanosine diphosphate (4). This same order is observed for the maximum velocity of the enzymatic reaction with these substrates. There was no significant difference in the dissociation constants of the enzyme-metal-substrate complexes for the three manganese-adenine nucleotides. Values of ϵt for the nucleoside triphosphates were: MnATP (9.8) g Mn-2'-dATP (4.5) g MnGTP (3.7) g MnITP (3.2). The order of relative velocities was found to be MnATP g Mn-2'-dATP g MnITP g MnGTP. The relative effects of a number of substrates and inhibitors of creatine kinase on the rate of reaction between iodoacetic acid and the essential sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme was also investigated. Metal nucleoside diphosphates increased the —SH reactivity in the order M-ADP g M-2'-dADP g M-IDP g M-GDP, while the free nucleotides protected in the order ADP g 2'-dADP g IDP g GDP. Both the metal complexes and the free forms of nucleoside triphosphates protected creatine kinase against iodoacetic acid, although the effects were much greater for the free nucleotides. With both series of compounds, an order similar to that for the diphosphates was observed. The parallel order of the values of ϵt, the maximum velocities of the enzymatic reaction, and the rate constants for the iodoacetic acid reaction with the different metal-nucleotides may be ascribed to differing degrees of conformational change induced at the active site of creatine kinase. Thus, the properties of water in the coordination sphere of the manganese in the enzyme-metal-substrate complex as manifested by the enhancement of proton relaxation rate may be used as a probe to reveal changes in the conformation of the enzyme at its active site in the same way as the modification of the reactivity of the essential cysteine residues is used. With the latter criterion, the effect of binding free nucleotides and metal-nucleotides could be investigated and the observed rate constants for the reaction between iodoacetic acid and creatine kinase could be explained by induced conformational changes, which increased the accessibility of the —SH groups upon binding of metal nucleotides and decreased the accessibility of the —SH groups upon binding of the free nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1525881886,"Abstract The titration data of Antonini, Wyman, Brunori, Fonticelli, Bucci, and Rossi-Fanelli (1), for human and horse oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins, have been analyzed in a way that yields the number of groups which titrate in the pH region normally assigned to imidazole and α-amino groups. The results suggest the possibility that the group which differs between the oxy- and deoxyproteins above pH 6.5, which is the group linked to the alkaline Bohr effect, may be an α-amino group rather than an imidazole group, as has been assumed heretofore. The number of unavailable imidazole groups, which arise from histidine residues obliged to be in the uncharged state in the native protein, is about 4 per heme in human hemoglobin and about 3 per heme in horse hemoglobin. This is considerably smaller than the number of unavailable imidazoles in sperm whale myoglobin, and is also less than the number of unavailable imidazoles estimated for horse hemoglobin in previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W1572262714,"The specificity patterns of chymotrypsins in which the methionine residues have been converted to the sulfoxide have been examined relative to the native enzyme. When the surface methionine residue 3 residues away from the active serine is oxidized, the specificity pattern is quite similar to the native enzyme as judged by the relative rates of hydrolysis of ester and peptide substrates. When both methionine residues are oxidized to the sulfoxide, however, notable changes of the ratios occur. For example, the acetyltyrosinamide activity becomes undetectable, decreased by a factor of over 400, whereas the acetyltyrosine ethyl ester activity decreases by a factor of 4. The change in specificity is not related in a simple way either to a chemical property such as carbon-nitrogen versus the carbon-oxygen bond nor to the size of the substrate. Moreover, the binding properties for many substrates and all-or-none assay are changed very little. A plausible explanation for the observations is that the oxidation of the interior methionine residue does not change the basic catalytic power of the enzyme but does cause subtle changes in the relationship between substrate and enzyme which affects its specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1601974339,"Abstract With molar ratios of methylene blue to ribonuclease-S of 1:30, histidyl residues 105 and 119 are destroyed by photooxidation at approximately equal rates. The loss of histidine 119 results in complete loss of enzymic activity; the loss of 105 is without effect on the activity. Histidine-12 in RNase-S is photooxidized at a slower rate than 105 or 119 and slower than the same residue in S-Peptide. Apparently histidine-12 is partially protected in the RNase-S complex. Loss of histidine-12 in S-Peptide results in loss of potential activity. Photooxidation of S-Peptide causes the oxidation of methionine-13 to the sulfoxide as well as the destruction of histidine-12. The sulfoxide can easily be reduced to yield a derivative where the only change is in histidine-12. Monoiodination of histidine-12 in S-Peptide on carbon-2(4) also resulted in complete loss of potential activity. Estimates of ratio of S-Protein to S-Peptide derivative association constants relative to that for the unmodified peptide show reductions in affinity by factors of about 700 for methionine-13 sulfone, 1900 for photooxidized histidine-12, 3200 for 2(4)-iodohistidine-12. The loss of histidine-119 markedly lowers the affinity of S-Protein for native S-Peptide. The photooxidation reaction was carried out in the solid state on single crystals of RNase-S. The qualitative effects were identical with those seen in solution, although the overall rate was slower. A comparison of x-ray diffraction patterns of native and photooxidized crystals of RNase-S showed only slight intensity changes. There was no evidence of any disordering of the crystal lattice. It is tentatively concluded that only small general conformational changes can have occurred, and that the activity effects can probably be attributed directly to the loss of the imidazole residues."

Kinase-activating factor which is required for calcium activation of kinase and an inhibitory factor which prevents calcium activation were also partially purified. Kinase, kinase-activating factor, and inhibitory factor were each obtained essentially free of the other. The action of kinase-activating factor was proportional to protein concentration but was not strictly time-dependent. The activating factor appeared to act on kinase in a stoichiometric manner rather than catalytically. The activated enzyme, however, was unstable under the experimental conditions so that the variation of activation with time could have been the result of competing activation and inactivation. The action of the inhibitory factor was antagonized by activating factor. The data suggested that the action of the inhibitor was noncatalytic and that it interacted stoichiometrically with kinase-activating factor."

https://openalex.org/W1565649053,"β-Galactosidase was analyzed for NH2-terminal amino acids by the Sanger procedure. About two-thirds of a mole of threonine per 135,000 g was obtained, even with the use of dinitrophenyl-threonine-14C as internal control. The same result was obtained with protein treated by a variety of dissociating conditions before analysis. However, the Stark and Smyth carbamylation method yielded 1 mole of threonine per 135,000 g of protein. Labeled enzyme was prepared from a culture to which acetate-1-14C was added. Treatment with methanolic HCl and with Pronase showed that N-acetyl groups were absent from β-galactosidase. Carboxypeptidase A released no amino acid from denatured protein. Carboxypeptidase B removed 1 mole of lysine per 135,000 g, and lysine was shown to be the only COOH-terminal amino acid when performic acid-oxidized and carboxymethylated β-galactosidase were treated with carboxypeptidase B. The hydrazinolysis method also released lysine. On the basis solely of these end group studies, it seems possible that the β-galactosidase monomer is a single long chain."
https://openalex.org/W1863644735,"Abstract The location of the tyrosyl residues (there are no tryptophyl residues) in paramyosin was studied by solvent perturbation difference spectroscopy, with 20% polyhydroxy perturbants of increasing size from ethylene glycol to sucrose. Of the tyrosyl residues, 35% are not perturbed by any of the solvents, and an additional 10 to 15% apparently lie in crevices which are inaccessible to perturbants with diameters greater than 5 A (i.e. glycerol and larger molecules). These latter groups may be involved in the intermolecular aggregation phenomenon. Increasing concentrations of guanidine-HCl increase the magnitude of the denaturation blue shift in four steps. The first two of these steps coincide with the first two steps in the helix-coil transition and account for the exposure of about 68% of the 38 tyrosyl groups to the solvent. The remaining 12 tyrosyls are exposed in two steps during the breakdown of the final third of the helix and are considered to be the same 12 groups inaccessible to all perturbants. The ultraviolet optical rotatory properties of native α-helical paramyosin from 315 to 190 mµ were studied in detail. Statistical analyses of the Moffitt equation showed that it adequately describes the dispersion data in the 315 to 240 mµ region, if λ0 is taken as 220 mµ, until the molecule becomes less than 30% helical. Beyond that point the one-term Drude equation is sufficient. The Moffitt parameters are shown to be colinear with [m']232 for the whole helix-coil transition. By comparison with optical rotatory dispersion parameters for random polypeptides, paramyosin retains approximately 10% order in 7 m guanidine. Since this order cannot be destroyed by heating to 50° or by 8 m guanidine-HCl and the molecule refolds completely upon removal of the guanidine, hydrophobic interactions appear responsible for this order."
https://openalex.org/W1602068782,"Abstract A study has been made of the deoxyribonucleic acid primer requirements of partially purified deoxyribonucleic acid deoxynucleotidyltransferase fractionated from regenerating liver of the adult rat. Native, double stranded DNAs derived from either viral, bacterial, or mammalian sources serve more effectively as primers than either single stranded or heat-denatured DNAs for the incorporation of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates into polydeoxyribonucleotides. The highly ordered, helical, alternating, copolymer consisting of deoxyadenylate and deoxythymidylate residues was found to be the best primer tested. Destruction of the secondary structure of native DNA primers by either controlled acid or alkaline denaturation or by thermal means decreases priming activity. Additionally, changes in the primary structure of native DNA primers by limited enzymic treatment also altered their priming abilities. Crystalline bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease, which cleaves DNA to yield 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphoryl end groups, produced stimulation in priming activity, whereas bovine spleen and micrococcal endonucleases, which produce 3'-phosphoryl and 5'-hydroxyl termini, decrease the priming activity of native DNA primers. Heating and rapid cooling of the primers partially degraded enzymically results in a further reduction of priming activity."

Kinetic properties of the two enzymes differed slightly, but the differences did not appear sufficient to explain the marked difference in total activity (0.65:1.00) found in homozygous human red cells."
https://openalex.org/W1569848563,"Abstract Rigor mortis was induced in frog sartorii from female Rana pipiens by incubating the isolated muscles in 0.38 mm 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene Ringer's (frog) solution for 90 min at 0°. This compound completely inhibits adenosine triphosphatecreatine phosphotransferase in vivo and eventually induces rigor mortis as characterized by shortening of the muscle to 50% of its rest length and the development of stiffness. As the muscle began to shorten the rate of 45Ca efflux increased and the ATP level fell from 3.80 to 0.0 µmoles per g. There was a lack of correspondence between ATP breakdown and appearance of inorganic phosphate, which can be explained by leakage of inorganic phosphate from the muscle and by an increase in the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate. The frog sartorius muscle breaks down ATP during a working contraction and in the shortening phase of rigor mortis. There is no ATP requirement for tension maintenance in rigor mortis after the muscle has finished shortening."
https://openalex.org/W1524825181,"Abstract By exploiting the relatively slow hydration of acetaldehyde in neutral solutions of low ionic strength and the general acid-base catalysis of this hydration reaction, it is shown that the hydration of acetaldehyde does not precede its oxidation by xanthine oxidase. It follows that the aldehyde, per se, rather than its hydrate is the true substrate."

The enzyme catalyzes the following reaction: 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate ⇄ pyruvate + D-arabinose. Pyruvate was characterized chromatographically and with lactic acid dehydrogenase. D-Arabinose was characterized chromatographically and by its reactivity with L-fucose isomerase to form D-ribulose. The purified enzyme exhibited the following properties: pH optimum, 7; Michaelis constant = 6 x 10-3 M; and equilibrium constant = 0.077 M. The enzyme provides a convenient method for the preparation of specifically 14C-labeled 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate."
https://openalex.org/W1568110881,"Abstract When large quantities of androst-4-ene-3,17-dione were incubated with reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide and an acetone powder of sheep adrenal microsomes, 3β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-17-one and its Δ5 isomer were isolated and crystallized as their benzoates. The melting points and infrared spectra were in agreement with those of the corresponding standards. A similar incubation of unlabeled androst-5-ene-3,17-dione produced 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one in good yield. Since incubation of 3β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-17-one-3α-3H yielded nonradioactive 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one and androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, it was concluded that the isomerase did not act on the allylic alcohol. 3β-Hydroxyandrost-4-en-17-one-3α-3H and -3α-H were incubated simultaneously in the presence of diphosphopyridine nucleotide and an acetone powder of sheep adrenal microsomes for varying times. There was no measurable difference in the rates of oxidation of these two allylic alcohols."
https://openalex.org/W1556560371,Abstract Evidence is presented that tetrahydrofolate reacts chemically with 2-mercaptoethanol. The resulting product is more stable than tetrahydrofolate itself. The rate of decomposition of this derivative has been investigated. The possible sequences of interaction of tetrahydrofolate with 2-mercaptoethanol are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1503992474,"The inhibitory effects of oxygen and N-ethylmaleimide upon glycolysis and adenosine triphosphate accumulation in rat heart homogenate systems were studied. The main effect of N-ethylmaleimide was to inhibit ATP synthesis and thus to decrease the phosphorylation of glucose and fructose 6-phosphate. It is likely that this compound exerts its action by interfering with reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or electron transport. Oxygen at a pressure of 1 atm was found to inhibit glycolysis directly. The experiments provide strong evidence that the mechanism of this inhibitory effect of oxygen involves the inactivation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by oxidation of enzyme sulfhydryl groups. Depression of glycolysis by oxygen was prevented by reduced glutathione, cysteine, and dithiothreitol. Some protection against oxygen toxicity was afforded by ascorbic acid. Addition of dithiothreitol or reduced glutathione to a homogenate system inhibited by oxygen caused a reversal of the toxic effects of oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1604317747,"Abstract The antigenic constituents in activated and nonactivated rat pancreatic extracts have been demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis. Specific reactions with appropriate substrates have been used to identify and to localize the zymogens and their active forms on the immunoelectrophoretic diagrams. In the activated extracts, elastase, α-amylase, ribonuclease, carboxypeptidase B, chymotrypsin, and lipase have been identified as single antigens. Two immunologically distinct enzymes with carboxypeptidase A activity, as well as two others with trypsin activity, have been demonstrated. The following zymogens have been identified: one proelastase, one chymotrypsinogen, one procarboxypeptidase B and two immunologically distinct trypsinogens. The procarboxypeptidase A appears as two electrophoretic fractions with common antigenic properties. From the two trypsinogens derive two immunologically distinct trypsins. The procarboxypeptidase A gives rise after activation to two immunologically distinct carboxypeptidases A."
https://openalex.org/W1573851776,"Abstract 1. A method for the determination of photophosphorylation, which involves hydrogen ion change, has been applied to the phosphorylation associated with succinate oxidation by rotenone-treated mouse liver mitochondria. The determination of hydrogen ion uptake as a measure of adenosine diphosphate phosphorylation is considered valid since (a) the hydrogen ion uptake observed following ADP addition was completely inhibited by oligomycin, and (b) the values of ΔH+:ΔADP determined by adding a known amount of ADP and measuring pH change were in good agreement with the theoretical values obtained between pH 6.5 and 8.5. 2. The Sr++:ADP coefficient calculated from the quotient of Sr++:O and ADP:O was used to calculate an ADP:O corrected for energy leaks. A higher Sr++:O ratio was obtained in the presence of oligomycin, and, by application of the Sr++:ADP quotient to this ratio, a corrected ADP:O could be obtained, which is considered to represent better the potential for oxidative phosphorylation. 3. The stochiometry of proton ejection associated with Sr++ accumulation was also determined, and in phosphate medium the value of ΔH+:ΔSr++ was 0.67. In the absence of phosphate, the ratios were markedly dependent on the concentration of Sr++ and mitochondria. The optimal ratios were observed at a low Sr++ concentration under these conditions, and were approximately 1 with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane chloride medium. With tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine buffer, the ratios were as great as 2. Acetate shifted the optimal ratio to an even lower Sr++ concentration. These data were examined on the basis of current proposed models for the translocation of ions, and it was concluded that the intramitochondrial pH plays a primary role in the regulation of respiration and cation uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1674222787,"Abstract The 3'-nucleotidase present in mung bean sprouts was found to hydrolyze the 3'-monophosphates of adenosine, guanosine, uridine, and cytidine in the order 3'-AMP g 3'-GMP g 3'-UMP g 3'-CMP, and also to hydrolyze the 3'-phosphate group of coenzyme A, but showed no significant activity for 2'- or 5'-ribonucleotides or for several non-nucleotide phosphomonoesters. pH optima and the respective Km values for 3'-AMP, 3'-GMP, 3'-CMP, and 3'-UMP were determined. The 3'-nucleotidase and ribonuclease M2 were inactivated reversibly at pH 5 and by dialysis and irreversibly by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Inactivation of both enzymes at pH 5 could be largely prevented by the presence of Zn++, while several other metal ions were ineffective. The optimal concentrations of Zn++ for preventing inactivation were considerably different for the 3'-nucleotidase and RNase M2. The two enzyme activities were similarly inactivated by heat at pH 5 and 7.5. The pH optimum of RNase M2 was pH 5 with no Zn++ present, but dropped to pH 4.5 in the presence of 5 x 10-5 m Zn++, which also greatly increased its activity in the pH range 3.5 to 4.5. Several lines of evidence suggesting that the 3'-nucleotidase and RNase M2 activities may be due to the same protein are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1417846965,"Abstract The tryptic peptide comprising Residues 38 to 61 of oxidized bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A was isolated and shown to be convertible in part to a helical conformation in 2-chloroethanol- or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol-water mixtures. The characteristic trough in the optical rotatory dispersion spectrum near 233 mµ associated with the helical conformation of the peptide was progressively reduced by addition of each of 3 eq of cupric ion. The depth of the trough was regained quantitatively by addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate equivalent to the cupric ion present. The absorption and optical rotatory spectra of the cupricpeptide complexes are qualitatively similar to those of some smaller peptides in which chelation by amide nitrogen atoms of peptide bonds has been demonstrated. The points of similarity include absorption maxima in the range of 525 to 550 mµ and optically active bands near 330 mµ and 530 mµ. A Cotton effect centered near 260 mµ in the complexes of the ribonuclease peptide is more clearly resolved than in the previous studies with smaller peptides. These results are in keeping with contributions from binding sites at the NH2 terminus at the region of the histidine residue. Tentatively, the location of the third site is indicated from a molecular model to comprise members of the last 4, COOH-terminal residues. The effect of cupric ion binding on the helix content of the peptide is interpreted in terms of the conformational incompatibility of the chelate complexes with the α-helix. The observations do not support a strictly all-or-none metal-peptide interaction."

When sucrose phosphorylase is denatured after exposure to uniformly labeled sucrose-14C, the denatured protein contains firmly bound d-glucose or a compound derived from the d-glucose moiety of sucrose. The d-fructose moiety of sucrose is not bound to the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1540139239,"Abstract Substantial quantities of 2, 6-dichloroindophenol are bound to mitochondrial constituents. It is likely that binding is mediated by conjugation of dye to thiol groups, since reaction conditions favoring binding are completely analogous to conditions favorable for the conjugation of dye to isolated thiol compounds. Thus, procedures which promote the maintenance of reduced 2, 6-dichloroindophenol (addition of dl-β-hydroxybutyrate, KCN, antimycin A, rotenone, or ascorbate) inhibited the rate of conjugation. Addition of 2, 4-dinitrophenol favored the formation of oxidized dye and concomitantly promoted conjugation. The conjugation of dye was completely inhibited by addition of an amount of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate which corresponded well with the thiol content of mitochondria reported by others. Conjugation of dye with thiol groups readily accounts for certain inhibitory effects reported by others and indicates that 2, 6-dichloroindophenol may alter the properties of native systems. Thus much caution is warranted in the interpretation of studies in which 2, 6-dichloroindophenol, and other actual or potential quinoids are used."
https://openalex.org/W1487082848,"A nuclease has been isolated from an acid homogenate of chicken pancreas and purified over 300-fold. The purified preparation was free of phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase activity, but rapidly hydrolyzed ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. The enzyme which by several criteria was a single protein required Mg++ or Mn++ for activity; addition of excess ethylenediaminetetraacetate completely inhibited all of the nuclease action. The pH optimum for RNA was around 9.5 and for DNA around 8.8. The enzyme was found to be completely inactivated by heating for 10 min at 70°, but on heating at 80° from one-quarter to one-third of the activity was restored. There appeared to be no free sulfhydryl groups essential for enzyme activity. Iodoacetate at the proper concentration completely inhibited ribonuclease activity, but had little or no effect on deoxyribonuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1523207665,"Abstract The mechanism of action of l-gulonolactone oxidase has been studied by enzyme kinetic methods. Techniques have been developed for determining initial reaction rates above 1 atm of oxygen pressure. The data are consistent with the following sequence of reactions: (a) combination of the enzyme with l-gulono-γ-lactone; (b) reduction of the enzyme to produce ascorbic acid; (c) combination of the reduced enzyme with oxidant, which can be either oxygen or 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCI); and (d) oxidation to the original state. The substrate constants for l-gulono-γ-lactone, oxygen, and DCI have been computed for the above mechanism by means of nonlinear regression methods. In the presence of oxygen and DCI the enzyme decreased in activity as the oxygen pressure rose above 4 atm. This is consistent with there being two specific binding sites in close proximity to each other; each site binds only one of the two oxidants, oxygen or DCI, and inhibition occurs when both sites are occupied."
https://openalex.org/W1563339863,"Abstract The products of ribonuclease M2 action on tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid in the absence and presence of added Zn++ were fractionated by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and shown to consist of mixtures of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, higher oligonucleotides, and minor amounts of nucleosides. In the absence of added Zn++, the degradation of the RNA was relatively incomplete, with 27% of the total absorbance appearing in the mononucleotide fraction and a majority as di- and higher oligonucleotides. With added Zn++, 60% of the absorbance appeared in the mononucleotide fraction, 25% as dinucleotides, and 11% as higher oligonucleotides. The mononucleotide components both without and with added Zn++ were fractionated and identified as 5'-mononucleotides. Without added Zn++, about 60 mole % of the mononucleotide fraction was recovered as adenosine 5'-monophosphate and about 20 mole % each as uridine 5'-monophosphate and guanosine 5'-monophosphate, with no definite recovery of cytidine 5'-monophosphate (roughly two-thirds of the adenosine residues and about one-sixth each of the uridine and guanosine of tobacco mosaic virus RNA). With added Zn++, all of the adenosine residues were recovered as 5'-AMP (and adenosine); about one-half of the uridine and guanosine, respectively, as 5'-UMP and 5'-GMP; and about one-fifth of the cytidine, as CMP. The significance of these results in relation to the specificity of RNase M2 action, to the possible Zn++ metalloprotein nature of RNase M2, and to tobacco mosaic virus RNA structure is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1553659591,"Abstract The specificity of a chicken pancreas nuclease free from phosphodiesterase and nucleotidase activity was studied. The enzyme did not hydrolyze 2',3'-cyclic phosphates of guanosine, cytidine, or uridine. It rapidly hydrolyzed polyadenylate and more slowly polyuridylate, producing mainly di- and trinucleotides. Little or no mononucleotides were produced. Studies on hydrolysis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid suggested that the enzyme is mainly an endonuclease which forms short chain oligonucleotides (di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides) that terminate in 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl. There is little or no bond specificity. Exhaustive digests of RNA do produce some mononucleotides, but the rate of mononucleotide production is very slow. The properties of this pancreatic enzyme were compared to other nucleases."
