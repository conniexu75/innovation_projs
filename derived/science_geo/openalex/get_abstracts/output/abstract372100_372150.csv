https://openalex.org/W1999272982,"The methods currently available for diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral ischaemia still require further improvements. Micro-RNAs (small non-coding RNAs) have been recently reported as useful biomarkers in diseases such as cancer and diabetes. We therefore carried out microRNA (miRNA) profiling from peripheral blood to detect and identify characteristic patterns in ischaemic stroke.The ischaemic stroke patients aged between 18-49 years, characterized based on World Health Organization clinical criteria were further classified according to TOAST classification, a) Large-vessel atherosclerosis [n=8] b) Small-vessel disease [n=3] c) Cardioembolism [n=5] d) Undetermined cause [n=3]. The patients' functional status at the time of blood sampling (at the outpatient clinics) was evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Blood samples from normal (n=5) individuals were used as controls. Total RNA extracted from whole blood was subjected to miroRNA profiling and real-time PCR analysis. miRNAs that are implicated in the endothelial/vascular function, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and neural function showed differential expression profile as compared to the normal control. Interestingly, miRNAs that are involved in hypoxic conditions have also been found in our miRNA profiles.We demonstrate that the peripheral blood miRNAs and their profiles can be developed as biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral ischaemic stroke. The dysregulated miRNAs have been detectable even after several months from the onset of stroke in what is usually regarded as neurologically stable patients."

Although various components of the ECM have been enumerated, mechanisms that evolve the sophisticated ECM architecture remain to be addressed. Here we show that periostin, a matricellular protein, promotes incorporation of tenascin-C into the ECM and organizes a meshwork architecture of the ECM. We found that both periostin null mice and tenascin-C null mice exhibited a similar phenotype, confined tibial periostitis, which possibly corresponds to medial tibial stress syndrome in human sports injuries. Periostin possessed adjacent domains that bind to tenascin-C and the other ECM protein: fibronectin and type I collagen, respectively. These adjacent domains functioned as a bridge between tenascin-C and the ECM, which increased deposition of tenascin-C on the ECM. The deposition of hexabrachions of tenascin-C may stabilize bifurcations of the ECM fibrils, which is integrated into the extracellular meshwork architecture. This study suggests a role for periostin in adaptation of the ECM architecture in the mechanical environment.

Activation of cellular signaling by the ECM proteins has been investigated, whereas an importance of the ECM architecture has been underscored (1Cukierman E. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). It is quite certain that the diversity of three-dimensional configuration and connection of the ECM components invests the ECM architecture with multiple properties. Fibrillogenesis of the ECM takes place in the cell-matrix boundary, known as the matricellular space. The term “matricellular” was defined to denote a subset of ECM proteins whose properties could be distinguished from structural macromolecules and more bioactive proteins such as growth factors, cytokines, and proteases (2Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Several secreted proteins concentrated in the matricellular space are thought to be involved in ECM fibrillogenesis (3Bradshaw A.D. Puolakkainen P. Dasgupta J. Davidson J.M. Wight T.N. Helene Sage E.

At the beginning of this study, we focused on the myoseptum of zebrafish. The myoseptum, a connective tissue that transmits muscle contractile forces to bones and adjoining muscles, consists of collagen, fibronectin, tenascin-C, and periostin (5Kudo H. Amizuka N. Araki K.

Our previous study showed that targeted disruption of periostin causes disorganization of the myoseptum during zebrafish embryogenesis (5Kudo H. Amizuka N. Araki K. Inohaya K. Kudo A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In mammals, periostin is expressed in the connective tissues, such as periosteum (a fibrous sheath that covers the bone surface and is connected to muscle), periodontal ligament, aorta, and heart valve (9Horiuchi K.

Several groups including ours independently generated periostin−/− mice (11Kii I. Amizuka N. Minqi L. Kitajima S. Saga Y. Kudo A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We and others demonstrated that the rate of heart ruptures and death caused by acute myocardial infarction is higher in periostin−/− mice than in WT counterparts (13Oka T. Xu J. Kaiser R.A.

Sata M. Kudo A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Taken together, these previous studies in common suggest that periostin is involved in adaptation of the ECM architecture into the mechanical environment. To provide a mechanistic insight into the mechanical adaptation mediated by periostin, we investigated an involvement of tenascin-C. The expression profile of tenascin-C coincides with that of periostin (18Hamilton D.W. J. Cell Commun. Signal. 2008; 2: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Koyama E. Shimazu A. Leatherman J.L. Golden E.B. Nah H.D. Pacifici M. J. Orthop. Res. 1996; 14: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). tenascin-C−/− mice also develop normally, they are fertile, and no gross defects are found in their principal organ systems (20Saga Y. Yagi T. Ikawa Y. Sakakura T. Aizawa S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Tenascin-C is expressed in the infarcted myocardium (21Imanaka-Yoshida K. Hiroe M. Yoshida T. Histol. Histopathol. 2004; 19: 517-525PubMed Google Scholar) and has been suggested to be responsible for the tissue repair after myocardial injury (22Tamaoki M. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yokoyama K. Nishioka T. Inada H. Hiroe M. Sakakura T. Yoshida T. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which appears comparable to periostin. Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated that periostin directly binds to tenascin-C coated on a microtiter plate (23Takayama G. Arima K. Kanaji T. Toda S. Tanaka H. Shoji S. McKenzie A.N. Nagai H. Hotokebuchi T. Izuhara K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 118: 98-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These previous studies potently suggest that tenascin-C is involved in the mechanical adaptation mediated by periostin. In this study, we showed the extracellular meshwork architecture composed of substantial branched connections between tenascin-C hexabrachions and the ECM fibrils, and demonstrated that periostin functions as a bridge between tenascin-C and the ECM. Furthermore, we found that both periostin−/− mice and tenascin-C−/− mice exhibited confined tibial periostitis, which possibly corresponds to medial tibial stress syndrome in human sports injuries, suggesting a physiological role of the extracellular meshwork architecture. Rabbit anti-mouse periostin antibodies (anti-RD1 and anti-CT) were described previously (9Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M. Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J.

Rat monoclonal anti-mouse fibronectin antibody (A15-1) was generated previously in our laboratory. 3I. Kii, T. Nishiyama, M. Li, K.-i. Matsumoto, M. Saito, N. Amizuka, and A. Kudo, unpublished observation. Rabbit polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody Ab-10 (Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-type I collagen antibody (Novotec, Lyon, France), monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-tenascin-C antibody (Chemicon, Millipore, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-tenascin-C antibody 4F10TT (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Japan), mouse monoclonal anti-GM130 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), and rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody (ABR Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) were purchased as indicated. Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-labeled goat anti-mouse and rabbit antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rat antibody, as well as Alexa 488- or 568-labeled phalloidin, were obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor 647-labeled mouse anti-GM130 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (Pharmingen). The fibronectin expression vector (pAIFNBAC (24Manabe R. Ohe N. Maeda T. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) was provided by Dr. K. Sekiguchi. The tenascin-C expression vector was constructed by subcloning a murine tenascin-C cDNA (25Saga Y. Tsukamoto T. Jing N. Kusakabe M. Sakakura T. Gene. 1991; 104: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) into pSecTag2 (Invitrogen). Expression vectors for periostin and its deletion constructs were based on the pCAGIPuro backbone, which was provided by Dr. H. Niwa. The bicistronic expression vector pCAGIPuro was constructed by replacing the Zeocin-resistant gene of pPCAGIZ (26Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar) with the puromycin acetyltransferase gene. The substituted mutant Trp-65 → Ala and periostin-HA were also subcloned into the pMXs-puro vector, respectively. For generation of the domain deletion constructs, PCR-based domain replacements were performed. For the generation of the Trp-65 → Ala periostin construct, a pUC119 vector carrying C-terminal HA-tagged periostin cDNA was used as the template, and the substituted mutant form (Trp-65 → Ala) was created by site-directed mutagenesis. Internal complementary PCR primers used were the following: 5′-CCTGTAAGAACGCCTATCAAGGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCACCTTGATAGGCGTTCTTACAGG-3′. For the generation of HA-periostin, the internal PCR primers used were 5′-CAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAACCTGGACTGTTGGCATTTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GTGGCTCCGGTGGAAGTAACAGTTACTATGACAAGGTCCTG-3′. KOD plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was used for the PCR reaction. The PCR products were purified by electrophoresis gel extraction, self-ligated, and digested with DpnI before transformation. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the inserted cDNA. Standard methods were utilized to construct all plasmids. Full details will be provided upon request. Care and experiments with animals were in accordance with the guidelines of the animal care and use committees at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Generation of periostin−/− mice was described previously (14Shimazaki M. Nakamura K. Kii I. Kashima T. Amizuka N. Li M. Saito M. Fukuda K. Nishiyama T. Kitajima S. Saga Y. Fukayama M. Sata M. Kudo A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). tenascin-C−/− mice were generated as reported previously (20Saga Y. Yagi T. Ikawa Y. Sakakura T. Aizawa S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Calvarial osteoblast (COB) cells were prepared according to the standard collagenase method. The COB cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Inc., Lenexa, KS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. C3H10T1/2 cells, 293T cells, and Plat-E retrovirus-packaging cells (27Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar), were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs by using polyethyleneimine (Sigma-Aldrich (28Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar)). Cellular extracts were prepared with extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. Clarified lysates were incubated for 1 h with anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. COB cells were cultured for 3 weeks with α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, in which serum fibronectin had been depleted with gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Depletion of fibronectin was checked by Western blot (data not shown). Plat-E retrovirus-packaging cells were transfected with the retroviral vectors, respectively. The virus-containing medium was collected and filtrated. COB cells were infected with a viral supernatant containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h. The infected COB cells were cultured in the presence of 4 μg/ml puromycin (Nacalai Tesque) and then fluorescently stained. Purification of recombinant periostin proteins was described previously (29Takayama I. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biochem. 2009; 146: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/ml purified human tenascin-C proteins (Chemicon-Millipore) diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 5% BSA. Next, the plates were incubated with 12 μg/ml ΔEMIΔCTR-HA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, and washed with PBS. Bound ΔEMIΔCTR-HA was detected by using anti-HA antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The plates were washed, incubated with peroxidase substrate O-phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml) in 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 4.6), 0.003% H2O2 for 30 min, and then read at 490 nm. Cells were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After a wash with PBS, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml glycine in PBS to block free aldehyde groups for 10 min, and then with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. For observation of type I collagen, cells were fixed with cold acetone. After blocking with 1% BSA in TBS (pre-heated at 56 °C for 30 min) for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies in 1% BSA in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. Further incubation with an optimal dilution of fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies was performed for 1 h, followed by washing and post-fixation with 4% PFA. Nuclei were stained with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were collected on a laser-scanning confocal microscopy (FV1000-BX61, Olympus, Japan) with 40× UPlanApo numerical aperture 0.85 and 100× UPlanApo numerical aperture 1.35 objective lenses using imaging software (Fluoview version 1.6a, Olympus). Images were imported into Photoshop (version CS2, Adobe) for cropping and linear contrast adjustment. PLA was performed to visualize protein-protein interactions using fluorescent microscopy. In brief, oligonucleotide conjugated “probe” antibodies are directed against primary antibodies. Annealing of the probes occurs when the target proteins are in close proximity, which initiates the amplification of a reporter signals. C3H10T1/2 cells, which harbor an empty vector or periostin expression vector, were grown on coverslips with α-minimal essential medium/5% fetal bovine serum (fibronectin-depleted) for 1 week in a confluent condition. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min, blocked, and permeabilized with 1% BSA containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight with mouse anti-HA and rabbit anti-tenascin-C antibodies. A PLA was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Duolink Detection Kit with PLA PLUS and MINUS probes for rabbit and mouse antibodies (Olink Bioscience, Nacalai Tesque). For tissue preparation, mice were sacrificed after surgery under anesthesia, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS by transcardial perfusion and immediately immersed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C for 12 h. After a wash with PBS, the samples were decalcified in 10% EDTA solution at 4 °C for 3 weeks, and then were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol prior to embedding in paraffin. Series of 4- to 5-μm-thick paraffin sections were prepared for histological analysis or for immunostaining. For immunostaining of fibronectin, antigen-unmasking techniques with citrate buffer and signal amplification with the TSA (tyramide signal amplification) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were performed. Histological images were collected on a bright-field microscopy (Axioskop, Zeiss) with a charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam HRc, Zeiss), 20× Plan-Neofluar numerical aperture 0.50, and 40× Plan-Neofluar numerical aperture 0.75 objective lenses using imaging software (AxioVision Release 4.4, Zeiss). Images were imported into Photoshop (version CS2) for cropping. To take radiographs of 22- to 28-week-old WT (n = 15), periostin−/− (n = 22), and tenascin-C−/− (n = 6) mice, we used an x-ray imaging system, the μFX-1000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The skeletons were fixed in 4% PFA and were exposed to x-rays at 0.1 mA and 25 kV for 5 s. The radiographs were scanned with a BAS-2000 IP Reader (Fujifilm). Image analyses were performed with Photoshop (version CS2) for cropping and linear contrast adjustment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of 16-week-old WT and periostin−/− femurs and tibiae was performed as described previously (11Kii I. Amizuka N. Minqi L. Kitajima S. Saga Y. Kudo A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cortical bones of the femur dyaphysis of 14-week-old WT (n = 6) and periostin−/− mice (n = 6) were used. Femur metaphyses, bone marrow, and periosteum were removed. The periosteum was prepared from both tibias and femurs. Pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline, and total collagen content were determined by using the high-performance liquid chromatography method (30Saito M. Marumo K. Fujii K. Ishioka N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The alignment was constructed manually on the basis of the GENETYX-MAC (version 13.0.3) results. Protein names and GenBank™ identifiers were as follow: mouse periostin, NM_015784; human periostin, NM_006475; mouse βigh3, NM_009369; human βigh3, NM_000358; mouse Emid1, NM_080595; mouse Emid2, NM_024474; mouse Emilin1, NM_133918; mouse Emilin2, NM_145158; mouse Emilin3, NM_182840; and mouse Multimerin1, AK137556. Data were summarized as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by use of the unpaired t test (p values < 0.05 were considered significant). Periostin is expressed in periosteum of mice and human (9Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M. Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), which is a collagenous connective tissue surrounding the bone surface, and is connected to muscle. Bone histomorphometric analysis of periostin−/− mice was previously performed, indicating that overall bone contours are unaffected in the absence of periostin (12Rios H. Koushik S.V. Wang H. Wang J. Zhou H.M. Lindsley A. Rogers R. Chen Z. Maeda M. Kruzynska-Frejtag A. Feng J.Q. Conway S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11131-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether periosteum of the periostin−/− mice was intact, compared with that of the WT mice in detail. Histological sections showed no apparent abnormality of periosteum in the femur from the periostin−/− mice (supplemental Fig. S1). peripheral quantitative computed tomography analysis of cortical bone in the femur showed a decrease in the area and thickness of 84.4% and 86.5%, respectively, in periostin−/− mice (supplemental Table 1). However, the bone mineral density of the periostin−/− cortical bone was indistinguishable from that in the WT one (supplemental Table 1). We next examined the amount of collagen and of collagen cross-linkage in the cortical bone of femurs. The pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline (cross-linked peptides) content per mole of collagen was decreased in the periostin−/− femur, whereas the collagen content in the femur was not altered (Fig. 1A). The pyridinoline content was also decreased in the periostin−/− periosteum, compared with the WT counterpart (Fig. 1A). The deoxypyridinoline was not detected in periosteum from both the WT and periostin−/− mice (data not shown). These results of collagen deficiency in bone are consistent with those of previous studies on the infarcted myocardium and tendons (14Shimazaki M. Nakamura K. Kii I. Kashima T. Amizuka N. Li M.

To study collagen fibrillogenesis in the periostin−/− mice, we examined the ultrastructure of collagen fibrils in the femoral periosteum by TEM. The periosteum is composed of an osteoblastic layer and a fibrous layer (supplemental Fig. S2), and the cross-sections of collagen fibrils in the osteoblastic layer were examined at a higher magnification (Fig. 1B). Collagen fibrils were coarse and irregular in size and contour in the periostin−/− mice (Fig. 1B, −/−), in contrast to the regular and uniform fibrils in the WT mice (Fig. 1B, +/+). The aberrant nature of these fibrils appeared to be due to multiple and concurrent lateral fusions (Fig. 1B, −/−). These results indicate that collagen fibrillogenesis is disrupted in the periosteal osteoblasts of periostin−/− mice. The abnormality of the collagen fibrils probably indicates dysfunctions of the periosteum in the periostin−/− mice. We then scrutinized skeletal differences between WT and periostin−/− mice by soft x-ray analysis. We found ectopically mineralized deposits on the surface of the lower region of the tibia from 7-month-old periostin−/− mice (Fig. 1C, arrow). The ectopically mineralized deposit was observed in 20 periostin−/− mice (total of 22 periostin−/− mice); in contrast, this was observed in one WT mouse (total of 15 WT mice). Interestingly, these ectopically mineralized deposits were not found except in the lower region of periostin−/− tibia (data not shown). We then histologically examined the tibia from 20-week-old mice. Cross-sections of the lower one-third region of the tibia revealed a thickened periosteum and extra bone tissue on the cortical surface of the periostin−/− tibia, compared with the thin periosteum of the WT tibia (Fig. 1D). TEM analysis showed an increased number of cells that contained a large nucleus and massive cytoplasm in the periostin−/− periosteum (Fig. 1F), compared with the WT one (Fig. 1E). These characteristic features seen in the periostin−/− tibia appear as periostitis. To study an involvement of tenascin-C in the confined tibial periostitis of periostin−/− mice, we examined the in vivo deposition of tenascin-C proteins in the periosteum. We then stained paraffin-embedded sections of the femurs with hematoxylin and eosin, anti-fibronectin, anti-type I collagen, and anti-tenascin-C antibodies. Histological sections showed no apparent abnormality in the periostin−/− periosteum, compared with the WT counterpart (Fig. 2A). Immunolocalization of fibronectin and type I collagen also exhibited similar patterns between the WT and periostin−/− periosteum (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S3). A strong immunoreactivity for tenascin-C was detected throughout the osteoblastic layer in the WT periosteum (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a weak and scattered immunolocalization of tenascin-C was discernible in the periostin−/− periosteum (Fig. 2A, arrows). These results indicate that deletion of periostin reduced the deposition of tenascin-C on the ECM. To examine whether the confined tibial periostitis is due to the reduced deposition of tenascin-C in the periostin−/− periosteum, we examined the hind legs of 24-week-old tenascin-C−/− mice. Soft x-ray analysis also revealed ectopically mineralized deposits on the surface of the lower region of the tibia in five tenascin-C−/− mice (total of six tenascin-C−/− mice) (Fig. 2B, arrow). Cross-sections of the lower one-third region of the tibia in tenascin-C−/− mice showed a thickened periosteum surrounding the tibialis muscle and ectopically mineralized bone on the cortical surface of the tibia (Fig. 2D). Thus, the reduced deposition of tenascin-C on the ECM architecture is likely to be involved in the development of the tibial periostitis in periostin−/− mice. To investigate effects of the lack of periostin and reduced deposition of tenascin-C, we scrutinized the ECM architecture. Because there is a definite ceiling on histological analysis in vivo, we visualized the ECM architecture by staining an in vitro cell culture with an anti-fibronectin antibody. The ECM architecture is constructed from a framework of fibronectin"
https://openalex.org/W2001103978,"In cancer cells, glucose is often converted into lactic acid, which is known as the 'Warburg effect'. The reason that cancer cells have a higher rate of aerobic glycolysis, but not oxidative phosphorylation, remains largely unclear. Herein, we proposed an epigenetic mechanism of the Warburg effect. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 (FBP1), which functions to antagonize glycolysis was downregulated through NF-kappaB pathway in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. Restoration of FBP1 expression suppressed anchorage-independent growth, indicating the relevance of FBP1 downregulation in carcinogenesis. Indeed, FBP1 was downregulated in gastric carcinomas (P<0.01, n=22) and gastric cancer cell lines (57%, 4/7). Restoration of FBP1 expression reduced growth and glycolysis in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, FBP1 downregulation was reversed by pharmacological demethylation. Its promoter was hypermethylated in gastric cancer cell lines (57%, 4/7) and gastric carcinomas (33%, 33/101). Inhibition of NF-kappaB restored FBP1 expression, partially through demethylation of FBP1 promoter. Notably, Cox regression analysis revealed FBP1 promoter methylation as an independent prognosis predicator for gastric cancer (hazard ratio: 3.60, P=0.010). In summary, we found that NF-kappaB functions downstream of Ras to promote epigenetic downregulation of FBP1. Promoter methylation of FBP1 can be used as a new biomarker for prognosis prediction of gastric cancer. Such an important epigenetic link between glycolysis and carcinogenesis partly explains the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W2020097689,"Background Several genome-wide association studies have recently linked a group of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 9p21 region with cardiovascular disease. The molecular mechanisms of this link are not fully understood. We investigated five different expression microarray datasets in order to determine if the genotype had effect on expression of any gene transcript in aorta, mammary artery, carotid plaque and lymphoblastoid cells. Methodology/Principal Findings After multiple testing correction, no genes were found to have relation to the rs2891168 risk genotype, either on a genome-wide scale or on a regional (8 MB) scale. The neighbouring ANRIL gene was found to have eight novel transcript variants not previously known from literature and these varied by tissue type. We therefore performed a detailed probe-level analysis and found small stretches of significant relation to genotype but no consistent associations. In all investigated tissues we found an inverse correlation between ANRIL and the MTAP gene and a positive correlation between ANRIL and CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Conclusions/Significance Investigation of relation of the risk genotype to gene expression is complicated by the transcript complexity of the locus. With our investigation of a range of relevant tissue we wish to underscore the need for careful attention to the complexity of the alternative splicing issues in the region and its implications to the design of future gene expression studies."
https://openalex.org/W2014838450,"Activation of the cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB(2)) reduces ischemic injury in several organs. However, the mechanisms underlying this protective action are unclear. In a mouse model of ischemic stroke, we show that the CB(2) agonist JWH-133 (1 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1)) decreases the infarct size measured 3 d after onset of ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of JWH-133 was lost in CB(2)-deficient mice, confirming the specificity of JWH-133. Analysis of bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that bone marrow-derived cells mediate the CB(2) effect on ischemic brain injury. CB(2) activation reduced the number of neutrophils in the ischemic brain as shown by FACS analysis and by measuring the levels of the neutrophil marker enzyme myeloperoxidase. Indeed, we found in vitro that CB(2) activation inhibits adherence of neutrophils to brain endothelial cells. JWH-133 (1 microM) also interfered with the migration of neutrophils induced by the endogenous chemokine CXCL2 (30 ng/ml) through activation of the MAP kinase p38. This effect on neutrophils is likely responsible for the neuroprotection mediated by JWH-133 because JWH-133 was no longer protective when neutrophils were depleted. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that by activating p38 in neutrophils, CB(2) agonists inhibit neutrophil recruitment to the brain and protect against ischemic brain injury.-Murikinati, S., Jüttler, E., Keinert, T., Ridder, D. A., Muhammad, S., Waibler, Z., Ledent, C., Zimmer, A., Kalinke, U., Schwaninger, M. Activation of cannabinoid 2 receptors protects against cerebral ischemia by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2064821628,"Radiotherapy is increasingly used in the treatment of joint diseases, but limited information is available on the effects of radiation on cartilage. Here, we characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to cellular senescence in irradiated primary cultured articular chondrocytes. Ionizing radiation (IR) causes activation of ERK, in turn generating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) with induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity. ROS activate p38 kinase, which further promotes ROS generation, forming a positive feedback loop to sustain ROS-p38 kinase signaling. The ROS inhibitors, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and GSH, suppress phosphorylation of p38 and cell numbers positive for SA-β-gal following irradiation. Moreover, inhibition of the ERK and p38 kinase pathways leads to blockage of IR-induced SA-β-gal activity via reduction of ROS generation. Although JNK is activated by ROS, this pathway is not associated with cellular senescence of chondrocytes. Interestingly, IR triggers down-regulation of SIRT1 protein expression but not the transcript level, indicative of post-transcriptional cleavage of the protein. SIRT1 degradation is markedly blocked by SB203589 or MG132 after IR treatment, suggesting that cleavage occurs as a result of binding with p38 kinase, followed by processing via the 26 S proteasomal degradation pathway. Overexpression or activation of SIRT1 significantly reduces the IR-induced senescence phenotype, whereas inhibition of SIRT1 activity induces senescence. Based on these findings, we propose that IR induces cellular senescence of articular chondrocytes by negative post-translational regulation of SIRT1 via ROS-dependent p38 kinase activation.

https://openalex.org/W2083031173,"TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) has been recently identified as a major component of the ubiquitinated inclusions found in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, diseases that are collectively termed TDP-43 proteinopathies. Several amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked mutations of the TDP-43 gene have also been identified; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the neurodegeneration remain unclear. To investigate the biochemical characteristics of TDP-43, we examined truncation, isoforms, and cytoplasmic inclusion (foci) formation using TDP-43-expressing cells. Under apoptosis, caspase-3 generates two 35-kDa (p35f) and 25-kDa (p25f) fragments. However, in caspase-3(−/−) cells, novel caspase-3-independent isoforms of these two variants (p35iso and p25iso) were also detected under normal conditions. With a deletion mutant series, the critical domains for generating both isoforms were determined and applied to in vitro transcription/translation, revealing alternate in-frame translation start sites downstream of the natural initiation codon. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that p35 (p35f and p35iso) expression leads to the formation of stress granules, cellular structures that package mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during cell stress. After applying proteasome inhibitors, aggresomes, which are aggregates of misfolded proteins, were formed in the cytoplasm of cells expressing p35. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the 35-kDa isoforms of TDP-43 assemble in stress granules, suggesting that TDP-43 plays an important role in translation, stability, and metabolism of mRNA.

ALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, and although the vast majority of ALS cases are sporadic (sALS), almost 10% appear to be familial (fALS). Although mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) have been detected in 20% of fALS patients (1Shaw C.E. Enayat Z.E. Chioza B.A. Al-Chalabi A. Radunovic A. Powell J.F. Leigh P.N. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 43: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the cause of sALS and fALS not associated with SOD-1 remains unclear. Recently, two research groups have identified TDP-43 as a major component of ubiquitinated neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions identified in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), as well as in sALS (2Neumann M.

Missense mutations in TDP-43 have been found in autosomal dominant ALS families, suggesting that mutant TDP-43 may be a primary cause of motor neuron degeneration (4Van Deerlin V.M. Leverenz J.B.

Importantly, pathological analysis revealed that abnormal accumulation of TDP-43 does not occur in fALS cases with SOD-1 mutations, suggesting that the pathological process in sALS is distinct from those associated with SOD-1 mutations. Currently, FTLD-U, sALS, and fALS-linked TDP-43 mutations are classified together as TDP-43 proteinopathies (10Neumann M. Kwong L.K. Sampathu D.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Arch.

Wu F. Harrich D. García-Martínez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that TDP-43 is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and survival motor neuron (SMN) (12Buratti E. Dörk T.

Loss of functional TDP-43 is known to affect nuclear membrane stability and induce apoptosis via phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (14Ayala Y.M. Misteli T. Baralle F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3785-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Limited biochemical evidence has demonstrated the mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Using phosphorylation-specific antibodies, Hasegawa et al. demonstrated that TDP-43 is abnormally phosphorylated in the brain tissue of FTLD-U and ALS patients (15Hasegawa M. Arai T. Nonaka T. Kametani F. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Beach T.G. Buratti E. Baralle F. Morita M. Nakano I. Oda T. Tsuchiya K. Akiyama H. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. focused on proteolytic cleavage and demonstrated that caspase-3 can mediate cleavage of TDP-43 to generate 25- and 35-kDa fragments when progranulin (a candidate gene for familial FTLD-U) is down-regulated (16Zhang Y.J.

They also reported that the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 leads to the formation of toxic cytoplasmic inclusions within cells (17Zhang Y.J. Xu Y.F. Cook C. Gendron T.F. Roettges P. Link C.D. Lin W.L. Tong J. Castanedes-Casey M. Ash P. Gass J. Rangachari V. Buratti E. Baralle F. Golde T.E. Dickson D.W. Petrucelli L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). More recently, Igaz et al. identified the cleavage site for the lowest molecular mass TDP-43 CTF (∼22 kDa) in cortical urea extracts of FTLD-U brain and demonstrated that this fragment can recapitulate some of the pathological features of TDP-43 proteinopathy (18Igaz L.M. Kwong L.K. Chen-Plotkin A. Winton M.J. Unger T.L. Xu Y. Neumann M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8516-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, little is still known about the biochemical process of the generation of truncated forms of TDP-43 and the characteristics of cytoplasmic inclusion formation of these fragments.In this study, we first verified the caspase-3-dependent generation of CTFs of TDP-43 protein (p35f and p25f), which were abolished in caspase-3(−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, we identified two novel caspase-3-independent isoforms (p35iso and p25iso). Site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro transcription/translation revealed that these isoforms were generated from an alternative translation start site. Our results also show that the p35 forms of TDP-43 (p35f and p35iso) accumulate in two types of cytoplasmic foci, stress granules (SGs) under normal conditions and aggresomes under proteasome inhibition. These findings reveal novel biochemical properties of the TDP-43 protein and suggest the possibility that RNA quality control via the function of SGs is involved in the development of TDP-43 proteinopathy.DISCUSSIONA number of studies have shown that truncation of accumulated neurotoxic proteins associated with neurodegeneration, including the amyloid precursor protein, polyglutamine, and Tau, is critical for neurodegeneration processes (41Sisodia S.S.

Zhang et al. have suggested that proteolytic cleavage generates the 25- and 35-kDa CTFs present in cultured cells, leading to redistribution of TDP-43 from its nuclear location to the cytoplasm and is associated with cell death through a toxic gain of function (16Zhang Y.J.

Furthermore, Sreedharan et al. have demonstrated that a mutation linked to fALS enhanced fragmentation of TDP-43 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (5Sreedharan J. Blair I.P. Tripathi V.B. Hu X. Vance C.

Our study identified TDP-43 variant forms: two caspase-3-dependent fragments and two novel isoforms. Under normal conditions, the novel isoforms, p35iso (aa 85–414) and p25iso (aa ∼170–414), are translated from methionine 85 and aa 160–169, respectively, and apoptosis generates two fragments, p35f and p25f, via caspase-3 activation.The N-terminal amino acids of p25f and p25iso remain unclear. Based on the prediction of caspase-3 cleavage consensus sites (DXXD), p25f should comprise aa 220–414, with a molecular weight of appropriate 19,719, which is obviously smaller than 25 kDa. However, electromobility of overexpressed aa 170–414 (molecular weight: 25,635) of cDNA was compatible to that of the endogenous 25-kDa fragments seen on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3H). Fig. 2 (B and C) shows no discrepancy in the size between p25f and p25iso on SDS-PAGE. Moreover, well characterized monoclonal anti-TDP-43 antibody, 2E2-D3, could not recognize aa 208–414 and the smaller C-terminal residues of human TDP-43 (26Zhang H.X. Tanji K. Mori F. Wakabayashi K. Neurosci. Lett. 2008; 434: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but could detect both endogenous p25f and p25iso (Fig. 2C), indicating that the N terminus of p25f and p25iso is further upstream than previously reported (16Zhang Y.J.

Therefore, we suggest that DVMD (aa 216–219) may not be the true cleavage site of TDP-43 for generation of p25f and that additional unknown protease(s) activated by caspase-3 may generate p25f under apoptosis. We cannot however exclude the other possibility that p25iso and p25f are identical and caspase-3-dependent signaling suppresses degradation and/or enhances translation of p25iso, resulting in the accumulation of p25iso under staurosporine treatment.Recently, Igaz et al. have reported two major fragments of ∼22 and 24 kDa that were recognized in immunoprecipitation studies using an anti-TDP-43 antibody and cortical extracts of FTLD-U brain tissue (18Igaz L.M. Kwong L.K. Chen-Plotkin A. Winton M.J. Unger T.L. Xu Y. Neumann M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8516-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Both this group and Nonaka et al. identified several cleavage sites (aa 208, 219, and 247) for generation of the smaller 22-kDa CTF of TDP-43 by protein sequencing (18Igaz L.M. Kwong L.K.

As several smaller fragments (<25 kDa) appear following longer exposure in this study (Fig. 1A), several cleavage sites as well as alternate initial codons appear to exist within aa 160–250 for generating smaller fragments and isoforms.Another important finding was the characterization of TDP-43-containing IBs that appear in cells expressing p35. Two distinct IBs (IBPI and IBNC) were identified in either the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitors. IBPI demonstrated properties similar to aggresomes, which are formed by the assembly of misfolded proteins at the MTOC, and contained the redistributed intermediate filament protein vimentin in addition to other pathogenic proteins including mutant forms of huntingtin, α-synuclein, parkin, and prion (29Kopito R.R.

As IBPI was strongly positive for pS409/410, this inclusion appeared to be suitable for the pathological accumulation of TDP-43 in FTLD-U and ALS brain tissue. Our findings also showed that IBNC contains well established components of SGs, including G3BP, PABP, and HuR (22Ohn T. Kedersha N. Hickman T. Tisdale S. Anderson P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 38Kedersha N. Anderson P. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). SGs, which are induced by stress events, including hypoxia, heat shock, and arsenite, are multimolecular aggregates present in the cytosol and are responsible for the recruitment of ribonucleoprotein and mRNA. SGs are thought to function in the protection of mRNA against harmful stress events and to arrest translation, preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins (36Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M.

Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We found that p35 forms a part of these SGs and may facilitate the assembly of SGs when overexpressed, similar to other SG-associated proteins: G3BP, TIA-1/TIAR, and SMN (38Kedersha N. Anderson P. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 47Tourrière H. Chebli K. Zekri L. Courselaud B. Blanchard J.M. Bertrand E. Tazi J. J.

Although further studies are needed to determine whether p35-induced SGs contribute to RNA stability and regulation of translation, our findings suggest that p35f and p35iso are involved in RNA quality control under cellular stress via the function of SGs.Fig. 11 outlines our hypothetical model of the relationship between SGs and the variant forms of TDP-43. Full-length TDP-43 is located in the nucleus of the cell and functions as a splicing regulator. p35iso is translated from an alternate initiation codon, and p35f is generated by caspase-3 under apoptosis. As both are localized to the cytoplasm but lack the NLS, they subsequently form aggregates with a structure comparable to intracellular inclusions pathologically observed in the brain tissue of FTLD-U and ALS patients. p35 is also involved in SG formation. Recent evidence suggests that pathological aggregations of toxic proteins, including polyglutamine, and that β-amyloid are not directly linked to pathogenesis and rather might be neuroprotective (50Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 51Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S.

Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar), inappropriate SG assembly may be induced by p35, thereby chronically disturbing RNA stability and translation arrest, which is a key process of pathogenesis, compared with pathological aggregations such as neuronal cytoplasmic and skein-like inclusions in TDP- 43 proteinopathy. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that SMN, a protein associated with autosomal recessive motor neuron disease and spinal muscular atrophy, facilitates SG formation, and that loss-of-function of SMN in motor neurons may influence neurodegeneration via the disruption of RNA stability through SG function (49Hua Y. Zhou J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that editing of the RNA of GluR2, a subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor, is markedly decreased in the motor neurons of sALS patients (55Kawahara Y. Ito K. Sun H. Aizawa H. Kanazawa I. Kwak S. Nature. 2004; 427: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 56Nishimoto Y. Yamashita T. Hideyama T. Tsuji S. Suzuki N. Kwak S. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 61: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, dysfunction of RNA quality control systems may be a common feature of the pathological processes occurring in the development of motor neuron diseases.Further investigations are required to determine whether fALS-linked mutant TDP-43 affects the formation and RNA metabolism of SGs. Moreover, although future studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, our study contributes significantly toward a greater understanding for the treatment of the serious neurological diseases ALS and FTLD-U.

ALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, and although the vast majority of ALS cases are sporadic (sALS), almost 10% appear to be familial (fALS). Although mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) have been detected in 20% of fALS patients (1Shaw C.E. Enayat Z.E. Chioza B.A. Al-Chalabi A. Radunovic A. Powell J.F. Leigh P.N. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 43: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the cause of sALS and fALS not associated with SOD-1 remains unclear. Recently, two research groups have identified TDP-43 as a major component of ubiquitinated neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions identified in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), as well as in sALS (2Neumann M.

We aimed to identify methods for increasing male involvement in antenatal VCT and determine male correlates of accepting couple counseling in these settings.We invited women presenting to a Nairobi antenatal clinic to return with their male partners for individual or couples VCT. Male attitudes towards VCT and correlates of accompanying female partners to antenatal clinic and receiving couple counseling were determined. Of 1,993 women who invited their partner, 313 (16%) returned with their partners to ANC. Men attending antenatal clinic were married (>99%), employed (98%), and unlikely to report prior HIV testing (14%). Wanting an HIV test (87%) or health information (11%) were the most commonly cited reasons for attending. Most (95%) men who came to antenatal clinic accepted HIV testing and 39% elected to receive counseling as a couple. Men who received counseling with partners were younger, had fewer children, and were less knowledgeable about prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) than those who received counseling individually (p<0.05). Only 27% of men stated they would prefer HIV testing at a site other than the ANC. There was agreement between male and female reports for sociodemographic characteristics; however, men were more likely to report HIV preventive behaviors and health communication within the partnership than their partners (p<0.05).Offering VCT services to men at antenatal clinic with options for couple and individual counseling is an important opportunity and acceptable strategy for increasing male involvement in PMTCT and promoting male HIV testing."

https://openalex.org/W2056186845,"In mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents anaphase onset until all chromosomes have been attached to the spindle microtubules and aligned correctly at the equatorial metaphase plate. The major checkpoint proteins in mitosis consist of mitotic arrest-deficient (Mad)1-3, budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (Bub)1, Bub3, and monopolar spindle 1(Mps1). During meiosis, for the formation of a haploid gamete, two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation occur with only one round of DNA replication. To pull homologous chromosomes to opposite spindle poles during meiosis I, both sister kinetochores of a homologue must face toward the same pole which is very different from mitosis and meiosis II. As a core member of checkpoint proteins, the individual role of Bub3 in mammalian oocyte meiosis is unclear. In this study, using overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches, we analyzed the role of Bub3 in mouse oocyte meiosis. Our data showed that overexpressed Bub3 inhibited meiotic metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing homologous chromosome and sister chromatid segregations in meiosis I and II, respectively. Misaligned chromosomes, abnormal polar body and double polar bodies were observed in Bub3 knock-down oocytes, causing aneuploidy. Furthermore, through cold treatment combined with Bub3 overexpression, we found that overexpressed Bub3 affected the attachments of microtubules and kinetochores during metaphase-anaphase transition. We propose that as a member of SAC, Bub3 is required for regulation of both meiosis I and II, and is potentially involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment in mammalian oocytes."

Intracellular staining for Foxp3 was performed by using a Foxp3 staining kit (eBioscience). Also, after differentiation, cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 overnight and cytokines were measured in the cell-free culture supernatants by ELISA. Total RNA was prepared from T cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen), and gene expression was examined with a Bio-Rad iCycler optical system using iQTM SYBR green real-time PCR kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).

Cells were incubated for 16 h with complete medium and then for 24 h with 0.5% fetal bovine serum-containing medium. Then luciferase activity was analyzed with a Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by Renilla-luciferase activity. Expression vectors encoding Myc-Smad3, FLAG-RORγt, and His-TGF-βRI T202D were transfected into HEK293T cells. After 48 h, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (5.Yang X.O. Nurieva R. Martinez G.J. Kang H.S. Chung Y. Pappu B.P. Shah B.

Equivalent amounts of protein from whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG-M2 or anti-c-Myc. To better understand the role of the TGF-β signaling pathway in the induction of Th17 and Treg cell differentiation, we utilized mice deficient in Smad3 (10.Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mice exhibit normal CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels in vivo (data not shown). Similar to mice with a deletion of Smad4 in T cells (5.Yang X.O. Nurieva R. Martinez G.J. Kang H.S. Chung Y. Pappu B.P. Shah B. Chang S.H. Schluns K.S. Watowich S.S. Feng X.H. Jetten A.M. Dong C. Immunity. 2008; 29: 44-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), Smad3 KO mice exhibited normal numbers of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ natural Treg (nTreg) cells in spleen, peripheral lymph nodes, and mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 1, A and B). However, Smad3-deficient mice also displayed a significant decrease of Treg cells in thymus. When their functions were assessed, peripheral nTregs from Smad3-deficient mice were as suppressive as WT nTreg cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, these results indicate that Smad3 is not required for nTreg cell suppressive activity. We then examined whether Smad3 is necessary for the induction of iTreg cells. Naive T cells were isolated from Smad3 KO or WT mice by FACS sorting and stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of TGFβ. Smad3-deficient naive T cells had a profound defect on Foxp3 expression upon iTreg induction (Fig. 1, D and E). Moreover, induction of Treg-associated genes such as GPR83 and Ecm1 were also affected in Smad3-deficient T cells when compared with WT counterparts (Fig. 1E). Thus, these results indicate that Smad3 regulates the induction of Foxp3 and iTreg-associated genes. Because TGF-β also regulates the differentiation of Th17 cells, we addressed the role of Smad3 in the generation of Th17 cells. When naive cells were activated in the presence of TGF-β and IL-6, enhanced IL-17-producing cells were detected in Smad3-deficient cells (Fig. 2A). Gene expression profile analysis by real-time RT-PCR indicated an increase not only in IL-17A but also in IL-17F, CCR6, and CCL20 mRNA levels in Smad3-deficient cells when compared with WT counterparts (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Interestingly, no difference was observed in IL-21 or IL-22 expression, supporting that they are not regulated by TGF-β. Furthermore, when cells were restimulated with anti-CD3, enhanced IL-17 and IL-17F but not IL-21 cytokine production was observed (data not shown). Moreover, a slight increase in RORα and a decrease in AHR and IRF4, but no significant change in RORγt, were detected in Smad3-deficient Th17 cells when compared with WT cells (Fig. 2B). We have recently demonstrated that IL-1 in combination with IL-6 and IL-23 is able to initiate Th17 genetic programming. However, this Th17-polarizing condition still requires endogenous, low levels of TGF-β (11.Chung Y. Chang S.H. Martinez G.J. Yang X.O. Nurieva R. Kang H.S. Ma L. Watowich S.S. Jetten A.M. Tian Q. Dong C. Immunity. 2009; 30: 576-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether Smad3 deficiency would affect Th17 differentiation under low TGF-β concentrations, naive T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of two Th17-polarizing conditions. Interestingly, although TGF-β and IL-6 stimulation led to increased Th17 differentiation in Smad3-deficient cells, the combination of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23 stimulation induced similar numbers of IL-17-producing cells in both WT and KO T cells (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that Smad3 is required in the presence of high doses of TGF-β during Th17 differentiation. To assess that hypothesis, naive T cells from either WT or KO mice were stimulated with increasing concentrations of TGF-β in the presence of IL-6 and neutralizing antibodies against IFN-γ and IL-4. At low TGF-β concentrations, similarly low levels of IL-17-producing cells were observed between WT and KO cells. However, with increasing concentrations of TGF-β, Smad3-deficient cells had higher numbers of IL-17-producing cells when compared with WT counterpart (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, enhanced IL-17-producing cells were observed in Smad3-deficient T cells at TGF-β concentrations that were not sufficient to induce Foxp3 expression (Fig. 2C and data not shown), suggesting that the inhibitory role of Smad3 on Th17 cells was not dependent on Foxp3 induction. Because Smad3-deficient T cells exhibited enhanced capability to differentiate into IL-17-producing T cells independent of Foxp3 gene induction and given that RORγt levels were not affected in Smad3 KO T cells when compared with WT T cells, we next analyzed the regulation of RORγt function by Smad3. For that purpose, HEK293T cells were transfected with an RORE luciferase reporter vector (5.Yang X.O. Nurieva R. Martinez G.J. Kang H.S. Chung Y. Pappu B.P. Shah B. Chang S.H. Schluns K.S. Watowich S.S. Feng X.H. Jetten A.M. Dong C. Immunity. 2008; 29: 44-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of RORγt with or without a constitutively active Smad3-expressing vector. Although RORγt alone induced luciferase activity, co-expression of increasing concentrations of Smad3 significantly reduced its activity (Fig. 3A). Given that Smad3 is able to inhibit RORγt transcriptional activity, we next examined the interaction of Smad3 with RORγt using co-immunoprecipitation. We found that Smad3 was able to bind RORγt when co-expressed in HEK293T cells, and this binding was enhanced upon co-expression of a constitutively active form of rat TGF-βRI (TGF-βRI T202D) (12.Feng X.H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), suggesting that phosphorylation of Smad3 might enhance its affinity to RORγt. To analyze the role of Smad3 in Th17 cell generation in vivo, Rag1 KO mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells from WT or Smad3 KO mice. After 8 weeks, mice were immunized with MOG peptide emulsified in CFA. 7 days later, splenocytes and draining lymph node cells were harvested from the immunized mice and restimulated with MOG peptide for 3 days. After MOG immunization, enhanced IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22 production was detected in Rag1 KO mice reconstituted with Smad3-deficient bone marrow cells when compared with those with WT counterparts (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the expression of IFN-γ was not significantly different between the two groups of animals. Taken together, these results indicate that Smad3 deficiency enhanced Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we have investigated the role of Smad3 in the generation of iTreg and Th17 cells. Smad3 deficiency resulted in defective Foxp3 induction but enhanced Th17 cell generation in vitro and in vivo. Smad3 was found to be part of a protein complex with RORγt, leading to the inhibition of RORγt transcriptional activity. Smad3 thus differentially regulates iTreg and Th17 cell differentiation. These results may be beneficial in our further understanding of the reciprocal regulation of these two cell lineages, allowing for the development of better approaches to design immunotherapies to target each cell type individually.

https://openalex.org/W2057083103,"Half of all human transcription factors use C2H2 zinc finger domains to specify site-specific DNA binding and yet very little is known about their role in gene regulation. Based on in vitro studies, a zinc finger code has been developed that predicts a binding motif for a particular zinc finger factor (ZNF). However, very few studies have performed genome-wide analyses of ZNF binding patterns, and thus, it is not clear if the binding code developed in vitro will be useful for identifying target genes of a particular ZNF. We performed genome-wide ChIP-seq for ZNF263, a C2H2 ZNF that contains 9 finger domains, a KRAB repression domain, and a SCAN domain and identified more than 5000 binding sites in K562 cells. Our results suggest that ZNF263 binds to a 24-nt site that differs from the motif predicted by the zinc finger code in several positions. Interestingly, many of the ZNF263 binding sites are located within the transcribed region of the target gene. Although ZNFs containing a KRAB domain are thought to function mainly as transcriptional repressors, many of the ZNF263 target genes are expressed at high levels. To address the biological role of ZNF263, we identified genes whose expression was altered by treatment of cells with ZNF263-specific small interfering RNAs. Our results suggest that ZNF263 can have both positive and negative effects on transcriptional regulation of its target genes."
https://openalex.org/W1981607180,"We have investigated the heterodimerization of ORL1 receptors and classical members of the opioid receptor family. All three classes of opioid receptors could be co-immunoprecipitated with ORL1 receptors from both transfected tsA-201 cell lysate and rat dorsal root ganglia lysate, suggesting that these receptors can form heterodimers. Consistent with this hypothesis, in cells expressing either one of the opioid receptors together with ORL1, prolonged ORL1 receptor activation via nociceptin application resulted in internalization of the opioid receptors. Conversely, μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptor activation with the appropriate ligands triggered the internalization of ORL1. The μ-opioid receptor/ORL1 receptor heterodimers were shown to associate with N-type calcium channels, with activation of μ-opioid receptors triggering N-type channel internalization, but only in the presence of ORL1. Furthermore, the formation of opioid receptor/ORL1 receptor heterodimers attenuated the ORL1 receptor-mediated inhibition of N-type channels, in part because of constitutive opioid receptor activity. Collectively, our data support the existence of heterodimers between ORL1 and classical opioid receptors, with profound implications for effectors such as N-type calcium channels.

Collectively, our data support the existence of heterodimers between ORL1 and classical opioid receptors, with profound implications for effectors such as N-type calcium channels. ORL1 (opioid receptor-like 1) receptors (also known as NOP or nociceptin receptors) belong to the class of Gαi/o-linked seven-helix transmembrane receptors (1Bunzow J.R. Saez C. Mortrud M. Bouvier C.

Meunier J.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). They are structurally related to members of the classical opioid receptor family (i.e. μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors) but do not interact with known opioid receptor agonists or antagonists. Instead, they are activated by the endogenous ligand orphanin FQ (also known as nociceptin), a 17-amino acid polypeptide (3Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Science. 1995; 270: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). ORL1 receptors are expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems; the physiological effects of receptor activation include stimulation of food intake, reduced anxiety, reduced withdrawal symptoms, and when activated peripherally, analgesia (4Kolesnikov Y.A. Pasternak G.W. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Inoue M. Shimohira I. Yoshida A. Zimmer A. Takeshima H. Sakurada T. Ueda H. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is a functional cross-talk between ORL1 receptors and μ-opioid receptors such that chronic administration of the μ-receptor agonist morphine results in increased ORL1 receptor expression levels (7Gouardères C. Tafani J.A. Meunier J.C. Jhamandas K. Zajac J.M. Brain Res. 1999; 838: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas knock-out of the ORL1 receptor gene results in decreased morphine tolerance (8Ueda H. Inoue M. Takeshima H. Iwasawa Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7640-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without compensatory changes in opioid receptor expression (9Homberg J.R. Mul J. de Wit E. Cuppen E. Neuroscience. 2009; 163: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This may hint at the possibility of overlapping mechanisms controlling cellular expression levels of these two receptor subtypes. We have recently shown that ORL1 receptors physically interact with N-type calcium channels and that this interaction results in two distinct consequences: first, an agonist-independent inhibition of N-type channels due to constitutive receptor activity (10Beedle A.M. McRory J.E. Poirot O. Doering C.J. Altier C. Barrere C. Hamid J. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and second, receptor-mediated trafficking of N-type channels to and from the plasma membrane (11Altier C. Khosravani H. Evans R.M. Hameed S. Peloquin J.B. Vartian B.A. Chen L. Beedle A.M. Ferguson S.S. Mezghrani A. Dubel S.J. Bourinet E. McRory J.E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Neither of these phenomena appeared to occur with μ-opioid receptors (11Altier C. Khosravani H. Evans R.M. Hameed S. Peloquin J.B. Vartian B.A. Chen L. Beedle A.M. Ferguson S.S. Mezghrani A. Dubel S.J. Bourinet E. McRory J.E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ORL1 receptors have also been shown to heterodimerize with μ-opioid receptors (12Wang H.L. Hsu C.Y. Huang P.C. Kuo Y.L. Li A.H. Yeh T.H. Tso A.S. Chen Y.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with dimerized receptors showing altered sensitivity to μ-opioid receptor agonists and receptor desensitization (12Wang H.L.

Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility of larger, macromolecular signaling complexes involving multiple receptor types and voltage-gated calcium channels. Here, we show that ORL1 receptors also heterodimerize with the other members of the opioid receptor family and can co-internalize each other upon agonist exposure. Moreover, we show that, upon dimerization with opioid receptors, ORL1 receptor regulation of N-type channels is altered. Finally, we show that the ORL1 receptor can function as a molecular link that allows μ-opioid receptors to trigger N-type channel internalization. Considering the well documented involvement of both N-type channels and opioid receptors in the pain pathway, these functional interactions may provide novel avenues for regulating pain behavior. tsA-201 cells were cultured and transfected as previously reported (14Beedle A.M.

Cells were replated at ∼8% confluence on either poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips or 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp.). Cells used for electrophysiology experiments were moved to 30 °C after transfection, whereas those used for confocal microscopy or Western blotting were maintained at 37 °C until used. In cells used for electrophysiological recordings, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP, 2The abbreviations used are: YFPyellow fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineDRGdorsal root ganglionHAhemagglutininDAMGO[d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin. 0.5 μg; Clontech) was included as a transfection marker. yellow fluorescent protein cyan fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline dorsal root ganglion hemagglutinin [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin.

Similarly, the N-terminally His6/XPRESS-tagged μ-opioid receptor construct was created by subcloning into pcDNA3.1/HisB (Invitrogen).

The wild-type μ-opioid receptor clone was donated by Dr. William Colmers at the University of Alberta. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as follows. tsA-201 cells were grown for 48 h following transfection. Cells were washed with isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice for 1 h using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and the lysate was harvested. Cell lysate was spun down at 15,000 × g (5 min), and the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until used. Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were removed from all spinal levels of adult Sprague-Dawley rats and washed in ice-cold PBS. DRG tissue was lysed on ice for ∼1 h in an extraction solution containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The lysate was spun down at 15,000 × g (5 min), and the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until used. The lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate precipitating antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were then gently spun down and washed with ice-cold PBS. An equal amount of SDS loading buffer was added to each sample, and samples were then boiled for 5 min before being resolved by SDS-PAGE (8–12% gels). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.4 μm) and probed overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% powdered milk. After thorough washing with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000, PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 + 5% milk) before being washed again and exposed using the ECL detection method.

The proportion of Gβγ-mediated and voltage-independent N-type calcium current inhibition was measured by application of a prepulse facilitation protocol as described. 2–3 days after transfection, cells were subjected to either agonist or control treatment and then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. If required, permeabilization was achieved using 0.05% Triton-X (in PBS) for 5 min followed by immunostaining (primary antibody, 1 h at room temperature, 3× wash in PBS + 3% bovine serum albumin; secondary antibody, 45 min at room temperature, 3× wash PBS + 3% bovine serum albumin). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM-510 META confocal microscope using a 63× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective in the inverted configuration. For quantitative analysis, on each image, regions of interest corresponding to the nucleus, the intracellular region, and the cell membrane were manually traced, and the integrated fluorescence intensity was measured. The internalization ratio was defined as c/m, where c is the integrated fluorescence intensity within the cell (corrected for the nucleus) and m is the fluorescence intensity in the membrane region as obtained by subtracting the total intracellular fluorescence (including the nucleus) from the cell's total integrated intensity. Because the majority of commercially available antibodies directed against opioid receptors are raised in rabbits, we created a number of tagged receptor constructs to circumvent the issue of secondary antibodies reacting with both precipitating and probing primary antibodies. Fig. 1A shows a series of co-immunoprecipitations between ORL1 receptors and different wild-type and tagged opioid receptor subtypes that were coexpressed in tsA-201 cells. As evident from the figure, ORL1 receptors were able to precipitate both the wild-type μ-opioid receptor and a μ-opioid receptor construct tagged with a His6/XPRESS epitope (Fig. 1A). A His6/XPRESS-tagged ORL1 receptor construct also co-immunoprecipitated with an HA-tagged κ-opioid receptor construct, irrespective of which receptor was targeted by the precipitating antibody. ORL1 and the δ-opioid receptor also precipitated together, with ORL1 as both the precipitating and blotting antibody. Negative controls consisted of the appropriate cell lysate incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads, with the precipitating antibody being omitted from the sample. When polyclonal antibodies were used to blot, a heavy band was evident at ∼25 kDa. This band is likely due to nonspecific binding of lysate proteins to the protein G-Sepharose matrix and was still observed following preclearing of cell lysate. Such nonspecific binding to protein G-Sepharose has been observed by other groups (16Williams A.J. Norcross A.J. Chandler K.A. Bingley P.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 314: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The band appears in both control and experimental lanes and is outside of the predicted molecular weight range for our proteins of interest; as such, it does not obfuscate interpretation of the blots. Fig. 1B shows a similar set of co-immunoprecipitations using lysate from adult rat DRGs. Consistent with our results from tsA-201 cells lysate, ORL1 receptors were able to precipitate wild-type μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors from DRG lysate. Similar results were obtained using whole brain lysate from rats (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that stable biochemical complexes can be formed between ORL1 receptors and μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptor subtypes. Fig. 2 shows confocal images of tsA-201 cells transiently expressing YFP-κ-, YFP-δ-, or YFP-μ-opioid receptors, either alone or together with wild-type ORL1. In naïve cells expressing both receptors, the YFP signal was predominantly in the plasma membrane. Following a 30-min exposure to 1 μm nociceptin (at 37 °C), we observed a robust increase in cytoplasmic YFP signal for each of the three opioid receptor subtypes, which was not observed in cells where ORL1 was not coexpressed (Fig. 2, A and C). In the converse experiment, YFP-tagged ORL1 receptors were coexpressed with wild-type κ-, δ-, or μ-opioid receptor constructs. Cells were then exposed to the appropriate opioid receptor ligands ((±)-U50488 hydrochloride (Tocris), [d-Ala2]deltorphin II (Tocris), or [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO; Sigma), respectively, for κ-, δ-, and μ-receptors) for 30 min at 37 °C. Again, this resulted in a significantly increased cytoplasmic YFP signal (Fig. 2, B and D), consistent with opioid receptor-mediated internalization of ORL1. These data fit with the biochemical analysis shown in Fig. 1 and support the existence of opioid receptor/ORL1 receptor heterodimers that can be trafficked together as a complex. As further confirmation of heterodimer formation, we transfected YFP-tagged μ-, κ-, or δ-opioid receptors with the His6/XPRESS-tagged ORL1 receptor. Following the 30-min treatment with either vehicle or nociceptin (1 μm), cells were fixed and stained with the anti-XPRESS antibody (1:2,500) and anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:5,000). These cells were then assessed for co-localization of the two receptors. For all three opioid receptors, a relatively high degree of co-localization was observed in both control and nociceptin-treated cells. These data are shown in Fig. 3 and further support the notion that ORL1 and opioid receptors can exist as heterodimers.FIGURE 3A–C, confocal images of tsA-201 cells coexpressing His6/XPRESS-tagged ORL1 receptors (red) and YFP-tagged δ-, κ-, or μ-opioid receptors, respectively, under control conditions and following 30-min nociceptin (Noci) treatment (1 μm at 37 °C).

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7608-7615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in cells expressing various combinations of receptors. Functional N-type calcium channels were reconstituted by expression of Cav2.2 along with auxiliary α2δ1 and β1b subunits, and their electrical activity was examined using whole cell patch clamp recordings with 20 mm barium as the charge carrier. Cells were held at a potential of −100 mV, and currents were elicited by a step depolarization to +20 mV. A second depolarizing step to +20 mV was given immediately subsequent to a strong depolarization to +150 mV to assess the extent of voltage-dependent modulation (i.e. the amount of prepulse relief). Fig. 4A depicts representative current traces obtained with cells expressing N-type channels with either ORL1 receptors or ORL1 receptors coexpressed with the δ-opioid receptor before and after application of nociceptin. In cells expressing only ORL1 receptors, agonist application resulted in a pronounced inhibition of N-type channels that was largely reversible by the delivery of a strong depolarizing prepulse, consistent with membrane-delimited, Gβγ-mediated modulation of the channel. In the absence of agonist, a small degree of receptor-mediated, agonist-independent modulation could be observed (note the slight increase in current following the prepulse), consistent with our previous findings (10Beedle A.M. McRory J.E. Poirot O. Doering C.J. Altier C. Barrere C. Hamid J. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In cells expressing both receptor subtypes, the effects of nociceptin were largely attenuated in comparison with cells expressing only the ORL1 receptor. Fig. 4, B–D, shows a quantification of these data. In the absence of κ-, δ-, or μ-opioid receptors, 100 nm nociceptin mediated an ∼65% inhibition of N-type channel activity at a test potential of +20 mV. In contrast, nociceptin did not trigger G protein inhibition of N-type channels coexpressed with any of the opioid receptor isoforms (Fig. 4B). Coexpression of one of the three opioid receptor subtypes attenuated the nociceptin/ORL1 receptor-mediated inhibition in an opioid receptor subtype-dependent manner, with δ-opioid receptors blocking almost all of the actions of nociceptin (Fig. 4C), whereas μ-opioid receptors mediated a much smaller antagonism of the ORL1 response. This attenuation of the nociceptin response could in part be explained by a receptor-dependent, agonist-independent, tonic inhibition of N-type calcium channels that occurred simply by coexpression of the opioid receptor subtypes (Fig. 4D). As seen in Fig. 4D, expression of the μ-opioid receptor triggered only a small degree of constitutive channel inhibition, consistent with a low level of constitutive receptor activity (see also Ref. 22Chee M.J. Mörl K. Lindner D. Merten N. Zamponi G.W. Light P.E. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Colmers W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33337-33346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, coexpression with either the δ-opioid receptor or the κ-opioid receptor triggered large tonic, agonist-independent G protein modulation, as evident from the 2-fold increase in peak current amplitude following the prepulse. Because the degree of prepulse relief is proportional to the amount of tonic G protein inhibition, these data suggest that the mere presence of these opioid receptor subtypes mediates an ∼40–50% inhibition in current activity, thus precluding to a large extent further G protein inhibition via ORL1 receptor activation. We have shown previously that ORL1 receptors physically associate with N-type calcium channels, thus allowing for ORL1 receptor-mediated internalization of the channels upon prolonged agonist exposure (11Altier C. Khosravani H. Evans R.M. Hameed S. Peloquin J.B. Vartian B.A. Chen L. Beedle A.M. Ferguson S.S. Mezghrani A. Dubel S.J. Bourinet E. McRory J.E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, μ-opioid receptors did not appear to mediate N-type channel internalization upon treatment with DAMGO (11Altier C. Khosravani H. Evans R.M. Hameed S. Peloquin J.B. Vartian B.A. Chen L. Beedle A.M. Ferguson S.S. Mezghrani A. Dubel S.J. Bourinet E. McRory J.E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because ORL1 receptors are capable of heterodimerization with the μ-opioid receptors and can associate with N-type channels, we hypothesized that these three membrane proteins may form a larger macromolecular signaling complex, and if correct, any internalization of the μ-opioid receptors should allow for co-internalization of both the ORL1 receptor and the channel. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, coexpression of CFP-tagged N-type channels with wild-type ORL1 receptors and YFP-tagged μ-opioid receptors resulted in membrane localization of both fluorophores, which translocated to cytoplasmic compartments after a 30-min treatment with the agonist DAMGO. Triple labeling (i.e. CFP-N-type, YFP-μ-opioid receptor, and His6/XPRESS-ORL1 receptor) confirmed a similar distribution of all three proteins before and after internalization, consistent with the idea that μ-opioid receptor activation triggers N-type channel internalization via ORL1 receptors (Fig. 5C). As independent verification of these results, we used an immunoluminometry approach as described by us previously (11Altier C. Khosravani H. Evans R.M. Hameed S. Peloquin J.B. Vartian B.A. Chen L. Beedle A.M. Ferguson S.S. Mezghrani A. Dubel S.J. Bourinet E. McRory J.E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Kisilevsky A.E. Mulligan S.J.

In this case, ORL1 and/or μ-opioid receptors were coexpressed with Cav2.2 N-type channels carrying an extracellular HA epitope, and HA antibody reactivity was quantified in permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells with or without agonist treatment, thus allowing us to measure cell surface expression relative to total protein expression via a fluorescence plate reader system. As shown in Fig. 5D, when coexpressed with the channels individually, ORL1 receptors were able to trigger internalization of N-type channels in a nociceptin dose-dependent manner. In the absence or ORL1 receptor expression, activation of μ-opioid receptors by DAMGO did not affect N-type channel surface expression, consistent with a lack of internalization. However, when both μ-opioid and ORL1 receptors were coexpressed, DAMGO application resulted in a dose-dependent loss of N-type channels from the cell surface. Hence, ORL1 receptors serve as a molecular link that allows μ-opioid receptors to regulate N-type channel surface expression. The dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors is a well established concept (Ref. 24Harding P.J. Attrill H. Boehringer J. Ross S. Wadhams G.H. Smith E. Armitage J.P. Watts A. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 964-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; for review, see Refs. 25Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); however, its impact on the activation and regulation of effector systems has been less clear. Here, we not only present evidence that opioid and opioid-like receptors can form heterodimers, but we also show that these interactions alter the functional modulation of N-type calcium channels by these receptors. All members of the opioid receptor family have been shown to regulate N-type calcium channels when coexpressed in either tsA-201 cells or Xenopus oocytes (i.e. Refs. 18Kaneko S. Yada N. Fukuda K. Kikuwaka M. Akaike A. Satoh M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7608-7615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with receptor activation resulting in voltage-dependent inhibition that is mediated by G protein βγ subunits. For ORL1 receptors (10Beedle A.M. McRory J.E. Poirot O. Doering C.J. Altier C. Barrere C. Hamid J. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent μ-opioid receptors (22Chee M.J. Mörl K. Lindner D. Merten N. Zamponi G.W. Light P.E. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Colmers W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33337-33346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), agonist-independent modulation of channel activity has been reported likely because of constitutive receptor activity. Our data reveal a similar agonist-independent modulation of N-type channels by κ- and especially δ-opioid receptors. In the case of κ- and δ-opioid receptors, the tonic G protein inhibition was particularly large even upon transfection of as little as 1 μg of receptor cDNA. For comparison, in our previous work with ORL1 receptors, agonist-independent, tonic G protein inhibition necessitated transfection of larger amounts (3–9 μg of receptor DNA) (10Beedle A.M. McRory J.E. Poirot O. Doering C.J. Altier C. Barrere C. Hamid J. Nargeot J. Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous work, only a small degree of tonic ORL1 receptor-mediated inhibition was observed in the present study when we used 1 μg of receptor DNA. Altogether, under identical transfection conditions, different opioid receptor subtypes appear to mediate distinct amounts of tonic G protein inhibition of N-type calcium channels, perhaps suggesting that they show differing levels of constitutive receptor activity. This in turn results in differential effects of various opioid receptor subtypes on the ability of ORL1 receptors to mediate N-type channel inhibition because the channels are, to a large extent, already tonically inhibited by Gβγ subunits before nociceptin application. In addition to precluding ORL1 receptor-mediated inhibition through tonic G protein modulation, it is also possible that the formation of receptor heterodimers alters receptor pharmacology and efficacy, as has been described for μ-opioid/ORL1 receptor dimers (12Wang H.L. Hsu C.Y. Huang P.C. Kuo Y.L. Li A.H. Yeh T.H. Tso A.S. Chen Y.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Mandyam C.D. Thakker D.R. Standifer K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as well as for other types of G protein-coupled receptor heterodimers (27Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 28Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Trapaidze N. Nagy V. Devi L.A. J.

For example, it is possible that nociceptin binding to ORL1 may be allosterically inhibited when the ORL1 receptor is part of a heterodimer, as has been demonstrated for μ- and δ-opioid receptor heterodimers (30George S.R. Fan T. Xie Z. Tse R. Tam V. Varghese G. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Indeed, the notion that κ- and δ-opioid receptors produced similar levels of tonic G protein inhibition (i.e. a similar degree of prepulse relief), and yet ORL1 receptor activation was more strongly attenuated in cells coexpressing the δ-opioid receptor subtype, may support such a mechanism. The formation of heterodimers between the opioid and opioid-like receptors not only resulted in receptor co-internalization but also regulated N-type channel trafficking. We have shown previously that, unlike ORL1, μ-opioid receptors did not mediate trafficking of N-type channels to and from the plasma membrane (11Altier C. Khosravani H. Evans R.M. Hameed S. Peloquin J.B. Vartian B.A. Chen L. Beedle A.M. Ferguson S.S. Mezghrani A. Dubel S.J. Bourinet E. McRory J.E. Zamponi G.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a notion that is confirmed by the immunoluminometry experiments presented here. However, when coexpressed with ORL1 receptors, activation of the μ-opioid receptors triggered internalization of the N-type channels, leading to co-localization of all three players in cytoplasmic compartments. This indicates the presence of ORL1/μ-opioid receptor/N-type channel complexes and suggests that the ORL1 receptors act as an intermediary, physically coupling the μ-opioid receptors to N-type channels. This receptor-induced channel internalization adds to an increasing body of evidence showing that various G protein-coupled receptors form signaling complexes with voltage-gated calcium channels and regulate their membrane expression (15Kisilevsky A.E. Mulligan S.J. Altier C. Iftinca M.C. Varela D. Tai C. Chen L. Hameed S. Hamid J. Macvicar B.A. Zamponi G.W.

It is possible that δ- and κ-opioid receptors might mediate a similar trafficking effect, perhaps even in the absence of coexpressed ORL1 receptors, but this was not examined here and will be subject to further investigation. It is well established that opioid and opioid-like receptors play a key role in controlling pain signaling in primary afferent fibers (34Chen Y. Sommer C. J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 2006; 11: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Chen Y. Sommer C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Pettersson L.M. Sundler F.

Pain. 2009; 141: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) by two primary mechanisms. First, these receptors activate G protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium channels, thus reducing neuronal excitability (39Marker C.L. Luján R. Loh H.H. Wickman K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3551-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Dang V.C. Napier I.A. Christie M.J. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3322-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); and second, they inhibit N-type calcium channels in nerve terminals within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (41Connor M. Christie M.J. J. Physiol. 1998; 509: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Wu Z.Z. Chen S.R. Pan H.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The formation of opioid/ORL1 receptor heterodimers thus has a potentially profound effect on nociceptive processing. Little is known about the precise distributions of these receptors in different types of afferent fibers and to what extent ORL1 and opioid receptors are co-localized in synaptic nerve terminals; however, the observation that knock-out of ORL1 receptors alters morphine tolerance (8Ueda H. Inoue M. Takeshima H. Iwasawa Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7640-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that μ-opioid and ORL1 receptors show at least partial overlap in their cellular expression patterns. In this context, the heterodimerization of opioid and ORL1 receptors and the associated effects on N-type channel activity and trafficking may provide for a unique mechanism of fine-tuning pain transmission. Although not examined here, similar receptor dimer-dependent effects on G protein-coupled inward rectifier potassium channel activity are possible. Finally, it is worth noting that ORL1 receptors are expressed widely across the brain (43Neal Jr., C.R. Mansour A. Reinscheid R. Nothacker H.P. Civelli O. Akil H. Watson Jr., S.J. J. Comp.

https://openalex.org/W2033150420,"The coordinated regulation of gene expression is essential for pathogens to infect and cause disease. A recently appreciated mechanism of regulation is that afforded by small regulatory RNA (sRNA) molecules. Here, we set out to assess the prevalence of sRNAs in the human bacterial pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS). Genome-wide identification of candidate GAS sRNAs was performed through a tiling Affymetrix microarray approach and identified 40 candidate sRNAs within the M1T1 GAS strain MGAS2221. Together with a previous bioinformatic approach this brings the number of novel candidate sRNAs in GAS to 75, a number that approximates the number of GAS transcription factors. Transcripts were confirmed by Northern blot analysis for 16 of 32 candidate sRNAs tested, and the abundance of several of these sRNAs were shown to be temporally regulated. Six sRNAs were selected for further study and the promoter, transcriptional start site, and Rho-independent terminator identified for each. Significant variation was observed between the six sRNAs with respect to their stability during growth, and with respect to their inter- and/or intra-serotype-specific levels of abundance. To start to assess the contribution of sRNAs to gene regulation in M1T1 GAS we deleted the previously described sRNA PEL from four clinical isolates. Data from genome-wide expression microarray, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses are consistent with PEL having no regulatory function in M1T1 GAS. The finding that candidate sRNA molecules are prevalent throughout the GAS genome provides significant impetus to the study of this fundamental gene-regulatory mechanism in an important human pathogen."

To determine the role of PKD1 in osteoblasts, we conditionally inactivated Pkd1 in postnatal mature osteoblasts by crossing Oc (osteocalcin)-Cre mice with floxed Pkd1 (Pkd1flox/m1Bei) mice to generate conditional heterozygous (Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+) and homozygous (Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei) Pkd1-deficient mice. Cre-mediated recombination (Pkd1Δflox) occurred exclusively in bone. Compared with control mice, the conditional deletion of Pkd1 from osteoblasts resulted in a gene dose-dependent reduction in bone mineral density, trabecular bone volume, and cortical thickness. In addition, mineral apposition rates and osteoblast-related gene expression, including Runx2-II (Runt-related transcription factor 2), osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein, were reduced proportionate to the reduction of Pkd1 gene dose in bone of Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ and Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice. Primary osteoblasts derived from Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei displayed impaired differentiation and suppressed activity of the phosphatidylinositdol 3-kinase-Akt-GSK3β-β-catenin signaling pathways. The conditional deletion of Pkd1 also resulted in increased adipogenesis in bone marrow and in osteoblast cultures. Thus, PKD1 directly functions in osteoblasts to regulate bone formation.

The biological functions of PC1 are poorly defined in some tissues that express PKD1 transcripts, such as bone. Indeed, the absence of clinically demonstrable skeletal abnormalities in patients with ADPKD initially delayed the investigation of PKD1 function in bone. The apparent lack of abnormalities in other tissues expressing PC1 may arise because of differences in the frequency of a second hit somatic mutation, the presence of other modifying factors that may compensate for lack of PC1 function in other organs (12Watnick T.J.

Most recently, however, the heterozygous Pkd1m1Bei mouse, which has an inactivating mutation of Pkd1 and survives to adulthood without polycystic kidney disease, has been shown to develop osteopenia and impaired osteoblastic differentiation (17Xiao Z.

Because homozygous PKD1/Pkd1 mutations in humans and mice are lethal, and most of the existing models are globally Pkd1-deficient, the significance of inactivation of Pkd1 in osteoblasts remains uncertain, and the bone changes might reflect an indirect effect due to loss of PKD1, in the kidney or other tissues. In the current study, to determine if PKD1 in osteoblasts has a direct function in regulating postnatal skeletal functions, we used mouse genetic approaches to conditionally delete Pkd1 in osteoblasts. We demonstrate that conditional deletion of Pkd1 from osteoblasts using Oc-Cre results defective osteoblast function in vivo and in vitro, and osteopenia, indicating that PKD1 has a direct role to regulate osteoblast function and skeletal homeostasis. We obtained the floxed Pkd1 mice from Dr. Gregory Germino at Johns Hopkins University (19Piontek K.B. Huso D.L. Grinberg A. Liu L. Bedja D. Zhao H. Gabrielson K. Qian F. Mei C. Westphal H.

At first, we created double heterozygous Oc-Cre;Pkd1m1Bei/+ mice and homozygous Pkd1flox/flox mice.

Whole intact femurs with encapsulated marrow were dissected from 18-week-old mice, fixed for 48 h in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, decalcified in 14% EDTA, and then embedded in tissue freezing medium. Cryosectioning was performed on a Leica CM1900 cryostat (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) equipped with a CryoJane frozen sectioning kit (Instrumedics, Hackensack, NJ). 10-μm thick sections were then stained with Oil Red O for bone marrow adipocytes as described before (23David V.

Briefly, the sections were rinsed in 60% isopropyl alcohol; stained for 20 min in 0.5% Oil Red O, isopropyl alcohol solution; differentiated in 60% isopropyl alcohol; rinsed in tap water; and mounted in glycerin jelly. Sections were examined with a Leica DM LB microscope equipped with an Optronics digital camera. Whole intact tibiae with encapsulated marrow were dissected from 18-week-old mice, fixed for 48 h in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, decalcified in 14% EDTA, and stained for 2 h in 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide (OsO4). Bones were rinsed in water for 48 h and then scanned at 6 μm resolution using a Scanco μCT 40, 45 keV, and 177 μA. Quantification of fat volume, density, and distribution throughout the marrow was registered to low contrast decalcified bone. For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, 2.0 μg of total RNA isolated from either the long bone of 16-week-old mice or 10-day cultured primary osteoblasts in differentiation medium was reverse transcribed as described previously (24Xiao Z.S.

PCRs contained 100 ng of template (cDNA or RNA), 300 nm each forward and reverse primers, and 1× iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in 50 μl. The threshold cycle of tested gene product from the indicated genotype was normalized to the threshold cycle for cyclophilin A. Expression of total Pkd1 transcripts was performed using the following Pkd1 allele-specific primers: in exon 26, forward primer of normal Pkd1+ transcript (5′-CTG GTG ACC TAT GTG GTC AT-3′), forward primer of mutant Pkd1m1Bei transcript (5′-CTG GTG ACC TAT GTG GTC AG-3′), and common reverse primer (5′-AGC CGG TCT TAA CAA GTA TTT C-3′); in exons 2–4, forward primer of normal Pkd1+ transcript (5′-ATA GGG CTC CTG GTG AAC CT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCA CAG TTG CAC TCA AAT GG-3′). The normal Pkd1+ versus cyclophilin A is normalized to the mean ratio of five control mice, which has been set to 1. The percentage of conditional deleted and mutant transcripts was calculated from the relative levels of the normal Pkd1+ transcripts in different Pkd1 exons (25Lantinga-van Leeuwen I.S.

Serum osteocalcin levels were measured using a mouse osteocalcin enzyme immunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). Serum urea nitrogen was determined using a serum urea nitrogen diagnostic kit from Pointe Scientific, Inc. Serum calcium was measured by the colorimetric cresolphthalein binding method, and phosphorus was measured by the phosphomolybdate-ascorbic acid method (Stanbio Laboratory, TX). Serum TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) was assayed with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based SBA Sciences mouseTRAPTM assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Fountain Hills, AZ). Primary osteoblasts from newborn mouse calvarias were cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin as described previously (24Xiao Z.S.

Cell proliferation was detected by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays as the manufacturer describes (QIA58, Calbiochem). To induce differentiation, primary osteoblasts were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate and grown for period of up to 21 days in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 5 mm β-glycerophosphate and 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Alkaline phosphatase activity and alizarin red-S histochemical staining for mineralization were performed as described previously (24Xiao Z.S. Hjelmeland A.B. Quarles L.D. J. Biol.

Total DNA content was measured with a PicoGreen® double-stranded DNA quantitation reagent and kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). To examine the amounts of cytoplasmic Akt, GSK, and β-catenin, the cells were prepared using 1× passive lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C (Promega, Madison, WI) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatant were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal quantities of protein were subjected to NuPAGETM 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and were analyzed with standard Western blot protocols (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Anti-β-catenin (sc-7199) and anti-β-actin (sc-47778) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Both MC3T3-E1 and primary osteoblasts were cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To examine if PC1 regulates Runx2-P1 promoter activity by coupling with PI3K-Akt signaling, 1 × 106 MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with either control expression vector (sIg℘) or gain-of-function PC1 C-tail construct (PC1-AT) along with the Runx2-P1 luciferase reporter (p0.42Runx2-P1-Luc) construct by electroporation using Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). A total of 10.2 μg of plasmid DNA was used for each electroporation, with 3.6 μg of PC1 C-tail construct, 2.4 μg of p0.42Runx2-P1-Luc reporter, the indicated amounts of a dominant negative Akt (dn-Akt) construct in combination with empty vector (3.6 μg), and 0.6 μg of Renilla luciferase-null (RL-null) as internal control plasmid. Promoter activity was assessed by measuring luciferase activity 48 h after transfection in the presence or absence of a PI3K inhibitor (0.1–10 μm; LY294002) and a dn-Akt construct (1.2–3.6 μg) as described previously (17Xiao Z.

To explore potential abnormalities of the WNT pathway in excised floxed Pkd1 null mice, control (Pkd1flox/+) and excised floxed Pkd1 null (Pkd1Oc-cko) osteoblasts were transiently cotransfected with either pTOPFLASH or pFOPFLASH along with Renilla luciferase-null (RL-null; Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal control as described above. Promoter activity will be assessed by measuring luciferase activity 48 h after transfection in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml recombinant Wnt3a treatment for the last 8 h. We evaluated differences between groups by one-way analysis of variance. All values are expressed as means ± S.D. All computations were performed using GraphPad Prism5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The four genotypes from the breeding strategy (Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei or Pkd1Oc-cKO, Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+, Pkd1flox/m1Bei, and Pkd1flox/+) were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, and all exhibited survival indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice. The normal survival of conditional Pkd1Oc-cKO null mice (Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei) contrasts with perinatal lethality of homozygous Pkd1m1Bei/m1Bei mice (17Xiao Z. Zhang S. Magenheimer B.S. Luo J. Quarles L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12624-12634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oc-Cre expression is limited to cells of the osteoblast lineage (late osteoblasts > osteocytes) with onset of expression just before birth and persisting throughout the mature osteoblast lineage (20Zhang M. Xuan S. Bouxsein M.L. von Stechow D. Akeno N. Faugere M.C. Malluche H. Zhao G. Rosen C.J. Efstratiadis A. Clemens T.L. J. Biol.

To confirm that the Pkd1 floxed allele was selectively deleted in bone, we performed PCR analysis using a combination of primers that specifically detect floxed Pkd1 alleles (Pkd1flox) and the excised floxed Pkd1 alleles (Pkd1Δflox) in Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ or Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice (Fig. 1A). We demonstrated that Oc-Cre-mediated floxed recombination occurred exclusively in tissues that contain osteoblastic cells, whereas non-skeletal tissues retained the intact floxed Pkd1 alleles (Pkd1flox) (Fig. 1B). The Pkd1m1Bei mutation, which functions as a null allele, was used in combination with the floxed Pkd1 allele (Pkd1flox) to increase the net efficiency of Pkd1 inactivation by Cre-recombinase to reduce functional Pkd1 expression. Therefore, we examined the percentage of Pkd1 conditional deleted and the Pkd1m1Bei mutant alleles in bone. The level of conditional deleted Pkd1Δflox alleles and the presence of the Pkd1m1Bei mutation from the femurs of these four genotypes of mice were assessed by real time PCR (Fig. 1C). Both Pkd1flox/m1Bei and Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice expressed 50% of the Pkd1m1Bei mutant allele, whereas Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ and Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice exhibited ∼25% excision of the floxed exons 2–4 from Pkd1, indicating that Oc-Cre-mediated bone-specific deletion of the floxed Pkd1 allele is incomplete (Fig. 1C). The combined effect of Pkd1m1Bei and (Pkd1Δflox) in Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei resulted in a net reduction of Pkd1 expression by ∼75% in bone (Fig. 1C). Real-time RT-PCR to assess the level of expression of the residual functional Pkd1 transcript confirmed the progressive reduction of functional Pkd1 message in conditional mutant mice (i.e. Pkd1flox/+ (100%), Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ (76%), Pkd1flox/m1Bei (50%), and Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei (25%) mice) (data not shown). In addition, Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice heterozygous for the conditional deleted Pkd1Δflox allele and mutant Pkd1m1Bei allele demonstrated no cyst formation in the kidney, consistent with the bone-specific inactivation of Pkd1 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, positive control mice lacking Pkd1 in the kidney have massive cyst formation in the kidney (Fig. 1D). At 16 weeks of age, the gross appearance and body weight of single global and conditional heterozygous (Pkd1flox/m1Bei or Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+) and control (Pkd1flox/+) mice were not significantly different. The global Pkd1 heterozygous mice (Pkd1flox/m1Bei) and heterozygous conditional deleted Pkd1 mice (Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+), however, were osteopenic, as evidenced by respective 9 and 7% reduction BMD in both male and female adult mice (Fig. 2A). The phenotype of the Pkd1Oc-cKO mice was more severe. The body weight of both male and female Pkd1Oc-cKO mice was reduced by ∼16 and 12% (data not shown) compared with the control mice (Pkd1flox/+). In addition, Pkd1Oc-cKO mice had greater loss in BMD, with respective reductions in BMD of 14 and 13% reduction in male and female adult mice (Fig. 2A). The abnormalities in BMD in the various groups, although present at 6 weeks of age, segregated by gene dose by 16 weeks of age (Fig. 2B). μCT analysis revealed that the reduction in bone mass in heterozygous Pkd1-deficient mice (either Pkd1flox/m1Bei or Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+) was caused by a reduction in trabecular bone volume (24.3 and 25.5%, respectively) and cortical bone thickness (9.7 and 10.8%, respectively) (Fig. 2C). Pkd1cKO/m1Bei had greater loss in both trabecular (44.5%) and cortical bone (21.0%) than did single heterozygous mice (Fig. 2C). Consistent with a low bone mass phenotype by BMD and μCT analysis, both Goldner staining in distal femur and Von Kossa staining in vertebrae confirmed marked reductions in bone volume and cortical thickness in Pkd1Oc-cKO null mice (Fig. 3A). In addition, we found that bone loss was associated with a significant Pkd1 gene dose-dependent decrease in periosteal MAR, MS/BS, and BFR. In this regard, MAR, MS/BS, and BFR were reduced by ∼36%, ∼33%, and ∼57% in heterozygous Pkd1flox/m1Bei and Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ mice and ∼65, ∼60, and ∼87% in Pkd1Oc-cKO null mice compared with age-matched controls, respectively (Fig. 3B). To investigate the effects of Pkd1 deficiency on gene expression profiles in bone, we examined by real-time RT-PCR the expression levels of a panel of osteoblast lineage-, osteoclast-, and chondrocyte-related mRNAs from the femurs of 16-week-old control, heterozygous Pkd1-deficient (Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ and Pkd1m1Bei/+), and Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice (Table 1). Bone derived from heterozygous Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ and Pkd1m1Bei/+ mice had measurable reductions in the osteoblast lineage gene transcripts, including Runx2-II, total Runx2, osteocalcin, osteopontin, Bsp (bone sialoprotein), Opg (osteoprotegerin), RankL (Rank ligand), Dmp1 (dentin matrix protein 1), and Phex (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) mRNA levels compared with control mice. Significantly greater reductions of Runx2-II, total Runx2, osteocalcin, osteopontin, Bsp, RankL, and Dmp1 were observed in Pkd1Oc-cKO null mice. In this regard, the Opg/RankL expression ratio was increased in a gene dose-dependent manner (Table 1). Consistent with a ratio of Opg/RankL that favors the reduced osteoclastogenesis, bone expression of Trap and Mmp9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), markers of bone resorption, were also reduced in heterozygous Pkd1-deficient mice and to a greater extent in Pkd1Oc-cKO null mice (Table 1). Transcripts of chondrocyte-related genes did not differ between heterozygous Pkd1-deficient and Pkd1Oc-cKO null mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Gene expression profiles in 16-week-old miceGeneAccession no.Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+Pkd1flox/m1BeiOc-Cre;Pkd1flox/m1Beip valueOsteoblast lineage Runx2-IINM_0098200.73 ± 0.04aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.71 ± 0.08aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.45 ± 0.07aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.,bSignificant difference from single heterozygous Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ and Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice at p < 0.05.0.0007 Runx2-ID146361.14 ± 0.321.16 ± 0.141.15 ± 0.180.5961 Runx2NM_0098200.73 ± 0.09aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.71 ± 0.16aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.51 ± 0.07aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.,bSignificant difference from single heterozygous Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ and Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice at p < 0.05.0.0009 OsteocalcinNM_0075410.82 ± 0.12aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.80 ± 0.11aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.46 ± 0.08aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.,bSignificant difference from single heterozygous Oc-Cre;Pkd1flox/+ and Pkd1flox/m1Bei mice at p < 0.05.<0.0001 OsteopontinAF5157080.73 ± 0.11aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.69 ± 0.11aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.0.44 ± 0.03aSignificant difference from control (Pkd1flox/+) at p < 0.05.,bSignificant difference from single heterozygous Oc-C"
https://openalex.org/W2097012024,"Background There is currently no effective AIDS vaccine, emphasizing the importance of developing alternative therapies. Recently, a patient was successfully transplanted with allogeneic, naturally resistant CCR5-negative (CCR5Δ32) cells, setting the stage for transplantation of naturally resistant, or genetically modified stem cells as a viable therapy for AIDS. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy using vectors that express various anti-HIV transgenes has also been attempted in clinical trials, but inefficient gene transfer in these studies has severely limited the potential of this approach. Here we evaluated HSC gene transfer of an anti-HIV vector in the pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model, which closely models human transplantation. Methods and Findings We used lentiviral vectors that inhibited both HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV-1 (SHIV) chimera virus infection, and also expressed a P140K mutant methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) transgene to select gene-modified cells by adding chemotherapy drugs. Following transplantation and MGMT-mediated selection we demonstrated transgene expression in over 7% of stem-cell derived lymphocytes. The high marking levels allowed us to demonstrate protection from SHIV in lymphocytes derived from gene-modified macaque long-term repopulating cells that expressed an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor. We observed a statistically significant 4-fold increase of gene-modified cells after challenge of lymphocytes from one macaque that received stem cells transduced with an anti-HIV vector (p<0.02, Student's t-test), but not in lymphocytes from a macaque that received a control vector. We also established a competitive repopulation assay in a second macaque for preclinical testing of promising anti-HIV vectors. The vectors we used were HIV-based and thus efficiently transduce human cells, and the transgenes we used target HIV-1 genes that are also in SHIV, so our findings can be rapidly translated to the clinic. Conclusions Here we demonstrate the ability to select protected HSC-derived lymphocytes in vivo in a clinically relevant nonhuman primate model of HIV/SHIV infection. This approach can now be evaluated in human clinical trials in AIDS lymphoma patients. In this patient setting, chemotherapy would not only kill malignant cells, but would also increase the number of MGMTP140K-expressing HIV-resistant cells. This approach should allow for high levels of HIV-protected cells in AIDS patients to evaluate AIDS gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2018560344,"Mammalian ATAD3 is a mitochondrial protein, which is thought to play an important role in nucleoid organization. However, its exact function is still unresolved.Here, we characterize the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) ATAD3 homologue (ATAD-3) and investigate its importance for mitochondrial function and development. We show that ATAD-3 is highly conserved among different species and RNA mediated interference against atad-3 causes severe defects, characterized by early larval arrest, gonadal dysfunction and embryonic lethality. Investigation of mitochondrial physiology revealed a disturbance in organellar structure while biogenesis and function, as indicated by complex I and citrate synthase activities, appeared to be unaltered according to the developmental stage. Nevertheless, we observed very low complex I and citrate synthase activities in L1 larvae populations in comparison to higher larval and adult stages. Our findings indicate that atad-3(RNAi) animals arrest at developmental stages with low mitochondrial activity. In addition, a reduced intestinal fat storage and low lysosomal content after depletion of ATAD-3 suggests a central role of this protein for metabolic activity.In summary, our data clearly indicate that ATAD-3 is essential for C. elegans development in vivo. Moreover, our results suggest that the protein is important for the upregulation of mitochondrial activity during the transition to higher larval stages."

Among the extracellular matrix proteins enriched in the stroma of carcinomas are the tenascin family members tenascin-C and tenascin-W. Whereas tenascin-C overexpression in gliomas is known to correlate with poor prognosis, the status of tenascin-W in brain tumors has not been investigated so far. In the present study, we analyzed protein levels of tenascin-W in 38 human gliomas and found expression of tenascin-W in 80% of the tumor samples, whereas no tenascin-W could be detected in control, nontumoral brain tissues. Double immunohistochemical staining of tenascin-W and von Willebrand factor revealed that tenascin-W is localized around blood vessels, exclusively in tumor samples. In vitro, the presence of tenascin-W increased the proportion of elongated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and augmented the mean speed of cell migration. Furthermore, tenascin-W triggered sprouting of HUVEC spheroids to a similar extent as the proangiogenic factor tenascin-C. In conclusion, our study identifies tenascin-W as a candidate biomarker for brain tumor angiogenesis that could be used as a molecular target for therapy irrespective of the glioma subtype.-Martina, E., Degen, M., Rüegg, C., Merlo, A., Lino, M.

https://openalex.org/W2091171324,"Salamander limb regeneration depends on local progenitors whose progeny are recruited to the new limb. We previously identified a Pax7(+) cell population in skeletal muscle whose progeny have the potential to contribute to the regenerating limb. However, the plasticity of individual Pax7(+) cells, as well as their recovery within the new limb, was unclear. Here, we show that Pax7(+) cells remain present after multiple rounds of limb amputation/regeneration. Pax7(+) cells are found exclusively within skeletal muscle in the regenerating limb and proliferate where the myofibers are growing. Pax7 is rapidly down-regulated in the blastema, and analyses of clonal derivatives show that Pax7(+) cell progeny are not restricted to skeletal muscle during limb regeneration. Our data suggest that the newt regeneration blastema is not entirely a composite of lineage-restricted progenitors. The results demonstrate that except for a transient and subsequently blunted increase, skeletal muscle satellite cells constitute a stable pool of reserve cells for multiple limb regeneration events.-Morrison, J. I., Borg, P., Simon, A. Plasticity and recovery of skeletal muscle satellite cells during limb regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1990367597,"LIM-kinase 2 (LIMK2) belongs to the LIMK family of proteins, which comprises LIMK1 and LIMK2. Both proteins regulate actin polymerization through phosphorylation and inactivation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. In this study, we show that the level of LIMK2 protein is increased in neuroblastoma, BE(2)-C cells, selected for resistance to microtubule-destabilizing agents, vincristine and colchicine. However, the level of phosphorylated LIMK1 and LIMK2 was similar in the resistant and parental BE(2)-C cells. In contrast, the level of phospho-cofilin was greatly increased in the drug-resistant cells. Downregulation of LIMK2 expression increases sensitivity of neuroblastoma SH–EP cells to vincristine and vinblastine but not to microtubule-stabilizing agents, while it's overexpression increased its resistance to vincristine. Its vincristine-induced mitotic arrest was moderately inhibited in the LIMK2 knockdown cells, suggesting that the increased drug sensitivity is through an alternative mechanism other then mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, downregulation of LIMK2 expression induces formation of abnormal mitotic spindles, an effect enhanced in the presence of microtubule-destabilizing agents. LIMK2 is important for normal mitotic spindle formation and altered LIMK2 expression mediates sensitivity to microtubule destabilizing agents. These findings suggest that inhibition of LIMK2 activity may be used for the treatment of tumors resistant to microtubule-destabilizing drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2013853109,"Background Male circumcision (MC) is an effective strategy to prevent HIV infection in heterosexual men. To our knowledge, there are no studies of the acceptability of this procedure in the Dominican Republic (DR). The main objective of this study was to assess the acceptability of MC to prevent HIV transmission among men ages 18 to 50 years in the Altagracia Province in the Dominican Republic. Because differences in culture and beliefs between Haitians and Dominicans could potentially influence their acceptability of MC, we conducted a comparative analysis based on national origin. Methods A survey was administered to a convenience sample of 368 men. The questionnaire was divided in 3 sections: 1) Background demographics (including national origin), 2) Male circumcision and 3) Sexual health. Stratified and logistic multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the acceptability of MC. Results The sample consisted of 238 (65%) Dominicans and 130 (35%) Haitian immigrants. Almost all participants were uncircumcised (95%) and about half (52%) were single. The overall acceptability of MC was 29%. The number of men willing to be circumcised increased to 67% after an information session explaining the benefits of the procedure. 74% of men reported that they would be willing to circumcise their sons after hearing that information. In multivariate analysis, Haitian nationality (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.01–3.41), knowing that circumcision improves hygiene (OR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.29–6.0) and not believing that circumcision decreases sexual pleasure (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.20–3.94) were associated with a higher acceptability of the procedure. Although age was not significantly associated with the willingness to be circumcised in the multivariate analysis, stratified analysis based on national origin suggested that younger Dominicans (<30 years of age) are more likely to accept the procedure when compared to their older counterparts (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.14–4.12). Conclusions An important number of sexually active men in the DR may be willing to be circumcised if educational resources detailing the benefits of the procedure are made available. These educational activities would constitute a great opportunity to teach about sexual health and reinforce safe sex practices."
https://openalex.org/W2129616981,"Initially viewed as innovative carriers for biomedical applications, with unique photophysical properties and great versatility to be decorated at their surface with suitable molecules, nanoparticles can also play active roles in mediating biological effects, suggesting the need to deeply investigate the mechanisms underlying cell-nanoparticle interaction and to identify the molecular players. Here we show that the cell uptake of fluorescent CdSe/CdS quantum rods (QRs) by Hydra vulgaris, a simple model organism at the base of metazoan evolution, can be tuned by modifying nanoparticle surface charge. At acidic pH, amino-PEG coated QRs, showing positive surface charge, are actively internalized by tentacle and body ectodermal cells, while negatively charged nanoparticles are not uptaken. In order to identify the molecular factors underlying QR uptake at acidic pH, we provide functional evidence of annexins involvement and explain the QR uptake as the combined result of QR positive charge and annexin membrane insertion. Moreover, tracking QR labelled cells during development and regeneration allowed us to uncover novel intercellular trafficking and cell dynamics underlying the remarkable plasticity of this ancient organism."
https://openalex.org/W1984675911,"The sequence-specific binding to DNA is crucial for the p53 tumor suppressor function. To investigate the constraints imposed on p53-DNA recognition by nucleosomal organization, we studied binding of the p53 DNA binding domain (p53DBD) and full-length wild-type p53 protein to a single p53 response element (p53RE) placed near the nucleosomal dyad in six rotational settings. We demonstrate that the strongest p53 binding occurs when the p53RE in the nucleosome is bent in the same direction as observed for the p53-DNA complexes in solution and in co-crystals. The p53RE becomes inaccessible, however, if its orientation in the core particle is changed by approximately 180 degrees. Our observations indicate that the orientation of the binding sites on a nucleosome may play a significant role in the initial p53-DNA recognition and subsequent cofactor recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2087231400,"Retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) proteins are molecular chaperones that facilitate nucleic acid (NA) remodeling events critical in viral replication processes such as reverse transcription. Surprisingly, the NC protein from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an extremely poor NA chaperone. Using bulk and single molecule methods, we find that removal of the anionic C-terminal domain (CTD) of HTLV-1 NC results in a protein with chaperone properties comparable with that of other retroviral NCs. Increasing the ionic strength of the solution also improves the chaperone activity of full-length HTLV-1 NC. To determine how the CTD negatively modulates the chaperone activity of HTLV-1 NC, we quantified the thermodynamics and kinetics of wild-type and mutant HTLV-1 NC/NA interactions. The wild-type protein exhibits very slow dissociation kinetics, and removal of the CTD or mutations that eliminate acidic residues dramatically increase the protein/DNA interaction kinetics. Taken together, these results suggest that the anionic CTD interacts with the cationic N-terminal domain intramolecularly when HTLV-1 NC is not bound to nucleic acids, and similar interactions occur between neighboring molecules when NC is NA-bound. The intramolecular N-terminal domain-CTD attraction slows down the association of the HTLV-1 NC with NA, whereas the intermolecular interaction leads to multimerization of HTLV-1 NC on the NA. The latter inhibits both NA/NC aggregation and rapid protein dissociation from single-stranded DNA.

Although this result could explain the poor chaperone activity of the HTLV-1 NC, the aggregation data were unable to explain the relatively poor annealing activity of murine leukemia virus NC compared with HIV or Rous sarcoma virus NC. SM λ-DNA stretching experiments revealed an excellent correlation between the overall chaperone function of each NC and its NA dissociation kinetics (28Stewart-Maynard K.M. Cruceanu M. Wang F.

The slow dissociation kinetics of HTLV-1 NC relative to that of other retroviral NCs was particularly striking, and the DNA stretching behavior resembled that of a single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein. In this study, we set out to understand the mechanistic basis for the slow NA dissociation kinetics and weak NA aggregation activity of HTLV-1 NC, which are the main factors contributing to its overall poor chaperone function. In addition to measuring TAR RNA/DNA annealing kinetics in the presence of WT and mutant HTLV-1 NC under varying conditions, we also used a number of other biophysical approaches to characterize the interaction of these proteins with NA. Specifically, we investigated the NA aggregating ability of the proteins, as well as their ability to destabilize NA duplexes. SM DNA stretching was used to characterize their NA interaction kinetics (30Cruceanu M. Gorelick R.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Rouzina I. Williams M.C. J. Mol.

Taken together, the results of this investigation lead to a proposed model in which electrostatic interaction between the anionic C-terminal domain (CTD) and cationic N-terminal domain (NTD) within a single HTLV-1 NC protein in solution, or between DNA-bound neighbors, results in slow NA association and dissociation, respectively, thereby negatively regulating the chaperone activity of this protein.

The resulting expression plasmid, pDB2703, was used for glutathione S-transferase-NC fusion protein expression, which was produced and affinity-purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. TEV cleavage of the purified fusion protein and final purification by HPLC were performed as described above for the HTLV-1 recombinant NC proteins. NCs were stored in lyophilized form with 1 eq of Zn2+ per finger at −80 °C. Prior to use, the proteins were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water or NC storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl), pH 7.5). NC concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) and using an extinction coefficient of 11,740 m−1 cm−1 for WT and mutant HTLV-1 NC and 5,690 m−1 cm−1 for the chimeric NC. The mini-TAR RNA and DNA constructs were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), respectively. The oligonucleotides were purified on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and stored at −20 °C. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined at A260 using the following extinction coefficients: mini-TAR RNA, 2.82 × 105 m−1 cm−1; mini-TAR DNA, 3.06 × 105 m−1 cm−1. Mini-TAR RNA was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) using standard protocols. The radiolabeled TAR constructs were purified on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and stored at −20 °C. Prior to use, mini-TAR oligonucleotides were refolded in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl at a concentration that was 100-fold greater than the final assay concentration. The oligonucleotides were incubated at 80 °C for 2 min, cooled to 60 °C for 2 min, followed by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm and placement on ice. Single time point annealing assays were performed to determine the amount of NC required to attain saturating annealing levels. Solutions containing 15 nm refolded 32P-labeled mini-TAR RNA and 90 nm refolded mini-TAR DNA in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm MgCl2) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. NC was then added to final concentrations varying from 0.25 to 6 μm, and reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For assays testing the effect of the HTLV-1 NC CTD in trans, a peptide corresponding to residues 57–85 of HTLV-1 NC and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate at its N terminus (CTD-FL) was used. The peptide was purchased from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). CTD-FL (0–15 μm) was added to 1 μm (3.3 nt:NC) HTLV-1 ΔC29 NC prior to addition of NA, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C in reaction buffer containing either 10 or 100 mm NaCl. Reactions were quenched and analyzed as described previously (38Vo M.N. Barany G. Rouzina I. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 244-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Annealing assays to determine the kinetics of mini-TAR RNA and DNA annealing were performed in the presence of 5.0 μm (0.66 nt:NC) WT or mutant HTLV-1 NC. Annealing reactions for salt dependence experiments were carried out using 3 μm (1.1 nt:NC) NC in low salt (20 mm NaCl) and 6 μm (0.55 nt:NC) NC in high salt (100 mm NaCl) to account for poorer binding. To determine the effect of zinc binding, annealing was performed in the presence of 3 μm apo-WT HTLV-1 NC prepared by pretreating with 1 mm EDTA for 30 min (30Cruceanu M. Gorelick R.J.

Experiments to compare annealing of HIV-1 NC, HTLV-1 NC, and the HIV-1/HTLV-1 chimera were performed using 1.5 μm (2.2 nt:NC) NC in low salt (20 mm NaCl). Separate mixtures containing mini-TAR RNA (15 nm) and mini-TAR DNA (90 nm) in reaction buffer were prepared and preincubated at 37 °C. DNA and RNA were mixed immediately prior to addition of NC. Reactions were quenched at the specified time points and analyzed as for the single time point assays. Solutions containing refolded 32P-labeled mini-TAR RNA (15 nm) and mini-TAR DNA (45 nm) were incubated with varying concentrations of WT and mutant HTLV-1 NC for 30 min at room temperature in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm MgCl2). The reactions were analyzed as described previously (38Vo M.N. Barany G. Rouzina I. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 244-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding of WT and mutant HTLV-1 NC to a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled 20-nt ssDNA oligonucleotide (5′-FAM-CTTCTTTGGGAGTGAATTAG-3′) was examined using an HPLC-purified DNA oligomer (5′-FAM DNA20) from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego). Binding to the corresponding 20-nt DNA/RNA hybrid duplex was also measured. The HPLC-purified RNA oligomer (5′-CUAAUUCACUCCCAAAGAAG-3′) was from Dharmacon. FA measurements were performed on an Analyst AD or a Spectramax M5 plate reader system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using Corning 3676 low volume 384-well black nonbinding surface polystyrene plates. Reaction mixtures contained 20 nm 5′-FAM DNA20 or the DNA/RNA duplex, varying concentrations of NC, and a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 100 μm TCEP (final concentrations). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark to allow samples to reach equilibrium. Samples were excited at 485 nm, and the emission intensities at 530 nm from the parallel and perpendicular planes were measured. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were obtained by fitting the binding curves as described previously (28Stewart-Maynard K.M. Cruceanu M. Wang F. Vo M.N. Gorelick R.J. Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 10129-10142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine the free energy per base pair (41McGhee J.D. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 1345-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), Equation 1 was used,ΔG=−RT⋅ln(Kdss/Kdds)/n(Eq. 1) where R is the molar gas constant; n is the binding site size in bp; Kdss and Kdds are the protein dissociation constants from ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively, and T is temperature in Kelvin. At room temperature (23 °C), RT = 0.59 kcal/mol. For FA measurements performed to characterize HTLV-1 NC ΔC29/CTD binding, the CTD-FL peptide described above was used. The HTLV-1 NC ΔC29 variant was titrated into a solution of CTD-FL and incubated for 30 min. The titrations were performed in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 100 μm TCEP) with variable [NaCl] (1–100 mm). The binding curves were fit to determine the dissociation constant for ΔC29/CTD-FL interaction as described previously (28Stewart-Maynard K.M. Cruceanu M. Wang F. Vo M.N. Gorelick R.J. Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 10129-10142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The measured salt dependence of the HTLV-1 NC NTD/CTD dissociation constant, Kd, NTD/CTD, was used to estimate the salt-dependent free energy of this interaction, ΔGNTD,CTD, using Equation 2,ΔGNTD/CTD=−RT⋅ln(C0Kd,NTD/CTD)(Eq. 2) where C0 is the effective concentration of NTD and CTD domains in this intramolecular binding reaction. C0 is the reciprocal volume of the HTLV-1 NC molecule, 400 m. This value was estimated using the volume of a sphere of 2 nm in diameter to approximate the average size of HTLV-1 NC, which was assumed to be an 85-residue flexible polypeptide chain. TAR DNA (64 nt) labeled with AlexaFluor-488 at the 5′-end and 4-(4′-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid at the 3′-end was obtained HPLC-purified from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego) and refolded as described (38Vo M.N. Barany G. Rouzina I. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 244-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Folded TAR DNA at a final concentration of 100 nm was incubated with and without NC in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μm TCEP, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm zinc acetate for 30 min. Fluorescence measurements were performed using the time-correlated single photon counting technique (42Hong M.K. Harbron E.J. O'Connor D.B. Guo J. Barbara P.F. Levin J.G. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) at room temperature on a LifeSpec Red time-resolved spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston UK) equipped with an EPL-475 picosecond diode laser (wavelength = 475 nm, repetition rate of 200 ns). Samples were excited using 475 nm vertically polarized pulses from the laser, and emission at 520 nm was detected at 90° with respect to the excitation axis with a miniature-PMT detector (Hamamatsu H7422) and a Glan Thompson polarizer set at the magic angle. The emission decay was fit using a noniterative nonlinear least squares fitting procedure by the reconvolution fit analysis module of the T900 software (Edinburgh Instruments), in which decay data were fit to a sum of exponential decays convoluted with the instrumental response function. Relative free energy ΔGT1 for the T1 state for each NC concentration was determined using Equation 3,ΔGT1=RT⋅ln(%population of T1 state)(Eq. 3) Dual beam optical tweezers were used to stretch bacteriophage λ DNA (Roche Applied Science), which was labeled with biotin on both 5′-ends. A single DNA molecule was caught between two streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (Bangs Labs) with optical tweezers. All stretching experiments were performed at a pulling rate of ∼100 nm/s in a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm Na+. Solutions of saturating NC concentrations were exchanged with buffer surrounding a single DNA molecule to investigate protein effects on DNA stretching curves. Experiments were performed in the presence of 700 and 200 nm WT and ΔC29 HTLV-1 NC, respectively. To measure DNA reannealing rate, we stretched λ-DNA through the DNA force-induced melting plateau and then relaxed to the mid-point of the transition. At a fixed DNA extension, the stretching force was recorded as function of time until equilibrium was achieved. Fig. 1 compares the amino acid sequence of HTLV-1 NC (Fig. 1A) with that of HIV-1 NC (Fig. 1C, top). Both proteins possess two zinc binding domains, which contain many basic residues and two or three aromatic residues. A distinguishing feature is the highly anionic CTD of HTLV-1 NC, which is absent in mature HIV-1 NC. Whereas most retroviral NCs have an overall basic character (pI = 9–10), the overall pI of HTLV-1 NC is about 7. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that this unusual feature leads to poor chaperone function by comparing the chaperone properties of the WT protein with that of a truncated variant lacking 29 amino acids from its CTD (ΔC29, see Fig. 1A). We also prepared three additional HTLV-1 NC mutants that lack (either through substitution with Ala or deletion) one or more C-terminal acidic residues. The negative charge of the anionic CTD of these mutants is diminished to varying extents, and they are designated EED, in which three acidic residues are neutralized by changing them to Ala, LLD, which lacks residues 65–70 including one acidic residue, and point mutant D69A. These HTLV-1 NC mutants are similar to the ones shown in a recent study to have a significant effect on apolipoprotein B editing catalytic polypeptide 3G (APOBEC3G) packaging into HTLV-1 virions (34Derse D. Hill S.A. Princler G. Lloyd P. Heidecker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a mini-TAR DNA/RNA model system to characterize the overall chaperone activity of WT and mutant HTLV-1 NC (Fig. 2). The mini-TAR RNA sequence is derived from the TAR RNA hairpin present near the 5′-end of the 96-nt R region of the HIV-1 genome. The HTLV-1 R region contains 228 nt and folds into a complex secondary structure (43Askjaer P. Kjems J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2125000836,"The lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan (HA) receptor Lyve-1 is a member of the Link protein superfamily most similar to the leukocyte HA receptor CD44. However, the structure of Lyve-1 and the nature of its interaction with ligand are obscure. Here we present new evidence that Lyve-1 is functionally distinct from CD44. Using truncation mutagenesis we confirm that Lyve-1 in common with CD44 contains an extended HA-binding unit, comprising elements flanking the N and C termini of the consensus lectin-like Link module, bridged by a third conserved disulfide linkage that is critical for HA binding. In addition, we identify six essential residues Tyr-87, Ile-97, Arg-99, Asn-103, Lys-105, and Lys-108 that define a compact HA-binding surface on Lyve-1, encompassing the epitope for an adhesion-blocking monoclonal antibody 3A, in an analogous position to the HA-binding surface in CD44. The overtly electrostatic character of HA binding in Lyve-1 and its sensitivity to ionic strength (IC(50) of 150 mm NaCl) contrast markedly with CD44 (IC(50) > 2 m NaCl) in which HA binding is mediated by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In addition, unlike the extended Link module in CD44, which binds HA efficiently when expressed as a soluble monomer (K(d) = 65.7 mum), that of Lyve-1 requires artificial dimerization, although the full ectodomain is active as a monomer (K(d) = 35.6 mum). Finally, full-length Lyve-1 did not form stable dimers in binding-competent 293T transfectants when assessed using bioluminescent resonance energy transfer. These results reveal that elements additional to the extended Link module are required to stabilize HA binding in Lyve-1 and indicate important structural and functional differences with CD44."

BK channel modulation by tyrosine kinases, including focal adhesion kinase and c-src, suggests their potential involvement in integrin signaling. Recently, we found that fibronectin, an endogenous α5β1 integrin ligand, enhances BK channel current through both Ca2+- and phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle. Here, we show that macroscopic currents from HEK 293 cells expressing murine BK channel α-subunits (mSlo) are acutely potentiated following α5β1 integrin activation. The effect occurs in a Ca2+-dependent manner, 1–3 min after integrin engagement. After integrin activation, normalized conductance-voltage relations for mSlo are left-shifted at free Ca2+ concentrations ≥1 μm. Overexpression of human c-src with mSlo, in the absence of integrin activation, leads to similar shifts in mSlo Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas overexpression of catalytically inactive c-src blocks integrin-induced potentiation. However, neither integrin activation nor c-src overexpression potentiates current in BK channels containing a point mutation at Tyr-766. Biochemical tests confirmed the critical importance of residue Tyr-766 in integrin-induced channel phosphorylation. Thus, BK channel activity is enhanced by α5β1 integrin activation, likely through an intracellular signaling pathway involving c-src phosphorylation of the channel α-subunit at Tyr-766. The net result is increased current amplitude, enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity, and rate of activation of the BK channel, which would collectively promote smooth muscle hyperpolarization in response to integrin-extracellular matrix interactions.

In the present study, we identified immunoglobulin superfamily molecules, Nephrin and Neph3, as direct downstream targets of Ptf1a. First, the expression domains of Nephrin and Neph3 closely resembled those of Ptf1a in the developing retina, hypothalamus, cerebellum, hindbrain, and spinal cord. Second, Ptf1a bound directly to a PTF-binding motif in the 5′-flanking region of Nephrin and Neph3 genes. Third, Ptf1a activated transcription driven by the 5′-flanking region of these genes. Finally, the expression of Nephrin and Neph3 was lost in Ptf1a-null mice, whereas ectopic expression of Nephrin and Neph3 was induced by forced expression of Ptf1a. We provided further evidence that Nephrin and Neph3 could interact homophilically and heterophilically, suggesting that Nephrin and Neph3 might regulate certain developmental aspects of Ptf1a-positive neurons as homo- or heterooligomers.

In the present study, we searched for direct downstream targets of Ptf1a, which is likely to be responsible for cell fate specification of Ptf1a neurons. We identified Nephrin and Neph3 as candidates of Ptf1a target molecules. Nephrin and Neph3 are transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Nephrin was originally isolated as a gene responsible for the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (11Kestilä M. Lenkkeri U. Männikkö M. Lamerdin J. McCready P. Putaala H.

Neph3 belongs to Neph family, which is composed of Neph1, Neph2, and Neph3 (also called as Kirrel, Kirrel3/mKirre, and Kirrel2/Filtrin, respectively), and Neph family members are structurally related to Nephrin (12Sellin L.

Full-length NephrinB cDNA was cloned from mouse E13.5 cerebellum, and its sequence was deposited into DDBJ with accession number AB513652. For construction of expression vectors of NephrinA (87–3857 of NM_019459), NephrinB (1–3729 of AB513652), and Neph3 (130–2232 of BC052773), cDNAs were subcloned into pCAG vector. A HA or FLAG sequence was inserted between 200 and 201 of NephrinA (NM_019459), between 72 and 73 of NephrinB (AB513652), and between 189 and 190 of Neph3 (BC052773). For construction of expression vectors of Ptf1a (199–1173 of NM_018809), E47 (87–2033 of AF352579), RBPJ (217–1716 of NM_009035), N-Twist (66–572 of NM_033522), Math1 (196–1251 of NM_007500), and Neurogenin1 (232–966 of NM_010896), cDNAs were subcloned into pCAG or pCAG-IRES-EGFP. A HA, FLAG, or Myc tag was added in their N termini by PCR. pGL2-basic vector was obtained commercially (Promega). The 5′-flanking region of Nephrin and Neph3 genes was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of ICR mice and subcloned into pGL2-basic. The following primers were used for PCR amplification: primer 1 (5′-ATG CAA GCT TCA GAG TGC CAG GAA AGG G-3′), primer 2 (5′-GAC CAA GCT TTG TGT GTA CCC CAA GAT C-3′), and primer 3 (5′-GAC CAA GCT TGT TTG TTG CTG TC-3′). For amplification of the 1.6-kb sequence upstream of the Neph3 start codon (see Fig. 4A), primers 1 and 2 were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. For the 1.6-kb sequence upstream of the NephrinB start codon or 3.3 kb upstream of the NephrinA start codon (see Fig. 4B), primers 2 and 1, or primers 2 and 3 were used as forward and reverse primer, respectively. The E-box and the TC-box mutations were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Anti-Ptf1a antibody was described previously (9Yamada M. Terao M. Terashima T. Fujiyama T. Kawaguchi Y.

In situ hybridization was performed using DIG-labeled RNA probes of Nephrin (2738–3764 of NM_019459) and Neph3 (1037–2129 of BC052773). For fluorescent detection, samples were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody, biotinylated-tyramide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and Alexa Fluor 594-streptavidin (Molecular Probes). To couple with immunostaining, sections were first hybridized with DIG-RNA probes and immunostained with an anti-Ptf1a (30Li H. Edlund H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or an anti-GFP antibody. In utero electroporation into the cerebral cortex of E14.5 mouse embryos was described previously (26Hatanaka Y. Murakami F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 454: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Expression vectors were introduced into E14.5 ICR mice, and pregnant mice were killed 1 or 2 days later for further analyses. Cerebellum from E11.5 ICR mice was dissected out, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (31Kawauchi D. Saito T. Dev. Biol. 2008; 322: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Endogenous Ptf1a was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Ptf1a antibody (9Yamada M. Terao M. Terashima T. Fujiyama T. Kawaguchi Y. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10924-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The amount of co-precipitated DNA fragments was analyzed by quantitative PCR using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). Primers used in quantitative PCR were as follows: PTF1 motif forward (5′-GCC AGG AGT TCA GAT TTA GGT G-3′) and reverse (5′-AGG ATG GGA AAA CCA ACA GAC-3′); 1.5 kb 5′ of the PTF1 forward (5′-TCC CTC TCA CCC ACT CAC AG-3′) and reverse (5′-AGT TCA CAC TGG GTC CAA GC-3′); 1.5 kb 3′ of the PTF1 forward (5′-TAC ACA CAC TCG GGA TGC TG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCA AAC AGG GCT GTA ATG GAC-3′). EMSA was performed following the manufacturer's protocol in the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). Nuclear extracts of HA-Ptf1a-, FLAG-E47-, or Myc-RBPJ-transfected COS7 cells were prepared as described previously (32Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Forward and 3′-biotinylated reverse oligonucleotides were purchased commercially (GeneDesign). The sequence of oligonucleotides is shown in Fig. 3B. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 200 fmol of annealed biotinylated oligonucleotides. For the supershift assay, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-HA, anti-FLAG, or anti-Myc antibody. Biotinylated oligonucleotides were detected by streptavidin-AP (Jackson Laboratories) and an AP substrate, CDP star (Roche Applied Science), and chemiluminescence was analyzed by RAS3000 mini (Fuji film). Luciferase reporter assay was performed following the manufacturer's protocol in the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). pGL2-basic vector constructs and pEF-RL with or without pCAG-Ptf1a were transfected into COS7 cells by FuGENE 6 (Roche). 48 h later, the activity of the firefly and Renilla luciferases was analyzed by Luminometer (Promega). An affinity probe in situ assay using Neph3-AP was performed as described previously (18Serizawa S. Miyamichi K. Takeuchi H. Yamagishi Y. Suzuki M. Sakano H.

Binding of Neph3-AP was detected by AP activity using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. To measure the binding affinity of Neph3-AP to COS7 cells transfected with HA-Neph3 or HA-NephrinA expression vector, cells were incubated with an AP substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, for 2 h. Increase of A405 in each sample relative to that in mock-transfected samples was analyzed. COS7 cells were transfected with expression vectors by FuGENE 6 or a standard calcium phosphate method. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (13Barletta G.M. Kovari I.A. Verma R.K. Kerjaschki D. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19266-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Ptf1a is a component of a trimeric transcription factor, PTF1, which interacts with the PTF1-binding motif, comprising an E-box (CAG/CCTG) and a TC-box (TTTCCC) separated by one or two helical turns (33Cockell M. Stevenson B.J. Strubin M. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2464-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Masui T. Long Q. Beres T.M. Magnuson M.A. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2629-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Wiebe P.O. Kormish J.D. Roper V.T. Fujitani Y. Alston N.I. Zaret K.S. Wright C.V. Stein R.W. Gannon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4093-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify novel downstream targets of Ptf1a, we took advantage of a data base, DBTSS, to screen for genes containing PTF1 motif in their 5′-flanking regions. As a result, we found a PTF1 motif located in the shared 5′-flanking region of Nephrin and Neph3 genes on mouse chromosome 7 (Fig. 1). The Nephrin gene has two isoforms, NephrinA and NephrinB, resulting from utilizing alternative first exons, 1A and 1B. Thus, the PTF1 motif is located 700 bases upstream of the first exon of Neph3, and 70 bases and 1.8 kb upstream of exon 1B and exon 1A of Nephrin, respectively. If Nephrin and Neph3 are downstream targets of Ptf1a, they would be expressed in Ptf1a-positive domains. To examine this possibility, we first analyzed the expression of Nephrin and Neph3 in the developing central nervous system. Nephrin and Neph3 were expressed in overlapping regions where Ptf1a is expressed, in the cerebellum and hindbrain at E12.5, in the spinal cord at E10.5, and in the retina and hypothalamus at E13.5 (Fig. 2, supplemental Fig. 1, and data not shown). Many Ptf1a-positve cells appeared to co-express Nephrin and Neph3 (Fig. 2). Moreover, Nephrin and Neph3 were co-expressed in the same cells, which was confirmed by double labeling of Nephrin and Neph3 (data not shown). We further examined the expression of two isoforms of Nephrin in the developing cerebellum by quantitative PCR. Consistent with the previous report (36Beltcheva O. Kontusaari S. Fetissov S. Putaala H. Kilpeläinen P. Hökfelt T. Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), comparable amounts of endogenous NephrinA and B were expressed in the developing cerebellum, whereas adult kidney predominantly expressed NephrinA (supplemental Fig. 2). These results raise the possibility that Ptf1a may control the expression of Nephrin and Neph3. Because Nephrin and Neph3 genes contain the PTF1 motif in their 5′-flanking region, it is highly possible that Ptf1a controls the transcription of these genes by direct binding to the PTF1 motif. We examined this possibility by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to test whether Ptf1a in the developing cerebellum associates with the 5′-flanking region of Nephrin and Neph3 genes in vivo. Anti-Ptf1a antibody immunoprecipitated DNA fragments centered on the PTF1 motif, but not 1.5 kb upstream or downstream of the motif (Fig. 3A). This interaction could also be detected in Ptf1a-overexpressed cerebral cortex (supplemental Fig. 3). We further examined whether the interaction could be reconstituted in vitro. Beres et al. (37Beres T.M. Masui T. Swift G.H. Shi L. Henke R.M. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) reported that PTF1 complex in the pancreas comprised Ptf1a, a class A basic helix-loop-helix protein, such as E47 or HEB, and RBPL. In the developing central nervous system, RBPJ instead of RBPL is expressed and interacts with a PTF1-binding motif in vitro (37Beres T.M. Masui T. Swift G.H. Shi L. Henke R.M. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Hori K. Cholewa-Waclaw J. Nakada Y. Glasgow S.M. Masui T. Henke R.M. Wildner H. Martarelli B. Beres T.M. Epstein J.A. Magnuson M.A. MacDonald R.J. Birchmeier C. Johnson J.E. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed EMSA using oligonucleotides containing the PTF1 motif and a combination of Ptf1a, E47, and RBPJ (Fig. 3B). RBPJ or an E47 dimer could bind the PTF motif alone. However, addition of all three proteins resulted in a new shifted band associated with a heterotrimeric complex composed of Ptf1a/E47/RBPJ. The presence of Ptf1a/E47/RBPJ trimer in the shifted band was confirmed by the fact that incubation with an antibody for each component all led to a supershift of the band (Fig. 3C). Mutations in E-box abolished Ptf1a binding, whereas the mutated TC-box had no effect in its binding, suggesting that E-box is necessary for the binding of Ptf1a to the PTF1 motif (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that Ptf1a binds to the promoter region of Nephrin and Neph3 genes and this binding is dependent on the PTF1 motif. We next tested whether Ptf1a binding to the promoter region of Nephrin and Neph3 leads to trans-activation of downstream genes by using a luciferase reporter system. Expression of Ptf1a in COS7 cells strongly activated a luciferase reporter driven by the 5′-flanking region of Nephrin and Neph3 containing the PTF1 motif in both directions (Fig. 4, A and B). Note that transcriptional activation by Ptf1a could take place from both promoter fragments upstream of exon 1A and exon 1B of the Nephrin gene, albeit weaker in the former. Mutations in the E-box or TC-box, particularly the E-box, notably reduced the level of Ptf1a-dependent transactivation, suggesting that activation of the promoter depends on the successful binding of Ptf1a to the PTF1 motif. Some other members of basic helix-loop-helix, such as Math1, Neurogenin1, or N-Twist, did not enhance Ptf1a transactivity, and Ptf1a did not activate c-fos promoter (Fig. 4, C and D, and data not shown). Furthermore, co-expression of Ptf1a and E47 caused synergistic enhancement of Neph3 promoter activation (supplemental Fig. 4). To confirm the dependence of Neph3 promoter activation on Ptf1a in vivo, we performed a luciferase assay in the developing cerebellum and cerebral cortex, which are Ptf1a-positive and Ptf1a-negative areas, respectively. As shown in supplemental Fig. 4, Neph3 promoter was highly activated in the developing cerebellum compared with the cerebral cortex, indicating a correlation of the presence of Ptf1a and high activation of the Neph3 promoter. These results suggest that Ptf1a activates transcription from Nephrin and Neph3 promoter. Ptf1a interacted with the PTF1 motif, thereby inducing transactivation of the Nephrin/Neph3 promoter, raising the possibility that Ptf1a controls the expression of Nephrin and Neph3 in vivo. To assess this possibility, we first examined the expression of Nephrin and Neph3 in Ptf1a-null mice (Fig. 5, A–L, and supplemental Fig. 1). The expression of Nephrin and Neph3 was lost in the developing cerebellum, hindbrain, spinal cord, retina, and hypothalamus of the homozygotes. We next performed gain-of-function experiments by ectopically expressing Ptf1a in the developing cerebral cortex, where Ptf1a, Nephrin, and Neph3 are not endogenously expressed (data not shown). We found that ectopic Ptf1a triggered a notable induction of Nephrin and Neph3 expression (Fig. 5, M–T), but not the other Neph family members Neph1 and Neph2 (data not shown). Because Ptf1a activated transcription from exon 1A and 1B of the Nephrin gene (Fig. 4B), we further examined whether both Nephrin isoforms are induced by ectopic expression of Ptf1a in the cerebral cortex. As expected, we found induction of NephrinA and B by Ptf1a (supplemental Fig. 2). These results together suggest that Ptf1a controls the expression of two isoforms of Nephrin and Neph3 in the developing central nervous system. So far we have shown that Ptf1a simultaneously activates the transcription of Nephrin and Neph3 in subsets of neural precursors. This raises the possibility that Nephrin and Neph3 may interact and in turn control certain aspects of the fate of these cells. Indeed, heterophilic interactions between Nephrin, and Neph1 or Neph2 have been previously demonstrated (13Barletta G.M. Kovari I.A. Verma R.K. Kerjaschki D. Holzman L.B. J. Biol.

We therefore investigated any potential interaction between Nephrin and Neph3 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in COS7 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, FLAG-NephrinA was co-precipitated with co-expressed HA-Neph3 or HA-NephrinA, but not with HA-NephrinB. To examine whether NephrinA and Neph3 interact in cis on the same cell, or in trans on different cells, we performed a similar experiment using a mixture of cells transfected with each construct separately (Fig. 6B). However, NephrinA was co-precipitated with neither Neph3 nor itself in this condition. These results imply that NephrinA interacts with Neph3 as well as itself in cis. To investigate whether NephrinA-Neph3 may interact in trans, we performed an affinity probe in situ assay using Neph3-AP fusion protein (Fig. 6, C and D). Consistent with a previous report (18Serizawa S. Miyamichi K. Takeuchi H. Yamagishi Y. Suzuki M. Sakano H. Cell. 2006; 127: 1057-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), Neph3-AP bound to Neph3-expressing cells, but not to NephrinA-expressing cells. It has been shown in invertebrate that trans-interactions between Nephrin and Neph family mediate cell-cell adhesion (23Shen K. Fetter R.D. Bargmann C.I. Cell. 2004; 116: 869-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Fischbach K.F. Linneweber G.A. Andlauer T.F. Hertenstein A. Bonengel B. Chaudhary K. J. Neurogenet. 2009; 23: 48-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether NephrinA and Neph3 could mediate cell adhesion. As expected, only Neph3-expressing cells formed cell aggregates, but no aggregation was detected between Neph3- and NephrinA-expressing cells and between NephrinA-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. 5). These data, taken together, showed that NephrinA-Neph3 interactions take place in cis but not in trans, whereas Neph3 could interact homophilically in trans, thereby mediating cell adhesion. In the present study, we identified Nephrin and Neph3 as direct downstream targets of Ptf1a in the developing central nervous system. Our finding provides an important clue to unravel as yet unclarified molecular mechanisms underlying cell fate specification of Ptf1a-neurons. Henke et al. (39Henke R.M. Savage T.K. Meredith D.M. Glasgow S.M. Hori K. Dumas J. MacDonald R.J. Johnson J.E. Development. 2009; 136: 2945-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) recently reported Neurog2, itself a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a first example of downstream target of Ptf1a in the developing spinal cord. However, in contrast to Ptf1a-null mice, neurogenesis of Ptf1a-neurons is not affected in Neurog2 knock-out mice, raising the possibility that Ptf1a downstream targets other than Neurog2 are also involved in the development of Ptf1a-neurons (7Glasgow S.M. Henke R.M. MacDonald R.J. Wright C.V. Johnson J.E. Development. 2005; 132: 5461-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 40Helms A.W. Battiste J. Henke R.M. Nakada Y. Simplicio N. Guillemot F. Johnson J.E. Development. 2005; 132: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Compared with Neurog2, Nephrin and Neph3 as transmembrane proteins more likely mediate the effect of Ptf1a by directly influencing the cellular behavior of Ptf1a-neurons. Moreover, Nephrin and Neph3 were more specifically expressed in the Ptf1a-positive domains, implicating their specific function in Ptf1a-neurons (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1). Ptf1a might also control Nephrin/Neph3 expression outside the nervous system, such as islet cells in the pancreas (20Putaala H. Soininen R. Kilpeläinen P. Wartiovaara J. Tryggvason K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 41Palmén T. Ahola H. Palgi J. Aaltonen P. Luimula P. Wang S. Jaakkola I. Knip M. Otonkoski T. Holthöfer H.

Genomics. 2003; 82: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ptf1a required co-factors for binding to the promoter region of Nephrin and Neph3 and to induce full promoter activation (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 4). Our in vitro data suggest that E47 facilitates binding of Ptf1a to the promoter via the E-box, and in turn activates Nephrin/Neph3 transcription. The wide expression of E47 in the ventricular zone of the developing central nervous system supports the possibility that it acts as a co-factor for Ptf1a in vivo (data not shown). RBPJ is another factor that is necessary for the binding of Ptf1a to the promoter of Nephrin and Neph3 in vitro. However, differing from E47, RBPJ interacted with the TC-box of the PTF1 motif, and this interaction was not required for Ptf1a binding to the PTF1 motif (Fig. 3). It is possible that a direct interaction between RBPJ and Ptf1a enhances association of Ptf1a to the E-box. Indeed, this possibility is implied by an in vivo study showing that the ability of Ptf1a to interact with RBPJ is crucial for its role in the specification of GABA-ergic neurons in the dorsal spinal cord (38Hori K. Cholewa-Waclaw J. Nakada Y. Glasgow S.M. Masui T. Henke R.M. Wildner H. Martarelli B. Beres T.M. Epstein J.A. Magnuson M.A. MacDonald R.J. Birchmeier C. Johnson J.E. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ptf1a/E47/RBPJ may not be the only proteins that trans-activate Nephrin and Neph3 genes. For example, NephrinA expression in the adult kidney is controlled by a zinc finger protein, Wt1, which interacts with the 5′-flanking region of exon 1A of Nephrin gene (44Wagner N. Wagner K.D. Xing Y. Scholz H. Schedl A. J Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Transcription factors NF-κB and Sp1 are key regulators of Neph3 expression in the kidney podocytes (45Ristola M. Arpiainen S. Saleem M.A. Mathieson P.W. Welsh G.I. Lehtonen S. Holthöfer H. BMC Mol. Biol. 2009; 10: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized homophilic and heterophilic interaction of Nephrin and Neph3, which provides insights into their mechanistic cellular function. To our surprise, we failed to detect an interaction between NephrinA-expressing cells, which has been demonstrated in a previous study (19Khoshnoodi J. Sigmundsson K. Ofverstedt L.G. Skoglund U. Obrink B. Wartiovaara J. Tryggvason K. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2337-2346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A possible reason for this discrepancy may be ascribable to differences in the type of cells being used. Conformation of NephrinA necessary for trans-homophilic interaction might be regulated by its interaction with cell-type specific cytoplasmic proteins, such as CD2AP, which is expressed in the kidney podocytes but not in the brain (46Shih N.Y. Li J. Cotran R. Mundel P. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2303-2308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The function of Nephrin and Neph3 in the development of Ptf1a-neurons has yet to be determined. So far, no anatomical or morphological abnormalities have been demonstrated in the brains of NephrinA-null mice, and knock-out mice of NephrinB and Neph3 have not been reported (20Putaala H. Soininen R. Kilpeläinen P. Wartiovaara J. Tryggvason K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Neph3 is transiently expressed in early postmitotic neurons of the developing spinal cord, and intracellularly Neph3 is localized at the adherens junction between apical processes (17Minaki Y. Mizuhara E. Morimoto K. Nakatani T. Sakamoto Y. Inoue Y. Satoh K. Imai T. Takai Y. Ono Y. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 52: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Miyata et al. (47Miyata T. Kawaguchi A. Okano H. Ogawa M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) reported that early postmitotic neurons maintain their apical processes before departing the ventricle to undergo radial migration. Therefore, one may speculate that Neph3 mediates the adhesion between the Ptf1a-progenitors, which in turn is necessary for their later development, such as neuronal migration, maturation, or differentiation. Alternatively, Neph3 trans-homophilic interaction may induce intracellular signals required for further development of Ptf1a-neurons. The ability of Neph family members in triggering intracellular signaling pathway has been best demonstrated in the case of Neph1. Neph1 overexpression activates the AP-1 promoter, and this activation is further stimulated by phosphorylation of Neph1 by tyrosine kinases (12Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstädt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 48Huber T.B. Schmidts M. Gerke P. Schermer B. Zahn A. Hartleben B. Sellin L. Walz G. Benzing T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13417-13421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, clustering of Neph1 results in its own tyrosine phosphorylation and its interaction with cytoplasmic proteins (49Garg P. Verma R. Nihalani D. Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8698-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same study showed that Neph1 clustering elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of NephrinA and the recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins to the NephrinA complex (49Garg P. Verma R. Nihalani D. Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8698-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). If Neph3 acts similarly to Neph1, we may speculate that in Ptf1a-neurons, Neph3 clustering triggered by its trans-homophilic binding may induce intracellular signals both via its own cytoplasmic domain and via its cis-interaction with NephrinA in the same cells. We showed that the other isoform of Nephrin, NephrinB, is equally expressed in the cerebellum. However, its function seems less clear because NephrinB does not possess a signal peptide cleavage site in its amino-terminal region and does not localize in the plasma membrane when overexpressed in COS7 cells (36Beltcheva O. Kontusaari S. Fetissov S. Putaala H. Kilpeläinen P. Hökfelt T. Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 6). One may hypothesize that it competes with NephrinA for cytoplasmic targets, sequestering them from the membrane to the cytosol, acting as a negative modulator for the effect mediated by NephrinA. Deeper understanding of molecular mechanism underlying Ptf1a-controlled neuronal cell fate specification must await clarification of signaling cascades downstream of Nephrin and Neph3 and functional characterization of two isoforms of Nephrin.

https://openalex.org/W2063257440,"Background Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer related deaths in women. Five-year survival rates for early stage disease are greater than 94%, however most women are diagnosed in advanced stage with 5 year survival less than 28%. Improved means for early detection and reliable patient monitoring are needed to increase survival. Methodology and Principal Findings Applying mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we sought to elucidate an unanswered biomarker research question regarding ability to determine tumor burden detectable by an ovarian cancer biomarker protein emanating directly from the tumor cells. Since aggressive serous epithelial ovarian cancers account for most mortality, a xenograft model using human SKOV-3 serous ovarian cancer cells was established to model progression to disseminated carcinomatosis. Using a method for low molecular weight protein enrichment, followed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis, a human-specific peptide sequence of S100A6 was identified in sera from mice with advanced-stage experimental ovarian carcinoma. S100A6 expression was documented in cancer xenografts as well as from ovarian cancer patient tissues. Longitudinal study revealed that serum S100A6 concentration is directly related to tumor burden predictions from an inverse regression calibration analysis of data obtained from a detergent-supplemented antigen capture immunoassay and whole-animal bioluminescent optical imaging. The result from the animal model was confirmed in human clinical material as S100A6 was found to be significantly elevated in the sera from women with advanced stage ovarian cancer compared to those with early stage disease. Conclusions S100A6 is expressed in ovarian and other cancer tissues, but has not been documented previously in ovarian cancer disease sera. S100A6 is found in serum in concentrations that correlate with experimental tumor burden and with clinical disease stage. The data signify that S100A6 may prove useful in detecting and/or monitoring ovarian cancer, when used in concert with other biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2076379612,"Ectodomain shedding is a proteolytic mechanism by which a transmembrane protein is converted into a secreted form. Pmel17/gp100 is a melanocyte-specific membrane-bound glycoprotein that has amyloid characteristics and forms fibrillar structures in melanosomes after a complex sequence of post-translational processing and trafficking events, including cleavage by a furin-like proprotein convertase (PC). A secreted form of Pmel17 (termed sPmel17) was also thought to be released due to cleavage by a PC. We used multidisciplinary approaches to demonstrate that sPmel17 is released by ectodomain shedding at the juxtamembrane and/or intramembrane motif and to show that this is independent of cleavage by a PC. We further show that sPmel17 consists of 2 fragments linked by disulfide bonds and that the shedding is inhibited at low temperature but not by metalloproteinase inhibitors. Moreover, treatment with a phorbol ester or a calmodulin inhibitor induces Pmel17 shedding. We also refine the reactivity of HMB50 and NKI/beteb, 2 monoclonal antibodies commonly used as melanoma-specific markers. The fact that those antibodies require physically separated domains of Pmel17 sheds interesting light on its 3-dimensional conformation. We conclude that sPmel17 is released by regulated proteolytic ectodomain shedding.—Hoashi, T., Tamaki, K., Hearing, V. J.

This study presents detailed mutagenesis analyses of NSF-N and NSF-D1, dissecting their roles in ATP hydrolysis, SNAP·SNARE binding, and complex disassembly. Our results show that a positively charged surface on NSF-N, bounded by Arg67 and Lys105, and the conserved residues in the central pore of NSF-D1 (Tyr296 and Gly298) are involved in SNAP·SNARE binding but not basal ATP hydrolysis. Mutagenesis of Sensor 1 (Thr373–Arg375), Sensor 2 (Glu440–Glu442), and Arginine Fingers (Arg385 and Arg388) in NSF-D1 shows that each region plays a discrete role. Sensor 1 is important for basal ATPase activity and nucleotide binding. Sensor 2 plays a role in ATP- and SNAP-dependent SNARE complex binding and disassembly but does so in cis and not through inter-protomer interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2048242923,"It is generally accepted that the organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin is strongly governed by a code inherent in the genomic DNA sequence. This code, as well as other codes, is superposed on the triplets coding for amino acids. The history of the chromatin code started three decades ago with the discovery of the periodic appearance of certain dinucleotides, with AA/TT and RR/YY giving the strongest signals, all with a period of 10.4 bases. Every base-pair stack in the DNA duplex has specific deformation properties, thus favoring DNA bending in a specific direction. The appearance of the corresponding dinucleotide at the distance 10.4 xn bases will facilitate DNA bending in that direction, which corresponds to the minimum energy of DNA folding in the nucleosome. We have analyzed the periodic appearances of all 16 dinucleotides in the genomes of thirteen different eukaryotic organisms. Our data show that a large variety of dinucleotides (if not all) are, apparently, contributing to the nucleosome positioning code. The choice of the periodical dinucleotides differs considerably from one organism to another. Among other 10.4 base periodicities, a strong and very regular 10.4 base signal was observed for CG dinucleotides in the genome of the honey bee A. mellifera. Also, the dinucleotide CG appears as the only periodical component in the human genome. This observation seems especially relevant since CpG methylation is well known to modulate chromatin packing and regularity. Thus, the selection of the dinucleotides contributing to the chromatin code is species specific, and may differ from region to region, depending on the sequence context."

(R)-Roscovitine, a trisubstituted purine, has been shown to inhibit L-currents by slowing activation and enhancing inactivation. This study utilized molecular and pharmacological approaches to determine whether these effects result from (R)-roscovitine binding to a single site. Using the S enantiomer, we find that (S)-roscovitine enhances inactivation without affecting activation, which suggests multiple sites. This was further supported in studies using chimeric channels comprised of N- and L-channel domains. Those chimeras containing L-channel domains I and IV showed (R)-roscovitine-induced slowed activation like that of wild type L-channels, whereas chimeric channels containing L-channel domain I responded to (R)-roscovitine with enhanced inactivation. We conclude that (R)-roscovitine binds to distinct sites on L-type channels to slow activation and enhance inactivation. These sites appear to be unique from other calcium channel antagonist sites that reside within domains III and IV and are thus novel sites that could be exploited for future drug development.

Cardiac L-type (CaV1.2) channels are central to the regulation of a number of physiological processes (1Striessnig J. Hoda J.C. Koschak A. Zaghetto F. Müllner C. Sinnegger-Brauns M.J. Wild C.

Activation of these channels in cardiac and smooth muscle generates the calcium influx that triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (3Roden D.M. Balser J.R. George Jr., A.L. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 431-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) to induce contraction. In contrast, inactivation of these channels provides a negative feedback mechanism to limit calcium influx into the cardiac myocyte, which helps protect from excessive calcium influx that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias (3Roden D.M.

Elmslie K.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1681-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The antagonist effect appears to result from (R)-roscovitine preferentially enhancing occupancy of a “resting” inactivated state to inhibit channel activity (18Buraei Z. Elmslie K.S. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1450-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the racemic variant (S)-roscovitine has been found to exhibit only an antagonist effect on N-channels, which is one result supporting unique binding sites for the agonist versus antagonist effects (14Buraei Z. Anghelescu M. Elmslie K.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1681-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Buraei Z. Schofield G. Elmslie K.S.

L-type channels are also inhibited by (R)-roscovitine, but by a unique mechanism relative to N-channels (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). L-channel inhibition results from slowed activation and enhanced open state voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI), 3The abbreviations used are: VDIvoltage-dependent inactivationHSDhonestly significant differenceL-DI, L-DII, L-DIII, and L-DIVL-channel domains I, II, III, and IV, respectivelyN-DI, N-DII, N-DIII, and N-DIVN-channel domains I, II, III, and IV, respectivelyWTwild typeRRSAroscovitine receptor site mediating slowed activationRREIroscovitine receptor site mediating enhanced inactivation. but the resting inactivated state is not affected. These two effects were characterized by approximately equal EC50 values (∼30 μm), which suggested a single binding site. However, the Hill coefficient for (R)-roscovitine-induced slowed activation was ∼1, whereas that for enhanced inactivation was >2, which could result from multiple binding sites (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Intracellularly applied (R)-roscovitine failed to affect L-channel activity, which supported an extracellularly exposed binding site(s) mediating both effects. The differential effect of (R)-roscovitine on N-type versus L-type channels provides an opportunity to localize the L-channel binding site(s) by making chimeric channels. In addition, the differential effect of racemic roscovitine variants on N-channels led us to investigate if the L-channel site(s) also showed chiral specificity. voltage-dependent inactivation honestly significant difference L-channel domains I, II, III, and IV, respectively N-channel domains I, II, III, and IV, respectively wild type roscovitine receptor site mediating slowed activation roscovitine receptor site mediating enhanced inactivation. We found that (S)-roscovitine enhanced L-channel VDI without slowing activation, which supports separate binding sites for these effects. In addition, the chimeric channels showed that the L-channel domain I (L-DI) is both necessary and sufficient for the (R)-roscovitine-induced enhancement of VDI, but slowed activation requires both L-DI and L-DIV. These results reveal novel sites on the L-type calcium channel that can be exploited for the development of drugs that can specifically target the activation or inactivation function. Chimeric calcium channels (Fig. 1) were constructed using cDNAs encoding the rabbit cardiac L-channel (GenBankTM number X15539) and rat neuronal N-channel (GenBankTM number AF055477; generously provided by Dr. Lucie Parent) α1 subunits. Briefly, N-channel domains were amplified by PCR, subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen), excised by restriction enzyme digestion, and subcloned in frame into an engineered L-channel. The sequences of the wild type (WT) and mutant channels were aligned using Vector NTI (Invitrogen), and domain boundaries were placed in regions of high amino acid sequence homology. The engineered L-channel was generated by introducing unique AgeI and NotI sites into the intracellular linkers between the II/III (nucleotide 2751) and III/IV (nucleotide 3680) domains, respectively, using silent mutagenesis via the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A unique XbaI site was introduced at nucleotide 4633 in the C terminus of the engineered channel using a similar strategy. The overall integrity of the engineered L-channel and each chimera was confirmed by qualitative restriction enzyme digests, DNA sequence analyses, Western blot analysis, and patch clamp electrophysiology . The chimeric channels were constructed as described below. For NNLL, L-DI and L-DII (Met1–Asn917) were replaced by N-DI and N-DII (Met1–Asn1134). N-DI and N-DII were amplified from full-length CaV2.2 and subcloned into the HindIII/AgeI sites of the engineered L-channel. For LLNN, L-DIII and L-DIV (Leu895–Leu2171) were replaced by N-DIII and N-DIV (Asp1112–Cys2333). The construction of this chimera did not utilize the engineered L-channel containing the introduced AgeI and NotI sites. Instead, a XbaI site at nucleotide 2678 was introduced into the L-channel, resulting in a missense mutation of a glutamate to arginine at position 894. For NLLL, L-DI (Met1–Cys519) was replaced by N-DI (Met1–Pro447). The insert for this chimera was constructed via overlap extension PCR. Briefly, N-DI and L-DII were amplified from full-length CaV2.2 and CaV1.2, respectively. The PCR products of these two domains contain a small region of overlap. They were then combined and used as templates in a second round of PCR. The final PCR product was subcloned into the HindIII/AgeI sites of the engineered L-channel. For LNLL, L-DII (Ala524–Val781) was replaced by N-DII (Ser452–Val909). This chimera was constructed using a strategy similar to that described for NLLL above. For LLNL, N-DIII (Arg1137–Ala1443) was amplified from full-length CaV2.2 and ligated into the AgeI/NotI sites of the engineered L-channel, thereby replacing L-DIII (Arg920–Ala1226). For LLLN, N-DIV (Pro1445–Ile1741) was amplified from full-length CaV2.2 and ligated into the NotI/BstEII sites of the engineered L-channel, thereby replacing L-DIV (Pro1228–Ile1542). For LNNL, N-DII and N-DIII were amplified from CaV2.2 with a 5′ primer containing an AscI site and a 3′ primer containing a NotI site, excised with AscI/NotI, and subcloned into the AscI/Not sites of LLNL. For LNNN, N-DIV was excised with NotI/XbaI from LLLN and subcloned into the NotI/XbaI sites of LNNL. For NNNL, N-DI was excised with HindIII/AscI from NLLL and subcloned into the HindIII/AscI sites of LNNL. For NNLN, N-DIV was excised with NotI/XbaI from LLLN and subcloned into the NotI/XbaI sites of NNLL. For NLLN, N-DI was excised with HindIII/AscI from NLLL and subcloned into the HindIII/AscI sites of LLLN. For L(l/n)LL, L-DII transmembrane segments 1–4 were amplified with a 5′ primer containing an AscI site and a 3′ primer (5′-ACC AGG TTC CTC AGG GAG TTC CAG TAC CTT GTA ATT TTG-3′) using NLLL as template, and N-DII transmembrane segments 5 and 6 with N-type intracellular linker between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 were amplified with a 5′ primer (5′-ATT ACA AGG TAC TGG AAC TCC CTG AGG AAC CTG GTT G-3′) and a 3′ primer lying downstream of an existing BfrI site in the WT α1C plasmid (pCDNA3). The final overlap PCR products were amplified using the above 5′ primer containing an AscI site and the above 3′ primer lying downstream of an existing BfrI site. The resulting PCR products were excised with AscI/BfrI and subcloned into the AscI/BfrI sites of LNLL to make L(l/n)LL. For LN*LL (also known as L(n/l)LL), N-DII transmembrane segments 1–4 were amplified with a 5′ primer containing an AscI site and a 3′ primer (5′-CAG GTT GCT CAA GGA GTT CCA ATA CTT GGT GAC TTT GAA AAT CCT CAG-3′) using LNLL as template, and L-DII transmembrane segments 5 and 6 with an L-type intracellular linker between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 were amplified with a 5′ primer (5′-GTC ACC AAG TAT TGG AAC TCC TTG AGC AAC CTG GTG GCC-3′) and a 3′ primer lying downstream of an existing BfrI site in WT α1C plasmid (pCDNA3). The final overlap PCR products were amplified using the above 5′ primer containing an AscI site and the above 3′ primer lying downstream of an existing BfrI site. The resulting PCR products were excised with AscI/BfrI and subcloned into the AscI/BfrI sites of LNLL to make L(n/l)LL. For LN*NN (also known as L(n/l)NN), first L-DIV in LLNL was replaced by N-DIV from LLLN to make a different LLNN maintaining the engineered unique AgeI site between the II and III domains, NotI sites between the III and IV domains, and XbaI site just after domain IV. Then the chimera domain II n/l was excised with AscI/BfrI from L(n/l)LL and subcloned into the AscI/BfrI sites of LLNN to make L(n/l)NN. For LN*NL (also known as L(n/l)NL), the fragment containing the chimera domain II n/l and N-DIII was excised with AscI/NotI from L(n/l)NN and ligated into the AscI/NotI sites of LNNL to make L(n/l)NL. The mutation and integrity of the mutant cDNAs was confirmed by qualitative restriction map analysis and directional DNA sequence analysis of the entire subcloned region. Functional expression of the mutant cDNAs was confirmed by Western blot analysis and patch clamp electrophysiology. We utilized either the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or Lipofectamine 2000 (following the manufacturer's directions) to transfect HEK 293 cells with WT L-, N-, and chimeric channels, which provided highly reproducible expression 24–72 h after transfection. HEK293 cells were maintained in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixtures (regular medium) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293 cells were transfected with cDNA plasmids using the following molar ratio: 1 α1 subunit (L-, N-, or chimeric channel):1 α2δ:1 β1b:1 TAG (to increase expression efficiency):0.2 green fluorescent protein (to visualize transfected cells). The transfected cells were split next day into 35-mm dishes that served as the recording chamber. Cells were voltage-clamped using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Pipettes were pulled from Schott 8250 glass (Garner Glass, Claremont, CA) on a Sutter P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA). Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and digitized with the ITC-18 data acquisition interface (Instrutech Corp., Port Washington, NY). Experiments were controlled by a Power Macintosh G3 computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) running S5 data acquisition software written by Dr. Stephen Ikeda (NIAAA, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Leak current was subtracted online using a P/4 protocol. All recordings were carried out at room temperature, and the holding potential was −120 mV. Whole-cell currents were digitized depending on test step duration at 50 (25 ms), 10 (200 ms), and 4 (1000 ms) kHz after analog filtering at 1–10 kHz. Data were analyzed using IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) running on a Macintosh computer. Step currents were measured as the average of 1 ms at the end of the voltage step. Activation τ (τAct) was determined by fitting a single exponential function to the step current after a 0.3-ms delay (15Buraei Z. Schofield G. Elmslie K.S. Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Inactivation τ (τInact) was determined by fitting a single exponential function from peak step current to the end of the step. The effect of roscovitine on inactivation of L-type or chimeric calcium channels was measured by using either 200- or 1000-ms voltage steps. The magnitude of inactivation was measured from either the IEnd/IPeak ratio, where IEnd was measured at the end of the step and IPeak was peak current, or as the IPost/IPre ratio from a triple pulse protocol consisting of identical 25-ms pre- and postpulse steps (to elicit peak current) bracketing a 200-ms test pulse to voltages ranging from −120 to +80 mV. Group data were calculated as mean ± S.D. throughout the paper. A paired t test was used for within-cell comparisons. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's HSD post hoc test was used to test for differences among three or more independent groups. The internal pipette solution contained 104 mm NMG-Cl, 14 mm creatine-PO4, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NMG-HEPES, 5 mm Tris-ATP, 0.3 mm Tris-GTP, and 10 mm NMG-EGTA with osmolarity of 280 mosm and pH 7.3. The external recording solution contained 30 mm BaCl2, 100 mm NMG-Cl, 10 mm NMG-HEPES, osmolarity of 300 mosm, and pH 7.3. We used Ba2+ as the permeant ion to exclude Ca2+-dependent inactivation (25Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 26Peterson B.Z. Lee J.S. Mulle J.G. Wang Y. de Leon M. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1906-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), since we have previously demonstrated that (R)-roscovitine enhances VDI but does not affect calcium-dependent inactivation (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both (R)- and (S)-roscovitine were prepared as a 50 mm stock solution in DMSO and stored at −30 °C. All external solutions contained the same DMSO concentration so that the roscovitine concentration was the sole variable when changing solutions. Test solutions were applied from a gravity-fed perfusion system with an exchange time of 1–2 s. All experiments utilized (R)-roscovitine from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA) and (S)-roscovitine from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, 100× antibiotic/antimycotic, and Lipofectamine 2000 were from Invitrogen. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. We have shown that (R)-roscovitine significantly slows activation and enhances inactivation of L-type channels and hypothesized that a single extracellular binding site mediated both effects (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We further investigated this idea by examining the effect of (S)-roscovitine on L-type channels, which was useful in differentiating multiple roscovitine binding sites on N-type channels (15Buraei Z. Schofield G. Elmslie K.S. Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Cho S. Meriney S.D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 3200-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Buraei Z. Elmslie K.S. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1450-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using 25-ms voltage steps to +20 mV, we verified that 100 μm (R)-roscovitine slowed L-channel activation (15Buraei Z. Schofield G. Elmslie K.S. Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). However, the activation rate was not altered by the application of 100 μm (S)-roscovitine (Fig. 2A), which was estimated by fitting the +20 mV step current using a single exponential function to generate τAct. The average change in τAct induced by (S)-roscovitine was 8.6 ± 8.5% (±S.D., n = 7), whereas the (R)-roscovitine-induced increase of τAct was 148.6 ± 24.8% (n = 9, p < 0.001; Fig. 2C). Thus, the L-channel binding site involved with slowed activation shows stereo-selectivity for roscovitine. The inability of (S)-roscovitine to slow L-channel activation could be explained by low affinity of a single roscovitine binding site for the S enantiomer. If this were true, inactivation should also be insensitive to (S)-roscovitine. This hypothesis was tested using 1000-ms voltage steps to +30 mV to measure VDI (30 mm Ba2+). Fig. 3 shows typical L-current traces recorded from the same cell exposed to either 100 μm (S)- or (R)-roscovitine. The speed of inactivation (τInact) was determined from single exponential fits to the inactivating portion of the current (peak to end). Counter to our hypothesis, (S)-roscovitine increased inactivation to a degree similar to that of (R)-roscovitine (Fig. 3). (S)-Roscovitine decreased τInact from 591 ± 133 to 220 ± 11 ms (p < 0.05, n = 3), whereas τInact was decreased from 504 ± 84 to 216 ± 7 ms (p < 0.05, n = 3) by (R)-roscovitine (Fig. 3B). There was no significant difference in τInact between (S)-roscovitine and (R)-roscovitine. The L-channel binding site that mediates roscovitine-induced enhancement of inactivation does not show stereo-selectivity. The effect of (S)-roscovitine on the voltage dependence of inactivation was determined using a three-pulse protocol where the ratio of the postpulse/prepulse (25 ms, +30 mV) current (IPost/IPre) was used to monitor inactivation induced by 200-ms inactivating steps ranging in voltage from −120 to +80 mV. Under control conditions (30 mm Ba2+), the inactivation versus voltage relationship was U-shaped (Fig. 3C), which was more prominent than we observed previously using 10 mm Ba2+ (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is unknown, but as we did with our previous data, we fit the inactivation versus voltage data from −120 to +50 mV (peak inactivation) using a single Boltzmann equation (Fig. 3C). (S)-Roscovitine increased the magnitude of inactivation so that the inactivation versus voltage relationship became less U-shaped. Maximal inactivation from the Boltzmann fit increased from 0.19 ± 0.01 in control and 0.18 ± 0.02 for recovery to 0.66 ± 0.03 by (S)-roscovitine. Boltzmann fitting of the IPost/IPre versus voltage relationship showed a small (∼5 mV) (S)-roscovitine-induced right shift in half-inactivation voltage (V½) and a small (e-fold/4 mV) decrease in slope (Fig. 3C) that was also observed with (R)-roscovitine (see Fig. 6A). Maximal inactivation was increased from 0.23 in control to 0.67 in (R)-roscovitine, which is very similar to our observations with (S)-roscovitine. These results suggest that the L-channel site mediating enhanced inactivation does not differentiate between (R)- and (S)-roscovitine. The dose-response relationship of (R)-roscovitine showed similar EC50 values for both slowed activation and enhanced inactivation (20–30 μm), which supported a single binding site (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the Hill coefficient was close to 1 (1.2) for slowed activation, whereas that for enhanced inactivation was >2 (2.3), which suggested separate binding sites for these two effects. The differential sensitivity of slowed activation for (R)- versus (S)-roscovitine supports the latter idea. We further investigated the enhanced inactivation by determining the EC50 for (S)-roscovitine. Inactivation was measured as the IEnd/IPeak ratio calculated from 200-ms steps to +25 mV. (S)-Roscovitine increased inactivation in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 100 μm, but the response to 300 μm was reproducibly reduced relative to that of 100 μm. This effect was also observed in (R)-roscovitine (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The dose-response data were fit (0–100 μm) using the Hill equation to yield EC50 = 41.1 ± 0.1 μm and a Hill coefficient of 4.47 ± 0.03 (Fig. 4). Both of these values are larger than that obtained from (R)-roscovitine (19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One thing that is clear from these data is that the binding site mediating enhanced inactivation shows a Hill coefficient of >2, suggesting positive cooperativity. One explanation for this cooperativity is that roscovitine selectively binds to inactivated channels to enhance VDI. We were interested in localizing the L-type channel structures that mediate both roscovitine-induced effects to further investigate the hypothesis of multiple roscovitine binding sites. We focused on a chimeric strategy that had been previously exploited to determine DHP binding sites on L-type channels (20Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) but needed to establish that the (R)-roscovitine effect on L-channels was unique. We had previously demonstrated that (R)-roscovitine uniquely affected L-channel activation because N-channel activation was slowed only at voltages of <0 mV and L-channel activation was slowed at all voltages (14Buraei Z. Anghelescu M. Elmslie K.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1681-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Yarotskyy V. Elmslie K.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, our recordings of native N-current (bullfrog sympathetic neurons) showed enhanced inactivation during voltage steps (peak current) (14Buraei Z. Anghelescu M. Elmslie K.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1681-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our data from N-type channels expressed in HEK293 cells failed to reproduce those results (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Inactivation during 200-ms steps to +30 mV was not enhanced (Fig. 5B), and the mean IPost/IPre ratio was not changed at any voltage by 100 μm (R)-roscovitine (Fig. 6B). Single Boltzmann equation fits from −120 mV to peak inactivation (+10 mV) yielded maximum inactivation of 0.48 ± 0.05 in control versus 0.47 ± 0.03 (±S.D., n = 6, not significant) in (R)-roscovitine. Thus, (R)-roscovitine does not enhance U-type inactivation of N-type calcium channels (21Goo Y.S. Lim W. Elmslie K.S. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) expressed in HEK293 cells. These"

This study proposes a role for insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in male germ cell apoptosis. Groups of adult Sprague-Dawley male rats received one of the following treatments for 5 days: (i) daily intratesticular (IT) injections with saline (control); (ii) a single subcutaneous injection of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-A), acyline, on day 1 and a daily IT injection of saline; (iii) daily IT injection of IGFBP-3; and (iv) a GnRH-A injection on day 1 and a daily IT injection of IGFBP-3. Germ cell apoptosis increased significantly after IGFBP-3 or GnRH-A treatment which was further enhanced by the combined treatment. After co-immunoprecipitation with BAX antibody, IGFBP-3 association with BAX was demonstrated in total and mitochondrial fractions but not in the cytosol of testis extracts. BAX-associated IGFBP-3 expression was increased in mitochondria after treatment compared with control, which was confirmed by an IGFBP-3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dot blot studies further validated the BAX-IGFBP-3 binding in vitro. IGFBP-3 as well as BAX induced release of cytochrome c and DIABLO from isolated testicular mitochondria in vitro. IGFBP-3, when combined with an ineffective dose of BAX, triggered release of these proteins from isolated mitochondria at a 4-fold lower dose than IGFBP-3 alone. Our data demonstrate that the IGFBP-3 and BAX interaction activates germ cell apoptosis via the mitochondria-dependent pathway. This represents a novel pathway regulating germ call homeostasis that may have significance for male fertility and testicular disease."

It is linked to the maintenance of ubiquitin levels, but the mechanism by which it accomplishes this is unclear. The C-terminal PUL (PLAP, Ufd3p, and Lub1p) domain of PLAA binds p97, an AAA ATPase, which among other functions helps transfer ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. In yeast, loss of Doa1 is suppressed by altering p97/Cdc48 function indicating that physical interaction between PLAA and p97 is functionally important. Although the overall regions of interaction between these proteins are known, the structural basis has been unavailable. We solved the high resolution crystal structure of the p97-PLAA complex showing that the PUL domain forms a 6-mer Armadillo-containing domain. Its N-terminal extension folds back onto the inner curvature forming a deep ridge that is positively charged with residues that are phylogenetically conserved. The C terminus of p97 binds in this ridge, where the side chain of p97-Tyr805, implicated in phosphorylation-dependent regulation, is buried. Expressed in doa1Δ null cells, point mutants of the yeast ortholog Doa1 that disrupt this interaction display slightly reduced ubiquitin levels, but unlike doa1Δ null cells, showed only some of the growth phenotypes.

These data suggest that the p97-PLAA interaction is important for a subset of PLAA-dependent biological processes and provides a framework to better understand the role of these complex molecules in the ubiquitin system."
https://openalex.org/W1969829061,"UDP-galactopyranose mutases (UGM) are the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of UDP-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf) from UDP-galactopyranose (UDP-Galp). The enzyme, encoded by the glf gene, is present in bacteria, parasites, and fungi that express Galf in their glycoconjugates. Recently, a UGM homologue encoded by the cj1439 gene has been identified in Campylobacter jejuni 11168, an organism possessing no Galf-containing glycoconjugates. However, the capsular polysaccharide from this strain contains a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactofuranose (GalfNAc) moiety. Using an in vitro high performance liquid chromatography assay and complementation studies, we characterized the activity of this UGM homologue. The enzyme, which we have renamed UDP-N-acetylgalactopyranose mutase (UNGM), has relaxed specificity and can use either UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc as a substrate. Complementation studies of mutase knock-outs in C. jejuni 11168 and Escherichia coli W3110, the latter containing Galf residues in its lipopolysaccharide, demonstrated that the enzyme recognizes both UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc in vivo. A homology model of UNGM and site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of two active site amino acid residues involved in the recognition of the UDP-GalNAc substrate. The specificity of UNGM was characterized using a two-substrate co-incubation assay, which demonstrated, surprisingly, that UDP-Gal is a better substrate than UDP-GalNAc."
https://openalex.org/W1979743978,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction initiates a signaling cascade that culminates in a transient DNA damage response. During this time, host DNA repair proteins convert the linear single-strand AAV genomes to double-strand circular monomers and concatemers in processes stimulated by the AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). As the orientation of AAV genome concatemerization appears unbiased, the likelihood of concatemerization in a desired orientation is low (less than 1 in 6). Using a novel recombineering method, Oligo-Assisted AAV Genome Recombination (OAGR), this work demonstrates the ability to direct concatemerization specifically to a desired orientation in human cells. This was achieved by a single-strand DNA oligonucleotide (oligo) displaying homology to distinct AAV genomes capable of forming an intermolecular bridge for recombination. This DNA repair process results in concatemers with genomic junctions corresponding to the sequence of oligo homology. Furthermore, OAGR was restricted to single-strand, not duplexed, AAV genomes suggestive of replication-dependent recombination. Consistent with this process, OAGR demonstrated oligo polarity biases in all tested configurations except when a portion of the oligo targeted the ITR. This approach, in addition to being useful for the elucidation of intermolecular homologous recombination, may find eventual relevance for AAV mediated large gene therapy."

Unlike other ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases that catalyze a two-electron reduction, PcyA sequentially reduces D-ring (exo) and A-ring (endo) vinyl groups of biliverdin IXα (BV) to yield phycocyanobilin, a key pigment precursor of the light-harvesting antennae complexes of red algae, cyanobacteria, and cryptophytes. To address the structural basis for the reduction regiospecificity of PcyA, we report new high resolution crystal structures of bilin substrate complexes of PcyA from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, all of which lack exo-vinyl reduction activity. These include the BV complex of the E76Q mutant as well as substrate-bound complexes of wild-type PcyA with the reaction intermediate 181,182-dihydrobiliverdin IXα (18EtBV) and with biliverdin XIIIα (BV13), a synthetic substrate that lacks an exo-vinyl group. Although the overall folds and the binding sites of the U-shaped substrates of all three complexes were similar with wild-type PcyA-BV, the orientation of the Glu-76 side chain, which was in close contact with the exo-vinyl group in PcyA-BV, was rotated away from the bilin D-ring. The local structures around the A-rings in the three complexes, which all retain the ability to reduce the A-ring of their bound pigments, were nearly identical with that of wild-type PcyA-BV. Consistent with the proposed proton-donating role of the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu-76 for exo-vinyl reduction, these structures reveal new insight into the reduction regiospecificity of PcyA.

https://openalex.org/W2038480279,"The Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) is a transcription factor ubiquitously expressed in the brain. Activation of brain GRs by high levels of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones modifies a large variety of physiological and pathological-related behaviors. Unfortunately the specific cellular targets of GR-mediated behavioral effects of GC are still largely unknown. To address this issue, we generated a mutated form of the GR called DeltaGR. DeltaGR is a constitutively transcriptionally active form of the GR that is localized in the nuclei and activates transcription without binding to glucocorticoids. Using the tetracycline-regulated system (Tet-OFF), we developed an inducible transgenic approach that allows the expression of the DeltaGR in specific brain areas. We focused our study on a mouse line that expressed DeltaGR almost selectively in the glutamatergic neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. This restricted expression of the DeltaGR increased anxiety-related behaviors without affecting other behaviors that could indirectly influence performance in anxiety-related tests. This behavioral phenotype was also associated with an up-regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway and Egr-1 protein in the DG. These findings identify glutamatergic neurons in the DG as one of the cellular substrate of stress-related pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2068313507,"Pediatric Crohn's disease is a chronic auto inflammatory bowel disorder affecting children under the age of 17 years. A putative etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with disregulation of immune response to antigens commonly present in the gut microenvironment. Heat shock proteins (HSP) have been identified as ubiquitous antigens with the ability to modulate inflammatory responses associated with several autoimmune diseases. The present study tested the contribution of immune responses to HSP in the amplification of autoimmune inflammation in chronically inflamed mucosa of pediatric CD patients. Colonic biopsies obtained from normal and CD mucosa were stimulated with pairs of Pan HLA-DR binder HSP60-derived peptides (human/bacterial homologues). The modulation of RNA and protein levels of induced proinflammatory cytokines were measured. We identified two epitopes capable of sustaining proinflammatory responses, specifically TNF〈 and IFN© induction, in the inflamed intestinal mucosa in CD patients. The responses correlated positively with clinical and histological measurements of disease activity, thus suggesting a contribution of immune responses to HSP in pediatric CD site-specific mucosal inflammation."

Nevertheless, these proposed functions of putative CstF-64 domains have not been demonstrated in vivo due to the absence of a straightforward assay system (cf. Ref. 52Hague L.K. Hall-Pogar T. Lutz C.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 419: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We present here the stem-loop luciferase assay for polyadenylation (SLAP) that allows structure-function studies of CstF-64 in vivo. In SLAP, the downstream G/U-rich sequence element of a luciferase reporter gene is replaced with two copies of the MS2 bacteriophage stem-loop element (37Maciolek N.L. McNally M.T. Virology. 2008; 374: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This modification makes luciferase expression dependent on co-expression of CstF-64 that is fused with the MS2 coat protein RNA-binding domain (53Lago H. Fonseca S.A. Murray J.B. Stonehouse N.J. Stockley P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this in vivo assay, varying levels of luciferase expression correlate with changes in mRNA polyadenylation. Using SLAP, we show that three domains of CstF-64, the RBD, Hinge, and CTD, are essential for polyadenylation in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the Hinge domain of CstF-64 is necessary for both its interaction with CstF-77 and nuclear localization. Consequently, we propose a model for CstF formation and nuclear import in which interaction of CstF-64 with CstF-77 is an important early step in nuclear pre-mRNA polyadenylation. Human CstF-64 cloned in-frame with the MS2 RNA-binding domain and three copies of the FLAG epitope (MS2-CstF-64) was a kind gift from Nicole Maciolek and Mark McNally (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI (37Maciolek N.L. McNally M.T. Virology. 2008; 374: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). CstF-64 deletions were generated by PCR from MS2-CstF-64 and cloned into p3×FLAG7.1 using NotI, BglII, and KpnI restriction enzymes. Primer sequences for ΔRBD, ΔHinge, ΔP/G, ΔMEARA, ΔCTD, Δ96–156, Δ157–215, Δ96–126, and Δ186–216 are listed in supplemental Table 1. MS2-CstF-64Y85A-L86S was generated through site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX, supplemental Table 1). The SL-Luc luciferase reporter was generated by removing the SV40 polyadenylation cassette from pRL-SV40 (Promega, Madison, WI) using NotI and ClaI. Then a SV40 polyadenylation cassette with MS2 stem loops replacing the G/U-rich downstream sequence element was cloned in by PCR from p3Z SVL-MS2, obtained from N. Maciolek and M. McNally, also using NotI and ClaI (primers listed in supplemental Table 1). To generate the SL-LucΔSL vector, the SL-Luc vector was cut with XmaI and ClaI, and the ends were filled in using Klenow polymerase and ligated together. The SL-LucAGGAGA was generated through site-directed mutagenesis of the SL-Luc plasmid using the QuikChange kit. MS2-CstF-64ΔHinge+NLS was generated by cloning three copies of the SV40 NLS (oligonucleotide sequence listed in supplemental Table 1) into the MS2-CstF-64ΔHinge plasmid between the 3×FLAG epitope and the MS2-RBD using Cla1 and Not1. The MS2-Hinge-GFP, MS2-GFP, and NLS-MS2-GFP plasmids were generated from MS2-CstF-64ΔRBD and MS2-CstF-64ΔHinge+NLS using primers with ends containing ApaI and XhoI restriction sites (supplemental Table 1). These PCR products were then cloned into pAcGFP-N1 (Clontech) using ApaI and XhoI restriction sites. HeLa cells were used in all transfection experiments. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Thermo Scientific HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). All transfections were done using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) at 7 μl/μg of transfected DNA. HeLa cells were plated on 24-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 12 ng of luciferase reporter (SL-Luc, SL-LucΔSL, or SL-LucAGGAGA), 4 ng of pGL3-Control (firefly luciferase plasmid, Promega), and either no additional plasmid (for the SL-Luc transfections) or 100 ng of CstF-64 expression plasmid (MS2-CstF-64 or mutant) per well. p3XFLAG 7.1 was co-transfected with each experiment to equilibrate the total transfected DNA to 250 ng. Cells were grown for 48 h after transfection and lysed in 100 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). The extracts were then used in a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Each experimental expression plasmid (MS2-CstF-64 or mutant) data point was done in triplicate, and experiments were repeated five times with the results of the Renilla luciferase/firefly luciferase averaged; the results were normalized to the densitometry of the expressed protein for each data point, and statistics were performed using the InStat computer program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Analysis of variance was performed on each group, and variance between group members was determined using a Tukey's post test. HeLa cells were plated onto glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) in 12-well plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well. They were transfected with 500 ng of each MS2-CstF-64 expression plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were grown for 48 h after transfection, and then coverslips were transferred to a PBS bath followed by a 30-min incubation in PBS, 3.7% formaldehyde. Coverslips were washed for 10 min in PBS, 1% Triton X-100 followed by two washes in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. They were then incubated for at least 1 h in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin with a 1:6,000 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F1804, Sigma), washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated for at least 1 h using either an Alexa Fluor 488 or an Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen Molecular Probes) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were washed three more times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min and twice with distilled water, mounted onto microscope slides, and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV microscope with an Attoarc lamp (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY). Images were taken using a digital camera along with the Metamorph imaging software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Downingtown, PA). The anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma (M2, F1804), and the anti-CstF-64 (3A7) monoclonal antibody was described previously (54Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28687-28698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the 17 amino acids at the C terminus of human CstF-77 and was the generous gift of Dr. Elizabeth Mandart (Centre de Recherches de Biochimie Macromoléculaire, Montpellier, France). After transfection, six wells of cells were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 300 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's directions, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 25 μl of double distilled H2O. 10 μg of cytoplasmic RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) before cDNA synthesis. 2 μg of DNase-treated cytoplasmic RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using SMART Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Clontech) and oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction. The cDNA samples were analyzed on a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) in triplicate for each sample using the iTaqTM SYBR® Green supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad), forward and reverse primers for SL-Luc or pGL3-Control (57Yang Y. Ho S.C. Yap M.G. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009; 102: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1), and 1 μl of cDNA. The PCR cycling conditions were 95 °C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 45 s. The threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined using 7500 SDS software (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using the 2−ΔCt method. The 2−ΔCt values represent the expression level of SL-Luc relative to pGL3-Control. 500 ng of DNase-treated cytoplasmic RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using SMART Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Clontech) and 3′-CDS primer A in a 10-μl reaction. cDNA was diluted in 100 μl of 10 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA. A 10-μl PCR reaction was prepared by mixing 1 μl of 30 mm PCR buffer (30 mm MgCl2/sucrose-cresol red, Idaho Technology), 0.2 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 0.5 μl of 10× universal primer A mix, 0.5 μl of 10 μm gene-specific primer, 0.3 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 1 μl of cDNA, and 6.5 μl of double distilled H2O. The PCR was performed using one cycle of 94 °C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0 s, 68 °C for 0 s, and 72 °C for 40 s with a final 3 min at 72 °C. The PCR reaction was diluted 10-fold with double distilled H2O. The PCR process was repeated as described above using 0.5 μl of 10 μm nested universal primer A, 0.5 μl of 10 μm nested gene-specific primer, and 1 μl of diluted PCR product. 2.5 × 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 8 μg of the MS2-CstF-64 expression plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 μg/ml E160 protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). The tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min, NaCl was added to 150 mm, and the tubes were left on ice for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 15 min at 4 °C, 100 μl of extract was removed for later analysis by SDS-PAGE, and the rest was moved to a tube containing 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 agarose (F2426, Sigma) prewashed with 1 ml of NET-2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100). The tubes were incubated while rotating for at least 2 h at 4 °C. The tubes were then centrifuged at 9,300 RCF for 1 min. 100 μl of each supernatant was kept as the unbound fraction. The agarose bead pellet was washed eight times with 1 ml of ice-cold NET-2, centrifuged at 9,300 RCF after each wash. After the last wash, the entire wash buffer was removed, and 100 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer (15% (v/v) glycerol, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added to the beads and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The beads were then centrifuged at 9,300 RCF for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred into sample buffer, and a portion was run on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. We developed a new in vivo polyadenylation assay (SLAP) based on the in vitro system used to study retroviral polyadenylation (37Maciolek N.L. McNally M.T. Virology. 2008; 374: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For SLAP, the downstream sequence G/U-rich element of a luciferase reporter gene polyadenylation region was replaced with two copies of the MS2 replicase stem-loop element (53Lago H. Fonseca S.A. Murray J.B. Stonehouse N.J. Stockley P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (SL-Luc, Fig. 1, A and B). Lacking an efficient downstream sequence element, expression of this modified reporter gene was very low. Luciferase expression could be increased, however, by co-expression of a CstF-64 fusion protein containing the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein RNA-binding domain (MS2-CstF-64, Fig. 1, B and C) that allows binding of MS2-CstF-64 and to the MS2 stem-loop element, thus substituting for endogenous CstF-64. For detection and quantification (see “Experimental Procedures”), MS2-CstF-64 constructs also contained a 3×FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus (58Hernan R. Heuermann K. Brizzard B. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test whether expression of SL-Luc depended upon co-expression of MS2-CstF-64, we transfected HeLa cells with SL-Luc in the absence or presence of the MS2-CstF-64 plasmid (Fig. 1D). In the absence of MS2-CstF-64, relative expression of Renilla luciferase was minimal (Fig. 1D, bar 1). Co-expression of MS2-CstF-64 resulted in about a 10-fold increase in luciferase expression (bar 2). To confirm that this increased expression was due to a direct interaction of the MS2-CstF-64 with the stem-loop RNA element, we created a mutated MS2-CstF-64 in which two amino acids in the MS2-RBD were mutated to prevent its association with the stem loops (MS2-CstF-64Y85A-L86S, bar 3) (59Valegârd K. Murray J.B. Stonehouse N.J. van den Worm S. Stockley P.G. Liljas L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the absence or presence of MS2-CstF-64, SL-LucΔSL (from which the stem loops of SL-Luc were removed, bars 4 and 5), expression was indistinguishable from background, demonstrating that interaction of MS2-CstF-64 with the stem loops of SL-Luc was essential for luciferase gene expression. To test whether SLAP depended upon polyadenylation sequence elements, we generated SL-LucAGGAGA, in which the efficient AAUAAA polyadenylation signal was mutated to the less efficient AGGAGA (60Wilusz J. Pettine S.M. Shenk T. Nucleic Acids Research. 1989; 17: 3899-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 61Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Research. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Expression of this construct was minimal in the absence (bar 6) and in the presence (bar 7) of MS2-CstF-64, suggesting that MS2-CstF-64-dependent expression of SL-Luc could be directly correlated with efficiency of polyadenylation. SLAP quantifies luciferase protein expression in response to changes in the polyadenylation region. To determine whether these changes reflected changes in mRNA production, we measured cytoplasmic mRNA levels directly using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) at the same time as SLAP was performed (Fig. 2A). As before (Fig. 1D), in the absence of MS2-CstF-64, relative luciferase activity was low (Fig. 2A, bar 1). Similarly, the mRNA level of SL-Luc was low (Fig. 2B, bar 1). Co-expression with MS2-CstF-64 resulted in an increase of SL-Luc luciferase activity (Fig. 2A, bar 1) and mRNA (Fig. 2B, bar 2), whereas upon co-expression with MS2-CstF-64Y85A-L86S, SL-Luc luciferase and mRNA levels remained low (bar 3). Expression of SL-LucΔSL or SL-LucAGGAGA in the absence or presence of MS2-CstF-64 similarly resulted in low luciferase and mRNA levels (bars 4–7). Comparing the SLAP and qRT-PCR data showed a large correlation (r = 0.9594), suggesting that the SLAP values strongly reflected mRNA levels resulting from changes in polyadenylation. To confirm that the mRNAs made by SLAP resulted from polyadenylation of the SL-Luc mRNA, we performed 3′ RACE on SL-Luc mRNA product (Fig. 2D). The specific 3′ RACE product was excised, cloned, and sequenced, confirming that it represented cleavage and polyadenylation at the correct site in SL-Luc (not shown). Prior in vitro studies predicted probable roles of distinct domains of CstF-64 (45Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 50Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 1403-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We decided to test whether individual domains of CstF-64 were essential for polyadenylation in vivo. Hence, deletion constructs of MS2-CstF-64 were generated (Fig. 3A), SLAP was performed by co-transfection of MS2-CstF-64 or each of the domain deletion constructs with the SL-Luc reporter, and luciferase levels were determined after normalization to MS2-CstF-64 expression (Fig. 3B). Transfection of the SL-Luc reporter plasmid alone resulted in low luciferase activity (Fig. 3B, bar 1), whereas co-transfection of SL-Luc with MS2-CstF-64 resulted in significantly higher levels (bar 2). However, co-transfection of SL-Luc with constructs from which amino acids were removed corresponding to the RBD (MS2-CstF-64ΔRBD, Fig. 3B, bar 3), the Hinge domain (MS2-CstF-64ΔHinge, bar 4), or the CTD (MS2-CstF-64ΔCTD, bar 7) resulted in luciferase expression that was significantly lower than that with the full-length protein. These results suggest that the RBD, Hinge, and CTD are important for efficient luciferase expression in the SLAP system and thus for efficient polyadenylation. Co-transfection of SL-Luc with the MS2-CstF-64ΔP/G construct (in which the P/G domain was removed) also resulted in decreased luciferase expression (Fig. 3B, bar 5), although not to the same extent as MS2-CstF-64ΔRBD, MS2-CstF-64ΔHinge, or MS2-CstF-64ΔCTD. Finally, co-transfection of SL-Luc with MS2-CstF-64ΔMEARA (in which the 12×MEAR(A/G) was removed) resulted in luciferase expression that was indistinguishable from MS2-CstF-64 (Fig. 3B, bar 6). These data indicate that the RBD,"
https://openalex.org/W2052657512,"Previous studies have shown that the kinase activation loop (KAL) of the oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK regulates its overall tyrosine phosphorylation status and tumorigenicity. Using tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we assessed how the KAL of NPM-ALK regulates the phosphorylation status of its individual tyrosines. Using the lysates of GP293 cells transfected with NPM-ALK, our highly reproducible results showed evidence of phosphorylation in all 3 tyrosines in KAL and 8 tyrosines outside KAL. We created 7 KAL mutants, each of which carried a Tyr-to-Phe mutation of >or=1 of the 3 tyrosines in KAL. A complete loss of the 8 phosphotyrosines outside KAL was found in 3 KAL mutants, and their oncogenicity (assessed by cell viability, colony formation, and the ability to phosphorylate effector proteins) was abrogated. A partial loss of the 8 phosphotyrosines was found in 4 KAL mutants, but their oncogenicity did not show simple correlation with the number of residual phosphotyrosines. Tyr-to-Phe mutations of each of the 8 phosphotyrosines outside KAL did not result in a significant decrease in the oncogenicity. In conclusion, we have provided details of how the KAL in NPM-ALK regulates its tyrosine phosphorylation pattern. Our results challenge some of the current concepts regarding the relationship between the tyrosine phosphorylation and oncogenicity of NPM-ALK."
https://openalex.org/W2170032934,"The docking protein Grb2-associated binder1 (Gab1) has a central role in the integration of the growth-factor signaling. In this study, we aimed to examine the significance of Src-mediated Gab1 phosphorylation in the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling. Using both mutagenesis and mass spectrometry approaches, Y242, Y259, Y317, Y373 and Y627 of Gab1 were identified to be phosphorylated by c-Src. It is interesting to note that the binding of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 to the Y627 antagonized the effect of c-Src on the phosphorylation of the other four tyrosine residues. Moreover, the tyrosine residues predominantly phosphorylated by c-Src were different from those predominantly phosphorylated by the HGF receptor. Gab1 overexpression potentiated both mitogenic and motogenic activities of HGF. However, a Gab1 mutant with substitutions of the Src phosphorylation sites (Y242, Y259, Y317 and Y373) failed to promote HGF-induced DNA synthesis, but retained its ability to facilitate HGF-induced chemotaxis. Taken together, our results not only suggest that the phosphorylation of Gab1 by c-Src is important for HGF-induced DNA synthesis, but also provide an example to illustrate how a docking protein (for example, Gab1) is differentially phosphorylated by c-Src and a receptor tyrosine kinase to emanate full spectrum of signals to the downstream."
https://openalex.org/W2010117304,"Previously, we showed that CL1-5 cells express more hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) than the parental CL1 cells, which bestows CL1-5 cells a stronger invasive activity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the differential expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA in CL1 and CL1-5 cells. Data showed that the transcription rate of HIF-1alpha gene in CL1 cells was slightly higher than that of CL1-5 cells, suggesting that the expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA in CL1 cells was repressed by post-transcriptional mechanisms. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a 61-base segment (designated as D5) within the 5'-untranslated repeat of HIF-1alpha mRNA, with which the CL1 cell lysates formed more prominent complexes (including complex I) than did CL1-5 cell lysates. Insertion of D5 into a reporter construct reduced the half-life of the chimeric transcripts in transfected CL1 but not CL1-5 cells; conversely, overexpression of D5-containing reporter construct in CL1 cells increased HIF-1alpha mRNA. We also identified the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) as a required component of complex I. Deletion of the RNA recognition motif 1 (RRM1) or RRM3 of PTB abolished the formation of complex I. Our data showed that CL1 cells expressed more PTB than CL1-5 cells. Inhibition of PTB expression in CL1 cells decreased the formation of complex I, whereas overexpression of PTB in CL1-5 cells increased the levels of complex I, decreased the stability of HIF-1alpha and D5-containing chimeric mRNAs, and decreased cell invasiveness. In sum, we have identified in lung adenocarcinoma cells a mechanism that regulates HIF-1alpha expression by modulating HIF-1alpha mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2051338668,"To better understand the principles underlying the substrate specificity of A-type phospholipases (PLAs), a high throughput mass spectrometric assay was employed to study the effect of acyl chain length and unsaturation of phospholipids on their rate of hydrolysis by three different secretory PLAs in micelles and vesicle bilayers. With micelles, each enzyme responded differently to substrate acyl chain unsaturation and double bond position, probably reflecting differences in the accommodative properties of their substrate binding sites. Experiments with saturated acyl positional isomers indicated that the length of the sn2 chain was more critical than that of the sn1 chain, suggesting tighter association of the former with the enzyme. Only the first 9–10 carbons of the sn2 acyl chain seem to interact intimately with the active site. Strikingly, no discrimination between positional isomers was observed with vesicles, and the rate of hydrolysis decreased far more with increasing chain length than with micelles, suggesting that translocation of the phospholipid substrate to the active site is rate-limiting with bilayers. Supporting this conclusion, acyl chain structure affected hydrolysis and spontaneous intervesicle transfer, which correlates with lipid efflux propensity, analogously. We conclude that substrate efflux propensity plays a more important role in the specificity of secretory PLA2s than commonly thought and could also be a key attribute in phospholipid homeostasis in which (unknown) PLA2s are key players.

PLAs are also clinically relevant because they have been implicated in many common diseases or disorders, including atherosclerosis, allergy, Alzheimer disease, and cancer (5Wilkins 3rd, W.P. Barbour S.E. Curr.

Several PLAs display significant specificity toward the phospholipid acyl chain(s) in vitro (6Yang H.C. Mosior M. Ni B. Dennis E.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Ghosh M. Tucker D.E. Burchett S.A. Leslie C.C. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2006; 45: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, despite numerous studies, the factors underlying such specificity have remained largely elusive. In principle, two factors contribute to selective hydrolysis of phospholipids by PLA: 1) accommodation of the acyl chains in the protein lipid binding site and 2) the ease of efflux of the phospholipid substrate from the bilayer (8Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 9Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The understanding of acyl chain accommodation has been greatly hampered by the lack of crystal structures of PLAs complexed with a physiological substrate. Crystal structures have been obtained for some PLAs with a bound noncleavable short-chain substrate analogue (10Sekar K. Eswaramoorthy S. Jain M.K. Sundaralingam M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14186-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14790-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but because these analogues have truncated acyl chains, they only provide very limited information on the factors underlying acyl chain specificity. Furthermore, the information could also be biased, since studies with other lipid-binding proteins have shown that the mode of accommodation of an alkyl chain can be markedly influenced by the other alkyl chain of the bound lipid (14Kudo N. Kumagai K. Tomishige N. Yamaji T. Wakatsuki S. Nishijima M. Hanada K. Kato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Malinina L. Malakhova M.L. Kanack A.T. Lu M. Abagyan R. Brown R.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another uncertainty with non-cleavable lipid analogues is that the “unnatural” moieties may greatly increase their affinity for the enzyme (16Yu L. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 8757-8763Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), thus potentially masking effects of acyl chain structure. Notably, even if crystal structures with bound natural substrates could be obtained, they would not reveal how the efflux of the phospholipid substrate from the bilayer contributes to PLA specificity. This contribution is likely to be a major one, because lipid-lipid interactions influence the vertical movement of the phospholipid (or efflux propensity), which is thought to be necessary for its binding to the active site of the enzyme (8Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 17Blow D.

Such translocation should be easier for phospholipids that interact less tightly with its lipid neighbors (i.e. for those with short, polyunsaturated, or oxidized acyl chains). In conclusion, the relative contributions of the PLA active site accommodation and substrate efflux propensity to phospholipid hydrolysis are poorly understood at present. Such information is necessary to fully understand the mode of action of PLAs as well as to establish why homeostatic PLAs preferentially hydrolyze certain phospholipid species (20Kainu V.

Chem. 2008; 283: 3676-3687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), thus helping to maintain the characteristic phospholipid composition of cellular membranes. To obtain information on acyl chain specificity of PLA2s, early studies typically compared the rates of hydrolysis obtained with vesicles consisting only of a single phospholipid species. This, however, is not a good approach, because the observed rate often reflects more the affinity of the PLA for the vesicles (which can vary greatly with the phospholipid used) than the true substrate specificity of the PLA under study (21Ghomashchi F. Yu B.Z. Berg O. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7318-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although incorporation of phospholipids in detergent micelles partially alleviates this problem, others are introduced (22Berg O.G. Yu B.Z. Rogers J. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7283-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Much more reliable information can be obtained by comparing the hydrolysis of a 3H-labeled species with a 14C-labeled one incorporated together in vesicles (21Ghomashchi F. Yu B.Z. Berg O. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7318-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, this approach is not optimal if a large number of species are to be studied. One solution is to use biological membranes or liposomes made of natural lipids as the macrosubstrate and to determine the rates of hydrolysis of the multiple species present by gas or liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry (23Burdge G.C. Creaney A. Postle A.D. Wilton D.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Diez E. Chilton F.H. Stroup G. Mayer R.J. Winkler J.D. Fonteh A.N.

Acta. 2007; 1771: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the species that can be studied are limited to those present in a particular cell or tissue, and thus systematic information on the effects on acyl chain length and unsaturation and sn position cannot be readily obtained. Here, we studied factors underlying the specificity of PLAs by determining the kinetics of hydrolysis of a large variety of phospholipid molecular species by three different secretory PLA2s with detergent micelles or vesicle bilayers as the macrosubstrate. We used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which allows facile analysis of a multitude of phospholipid species (26Yang K. Cheng H. Gross R.W. Han X. Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 4356-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 27Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Chromatogr. B Anal. Technol. Biomed.

Chem. 2006; 78: 6202-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), to monitor the hydrolysis of each species simultaneously, thus avoiding bias due to substrate-dependent variations of the interfacial properties. With micelles, significant differences between the three PLA2s were found regarding the effect of double bond number and position. In addition, the length of the sn2 acyl chain was found to be more critical for hydrolysis than that of the sn1 chain, suggesting tighter interaction of the former with the lipid binding cavity of the enzyme. With vesicles, the effect of chain length was much more pronounced than with micelles, and, strikingly, no significant difference in the effect of sn1 versus sn2 chain length was observed. These data suggest that with bilayers, substrate efflux propensity is the key determinant of PLA2-mediated hydrolysis and tends to mask differences in the accommodative properties of lipid binding cavity of the enzyme. Cholesterol, unlabeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and lysophosphatidylcholines were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). D3-methyl iodide was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Ethanolamine, phospholipase D (Streptomyces sp.), and phospholipases A2 from cobra venom (Naja mossambica mossambica (P7778), bee venom (P9279), and porcine pancreas (P6534) were obtained from Sigma, and the solvents were from Merck. The sn1-16:0/sn2-Cn-PC and sn1-Cn/sn2-16:0-PC (where n indicates the number of acyl carbons) species were synthesized by acylation of sn1-16:0-lysophosphatidylcholine with an anhydride of a Cn-fatty acid or an sn1-Cn-lysophosphatidylcholine with 16:0-fatty acid, respectively (29Somerharju P.J. van Loon D. Wirtz K.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7193-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). D9-labeled PC species were synthesized from the corresponding phosphatidylethanolamine species by methylation with D3-methyl iodide essentially as described (30Patel K.M. Morrisett J.D. Sparrow J.T. Lipids. 1979; 14: 596-597Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) except that benzene was replaced with toluene. The phosphatidylethanolamine species were synthesized from corresponding phosphatidylcholines using phospholipase D-mediated transphosphatidylation (31Käkelä R. Somerharju P. Tyynelä J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1051-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The lipids were purified using normal-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a diol-modified silica column (32Silversand C. Haux C. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 703: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The purity of phospholipids was confirmed by TLC and mass spectrometry, and their concentrations were determined based on phosphate content (33Bartlett E.M. Lewis D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The concentration of the phospholipases was determined with a fluorometric protein assay (34Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). A mixture of phosphatidylcholine species (see “Results”), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-phosphatidic acid, and 17:0, 21:0, or 25:0 sphingomyelin were mixed in chloroform, and the solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream and further under high vacuum for 1 h. Then 2 ml of 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 mm CaCl2 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 30 mm octyl glucoside was added, and the lipids were dispersed by vortexing for 2 min at room temperature. The mixed micelles (0.25 mm phospholipid) were incubated in the presence of a PLA2 (typically 2 ng for bee, 1 ng for cobra, and 1.5 μg for porcine enzyme) at 37 °C, aliquots were removed at intervals and mixed with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2 (v/v)), and the lipids were extracted according to Folch et al. (35Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower phase was washed three times with the theoretical upper phase and taken to dryness under an N2 stream, and the residue was reconstituted in 300 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2) and stored at −20 °C. The lipids were mixed and dried as above, and 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 was added. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by sonication with a probe under argon for 5 × 2 min. Butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mol %) was included as an antioxidant when the lipid mixture contained unsaturated species. Any undispersed lipid and probe particles were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 6000 × g. To prepare large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), the dried lipids were covered with buffer, and the tubes were placed in a 4 °C water bath for 1 min and then in a 50 °C bath for 1 min. This cooling-heating cycle was repeated four times. The lipids were then dispersed by vortexing for 1 min at room temperature, and the resulting multilamellar vesicles were extruded 10 times through a 1.2-μm polycarbonate membrane and then 10 times trough two 0.4-μm polycarbonate membranes using a Lipex extruder (Lipex, Vancouver, Canada). SUVs or LUVs (0.2 mm) were incubated with a PLA2 in 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 mm CaCl2 buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The amount of PLA2 used per nmol of phospholipid was typically 1 ng for bee, 1 ng for cobra, and 20 μg for porcine PLA2. Otherwise, the assay was carried as outlined above for micelles. The spontaneous intervesicle translocation rates of PC species were determined as described previously (36Jones J.D. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) Briefly, negatively charged donor vesicles consisting of 1-stearoyl-2-oleyl-PC, D9-labeled PC-mix27, and tetraoleyl-cardiolipin (45:45:10 (mol/mol/mol)) and uncharged acceptor vesicles consisting of dioleyl-PC and di-22:1-D9-PC (99:1 mol/mol) were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) by probe sonication. Donor and acceptor vesicles (1.5 and 7.5 μmol of total phospholipid, respectively) were coincubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn at intervals and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) minicolumn to trap the negatively charged donors. The D9-PC species transferred to the eluted acceptor vesicles were then quantified by mass spectrometry using di-22:1-D9-PC present in the acceptor vesicles as an internal standard. After the addition of NH4OH (4%), the sample was infused at 6 μl/min to a Micromass Quattro Micro triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer operated as described previously (37Hermansson M. Uphoff A. Käkelä R. Somerharju P. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The D9-labeled and unlabeled PC species were detected by scanning for precursors of m/z +193 and m/z +184, respectively. Spectra were acquired for 5 min over a mass range of m/z 400–950 at a frequency of 4 scans/min. The spectra were exported to Microsoft Excel, and the PC species were quantified by using the LIMSA software (38Haimi P. Uphoff A. Hermansson M. Somerharju P. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 8324-8331Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the individual lipid species were plotted against time, and the rate constants of hydrolysis were obtained by fitting a first order exponential decay model to the data. Based on the theoretical fraction of phospholipid accessible to PLA2s, the maximal hydrolyzable fraction at t∞ was constrained to 1.0, 0.67, or 0.5 with micelles, SUVs, and LUVs, respectively. To obtain information on the factors underlying the acyl chain specificity of PLA2s, we devised a mass spectrometry-based assay that allows the rates of hydrolysis of a multitude of phospholipid species to be determined simultaneously. We used three different mixtures of PC species. One of them, PC-mix27, consisted of 1) 10 disaturated species with the length of the acyl chains varying from 13 to 22 carbons; 2) three monounsaturated species (14:0/18:1, 16:018:1, and 18:0/18:1); 3) six species with two double bonds, including 16:0/18:2, and five dimonounsaturated species with acyl chain lengths varying from 14 to 22 carbons; 4) three species with four double bonds (14:0/20:4, 16:0/20:4 and 18:0/20:4); 5) three species with six double bonds (18:3/18:3, 16:0/22:6, and 18:0/22:6); 6) one with eight (20:4/20:4); and 7) one with 12 double bonds (22:6/22:6). The second mixture (16:0/Cn-PCs; n = 6–24) consisted of 18 saturated PC species with a 16:0 sn1 chain and a sn2 chain of a variable number of carbons, whereas the third mixture (Cn/16:0-PCs) consisted of the positional isomers of the second one. Hydrolysis of PC species was studied both in octyl glucoside micelles and small and large unilamellar vesicles to see how lipid packing influences the apparent specificity of the PLA2s. A sphingomyelin species (10 mol %) was included as a nonhydrolyzable internal standard. Fig. 1A shows the spectra obtained for a mixture of PC species in octyl glucoside micelles before (top) and after (bottom) incubation with bee PLA2 for 3 min. Clearly, a major decrease in the amount of several PC species has taken place during the 3-min incubation, whereas some others have changed only slightly. These differences are more clearly revealed by Fig. 1B, showing the kinetics of hydrolysis of six select species. Fig. 2A displays the relative rates of hydrolysis of PC species with acyl chains of variable length and unsaturation by bee PLA2. Significant and systematic differences were observed. Increasing acyl chain length resulted in a modest decrease of hydrolysis rate of the saturated and diunsaturated species, whereas no significant effect was observed for the mono- and polyunsaturated species. The hydrolysis of species with same total acyl chain carbons generally increased with increasing unsaturation. Interestingly, however, the arachidonic acid-containing 14:0/20:4, 16:0/20:4, 18:0/20:4, and 20:4/20:4 species were hydrolyzed significantly faster than predicted by this general trend. In striking contrast to the bee enzyme, substrate unsaturation had hardly any effect on hydrolysis by cobra PLA2 (Fig. 2B). Thus, all species of equal chain length were hydrolyzed at a comparable rate apart from those containing 18:3 or 22:6 fatty acids, which were hydrolyzed somewhat faster. A modest decrease of hydrolysis with increasing acyl chain length was observed. Yet a different pattern was obtained for the porcine PLA2 (Fig. 2C). This enzyme, unlike bee and cobra PLA2s, preferred the short diunsaturated species as well as the 16:0/18:2 and di-18:3 species. Increasing acyl chain length inhibited hydrolysis, particularly in the case of the diunsaturated species. We next studied the specificity of the different PLAs with SUVs. We found that in SUVs, the hydrolysis of most species leveled off when ∼67% of them had been hydrolyzed. Because this percentage corresponds to the theoretical fraction of phospholipids in the outer leaflet in SUVs, and because secretory PLA2s have access only to phospholipid molecules in the outer leaflet (39Kumar A. Gupta C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the composition of the outer leaflet should be similar to the total composition. However, a somewhat higher fraction (70–80%) of species with short chains (e.g. 13:0/13:0-PC) was hydrolyzed, thus indicating that they, unlike others, were somewhat enriched in the outer leaflet. Such species are more cone-shaped than those with longer chains, which may favor their enrichment in the outer leaflet, which has a positive curvature. Nevertheless, such differences in the outer leaflet concentrations do not bias the specificity data, because the rate of hydrolysis of a species was determined based on its normalized concentration, rather than the absolute one, at different time points. The specificity profile obtained with bee PLA2 in SUVs differed markedly from that obtained with micelles (Fig. 3A). First of all, the differences in the rate of hydrolysis were far more pronounced with SUVs. The most rapidly hydrolyzed species (i.e. 14:1/14:1) was hydrolyzed ∼100-fold faster than the most slowly hydrolyzed one (i.e. 22:0/22:0), whereas in micelles, the difference between the fastest (di-20:4) and slowest (di-22:1) species was only ∼10-fold. With vesicles, the rate of hydrolysis of both saturated and diunsaturated PC species decreased strongly and monotonously with increasing acyl chain length. In addition, the hydrolysis increased with increasing degree of unsaturation (i.e. among the species of equal chain length, the lowest rate was always observed for the saturated species, and the rate generally increased with the number of double bonds). However, the hydrolysis of arachidonoyl (20:4) species was again faster than expected from the general trend. Notably, although the relative rates varied somewhat between experiments, probably due to slightly different amounts of enzyme used, the specificity profile obtained was essentially identical (supplemental Fig. 1). Analogous results were obtained with large unilamellar vesicles (supplemental Fig. 2A). Also, with cobra PLA2 the length of the acyl chain(s) had a much stronger effect on the rate hydrolysis of both saturated and diunsaturated PC species as compared with micelles (Fig. 3B). Hydrolysis of the arachidonic acid-containing species was again relatively slow, and that of the 18:3- or 22:6-containing species was relatively fast as compared with the bee enzyme. Parallel results were obtained with LUVs (supplemental Fig. 2B). With porcine PLA2 the inhibitory effect of increasing chain length was also much stronger in vesicles versus micelles (Fig. 3C). However, differently from the other two enzymes, the relative rate of hydrolysis of the shortest saturated and diunsaturated species was exceptionally high (note the break in the y axis). As with micelles, the hydrolysis of the arachidonoyl species was slow as compared with bee PLA2. In contrast to the other enzymes, the di-22:6 species was hydrolyzed only somewhat faster than other species of equal total chain length. To obtain more detailed information on the contribution of the individual acyl chains, we synthesized two sets of saturated PC species in which the length of either the sn1 or sn2 acyl chain was varied from 6 to 24 carbons, whereas the length of the chain in the other sn-position was kept constant at 16 carbons. The Cn/16:0-PC species contained a D9-labeled choline headgroup, whereas the 16:0/Cn-PC species were unlabeled. Both sets were present together in the same vesicles, which allowed us to study their hydrolysis under identical conditions. The relative rates of hydrolysis were determined by comparing peak areas with that of the SM internal standard. In addition, relative rates of hydrolysis of positional isomers could be determined accurately by plotting the ratio of the isomer peak areas versus time. In micelles, variation of the sn1 versus sn2 chain length distinctly affected the rate of hydrolysis with each PLA2. With bee PLA2, increasing the length of the sn2 chain from 6 to 8 carbons increased hydrolysis, which then decreased sharply at C9-C11 and finally leveled off (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the rate decreased monotonously with increasing length of the sn1 chain. The ratio of the rate for sn2 to that of sn1 isomer is plotted in Fig. 4D. The plot shows a peak for sn2 preference at C8-C9 but little if any preference for either isomer at longer chain lengths. With cobra PLA2, hydrolysis increased when the length of the sn2 chain increased from 6 to 8 carbons and then decreased sharply and finally leveled off. As observed with the bee enzyme, only a modest and monotonous decrease took place with increasing length of the sn1 chain (Fig. 4B). The isomer ratio plot (Fig. 4D) shows ∼2-fold preference for the isomers with a C8-C9 sn2 chain and a lesser one for those with a C13-C14 sn2 chain. On the other hand, the species with a C6-C7 or C10–11 chain in the sn1-position seem to be preferred over their positional isomers. Identical results were obtained independently of which isomeric set was D9-labeled (data not shown), thus excluding an isotope effect. The porcine PLA2 discriminated between positional isomers even more than the other two enzymes. The sn2 chain length versus rate plot displays a major peak at C8-C9 and a minor peak at C13-C14 (Fig. 4C). Again, the rate varied only modestly and smoothly with the length of the sn1 chain. The isomer ratio plot shows that the 16:0/C9 species was hydrolyzed 9-fold faster than its positional isomer (i.e. C9/16:0) (Fig. 4D). With bee PLA2, the rate of hydrolysis diminished markedly with increasing sn2 chain length (Fig. 5A), but the effect was more pronounced than in micelles. A precipitous decrease was observed from 6 to 10–11 carbons, whereas there was only a slight decrease beyond. Remarkably, unlike with micelles, a practically identical curve was obtained for the sn1 chain, thus signifying the absence of significant sn isomer preference for any chain length (Fig. 5A, inset). No significant isomer preference was observed for the cobra enzyme either (Fig. 5B). Practically identical results were obtained for both bee and cobra PLAs with large unilamellar vesicles (data not shown). Although direct measurements of lipid efflux rates cannot be readily accomplished, previous studies have shown that the rate of phospholipid efflux from a lipidic surface is proportional to its rate of spontaneous interparticle diffusion (36Jones J.D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), where they cleave downstream molecules to initiate the apoptotic process. The death receptor pathway is extensively regulated at many levels. First, binding of ligand to death receptors is modulated by receptor glycosylation (19Wagner K.W. Punnoose E.A. Januario T. Lawrence D.A. Pitti R.M. Lancaster K. Lee D. von Goetz M. Yee S.F. Totpal K. Huw L. Katta V. Cavet G. Hymowitz S.G. Amler L. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Second, binding of ligand to potentially active receptors is altered by the presence of decoy receptors, which bind ligand but lack the required intracellular domains to initiate DISC assembly (20Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Third, receptor internalization and endosomal trafficking has been observed to facilitate death signaling in some model systems (21Lee K.H. Feig C. Tchikov V. Schickel R. Hallas C. Schütze S. Peter M.E. Chan A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Schütze S. Tchikov V. Schneider-Brachert W. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Conversely, trafficking of FADD to the nucleus has been reported to affect its availability for DISC formation (24Alappat E.C. Feig C. Boyerinas B. Volkland J. Samuels M. Murmann A.E. Thorburn A. Kidd V.J. Slaughter C.A. Osborn S.L. Winoto A. Tang W.J. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Werner M.H. Wu C. Walsh C.M. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2332-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fourth, activation of caspase 8 is modulated by c-FLIP, an intracellular procaspase 8 homolog that can bind the DISC but lacks a catalytically competent active site (26Yu J.W. Shi Y. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6216-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Some c-FLIP spice variants inhibit caspase 8 activation, whereas other splice variants facilitate caspase 8 activation (27Chang D.W. Xing Z. Pan Y. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Barnhart B.C. Yaish-Ohad S. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3704-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 28Panner A. James C.D. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Mol. Cell.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8169-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fifth, it has been reported that death receptor signaling can be modulated by CARPs, E3 ubiquitin ligases that bind and presumably ubiquitylate active caspases 8 and 10 (31McDonald 3rd, E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6170-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that PKC activation can affect sensitivity to death ligands. In particular, several groups have previously reported that treatment with PMA, a well characterized activator of PKC and several other enzymes, inhibits Fas- or TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in some cells (reviewed in Refs. 32Gómez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Meng X.W. Heldebrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol.

Early studies proposed several mechanisms for the ability of PMA to protect susceptible cells from death ligand-induced apoptosis, including activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (35Holmström T.H. Schmitz I. Söderström T.S. Poukkula M. Johnson V.L. Chow S.C. Krammer P.H. Eriksson J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5418-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 (36Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and Mcl-1 (37Domina A.M. Vrana J.A. Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5301-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), or activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (38Busuttil V. Bottero V. Frelin C. Imbert V. Ricci J.E. Auberger P. Peyron J.F. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which enhances expression of a number of antiapoptotic polypeptides (39Wajant H. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 67: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 40Hendrickson A.W. Meng X.W. Kaufmann S.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3582-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, subsequent reports provided evidence that PMA affects death signaling more directly by disrupting recruitment of FADD and procaspase 8 to the intracellular domains of ligated Fas (32Gómez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44944-44952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Meng X.W. Heldebrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), DR4, and DR5 (34Harper N. Hughes M.A. Farrow S.N. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44338-44347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These latter studies, however, left a number of questions unanswered. First, although prior results demonstrated that PMA provides short term protection from apoptosis, it has been unclear whether PMA is merely delaying the apoptotic process or affecting the number of cells that ultimately die. Second, even though a variety of PKC isoforms, including PKCα, PKCβ, PKCϵ, PKCθ, PKCδ, and PKCζ, have been implicated in pro- and antiapoptotic signaling (41Reyland M.E. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 2386-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), it remains uncertain which PKC isoforms are responsible for modulating the death receptor pathway. Third, the mechanism by which PKC activation diminishes DISC formation has remained unclear. This study was undertaken to address these issues. Enzastaurin was provided by Lilly. Other reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: PMA, Hoechst 33258, camptothecin, staurosporine, dimethyl pimelimidate, and monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) from Sigma; 3-(1-(3-imidazol-1-ylpropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)-4-anilino-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (catalog no. 539654) from Calbiochem; enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and Sepharose coupled to protein G from GE Healthcare; CH-11 monoclonal IgM agonistic anti-Fas from Millipore (Lake Placid, NY); Escherichia coli recombinant human TRAIL and agonistic anti-DR5 antibody from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); FLAG-tagged recombinant FasL and FLAG-tagged recombinant human TRAIL from Alexis (San Diego); anti-phosphorylated PKC substrate antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); monoclonal antibodies to procaspase 8 and procaspase 3 as well as APC-coupled annexin V from Pharmingen; murine monoclonal antibodies to PKC-α, -β, -ϵ, and -θ from BD Transduction Laboratories; Alexa Fluor647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from Invitrogen; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, and IgG2b as well as APC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM from Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). Monoclonal antibodies that recognize poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, HSP90, and cleaved Bid were gifts from Guy Poirier (Laval University, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada), David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), and Andreas Strasser (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia), respectively. Rabbit antiserum that recognizes a neoepitope at the C terminus of the caspase 3 large subunit (42Mesner Jr., P.W. Bible K.C. Martins L.M. Kottke T.J. Srinivasula S.M. Svingen P.A. Chilcote T.J.

For transfection, cells grown to a concentration of 3–4 × 105 cells/ml in medium A without antibiotics (medium B) were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min, resuspended at 25 × 106 cells/ml in 0.4 ml of medium B, and incubated with 40 μg of the indicated plasmid DNA along with 5–10 μg of pEGFP-N1, which encodes EGFP, for 5 min. Samples were electroporated using a BTX 820 or 830 square wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego) at 280 V for 10 ms. After 5 min, cells were placed in fresh medium B and cultured for 24–48 h as indicated before treatment. Control experiments using a plasmid encoding EGFP typically indicated a 60–80% transfection efficiency as assessed by flow cytometry 24–48 h after electroporation. To assess the effects of treatment on clonogenic survival, aliquots containing 4–8 × 105 log phase HL-60 cells in medium A were treated for 6 h with the indicated concentrations of TRAIL and/or PMA, sedimented at 100 × g for 5 min, washed once with medium A, diluted into molten 0.3% (w/v) agar in the medium of Pike and Robinson (46Pike B.L. Robinson W.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1970; 76: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), and plated in 35-mm gridded plates as described previously. After a 10–14-day incubation, colonies containing >50 cells were counted on an inverted microscope at ×25 magnification. Because Jurkat cells do not form colonies under these conditions, long term survival and proliferation were assessed using a culture repopulation assay similar to that described by Simonian et al. (47Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A. Nuñez G. Blood. 1997; 90: 1208-1216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots containing 106 cells in medium A were treated for 6 h with the indicated concentrations of TRAIL or CH-11 in the absence or presence of PMA, sedimented at 100 × g for 5 min, washed once with medium A, and diluted into 10 ml of medium A. Flasks were examined daily to determine the point at which cell density again reached 1 × 106/ml. To provide a standard curve, aliquots containing 10, 100, 1000, 104, 105, and 106 untreated Jurkat cells were also diluted into 10 ml of medium A and examined for subsequent regrowth to 106 cells/ml. T98G cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in medium A supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate (medium C). After subconfluent monolayers were trypsinized, aliquots containing 250 cells were plated in multiple 35-mm dishes containing 2 ml of medium C and allowed to attach overnight. Graded concentrations of TRAIL and enzastaurin were then added to triplicate plates. After a 4-h incubation, plates were washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated in drug-free medium C for an additional 7 days. The resulting colonies were stained with Coomassie Blue and counted. Diluent-treated control plates typically contained ∼150 colonies. Colony forming assays using HeLa cells and HCT116 were performed similarly except that 300 (HeLa) or 500 (HCT116) cells were plated to have 150–200 colonies on the diluent-treated plates. After treatment with the indicated concentrations of death ligand, PMA, and/or enzastaurin, cells were washed and stained with APC-conjugated annexin V as described (48Meng X.W. Lee S.H. Dai H.

Apoptotic and nonapoptotic untransfected Jurkat cells treated with APC-annexin V alone were utilized to identify cut points for EGFP+ versus EGFP− and annexin V+ versus annexin V− cells. Alternatively, untransfected cells were lysed at 4 °C in buffer D (0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate) and subjected to flow cytometry to assess DNA fragmentation (45Meng X.W.

In some experiments, cells were also fixed in 3:1 (v/v) methanol/acetic acid, stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258, and examined by fluorescence microscopy for apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology (33Meng X.W. Heldebrant M.P. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3776-3783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After treatment with PMA for 30–60 min, cells were harvested for fractionation. All further steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then swelled for 30 min in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 4 °C)) supplemented with the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), and α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cells were lysed in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer until >95% of the cells were ruptured. The mitochondria and nuclei were removed by sedimentation at 4000 × g for 15 min. Samples were then spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the membrane fraction (pellet) from the cytosol (supernatant). The parental pFRT-HIP and pCMS3-EGFP-HIP plasmids used for shRNA silencing were described previously (52Gomez T.S. McCarney S.D. Carrizosa E. Labno C.M. Comiskey E.O. Nolz J.C. Zhu P. Freedman B.D.

Isoform-specific RNA interference target sequences were selected using a custom program designed to parse the output of the GeneBee RNA secondary structure prediction program. Sequences selected for the targeted isoforms were as follows: PKCα, 5′-GAACAACAAGGAAUGACUU-3′; PKCβ, 5′- GGAAGCUGUGGCCAUCUGC-3′; PKCϵ, 5′-GCCACCCUUCAAACCACGCAUU-3′; and PKCθ, 5′-UUGGAUGAGGUGGAUAAA-3′. To generate Fas fused at its C terminus with S peptide (Fas-S peptide), cDNA encoding full-length Fas (GenBankTM accession number M67454) was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR using a 3′ primer designed to add a linker and S peptide (GAGAGAGAGGAP)MKETAAAKFERQHMDS in-frame at the C terminus. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1 using EcoRI and XbaI. After treatment with PMA and/or death ligands as indicated in the figures, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended at a concentration of 30 × 106 cells/ml in DISC buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C)) supplemented with the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), and α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and the phosphatase inhibitors NaF (100 mm), NaP2O7 (100 mm), and Na3VO4 (1 mm). After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min and transferred to fresh tubes. To measure the binding of death ligands, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with agonistic CH-11 anti-Fas antibody or 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody plus FLAG-tagged FasL or FLAG-tagged TRAIL in the absence or presence of PMA for 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were then quickly cooled, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and incubated with APC-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (for CH-11 binding) or Alexa Fluor647-labeled anti-mouse IgG (to detect ligand-bound anti-FLAG) for an additional 45 min on ice. Following two washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were resuspended in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and stored in the dark at 4 °C for <18 h until flow microfluorimetry was performed. For cell surface biotinylation as well as phosphorylation analysis, we created JFSD9 cells, which stably express Fas-S peptide, by transfecting the Fas-deficient line JM14A5 (45Meng X.W. Chandra J.

After selection in medium A containing 400 μg/ml G418 and cloning by limiting dilution, this line was chosen from among other clones because Fas was readily detectable on its surface by flow cytometry. Following treatment as specified in the figure legends, aliquots were quickly chilled by adding 4 volumes of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM) and washed three times with the same buffer. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating cells in 1.0 ml of PBS-CM containing 1 mm NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) on ice for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by incubating cells with ice-cold PBS-CM containing 100 mm glycine. After three washes with PBS-CM, cells were lysed in 1.0 ml DISC buffer as described above. Following clarification of the lysates, Fas was pulled down by incubating lysates for 2–3 h at 4 °C with anti-S peptide antibody covalently coupled to agarose and then washing the bound proteins as described (49Dai H. Meng X.W. Lee S.H. Schneider P.A. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18311-18322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After release from beads and SDS-PAGE as described below, polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin or anti-S peptide antibody. To isolate the Fas DISC, aliquots containing 5 × 107 cells were resuspended in 10 ml of medium A and incubated with diluent or 10 μm enzastaurin for 30 min. Following addition of PMA and/or CH-11 (final concentrations 20 nm and 500 ng/ml, respectively), the incubation was continued for an additional 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were then sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min and lysed in 1 ml of DISC buffer on ice for 30 min. After the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min, an aliquot of supernatant (4 mg of protein) was transferred to a new tube containing 30 μl of beads with rabbit anti-mouse IgM antibody cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose. Beads were rotated at 4 °C for 90 min and washed five times in DISC buffer. Bound polypeptides were released by boiling the beads for 5 min with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer and loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After drug treatment or fluorescence-activated cell sorting, cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), solubilized in buffered 6 m guanidine hydrochloride under reducing conditions, and prepared for electrophoresis (54Kaufmann S.H.

https://openalex.org/W2034507058,"The E2A-HLF fusion transcription factor generated by t(17;19)(q22;p13) translocation is found in a small subset of pro-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and promotes leukemogenesis by substituting for the antiapoptotic function of cytokines. Here we show that t(17;19)+ ALL cells express Survivin at high levels and that a dominant negative mutant of E2A-HLF suppresses Survivin expression. Forced expression of E2A-HLF in t(17;19)− leukemia cells up-regulated Survivin expression, suggesting that Survivin is a downstream target of E2A-HLF. Analysis using a counterflow centrifugal elutriator revealed that t(17;19)+ ALL cells express Survivin throughout the cell cycle. Reporter assays revealed that E2A-HLF induces survivin expression at the transcriptional level likely through indirect down-regulation of a cell cycle-dependent cis element in the promoter region. Down-regulation of Survivin function by a dominant negative mutant of Survivin or reduction of Survivin expression induced massive apoptosis throughout the cell cycle in t(17;19)+ cells mainly through caspase-independent pathways involving translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus. AIF knockdown conferred resistance to apoptosis caused by down-regulation of Survivin function. These data indicated that reversal of AIF translocation by Survivin, which is induced by E2A-HLF throughout the cell cycle, is one of the key mechanisms in the protection of t(17;19)+ leukemia cells from apoptosis. The E2A-HLF fusion transcription factor generated by t(17;19)(q22;p13) translocation is found in a small subset of pro-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and promotes leukemogenesis by substituting for the antiapoptotic function of cytokines.

In this chimeric molecule, the trans-activation domain of E2A is fused to the basic region and leucine zipper domain of HLF, which mediates DNA binding and dimerization. Patients with this chimera share distinct clinical features such as hypercalcemia and coagulopathy and very poor prognosis because of resistance to intensive chemotherapy, including aggressive conditioning for bone marrow transplantation (3Hunger S.P.

Thus, these features may be a direct consequence of aberrant gene expression induced by E2A-HLF fusion transcription factor, rather than a consequence of the nature of B cell progenitors. acute lymphoblastic leukemia apoptosis-inducing factor interleukin mitogen-activated protein kinase cell cycle homology region phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate short hairpin RNA short interfering RNA green fluorescent protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay bromodeoxyuridine terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling propidium iodide dominant negative nucleotide 7-amino-actinomycin D plenti-Lox3.7. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of the trans-activation potential of the E2A-HLF chimera by a dominant negative mutant results in apoptosis in t(17;19)+ ALL cells but does not affect the cell cycle (6Inaba T.

Moreover, E2A-HLF blocks apoptosis normally induced by cytokine deprivation in murine interleukin (IL)-3-dependent B precursor lines such as Baf-3 or FL5.12 cells, suggesting that this fusion protein contributes to leukemogenesis through modification of apoptosis regulatory pathways normally controlled by cytokines (6Inaba T.

Look A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6035-6043Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We speculated that the target genes of E2A-HLF involved in the inhibition of apoptosis are those regulated via Ras pathways in IL-3-dependent cells, because activation of Ras pathways is indispensable for long term survival of Baf-3 cells in cytokine-free medium (8Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 9Kuribara R. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Shinjyo T. Yoshihara T. Inukai T. Ozawa K. Look A.T. Inaba T.

Moreover, we previously identified E4BP4/NFIL3, a related basic region and leucine zipper factor with antiapoptotic function, as a possible physiological counterpart of E2A-HLF (10Ikushima S. Inukai T. Inaba T. Nimer S.D. Cleveland J.L. Look A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and we found that E4BP4 expression is induced by IL-3 through Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras-Raf-MAPK pathways in IL-3-dependent cells (9Kuribara R. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Shinjyo T. Yoshihara T. Inukai T. Ozawa K. Look A.T. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The survivin gene may be a good candidate for a target gene of E2A-HLF involved in the inhibition of apoptosis in t(17;19)+ ALL cells. Survivin, at 142 amino acids, is the smallest member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family and significantly prolongs the viability of cytokine-deprived IL-3-dependent cells (11Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). The expression of Survivin is controlled by oncogenic c-H-ras, and up-regulation of Survivin depends on functional Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling pathways (12Sommer K.W. Stumberger C.J. Schmidt G.E. Sasgary S. Cerni C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4266-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Survivin can protect cells from both extrinsically and intrinsically induced apoptosis (13Tamm I. Wang Y. Sausville E. Scudiero D.A. Vigne N. Oltersdorf T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5315-5320PubMed Google Scholar, 14Li F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 8-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of Survivin expression by antisense ribozyme or RNA interference leads to increased spontaneous apoptosis (15Li F. Ling X. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). A unique feature of Survivin as an apoptosis regulator is its involvement in cell cycle progression (17Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). survivin expression is transcriptionally induced in the G2/M phase through cell cycle- dependent cis elements located near the transcription initiation site (16Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). These elements, including the cell cycle-dependent element (GGCGG) and the cell cycle homology region (CHR; ATTTGAA), are implicated in G1 transcriptional repression in S/G2-regulated genes, such as cyclin A, cdc25C, and cdc2 (18Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, Survivin is activated through phosphorylation of Thr-34 by mitotic kinase CDC2-cyclin-B1 (14Li F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 8-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of a phosphorylation-defective Survivin T34A mutant (Survivin-T34A) initiates mitochondrial dependent apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines (14Li F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 8-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Survivin expression is induced by the E2A-HLF chimera, and down-regulation of Survivin induces caspase-independent massive apoptosis in t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines. These findings indicate that Survivin contributes to leukemogenesis by subverting genetic pathways responsible for the apoptosis of B cell progenitors. Human ALL cell lines that express E2A-HLF (UOC-B1, HAL-O1, YCUB-2, and Endo-kun) and other leukemia cell lines (Nalm-6, RS4;11, REH, 697, 920, HL-60, NB-4, and Jurkat) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Establishment of Nalm-6 human pro-B cell leukemia cells that express zinc-inducible E2A-HLF (Nalm-6/E2A-HLF) using the pMT-CB6+ eukaryotic expression vector (a gift from Dr. F. Rauscher III, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia) has been described previously (19Kurosawa H. Goi K. Inukai T. Inaba T. Chang K.S. Shinjyo T. Rake straw K.M. Naeve C.W. Look A.T. Blood. 1999; 93: 321-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UOC-B1/E2A-HLF(dn) cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of E2A-HLF, which lacks the AD1 transactivation domain of E2A and contains a mutated HLF DNA-binding domain with an intact leucine-zipper domain, were prepared as described previously (6Inaba T. Inukai T. Yoshihara T. Seyshab H. Ashmun R.A. Canman C.E. Laken S.J. Kastan M.B. Look A.T. Nature. 1996; 382: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). UOC-B1, Endo-kun, REH, and Jurkat cells that were transfected with either the pMT/Survivin-T34A vector or the empty pMT-CB6+ vector were designated as UOC-B1/Survivin(dn), UOC-B1/pMT, Endo-kun/Survivin(dn), Endo-kun/pMT, REH/Survivin(dn), REH/pMT, Jurkat/Survivin(dn), and Jurkat/pMT, respectively. Counterflow centrifugal elutriations were performed using the SRR6Y elutriation system and rotor equipped with a 4.5-ml chamber (Hitachi Koki Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (20Kikuchi J. Furukawa Y. Iwase S. Terui Y. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Kitagawa M. Komatsu N. Miura Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 3980-3990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Target cells were resuspended at 1–2 × 108 cells in 50 ml of PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum and injected into the elutriation system at 4 °C using an initial flow rate of 16 ml/min and rotor speed of 2,000 rpm. The flow rate was incrementally increased, and cell fractions were collected serially as follows: fraction 1, 200 ml at 16 ml/min; fraction 2, 200 ml at 18 ml/min; fraction 3, 200 ml at 20 ml/min; fraction 4, 200 ml at 22 ml/min; fraction 5, 200 ml at 24 ml/min; fraction 6, 200 ml at 26 ml/min; and fraction 7, 200 ml at 28 ml/min. Cell cycle analysis was performed on each fraction by staining DNA with propidium iodide (PI) in preparation for flow cytometry with the FACScan/CellFIT system (BD Biosciences). Short hairpin/short interfering RNA (shRNA/siRNA) was introduced into UOC-B1 or UOC-B1/Survivin(dn) cells to down-regulate the expression of Survivin or apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) by the shRNA lentivirus system (21Rubinson D.A.

Oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized, annealed, terminally phosphorylated, and inserted into the vector pLL3.7 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Oligonucleotides containing siRNA target for survivin sequences (23Gu C.M. Zhu Y.K. Ma Y.H. Zhang M. Liao B. Wu H.Y. Lin H.L.

Oligonucleotides containing siRNA target for AIF sequences were as follows: 5′-TGGAGGAGTCTGCGTAATGTTTCAAGAGAACATTACGCAGACTCCTCCTTTTTTC-3′ (forward 1) and 5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGGAGGAGTCTGCGTAATGTTCTCTTGAAACATTACGCAGACTCCTCCT-3′ (reverse 1); 5′- TGCAGGAAGGTAGAAACTGATTCAAGAGATCAGTTTCTACCTTCCTGCTTTTTTC-3′ (forward 2) and 5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGCAGGAAGGTAGAAACTGATCTCTTGAATCAGTTTCTACCTTCCTGCT-3′ (reverse 2); 5′-TGCATGCTTCTACGATATAATTCAAGAGATTATATCGTAGAAGCATGCTTTTTTC-3′ (forward 3) and 5′-TCGAGAAAAAAGCATGCTTCTACGATATAATCTCTTGAATTATATCGTAGAAGCATGCT-3′ (reverse 3); the nucleotide sequences corresponding to the siRNA are underlined. The resulting plasmids or the parental pLL3.7, along with lentiviral packaging mix (ViraPower, Invitrogen), was transfected into 293FT cells (Invitrogen) to produce recombinant lentivirus, and the UOC-B1 or UOC-B1/Survivin(dn) cells were infected with the virus. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were purified by FACSAria (BD Biosciences) as shRNA-transfected cell populations. Fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the human survivin gene spanning 147, 213, 288, 503, or 698 bp were generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase from genomic DNA of human placenta. The positions of the forward (5′) primers with respect to the translational initiation codon (according to NCBI GenBankTM sequence U75285) are −124 (−124 forward primer, 5′-ACTCCCAGAAGGCCGCGGGGGGTG-3′), −190 (5′-ACCACGGGCAGAGCCACGCGGCGGG-3′), −265 (5′-GTTCTTTGAAAGCAGTCGAGGGGGC-3′), −480 (5′-CGGGTTGAAGCGATTCTCCTGCCT-3′), and −675 (5′-CGATGTCTGCACTCCATCCCTC-3′). The reverse (3′) primer used for these amplifications was at position 23 (+23-reverse primer, 5′-GGGGGCAACGTCGGGGCAagCtTGC-3′) and was constructed based on the genomic sequence with a modification (lowercase) to create a HindIII site. The PCR products were cloned into a pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting reporter plasmids were designated as pGL3-124, pGL3-190, pGL3-265, pGL3-480, and pGL3-675, respectively. The pGL3-124mut1 vector containing two mutated cell cycle-dependent elements (−6 and −12) was generated by PCR using the −124 forward primer and a reverse primer (5′-GCAAGCTTGtcactGtcactACCTCTG-3′); pGL3-124mut2 vector containing mutated CHR (−42) in addition to two mutated cell cycle-dependent elements (−6 and −12) was generated by the −124 forward primer and a reverse primer (5′-GCAAGCTTGtcactGtcactACCTCTGCCAACGGGTCCCGCGATTCgggTCTGG-3′); and pGL3-124mut3 vector containing a mutated CHR (−42) was generated by the −124 forward primer and a reverse primer (5′-GCAAGCTTGCCGCCGCCGCCACCTCTGCCAACGGGTCCCGCGATTCgggTCTGG-3′) (lowercase indicates mutations). For transfection with a pMT-CB6+/E2A-HLF construct, Nalm-6 cells (6 × 104) were seeded into 24-well plates, cotransfected with pGL3-survivin promoter construct plus pRL-TK vector, which contains the Renilla luciferase gene, by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and harvested 24 h later. E2A-HLF expression was induced in Nalm-6 cells by the addition of 100 μm ZnCl2 24 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase as a transfection efficiency control were detected with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and measured in a Veritas Microplate Luminometer (Promega). EMSA were performed by incubating 12 μg of nuclear protein lysate at 30 °C for 15 min with a 32P-end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe (2 × 104 cpm) containing the CHR-binding site sequence in the survivin promoter (5′-CATTAACCGCCAGATTTGAATCGCGG-3′) in a solution of 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 133 mm KCl, 1.5 μg of sheared calf thymus DNA, and 300 μg of bovine serum albumin per ml as described previously (24Inaba T. Shapiro L.H. Funabiki T. Sinclair A.E. Jones B.G. Ashmun R.A. Look A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3403-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the competitive inhibition experiments, excess of the unlabeled CHR-consensus sequence probe, i.e. oligonucleotide containing the candidate-binding sites of CHR in the survivin gene promoter or its 3-bp mismatched oligonucleotide (5′-CATTAACCGCCAGAcccGAATCGCGG-3′) was added to the reaction mixture. The entire mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 4% acrylamide and 2.5% glycerol were prerun at 4 °C in a high ionic strength Tris-glycine buffer for 30 min and run at 50 mA for ∼45 min. The gel was then dried under vacuum and analyzed by autoradiography. For visualization of intracellular AIF, cytospinned cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS (5 min for each rinse), blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min, and incubated with anti-AIF antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. Cells were incubated with a secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-goat IgG (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), at 37 °C for 30 min. For Northern blot analysis, 1 μg of poly(A)-selected RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with the appropriate probe according to standard procedures as described previously (5Matsunaga T. Inaba T. Matsui H. Okuya M. Miyajima A. Inukai T. Funabiki T. Endo M. Look A.T. Kurosawa H. Blood. 2004; 103: 3185-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, the primary antibodies used were anti-Survivin polyclonal (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-α-tubulin monoclonal (Sigma), anti-caspase 3 polyclonal (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-caspase 9 polyclonal (BD Biosciences), anti-PARP monoclonal (BD Biosciences), and anti-AIF polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-HLF(C) antibody for detection of the E2A-HLF chimeric protein was described previously (24Inaba T. Shapiro L.H. Funabiki T. Sinclair A.E. Jones B.G. Ashmun R.A. Look A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3403-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Early apoptotic events were detected by flow cytometric measurement of externalized phosphatidylserine with the annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences) in preparation for flow cytometry with the FACScan/CellFIT system (BD Biosciences). For caspase inhibition, 20 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (BD Biosciences) was added to the cells 1 h before the addition of zinc. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) was performed using the apo-BrdUrd TUNEL assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Briefly, cells fixed with paraformaldehyde and ethanol were incubated with BrdUrd and TdT for 1 h at 37 °C. BrdUrd uptakes were detected by Alexa dye-leveled anti-BrdUrd antibodies. Cells were stained by PI just before analysis using FACScan/CellFIT system. Cell lines were used in this study instead of primary patient samples, because t(17;19)+ ALLs constitute only ∼1% of childhood B-precursor ALLs (1Inaba T. Roberts W.M. Shapiro L.H. Jolly K.W. Raimondi S.C. Smith S.D. Look A.T. Science. 1992; 257: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Hunger S.P. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Hunger S.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines (UOC-B1, YCUB-2, HAL-O1, and Endo-kun) expressed the E2A-HLF chimeric protein on immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A, 4th panel, lanes 1–4) either as a slower (lanes 1 and 3) or a faster migration band (lanes 2 and 4) corresponding to difference in the fusion junction, as described previously (3Hunger S.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the seven t(17;19)− leukemia cell lines tested (RS4;11, Nalm-6, REH, 920, Jurkat, HL-60 and NB-4), none expressed the E2A-HLF chimera (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–11). We performed Northern blot and immunoblot analyses to test human leukemia cell lines for the expression of survivin. Survivin mRNA and protein were expressed at uniformly high levels in the four t(17;19)+ ALL cell lines (Fig. 1A, top and 3rd panels). By contrast, survivin mRNA levels varied among the t(17;19)− leukemia cell lines and appeared to determine Survivin protein expression levels in each line (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–11). Next, we tested whether E2A-HLF induces the expression of Survivin. For these experiments, Nalm-6 cells were transfected with a pMT-CB6+/E2A-HLF construct to generate clones (Nalm-6/E2A-HLF) with zinc-inducible expression of E2A-HLF (Fig. 1B, 4th panel). Ectopic expression of E2A-HLF in Nalm-6 cells induced survivin mRNA by 5-fold within 24 h after the addition of zinc (Fig. 1B, top panel). Accordingly, Survivin protein expression increased within 24 h after induction of E2A-HLF (Fig. 1B, 3rd panel). In control Nalm-6/pMT cells, which contained the empty vector, Survivin expression was unaffected by zinc (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8), confirming that the observed changes in Survivin expression were induced by E2A-HLF and not by zinc. Induction of Survivin by E2A-HLF was further confirmed using UOC-B1/E2A-HLF(dn) cells, which express zinc-inducible E2A-HLF(dn), a dominant negative mutant of E2A-HLF (see under “Experimental Procedures”) (6Inaba T. Inukai T. Yoshihara T. Seyshab H. Ashmun R.A. Canman C.E. Laken S.J. Kastan M.B. Look A.T. Nature. 1996; 382: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Kurosawa H. Goi K. Inukai T. Inaba T. Chang K.S. Shinjyo T. Rake straw K.M. Naeve C.W. Look A.T. Blood. 1999; 93: 321-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Survivin mRNA and protein expression in UOC-B1/E2A-HLF(dn) cells were high in the absence of zinc (Fig. 1C, top and 3rd panels, lane 1; see also Fig. 1D) but decreased within 24 h after the addition of zinc (Fig. 1C, lane 5), coincident with expression of E2A-HLF(dn) protein (4th panel). Removal of zinc from the growth medium restored Survivin expression within 48 h, again coincident with a decline in the E2A-HLF(dn) protein level (Fig. 1C, lane 9). These data suggested that E2A-HLF induces Survivin mRNA expression. Down-regulation of Survivin protein preceded the reduction of Survivin mRNA (Fig. 1D), suggesting the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanism(s). The Survivin mRNA and protein levels at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle are more than 10-fold higher than those at the G1 phase in NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts synchronized by serum starvation and in drug-synchronized HeLa cells (17Li F.

Tokuhisa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because it is difficult to synchronize leukemia cells by serum starvation or by reagents inhibiting cell cycle progression at a specific phase, we performed counterflow centrifugal elutriation to enrich cells at each phase of the cell cycle. The purity of the preparations was typically more than 90% for G0/G1-phase cells, more than 80% for S-phase cells, and ∼90% for G2/M-phase cells (Fig. 2A). We performed immunoblot analysis to measure Survivin expression in the enriched fractions. In t(17;19)− ALL cell lines (RS4;11, REH, and 920), Survivin expression was most evident at the G2/M-phase (Fig. 2, B, lanes 13–21, and C). In particular, 920 cells at the G2/M phase showed ∼11- and 4-fold higher expression than those at the G1 and S phase, respectively. By contrast, the four cell lines harboring the E2A-HLF chimeric protein expressed Survivin at high levels throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 2, B, lanes 1–12, and C). To elucidate how E2A-HLF induces expression of the survivin gene, we analyzed the effects of E2A-HLF on the function of the survivin promoter. We initially generated reporter plasmid vectors (pGL3-124, -190, -265, -480, and -675), each of which contained a different length of human survivin promoter. These vectors were analyzed for luciferase activity in transiently transfected Nalm-6/E2A-HLF cells. When cells were cultured without zinc, luciferase activity was low in cells transfected with pGL3-124 (Fig. 3A). Transfection of pGL3-190 resulted in the highest luciferase activity; it was nearly 6-fold higher than that which resulted from transfection of pGL3-124. However, transfection of survivin constructs longer than pGL3-265 resulted in significantly less activity compared with that of pGL3-190, suggesting the presence of enhancer elements in the region from nt −124 to −190 and repressor elements in the region upstream of nt −190. When cells were cultured with zinc for 24 h, the luciferase activity of each reporter construct, including the shortest pGL3-124, increased by ∼3-fold compared with the respective cells cultured without zinc, suggesting that E2A-HLF induces survivin transcription through cis elements in the region from nt 0 to −124. To further investigate the mechanism through which E2A-HLF induces transcription of the survivin gene, we used luciferase reporter constructs with mutated cell cycle-dependent cis elements. These elements, including the cell cycle-dependent element (CDE; GGCGG) and the cell cycle homology region (CHR; ATTTGAA), are implicated in G1 transcriptional repression in S/G2-regulated genes, such as cyclin A, cdc25C, and cdc2 (18Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A previously published report demonstrated two CDEs (−6 and −12) and one CHR (−42) in the human survivin promoter between nt 0 and −124 (Fig. 3B) (18Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). When pGL3-124mut1, which contained mutated CDE-6 and CDE-12 but had intact CHR-42, was transfected in Nalm-6/E2A-HLF cells, the level of luciferase activity was virtually the same as that of pGL3-124 regardless of the presence of zinc, suggesting that CDE-6 and CDE-12 do not contribute to regulation of survivin transcription in Nalm-6 cells (Fig. 3A). By contrast, transfection of pGL3-124mut2, which contained mutated CHR-42 in addition to mutated CDE-6 and CDE-12, resulted in 10-fold higher luciferase activity in the absence of zinc and 3-fold higher luciferase activity in the presence of zinc compared with transfection of pGL3-124. As a result, there was virtually no difference in the level of luciferase activity between the presence or absence of zinc in cells transfected with pGL3-124mut2. Transfection of pGL3-124mut3, in which only CHR-42 was mutated, show similar results as transfection of pGL3-124mut2. These results suggested th"

SAA1 is one of the few modifiers identified in humans: this gene influences the risk of renal amyloidosis (RA) in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a Mendelian autoinflammatory disorder associated with mutations in MEFV. Indeed, the SAA1 alpha homozygous genotype and the p.Met694Val homozygous genotype at the MEFV locus are two main risk factors for RA.HERE, WE INVESTIGATED ARMENIAN FMF PATIENTS AND CONTROLS FROM TWO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES: Armenia, where RA is frequent (24%), and Karabakh, where RA is rare (2.5%). Sequencing of MEFV revealed similar frequencies of p.Met694Val homozygotes in the two groups of patients. However, a major deficit of SAA1 alpha homozygotes was found among Karabakhian patients (4%) as compared to Armenian patients (24%) (p = 5.10(-5)). Most importantly, we observed deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the two groups of patients, and unexpectedly, in opposite directions, whereas, in the two control populations, genotype distributions at this locus were similar and complied with (HWE).The excess of SAA1alpha homozygotes among Armenian patients could be explained by the recruitment of patients with severe phenotypes. In contrast, a population-based study revealed that the deficit of alpha/alpha among Karabakhian patients would result from a negative selection against carriers of this genotype. This study, which provides new insights into the role of SAA1 in the pathophysiology of FMF, represents the first example of deviations from HWE and selection involving the modifier gene of a Mendelian disorder."

Voltage gated sodium channels have four non-identical domains which differentiates them from the homotetrameric potassium channels that form the basis for current structural models. Since potassium and sodium channels also exhibit many different functional characteristics and the fourth domain (D4) of sodium channels differs in function from other domains (D1–D3), we have explored its structure in order to determine whether segments in D4 of sodium channels differ significantly from that determined for potassium channels. We have probed the secondary and tertiary structure and the role of the individual amino acid residues of the S2D4) of Nav1.4 by employing cysteine-scanning mutagenesis (with tryptophan and glutamine substituted for native cysteine). A Fourier transform power spectrum of perturbations in free energy of steady-state inactivation gating (using midpoint potentials and slopes of Boltzmann equation fits of channel availability, h∞-V plots) indicates a substantial amount of α-helical structure in S2D4 (peak at 106°, α-Periodicity Index (α-PI) of 3.10), This conclusion is supported by α-PI values of 3.28 and 2.84 for the perturbations in rate constants of entry into (β) and exit from (α) fast inactivation at 0 mV for mutant channels relative to WT channels assuming a simple two-state model for transition from the open to inactivated state. The results of cysteine substitution at the two most sensitive sites of the S2D4 α-helix (N1382 and E1392C) support the existence of electrostatic network interactions between S2 and other transmembrane segments within Nav1.4D4 similar to but not identical to those proposed for K+ channels."
