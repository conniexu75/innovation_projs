https://openalex.org/W2159466552,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates a set of signaling pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). The three UPR branches (IRE1, PERK, and ATF6) promote cell survival by reducing misfolded protein levels. UPR signaling also promotes apoptotic cell death if ER stress is not alleviated. How the UPR integrates its cytoprotective and proapoptotic outputs to select between life or death cell fates is unknown. We found that IRE1 and ATF6 activities were attenuated by persistent ER stress in human cells. By contrast, PERK signaling, including translational inhibition and proapoptotic transcription regulator Chop induction, was maintained. When IRE1 activity was sustained artificially, cell survival was enhanced, suggesting a causal link between the duration of UPR branch signaling and life or death cell fate after ER stress. Key findings from our studies in cell culture were recapitulated in photoreceptors expressing mutant rhodopsin in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa."

https://openalex.org/W2097469177,"It is widely assumed that the key rate-limiting step in gene activation is the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the core promoter1. Although there are well-documented examples in which Pol II is recruited to a gene but stalls2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, a general role for Pol II stalling in development has not been established. We have carried out comprehensive Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) assays in Drosophila embryos and identified three distinct Pol II binding behaviors: active (uniform binding across the entire transcription unit), no binding, and stalled (binding at the transcription start site). The notable feature of the ∼10% genes that are stalled is that they are highly enriched for developmental control genes, which are either repressed or poised for activation during later stages of embryogenesis. We propose that Pol II stalling facilitates rapid temporal and spatial changes in gene activity during development."
https://openalex.org/W2140485864,"Regulation of gene expression is integral to the development and survival of all organisms. Transcription begins with the assembly of a pre-initiation complex at the gene promoter1, followed by initiation of RNA synthesis and the transition to productive elongation2,3,4. In many cases, recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to a promoter is necessary and sufficient for activation of genes. However, there are a few notable exceptions to this paradigm, including heat shock genes and several proto-oncogenes, whose expression is attenuated by regulated stalling of polymerase elongation within the promoter-proximal region5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. To determine the importance of polymerase stalling for transcription regulation, we carried out a genome-wide search for Drosophila melanogaster genes with Pol II stalled within the promoter-proximal region. Our data show that stalling is widespread, occurring at hundreds of genes that respond to stimuli and developmental signals. This finding indicates a role for regulation of polymerase elongation in the transcriptional responses to dynamic environmental and developmental cues."

We rejected the hypothesis of an isotropic distribution of these cosmic rays with at least a 99% confidence level from a prescribed a priori test. The correlation we observed is compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energy particles originate from nearby extragalactic sources whose flux has not been substantially reduced by interaction with the cosmic background radiation. AGN or objects having a similar spatial distribution are possible sources."
https://openalex.org/W1963724707,"The identification of neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) by in vivo brain imaging could have important implications for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. We describe a metabolic biomarker for the detection and quantification of NPCs in the human brain in vivo. We used proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify and characterize a biomarker in which NPCs are enriched and demonstrated its use as a reference for monitoring neurogenesis. To detect low concentrations of NPCs in vivo, we developed a signal processing method that enabled the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the analysis of the NPC biomarker in both the rodent brain and the hippocampus of live humans. Our findings thus open the possibility of investigating the role of NPCs and neurogenesis in a wide variety of human brain disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1970707895,"The mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, is a central regulator of cell growth. Its activity is regulated by Rheb, a Ras-like small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), in response to growth factor stimulation and nutrient availability. We show that Rheb regulates mTOR through FKBP38, a member of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family that is structurally related to FKBP12. FKBP38 binds to mTOR and inhibits its activity in a manner similar to that of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Rheb interacts directly with FKBP38 and prevents its association with mTOR in a guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP)–dependent manner. Our findings suggest that FKBP38 is an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, whose inhibitory activity is antagonized by Rheb in response to growth factor stimulation and nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W2028349080,"Dislocations are ubiquitous linear defects and are responsible for many of the properties of crystalline materials. Studies on the glide process of dislocations in bulk materials have mostly focused on the response of dislocations with macroscopic lengths to external loading or unloading. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we show that nanometer-sized loops with a Burgers vector of ½〈111〉 in α-Fe can undergo one-dimensional diffusion even in the absence of stresses that are effective in driving the loops. The loop size dependence of the loop diffusivity obtained is explained by the stochastic thermal fluctuation in the numbers of double kinks."

https://openalex.org/W1968621706,"This issue includes a landmark collection of papers on the stalwart of the genetics lab, the Drosophila fruit fly. The centrepiece is the publication by the Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium of the genomic sequence for ten Drosophila species. The paper compares the newly sequenced genomes (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi species), with the two previously known sequences for D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. The resulting database of genetic variation will be invaluable for the study of the forces of evolutionary change. A second major collaboration has mined the dozen Drosophila genome sequences for conserved elements, and reports the relationship between conservation and function for many specific sequence motifs. A detailed regulatory network emerges, identifying protein-coding genes and exons, RNA genes, microRNAs and their targets. These papers are discussed in News and Views. Two further research papers use the new genomic data to study gene expression, first for genes with male-biased expression and those unique to each species and second, to track the evolution of gene dosage compensation on Drosophila sex chromosomes. Four new reviews focus on how the latest work on Drosophila is taking this genetically pliant lab model into exciting new fields. Pierre Leopold and Norbert Perrimon review advances in the study of endocrinology and homeostasis that are establishing Drosophila as a model for mammalian physiology. Drosophila has proved a powerful system in which to study the pathways controlling cell shape in growing tissue, as reported by Thomas Lecuit and Loïc Le Goff. Leslie Vosshall reviews the remarkable work linking neural circuits and behaviour and John Lis reviews work on Drosophila that has rewritten the textbook view of gene transcription. The cover shows anaesthetized individuals of all twelve Drosophila species. The evolution of dosage compensation on Drosophila sex chromosomes is examined by using microarrays to determine relative gene expression of sex-linked genes in a number of fly species. How this expression changes over time is discussed, particularly in species with a neo-X chromosome, to determine why genes might have male-biased expression. X chromosomes evolve differently from autosomes, but general governing principles have not emerged1. For example, genes with male-biased expression are under-represented on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster2, but are randomly distributed in the genome of Anopheles gambiae3. In direct global profiling experiments using species-specific microarrays, we find a nearly identical paucity of genes with male-biased expression on D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. virilis and D. mojavensis X chromosomes. We observe the same under-representation on the neo-X of D. pseudoobscura. It has been suggested that precocious meiotic silencing of the X chromosome accounts for reduced X chromosome male-biased expression in nematodes4, mammals5 and Drosophila6. We show that X chromosome genes with male-biased expression are under-represented in somatic cells and in mitotic male germ cells. These data are incompatible with simple X chromosome inactivation models. Using expression profiling and comparative sequence analysis, we show that selective gene extinction on the X chromosome, creation of new genes on autosomes and changed genomic location of existing genes contribute to the unusual X chromosome gene content."
https://openalex.org/W2048545536,"The wave nature of particles is rarely observed, in part because of their very short de Broglie wavelengths in most situations. However, even with wavelengths close to the size of their surroundings, the particles couple to their environment (for example, by gravity, Coulomb interaction, or thermal radiation). These couplings shift the wave phases, often in an uncontrolled way, and the resulting decoherence, or loss of phase integrity, is thought to be a main cause of the transition from quantum to classical behavior. How much interaction is needed to induce this transition? Here we show that a photoelectron and two protons form a minimum particle/slit system and that a single additional electron constitutes a minimum environment. Interference fringes observed in the angular distribution of a single electron are lost through its Coulomb interaction with a second electron, though the correlated momenta of the entangled electron pair continue to exhibit quantum interference."

https://openalex.org/W2090691489,"Mating with another species (hybridization) is often maladaptive. Consequently, females typically avoid heterospecifics as mates. Contrary to these expectations, female spadefoot toads were more likely to choose heterospecific males when exposed to environmental conditions that favor hybridization. Indeed, those females with phenotypic characteristics for which hybridization is most favorable were most likely to switch from choosing conspecifics to heterospecifics. Moreover, environmentally dependent mate choice has evolved only in populations and species that risk engaging in, and can potentially benefit from, hybridization. Thus, when the benefits of mate choice vary, females may radically alter their mate selection in response to their own phenotype and their environment, even to the point of choosing males of other species."

https://openalex.org/W2025766482,"Neurons in the recipient layers of sensory cortices receive excitatory input from two major sources: the feedforward thalamocortical and recurrent intracortical inputs. To address their respective functional roles, we developed a new method for silencing cortex by competitively activating GABAA while blocking GABAB receptors. In the rat primary auditory cortex, in vivo whole-cell recording from the same neuron before and after local cortical silencing revealed that thalamic input occupied the same area of frequency-intensity tonal receptive field as the total excitatory input, but showed a flattened tuning curve. In contrast, excitatory intracortical input was sharply tuned with a tuning curve that closely matched that of suprathreshold responses. This can be attributed to a selective amplification of cortical cells' responses at preferred frequencies by intracortical inputs from similarly tuned neurons. Thus, weakly tuned thalamocortical inputs determine the subthreshold responding range, whereas intracortical inputs largely define the tuning. Such circuits may ensure a faithful conveyance of sensory information."
https://openalex.org/W2079786703,"DNA polymerase η (Pol η) is a eukaryotic lesion bypass polymerase that helps organisms to survive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and tumor cells to gain resistance against cisplatin-based chemotherapy. It allows cells to replicate across cross-link lesions such as 1,2-d(GpG) cisplatin adducts (Pt-GG) and UV-induced cis – syn thymine dimers. We present structural and biochemical analysis of how Pol η copies Pt-GG–containing DNA. The damaged DNA is bound in an open DNA binding rim. Nucleotidyl transfer requires the DNA to rotate into an active conformation, driven by hydrogen bonding of the templating base to the dNTP. For the 3′dG of the Pt-GG, this step is accomplished by a Watson-Crick base pair to dCTP and is biochemically efficient and accurate. In contrast, bypass of the 5′dG of the Pt-GG is less efficient and promiscuous for dCTP and dATP as a result of the presence of the rigid Pt cross-link. Our analysis reveals the set of structural features that enable Pol η to replicate across strongly distorting DNA lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2087277393,"Leptin plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolism, primarily by acting on neurons in the hypothalamus that control food intake. However, leptin receptors are more widely expressed in the brain suggesting additional, as yet unknown, functions of leptin. Here we show that both embryonic and adult hippocampal neurons express leptin receptors coupled to activation of STAT3 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathways. Leptin protects hippocampal neurons against cell death induced by neurotrophic factor withdrawal and excitotoxic and oxidative insults. The neuroprotective effect of leptin is antagonized by the JAK2-STAT3 inhibitor AG-490, STAT3 decoy DNA, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inhibitors but not by an inhibitor of MAPK. Leptin induces the production of manganese superoxide dismutase and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, and stabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential and lessens mitochondrial oxidative stress. Leptin receptor-deficient mice (db/db mice) are more vulnerable to seizure-induced hippocampal damage, and intraventricular administration of leptin protects neurons against seizures. By enhancing mitochondrial resistance to apoptosis and excitotoxicity, our findings suggest that leptin signaling serves a neurotrophic function in the developing and adult hippocampus.

Leptin is a 16-kDa protein produced primarily by adipose cells from which it is released into the circulation and transported across the blood-brain barrier. Leptin regulates food intake and energy homeostasis by activating receptors on neurons in the hypothalamus. Mice defective in leptin production or signaling are hyperphagic and obese (1Boston B.A. Blaydon K.M. Varnerin J. Cone R.D.

Leptin signaling is mediated by the leptin receptor (ObRb), 2The abbreviations used are: ObRbleptin receptorJAK-2Janus kinase-2STAT3signal transducer and activator of transcription-3Mn-SODmanganese superoxide dismutaseTMREtetramethylrhodamine ethyl esterDHRdihydrorhodamine 123PIphosphatidylinositolPBSphosphate-buffered salineMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseROSreactive oxygen species. which is a member of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily. Leptin binding to Ob-Rb results in activation of the tyrosine kinase JAK-2, which in turn phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptor, providing a binding site for STAT3. The activated STAT3 proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of various genes (11Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev.

Beyond regulating energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine functions by acting on neuronal targets in the hypothalamus, leptin may have more widespread actions in the brain. Leptin receptors are expressed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and other regions of the adult rodent brain (12Shioda S. Funahashi H. Nakajo S. Yada T. Maruta O. Nakai Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 243: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Mercer J.G. Hoggard N. Williams L.M. Lawrence C.B. Hannah L.T. Trayhurn P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), but the function of leptin in these brain regions is unknown. However, it was reported that leptin can modulate the excitability of hippocampal neurons by activating potassium channels (14Shanley L.J. Irving A.J. Rae M.G. Ashford M.L. Harvey J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 299-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and that leptin receptor-deficient rodents have impaired spatial learning ability (15Li X.L. Aou S. Oomura Y. Hori N. Fukunaga K. Hori T. Neuroscience. 2002; 113: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), suggesting that leptin signaling may influence neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. Here we show that hippocampal neurons express leptin receptors coupled to the JAK/STAT and PI 3-kinase Akt signaling pathways. Activation of these pathways by leptin promotes neuronal survival by a mechanism involving increased production of the antioxidant enzyme Mn-SOD and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Hippocampal neurons in leptin receptor-deficient mice are more vulnerable to seizure-induced death, and administration of leptin to normal mice protects hippocampal neurons against seizures. Hippocampal Cultures, Experimental Treatments, and Quantification of Neuronal Survival—Hippocampi were removed from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats, and cells were plated in 35- or 60-mm diameter plastic dishes or glass coverslips on a polyethyleneimine substrate in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented 10% with heat-activated fetal bovine serum and containing 1 mm l-glutamine, 1mm pyruvate, 20 mm KCl, and 26 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.2). Following cell attachment, the culture medium was replaced with Neurobasal Medium containing B27 supplements (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm HEPES, and 0.001% gentamicin sulfate. All experiments were performed in 8-10-day-old-cultures. Leptin (PeproTech), glutamate (Sigma), and FeSO4 (Sigma) were prepared as 200-500× stocks in sterile water. AG490 (ICN), wortmannin (Sigma), PD98059, and LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology) were prepared as 500× stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide. STAT3 decoy DNA and control DNA were purchased from IDT; the following sequences were the same as described previously (16Leong P.L. Andrews G.A. Johnson D.E. Dyer K.F. Xi S. Mai J.C. Robbins P.D. Gadiparthi S. Burke N.A. Watkins S.F. Grandis J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Just before treatment, the medium was changed to Neurobasal Medium lacking B27 supplements. Withdrawal of trophic factor support was accomplished by replacing the culture maintenance medium with Locke's buffer as described previously (17Glazner G.W. Chan S.L. Lu C. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal survival was quantified by counting viable neurons in pre-marked microscope fields (10× objective) before experimental treatment and at different time points after treatment. Viability of neurons was established by morphological criteria. Neurons with intact neurites of uniform diameter and a soma with a smooth appearance were considered viable, whereas neurons with fragmented neurites and a vacuolated and/or swollen soma were considered nonviable. Counts were made in at least four separate cultures per treatment condition. Assessment of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Reactive Oxygen Species—Cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 100 nm TMRE dye (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C and were then washed twice in Locke's buffer. The dye dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) was used to quantify relative levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (this dye is particularly sensitive to oxidation by peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical) using methods described previously (18Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St Clair D.K. Yen H.C. Germeyer A. Steiner S.M. Bruce-Keller A.J. Hutchins J.B. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Images of cellular TMRE or DHR fluorescence were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm. The average pixel intensity in user-defined areas corresponding to neuronal cell bodies was determined using Zeiss software. All images were coded and analyzed without knowledge of experimental treatment history of the cultures. Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblot Analyses—The methods were similar to those described previously (19Cheng A. Wang S. Cai J. Rao M.S. Mattson M.P. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated for 5 min in a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and placed in blocking solution (5% goat serum in PBS). Cells were then exposed to the primary ObRb antibody (1:3000 dilution; Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) and 30 min in the presence of ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). The immunoreactive product was detected using peroxidase-labeled avidin and diaminobenzidine. For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated in a blocking solution containing 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with one of the following primary antibodies: anti-β-tubulin II (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-Bcl-xL (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology); anti-Mn-SOD (1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology); anti-phosphorylated STAT3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling); anti-STAT3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling); phosphorylated Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling); anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma); and anti-GLUT3 (1:2000; Chemicon). The blot was then exposed for 1 h to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and immunoreactive protein was visualized using a chemiluminescence-based detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Mice, Kainate Treatment, and Quantification of Neuronal Survival—Male leptin receptor-deficient mice (db/db mice) and C57BL/6 control mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. Three-month-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and kainate (0.1 μg in a volume of 0.5 μl) was administered unilaterally via stereotaxic injection into the dorsal aspect of the right hippocampus (D/V, -1.4; M/L, +2.4; A/P, -2.0). Mice were euthanized 24 h after kainate injection and perfused transcardially with saline followed by cold buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. Coronal brain sections were cut at 30 μm on a freezing microtome and stained with cresyl violet. Nissl-positive surviving neurons were counted in three 40× fields in regions CA1 and CA3 of the kainate-treated hippocampus in six adjacent sections located between 0.2 and 0.6 mm rostral to the injection site. The mean number of neurons/field was determined for each mouse. Neurons were scored as undamaged if they were Nissl-positive with a round to oval shaped cell body that exhibited no evidence of cell shrinkage. All slides were coded and analyzed in a blinded manner. Osmotic Pump Implantation—Alzet osmotic minipumps model 1007D (Durect Corp.) were filled with either saline or leptin dissolved in saline (adjusted to deliver 3 μg/day for 6 days). Animal surgery was performed under 5% isoflurane anesthesia. 3-Month-old C57BL/6 male mice were implanted with a stainless steel cannula into lateral ventricle via a hole drilled in the skull (Alzet brain infusion kit 3 catalog number 8851) and positioned under stereotaxic guidance (anterior/posterior -0.34 mm from bregma, medial/lateral -1.00 mm, dorsal/ventral -1.2 mm from the surface of the skull). The Alzet minipumps were implanted subcutaneously in the back of the animal and connected to the cannula. The cannula and minipumps were removed 6 days after either saline or leptin infusion, and kainate (0.1 μg in a volume of 0.5 μl) was infused into the right dorsal hippocampus. Twenty four hours later mice were killed; the brains were removed, and coronal sections were cut and stained with cresyl violet (Nissl staining). Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance and the Scheffe test for pairwise comparisons. Leptin Receptor Activation Promotes Neuronal Survival under Conditions of Reduced Trophic Support, and Oxidative or Excitotoxic Stress—To determine whether hippocampal neurons are capable of responding to leptin, we first performed immunocytochemical analysis of cultured embryonic rat hippocampal neurons using an antibody against the long form of the leptin receptor Ob-Rb. Neurons exhibited specific leptin receptor immunoreactivity, with a subcellular distribution consistent with its being located in the plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments (Fig. 1, a and b). Previous studies have shown that binding of leptin to its receptor results in activation of the JAK/STAT and PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways (11Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 20Zhan A.Z. Shinohara M.M. Huang D. Shimizu M. Elder-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Bornfeldt K.E. J. Biol.

Wiegand S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4081-4090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or PI 3-kinase/Akt (22Cheng A. Wang S. Yang D. Xiao R. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7591-7599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) pathways can promote neuronal survival, we determined whether leptin affected neuronal survival under conditions of trophic deprivation or exposure to oxidative or excitotoxic insults. Overactivation of glutamate receptors can kill neurons in a process called excitotoxicity that is mediated by excessive calcium in flux through glutamate receptor channels and voltage-dependent calcium channels (23Mattson M.P. Neuromolecular Med. 2003; 3: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Hippocampal cultures were pretreated for 24 h with saline or leptin at three different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 nm) and were then exposed to an excitotoxic concentration of glutamate (50 μm) for 24 h. In cultures not receiving leptin, glutamate killed ∼70% of the neurons (Fig. 1c). More neurons survived in cultures that had been pretreated with either 10 or 100 nm leptin, whereas 1 nm leptin was ineffective. When deprived of trophic support, cultured hippocampal neurons undergo apoptosis (17Glazner G.W. Chan S.L. Lu C. Mattson M.P. J.

In the absence of leptin, trophic factor withdrawal resulted in the death of more than 40% of the neurons during a 48-h period (Fig. 1d). In cultures pretreated with leptin (10 nm) prior to withdrawal of trophic support, cell survival was significantly increased with fewer than 20% of the neurons dying during the 48-h period (Fig. 1c). Oxidative stress plays an important role in neuronal death resulting from trophic factor deprivation (24Chan S.L. Griffin W.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Greenlund L.J. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 303-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and excessive glutamate receptor stimulation (23Mattson M.P. Neuromolecular Med. 2003; 3: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of leptin to prevent neuronal death induced by exposure to Fe2+, an oxidative insult that induces hydroxyl radical production and membrane lipid peroxidation (26Mark R.J. Pang Z. Geddes J.W. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mattson M.P. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 53-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In control cultures, ∼55% of the neurons survived a 24-h exposure to Fe2+ (5 μm), whereas in cultures pretreated with leptin (10 nm), neuronal survival was significantly improved to ∼75% (Fig. 1c). The neuroprotective effect of leptin was maintained through 48 h of exposure to Fe2+ (Fig. 1c). Leptin Stabilizes Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Suppresses Oxidative Stress—Mitochondrial alterations, including oxyradical production and membrane permeability changes, play a pivotal role in the death of neurons induced by trophic factor deprivation and excitotoxic and oxidative insults (28Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Ward M.W. Castilho R.F. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Deshmukh M. Kuida K. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Fiskum G. J. Neurotrauma. 2000; 17: 843-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether leptin modifies mitochondrial changes involved in the death of neurons subjected to excitotoxic and oxidative insults. The fluorescent probe TMRE was used to assess mitochondrial membrane potential (31Gillessen T. Grasshoff C. Szinicz L. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2002; 56: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and dihydrorhodamine 123 was used to measure mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels (32Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Exposure of cultures to Fe2+ or glutamate resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of TMRE fluorescence in neurons within 16 h (Fig. 2a). Quantification of the fluorescence revealed that the magnitude of the decrease was ∼50% in glutamate-treated neurons and 60% in Fe2+-treated neurons (Fig. 2b). Treatment with leptin significantly attenuated the decreased levels of TMRE fluorescence induced by glutamate and Fe2+ (Fig. 2b). These findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of leptin is associated with preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Exposure of cultures to Fe2+ and glutamate resulted in significant increases in the level of DHR fluorescence in neurons within 6 h, indicating an increase in the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (Fig. 2c); Quantification of the fluorescence revealed that the magnitude of the increase was more than 3-fold in cultures treated with Fe2+ and more than 2-fold in cultures treated with glutamate (Fig. 2d). In contrast, cultures pretreated with leptin exhibited a significant attenuation of glutamate- and Fe2+-induced DHR fluorescence. Mitochondrial potential was also preserved, and reactive oxyradical species production was suppressed in neurons treated with leptin and subjected to trophic factor deprivation (data not shown). Collectively, these findings suggest that leptin signaling can stabilize mitochondrial function and thereby protect the cells against death induced by several different insults. Neuroprotective Effect of Leptin Involves Activation of JAK-STAT3 Signaling and Up-regulation of the Expression of Mn-SOD and Bcl-xL—Binding of leptin to ObRb results in the activation of JAK2, a member of the Janus kinase family of tyrosine kinases (33Houseknecht K.L. Portocarrero C.P. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 1998; 15: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 34Heshka J.T. Jones P.J. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 987-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of JAK2 on tyrosine 1138 recruits STAT3 to the ObRb-JAK2 complex, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent translocation of STAT3 to the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription. Immunoblot analysis revealed a rapid phosphorylation of STAT3 in hippocampal neurons in response to leptin, which occurred within 5 min of exposure to leptin and reached a peak at 30 min (Fig. 3a). When neurons were treated with AG490, a specific inhibitor of JAK2 phosphorylation (35Ishihara K. Satoh I. Mue S. Ohuchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1536: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Miike S. Nakao A. Hiraguri M. Kurasawa K. Saito Y. Iwamoto I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), STAT3 phosphorylation was attenuated. AG490 treatment also resulted in increased levels of two lower molecular weight phospho-STAT3 immunoreactive bands (Fig. 3a), which may be enzymatic cleavage products of STAT3 (37Darnowsky J.W. Goulette F.A. Guan Y.J. Chatterjee D. Yang Z.F. Cousens L.P. Chin Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17707-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Examination of phospho-STAT3 immunoreactivity in leptin-treated and control neurons revealed increased levels of nuclear phospho-STAT3 in leptin-treated neurons compared with untreated control neurons (not shown) and AG490-treated neurons (Fig. 3b). Phospho-STAT3 immunoreactivity was also present in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes treated with leptin although, compared with neurons, relatively little of the immunoreactivity was present in the nucleus of astrocytes (Fig. 3c). We next evaluated the effects of AG490 on neuronal survival in leptin-treated and control hippocampal cultures. Neurons were treated for 24 h with leptin alone or in combination with AG490 and were then exposed to Fe2+ for 24 h, and neuronal survival was quantified. AG490 completely blocked the neuroprotective effect of leptin (Fig. 3d). AG490 also blocked the neuroprotective effects of leptin in cultures exposed to glutamate and trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 3e). These results suggest that JAK2 and STAT3 activation are required for leptin-mediated cell survival signaling in hippocampal neurons. We next determined whether STAT3 nuclear translocation and DNA binding are necessary for leptin-mediated neuron survival signaling. We employed a decoy DNA approach in which neurons were treated with double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide with a sequence corresponding to the STAT3 consensus sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and specificity of such decoy DNAs in blocking the function of transcription factors in neurons (32Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In this study, gel shift analysis confirmed the specific binding of the decoy DNA to STAT3 (data not shown). Hippocampal neurons were treated for 24 h with leptin, in the presence of either STAT3 decoy DNA or a control DNA oligonucleotide, and then exposed to glutamate for 24 h. The ability of leptin to protect neurons against glutamate-induced death was significantly attenuated in cultures treated with STAT3 decoy DNA at a concentration of 1 μm, and a higher concentration of STAT3 decoy DNA (10 μm) exacerbated glutamate toxicity (Fig. 4a). Previous studies of non-neural cells have shown that STAT3 induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (38Heis F.C. Cheng G. Lin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme Mn-SOD (39Terui K. Enosawa S. Haga S. Zhang H.Q. Kuroda H. Kouchi K. Matsunaga T. Yoshida H. Engelhardt J.F. Irani K. Ohnuma N. Ozaki M. J. Hepatol. 2004; 41: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from control and leptin-treated cultures showed that leptin signaling increases the levels of both Bcl-xL and Mn-SOD in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4b). Treatment of cultures with AG490 or STAT3 decoy DNA blocked the ability of leptin to increase the level Mn-SOD and Bcl-xL (Fig. 4, c and d), indicating a requirement for JAK2 and STAT3 in leptin-induced Mn-SOD expression. STAT3 and the PI3K-Akt Pathways Mediate Mitochondrial Stabilization by Leptin—Because leptin induced the expression of Bcl-xL and Mn-SOD, we determined whether STAT3 and or the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathways mediated mitochondrial stabilization by leptin. Treatment of neurons with STAT3 decoy DNA abolished the ability of leptin to prevent glutamate-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Fig. 5a) and ROS production (Fig. 5b). Treatment of neurons with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 also blocked the ability of leptin to prevent glutamate-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Fig. 5c) and ROS production (Fig. 5d). These findings suggest that both STAT3 and PI 3-kinase-Akt pathways are involved in mitochondrial stabilization by leptin. The PI 3-Kinase-Akt Pathway but Not the MAPK Pathway Is Involved in the Neuroprotective Action of Leptin—In addition to the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, leptin can also activate PI 3-kinase-Akt and MAPK pathways (40Harvey J. McKay N.G. Walker K.S. Van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Ashford M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4660-4669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 41Najib S. Sanchez-Margalet V. Cell. Immunol. 2002; 220: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 42Attoub S. Noe V. Pirola L. Bruyneel E. Chastre E. Mareel M. Wymann M.P. Gespach C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because activation of the latter pathways can promote neuronal survival, we evaluated their involvement in the neuroprotective effect of leptin. We detected an increase in the amount of phosphorylated Akt in hippocampal neurons within 30 min of exposure of exposure to leptin (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, AG490 blocked the ability of leptin to increase the level of phospho-Akt (Fig. 6a) suggesting a role for JAK2 upstream of PI 3-kinase. There was no effect of leptin on the level of phosphorylated MAPKs (ERK1/2) in cultured hippocampal neurons (supplemental Fig. 1), and the selective MAPK inhibitor PD98059 at concentration of 2 μm did not modify the neuroprotective effect of leptin against glutamate toxicity (Fig. 6b). Treatment of hippocampal cultures with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin significantly attenuated the neuroprotective effect of leptin against glutamate toxicity (Fig. 6c). These findings suggest the involvement of PI 3-kinase and Akt kinases but not MAPKs in the cell survival promoting effect of leptin hippocampal neurons. Leptin Signaling Protects Hippocampal Neurons in Adult Mice against Seizure-induced Degeneration—To determine whether leptin signaling influences neuronal survival in vivo, we employed leptin receptor-deficient mice (db/db). As expected, the body weights of db/db mice were significantly greater than wild-type mice, whereas brain weights of db/db mice and wild-type mice were not different (Fig. 7a). As hippocampal neurons are vulnerable to excitotoxicity in temporal lobe epilepsy (43Sloviter R.S. Neurologia. 1996; 11: 29-32PubMed Google Scholar), we induced seizures in wild-type and db/db mice by focal injection of kainate into the dorsal hippocampus. Kainate caused the degeneration of neurons in regions CA3 and CA1 of the hippocampus of both wild-type and db/db mice (Fig. 7, b-d). However, the numbers of CA3 and CA1 neurons damaged by kainate were significantly greater in db/db mice compared with wild-type mice. We next performed an experiment to determine the potential of leptin treatment as a therapeutic intervention. Leptin was infused into the brain through an intraventricular cannula connected to an osmotic mini-pump at a rate of 3 μg per day for 6 days. To determine whether the infused leptin activated ObRb in hippocampal neurons, we compared the level and subcellular localization of STAT3 immunoreactivity in brain sections from control and leptin-treated mice. In control mice treated with PBS, STAT3 immunoreactivity was present in the molecular layers throughout the hippocampus, with little or no immunoreactivity in the cell bodies and nucleus of pyramidal neurons (Fig. 8a). In contrast, high levels of STAT3 immunoreactivity were present in the cell bodies and nucleus of CA3 and CA1 neurons in mice treated with leptin (Fig. 8a). We also performed immunoblot analysis of hippocampal tissue samples from PBS- and leptin-treated mice, and we found that levels of phospho-STAT3 were clearly increased in response to leptin, whereas levels of phospho-Akt were not significantly increased by leptin (supplemental Fig. 2). We next determined whether leptin treatment can protect hippocampal neurons against seizure-induced damage. Kainate caused the degeneration of neurons in regions CA3 and CA1 of the hippocampus of both control and leptin-treated mice (Fig. 8, b-d). However, the numbers of CA3 and CA1 neurons damaged by kainate were significantly lower in leptin-treated mice compared with PBS-treated control mice. Actions of leptin on the physiology of hypothalamic neurons involved in the regulation of appetite are well established, and it was recently reported that leptin has trophic action on hypothalamic neurons (44Bouret S.G. Graper S.J. Simerly R.B. Science. 2004; 304: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Leptin receptors are also expressed in hippocampal cells (45Huang X.F. Koutcherov I. Lin S. Wang H.O. Storlien L. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 2635-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 46Funahashi H. Yada T. Suzuki R. Shioda S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 224: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the function of leptin in the hippocampus is unknown. Activation of ObRb by leptin results in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (33Houseknecht K.L. Portocarrero C.P. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 1998; 15: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We found that an inhibitor of STAT3 (AG490) and STAT3 decoy DNA abolished the cell survival-promoting effect of leptin. Treatment of hippocampal neurons with AG490 also blocked the ability of leptin to activate Akt, indicating a role for STAT3 upstream of Akt in the PI 3-kinase pathway. PI 3-kinase inhibitors attenuated the neuroprotective actions of leptin. Our findings therefore suggest that leptin promotes the survival of hippocampal neurons by activating JAK2-STAT3 and PI 3-kinase-Akt pathways. Leptin induced the expression of Mn-SOD and Bcl-xL, two mitochondria-associated proteins known to protect neurons against excitotoxicity and apoptosis (18Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St Clair D.K. Yen H.C. Germeyer A. Steiner S.M. Bruce-Keller A.J. Hutchins J.B. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Matsuoka N. Ishii K. Akimoto M. Hamada H. Hashimoto N. Miyatake S. Neurosurgery. 2002; 50: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We found that leptin can prevent glutamate-induced cleavage of PARP1 (supplemental Fig. 3). Because cleavage of PARP1 occurs in neurons undergoing apoptosis, the effect of leptin on PARP1 is consistent with an anti-apoptotic action of leptin signaling in neurons. Previous studies have provided evidence that STAT3 regulates the transcription of the Mn-SOD and Bcl-xL genes (48Negoro S. Kunisada K. Fujio Y. Funamoto M. Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Osugi T. Izumi M. Oshima Y. Nakaoka Y. Hirota H. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Circulation. 2001; 104: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 49Orike N. Middleton G. Borthwick E. Buchman V.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32979-32988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that the latter genes may be direct targets of STAT3 in hippocampal neurons. Mitochondrial stabilization/protection appears to be an important mechanism by which leptin promotes the survival of hippocampal neurons under conditions of oxidative and excitotoxic stress. Previous studies have shown that neuronal deaths induced by glutamate, trophic factor deprivation, and iron each involve oxyradical production and mitochondrial dysfunction (18Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St Clair D.K. Yen H.C. Germeyer A. Steiner S.M. Bruce-Keller A.J. Hutchins J.B. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Greenlund L.J.

We found that leptin treatment significantly attenuated glutamate- and iron-induced decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential (TMRE fluorescence) and increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (DHR fluorescence) in hippocampal neurons. We found that STAT3 decoy DNA abolished the ability of leptin to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential and suppress ROS production in neurons exposed to glutamate. When taken together with the data showing that leptin induces the expression of Bcl-xL and Mn-SOD, in a STAT3-dependent manner, our findings reveal a signal transduction pathway and two mito-protective proteins that mediate the neuroprotective actions of leptin. The up-regulation of Bcl-xL and Mn-SOD likely contributes to leptin-mediated mitochondrial stabilization because Mn-SOD is a key mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme (18Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St Clair D.K. Yen H.C. Germeyer A. Steiner S.M. Bruce-Keller A.J. Hutchins J.B. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Gonzalez-Zulueta M.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2040-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Bcl-xL stabilizes mitochondrial membranes (55Gabriel B. Sureau F. Casselyn M. Teissie J. Petit P.X. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, other mechanisms may contribute to the excitoprotective action of leptin. Indeed, several studies have provided evidence that leptin can modify neuronal excitability and responsiveness to glutamate, in the context of synaptic and behavioral plasticity. For example, leptin inhibited seizure-like activity in rat hippocampal neurons by PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of BK potassium channels (14Shanley L.J. Irving A.J. Rae M.G. Ashford M.L. Harvey J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 299-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and induced long term depression at hippocampal CA1 synapses (56Durakoglugil M. Irving A.J. Harvey J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, leptin receptor-deficient rodents exhibit impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial memory ability (15Li X.L. Aou S. Oomura Y. Hori N. Fukunaga K. Hori T. Neuroscience. 2002; 113: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that leptin treatment can protect cells in the developing rodent brain against necrotic death induced by the excitotoxin ibotenic acid (57Dicou E. Attoub S. Gressens P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3947-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We found that hippocampal neurons in leptin receptor mutant mice exhibited increased vulnerability to excitotoxic injury, whereas intraventricular administration of leptin in normal mice protected hippocampal neurons. These findings suggest that leptin can exert a cytoprotective action in hippocampal neurons under conditions relevant to the pathogenesis of several different neurodegenerative disorders. Overactivation of glutamate receptors and oxidative stress are believed to contribute to the death of neurons in epilepsy (43Sloviter R.S. Neurologia. 1996; 11: 29-32PubMed Google Scholar), stroke (58Dirnagl U. Iadecola C. Moskowitz M.A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), Alzheimer disease (27Mattson M.P.

Neurol. 1998; 44: S110-S114Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (60Rothstein J.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to protecting neurons against direct exposure to glutamate, leptin increased the resistance of neurons to death induced by iron, a metal that induces membrane lipid peroxidation and renders neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity (26Mark R.J. Pang Z. Geddes J.W. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leptin was also effective in protecting hippocampal neurons against death induced by trophic factor withdrawal, a model relevant to natural developmental cell death (24Chan S.L. Griffin W.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, whether leptin signaling plays a role in determining which neurons live and which die during the period of programmed cell death remains to be established.

https://openalex.org/W1978829875,"The migration of point defects, for example, crystal lattice vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs), typically occurs through three-dimensional random walk in crystalline solids. However, when vacancies and SIAs agglomerate to form planar clusters, the migration mode may change. We observed nanometer-sized clusters of vacancies exhibiting one-dimensional (1D) fast migration. The 1D migration transported a vacancy cluster containing several hundred vacancies with a mobility higher than that of a single vacancy random walk and a mobility comparable to a single SIA random walk. Moreover, we found that the 1D migration may be a key physical mechanism for self-organization of nanometer-sized sessile vacancy cluster (stacking fault tetrahedron) arrays. Harnessing this 1D migration mode may enable new control of defect microstructures such as effective defect removal and introduction of ordered nanostructures in materials, including semiconductors."

Menon S.T. Marin E.P. Awad E.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 443-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4992) Google Scholar, 6Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar).Current dynamic studies of other GPCRs rely on fluorescence techniques. However, methods currently available for dynamic studies of fluorescently labeled GPCRs in reconstituted model systems have inherent limitations. The two most common methods to introduce site-specific fluorescent labels, maleimide chemistry targeting cysteine residues and the use of green fluorescent protein fusions, are cases in point. The former method requires either detailed exploration of labeling conditions to control the precise labeling site with wild-type receptors in the native membrane environment (7Imamoto Y. Kataoka M. Tokunaga F. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15225-15233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or replacement of naturally occurring cysteines with unreactive amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis (6Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 8Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One obvious technical problem with the mutagenesis approach is that the substitution of multiple cysteines in a GPCR might have unintended or unforeseen effects on function. Green fluorescent protein fusions provide technical convenience and have been mostly used for cell-based studies of trafficking, subcellular localization, and receptor dimerization. A disadvantage of this method is the size of the green fluorescent protein fusion tag (238 amino acids with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa), which might interfere with the GPCR function or reconstitution. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, or related ensemble methods, is potentially the most promising tool to study conformational dynamics and structure. However, such studies are not generally feasible for GPCRs, because they require specific labeling of receptors at very high yield, generally with suitable donor and acceptor fluorophore pairs. Clearly, the development of an alternative and efficient site-specific labeling technique would greatly facilitate dynamic studies of receptors. This challenge prompted us to introduce specific reactive amino acid side chains, suitable for further derivatization with a wide variety of fluorescent tags, into GPCRs while leaving their cellular biogenesis and function intact.An important recent advance biology has been the development of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis involving readthrough of an amber (UAG) codon in an mRNA by a suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with the unnatural amino acid. Unnatural amino acids with novel chemical, physical, and biological properties have been incorporated into proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (9Payne R.C. Nichols B.P. Hecht S.M.

Two different approaches are used for the synthesis of the aminoacylated suppressor tRNAs: (i) chemical aminoacylation of suppressor tRNAs and (ii) introduction of engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/suppressor tRNA pairs that aminoacylate the suppressor tRNA in vivo with the desired unnatural amino acid. The chemical approach (23Heckler T.G. Chang L.H. Zama Y. Naka T. Chorghade M.S. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1468-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) is more versatile and allows the attachment of virtually any unnatural amino acid of interest to the suppressor tRNA. Dougherty and co-workers (17Beene D.L. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E.

Highly sensitive measurements of unique channel activities made the absolute expression yield non-critical, with single cell expression being sufficient. However, these and other studies (26Turcatti G. Nemeth K. Edgerton M.D. Meseth U. Talabot F. Peitsch M. Knowles J. Vogel H. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19991-19998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have been mostly limited to oocytes. The low yield and the technical difficulties to produce and deliver chemically aminoacylated suppressor tRNA into a large number of mammalian cells made this method impractical for general studies of GPCRs. In recent years, the alternative approach involving aaRS/suppressor tRNA pairs has opened up the possibility for synthesis in vivo of functionally active proteins containing unnatural amino acids, thereby providing a promising approach to study GPCRs using simplified procedures that any typical biochemistry or biophysics laboratory can undertake.High level site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins requires first the availability of orthogonal aaRS/suppressor tRNA pairs (27Edwards H. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Drabkin H.J. Park H.J. RajBhandary U.L. Mol. Cell.

A. 2001; 98: 2268-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These aaRSs are then mutagenized and used for generating suppressor tRNAs aminoacylated with the unnatural amino acid of choice in vivo. An orthogonal pair consisting of an amber suppressor tRNA derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus tRNATyr (Bst-Yam) and mutants derived from Escherichia coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) (Y37V/Q195C) was first established in mammalian cells for incorporation of 3-iodo-l-tyrosine into reporter proteins such as Ras, epidermal growth factor receptor, and cyan fluorescent protein (16Sakamoto K. Hayashi A. Sakamoto A. Kiga D. Nakayama H. Soma A. Kobayashi T. Kitabatake M. Takio K. Saito K. Shirouzu M. Hirao I. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4692-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Schultz and co-workers evolved several variants of E. coli TyrRS using positive and negative selections in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18Chin J.W. Cropp T.A. Anderson J.C. Mukherji M. Zhang Z. Schultz P.G. Science. 2003; 301: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) for the incorporation of other unnatural amino acids, including p-acetyl-l-phenylalanine (Acp) and p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bzp). More recently, the combination of Bst-Yam with one of these TyrRS variants (Y37G/D182G/L186A) was used to successfully incorporate Bzp into Grb2 protein in mammalian cells (21Hino N. Okazaki Y. Kobayashi T. Hayashi A. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).For this study, we were particularly interested in unnatural amino acids containing a keto moiety, such as Acp and Bzp, to introduce a chemically reactive handle into GPCRs. Keto groups are generally absent from natural proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids and can be derivatized both in vitro (13Cornish V.W. Hahn K.M. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8150-8151Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Bayer E.A. Ben-Hur H. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Wang L. Zhang Z. Brock A. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and in vivo (32Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 33Chen I. Howarth M. Lin W. Ting A.Y. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Z. Smith B.A. Wang L. Brock A. Cho C. Schultz P.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6735-6746Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with hydrazide- or hydroxylamine-bearing probes under physiological conditions. For site-specific incorporation of Acp and Bzp into GPCRs in mammalian cells, we use two orthogonal pairs consisting of the Bst-Yam suppressor tRNA and E. coli TyrRS variants AcpRS (Y37I/D165G/D182G/F183M/L186A) and BzpRS (Y37G/D182G/L186A), respectively, developed earlier in yeast (18Chin J.W. Cropp T.A. Anderson J.C. Mukherji M. Zhang Z. Schultz P.G. Science. 2003; 301: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar).To adapt unnatural amino acid mutagenesis to low abundance membrane proteins, amber codon suppression by the orthogonal suppressor tRNA/aaRS pairs must be optimized and a clear assessment of the amount of functional protein that contains the unnatural amino acid is necessary. A highly sensitive assay based on firefly luciferase (FLuc) reporter was used to optimize transfection procedures, evaluate functional yields of mutant proteins, and confirm independently the orthogonality and specificity of these pairs in mammalian cells. We successfully incorporated Acp and Bzp efficiently into two different GPCRs, CCR5 and rhodopsin, targeting multiple specific sites while preserving the function of the mutant receptors. The functionality of the receptors was demonstrated by calcium flux assays and cell surface expression of CCR5, or by direct spectroscopic evaluation of rhodopsin. Furthermore, mutant rhodopsins containing Acp could be derivatized with a keto-reactive hydrazide-fluorophore. Our results highlight the general use of this approach to future biophysical and cell biological studies of 7-transmembrane receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral—Standard E. coli genetic techniques were performed (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strains XL1-Blue (recA1 endA1 gyr96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac (F′ proAB lacIqZΔM15 Tn10 (Tetr)) from Stratagene and TOP10 (F- mcrA Δ(mrrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) ϕ80lacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 recA1 araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL (StrR) endA1 nupG)) from Invitrogen were used for plasmid propagation and isolation. Oligonucleotides were obtained from IDT, Genelink, and eOligo. Plasmid DNA was purified using standard Maxi Prep or EndoFree Maxi Prep Kits from Qiagen. Acp and Bzp were from RSP Amino Acids LLC and Bachem, respectively.Plasmids for Expression of Suppressor tRNA and Mutant aaRS Genes in Mammalian Cells—The expression cassette carrying an amber suppressor tRNA derived from the B. stearothermophilus tRNATyr (Bst-Yam) was designed with the following sequence: 5′-AGCGCTCCGGTTTTTCTGTGCTGAACCTCAGGGGACGCCGACACACGTACACGTCGGAGGGGTAGCGAAGTGGCTAAACGCGGCGGACTCTAAATCCGCTCCCTTTGGGTTCGGCGGTTCGAATCCGTCCCCCTCCAGTCCTTTTTTTG-3′. It consists of a (i) 5′ leader sequence taken from the human tRNATyr gene (underlined); (ii) the B. stearothermophilus tRNATyr gene sequence (bold) in which the anticodon was changed to CUA (bold underlined) and the 3′-terminal CCA was omitted; and (iii) a 3′-terminal region containing a transcription termination sequence (italics). The expression cassette was amplified from a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide by PCR and inserted into pSVBpUC (36Drabkin H.J. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5588-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding E. coli TyrRS was amplified by PCR from the genome of E. coli strain TOP10 and inserted into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) for subsequent mutagenesis. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol; Y37I/D165G/D182G/F183M/L186A for AcpRS and Y37G/D182G/L186A for BzpRS. The genes for AcpRS and BzpRS were further amplified by PCR introducing a C-terminal FLAG tag and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1(+)/neo (Invitrogen).Plasmids for Expression of FLuc, CCR5, and Rhodopsin in Mammalian Cells—The gene for wild-type firefly luciferase (FLuc.wt) and a variant thereof carrying a Y70am mutation (FLuc.Y70am) were amplified from plasmids described earlier (37Köhrer C. Yoo J. Bennett M. Schaack J. RajBhandary U.L. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1095-1102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pCMVTNT (Promega). Both luciferase constructs contain a C-terminal His6 tag. Plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)/neo carrying the gene for wild-type CCR5 (38Seibert C. Ying W. Gavrilov S. Tsamis F. Kuhmann S.E. Palani A. Tagat J.R.

Virology. 2006; 349: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and plasmid pMT4 carrying the gene for wild-type rhodopsin were described earlier (39Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A. Cypess A.M.

A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Both proteins contain a C-terminal 1D4 tag. Amber mutations were introduced into CCR5 at positions Ile-28, Phe-96, or Phe-260 using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Similarly, rhodopsin mutants carrying an amber mutation at positions Tyr-29, Tyr-102, or Tyr-274 were generated. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Incorporation of Acp and Bzp into Proteins Expressed in Mammalian Cells—HEK293T and HEK293S GnTI- cells (41Reeves P.J. Callewaert N. Contreras R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4,500 mg/liter glucose, Invitrogen and Cellgro), 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mammalian cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) or Effectene (Qiagen). For transfection in a 10-cm culture dish, 3.5 μg of pcDNA.CCR5 (or pMT4.rho), 3.5 μg of pSVBpUC.Bst-Yam, and 0.35 μg of pcDNA.aaRS were mixed with Lipofectamine and added to cells at 70–80% confluence according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three hours after transfection, cells were fed with an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Small scale transfections for luciferase expression in 24-well plates were carried out as described previously using Effectene (42Köhrer C. Sullivan E.L. RajBhandary U.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6200-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unnatural amino acids were supplied at a final concentration of 0.3–1 mm 3 h post-transfection; Acp was dissolved directly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a stock concentration of 2–3 mm; Bzp was neutralized with NaOH at a concentration of 0.2–0.4 m and then added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a final concentration of 0.3–1 mm. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and analyzed for expression of Bst-Yam, CCR5, rhodopsin, and luciferase.Analysis of in Vivo State of Suppressor tRNAs Expressed in Mammalian Cells—Total RNAs were isolated under acidic conditions using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The tRNA was resuspended in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and stored in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at -80 °C. tRNAs were separated by acid urea PAGE (43Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), electroblotted onto Nytran-SPC membrane (Whatman), and detected by standard Northern blot hybridization. Membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C in 10× Denhardt's solution/6× SSC/0.5% SDS. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in 6× SSC/0.1% SDS in the presence of a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 1–20 of the Bst-Yam suppressor tRNA. An oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 18–36 of the human initiator tRNA Meti was used as an internal standard. Membranes were washed at room temperature, once with 6× SSC/0.1% SDS followed by two washes with 6× SSC, and then subjected to autoradiography. Northern blots were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics).Assay for Luciferase Activity—A Single Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) was used to assay luciferase activity following the manufacturer's instructions. The preparation of mammalian cell extracts has been described elsewhere (37Köhrer C. Yoo J. Bennett M. Schaack J. RajBhandary U.L. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1095-1102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Measurement of luciferase activities was carried out on a Sirius tube luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems) with a 10-s premeasurement delay and a 15-s measurement period. Luciferase activities are given as relative luminescence units per μg of total cell protein. The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined with a BCA protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as standard. The values shown in the tables and figures represent the averages of at least two independent experiments; variation among experiments was <10%.Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon, a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies against the 1D4 epitope (National Cell Culture Center, 1:5,000), His4 tag (Qiagen; 1:5,000), FLAG tag (Invitrogen; 1:5,000), and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences GE or KPL Inc.; 1:5,000 to 1:10,000; anti-mouse IgG). Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence treatment (Amersham Biosciences GE or PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak). Equal amounts of total protein were analyzed per lane.Characterization of RANTES-dependent Calcium Flux in Transiently Transfected HEK293T Cells—Assays of calcium flux in mammalian cells using Fluo-3 (Invitrogen) as an intracellular calcium-indicator dye were performed essentially as described (44Cypess A.M. Unson C.G. Wu C.R. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19455-19464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Studies were performed at least twice on independent samples. Dose-response data were collected by measuring the effects of various concentrations of human RANTES peptide (Peprotech) on the calcium flux. For each concentration, 10% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to lyse the cells for maximal fluorescence followed by a quench with 4 mm EGTA that provides the minimal signal. Fluorescence was measured on an F-4500 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Fluorescence peak heights normalized to the total fluorescence response were plotted against RANTES concentration, and the data were fit to a four-parameter logistic function of the form: f(x) = a + [(b - a)/(1 + (x/c)d)] (45Kazmi M.A. Snyder L.A. Cypess A.M. Graber S.G. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3734-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The EC50 values were calculated from the inflection point c of the best-fit curve.Cell Surface Expression of CCR5 and Fluorescence Microscopy—24 h post-transfection, cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and cultured for another 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and labeled either with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CCR5 antibody (clone 2D7, BD Pharmingen) or with 1D4 antibody followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Fluorescence images of permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells were obtained. The cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope using a 20× objective. The images were acquired using Axiovision software and processed using Adobe Photoshop.Preparation and Spectral Characterization of Rhodopsin Mutants—The regeneration, immunoaffinity purification, and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy of rhodopsin were performed as described (39Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A. Cypess A.M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9400-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin samples were generally obtained in 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM, Anatrace)/0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.5). UV-visible spectra were recorded with a Lambda 800 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) set to a slit width of 2 nm in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length before and after 30 s of photobleaching with a 150-W FiberLite A-200 fiber-optic light source (Dolan Jenner Industries) using a 495-nm cut-off filter. The intensity of the 500 nm peak was used to calculate the concentration of rhodopsin, with an extinction coefficient of 42,000 m-1cm-1.Site-specific Labeling in Vitro of Purified Rhodopsin Mutants Containing a Reactive Keto Moiety—Cells from a 10-cm culture dish were harvested, regenerated with 11-cis-retinal, and further solubilized with 1 ml of SB buffer (0.05 m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.8) containing 1.0% (w/v) DM for 3–4 h at 4 °C as described (39Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A. Cypess A.M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9400-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, supernatant fractions were loaded onto 50 μl of 1D4 resin slurry (39Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A. Cypess A.M. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9400-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and equilibrated for ∼4 h at 4 °C. Resins were washed three times with WB1 (0.05 m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05% DM, pH 6.0), and then incubated with 300 μl of WB1 containing 1 mm fluorescein-hydrazide (Invitrogen) overnight at room temperature. Resins were washed extensively with WB1 (pH 6.8), followed by washes with WB2 (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.1% DM, pH 6.5). Labeled rhodopsin was eluted in a total volume of ∼100 μl of EB (WB2 buffer containing 0.36 mg/ml 1D5 peptide, Anaspec). Samples were analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. The amount of rhodopsin was normalized based on t"
https://openalex.org/W1997537106,"Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels that control photomovement of microalgae. In optogenetics, ChRs are widely applied for light-triggering action potentials in cells, tissues, and living animals, yet the spectral properties and photocycle of ChR remain obscure. In this study, we cloned a ChR from the colonial alga Volvox carteri, VChR. After electrophysiological characterization in Xenopus oocytes, VChR was expressed in COS-1 cells and purified. Time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy revealed a pH-dependent equilibrium of two dark species, D470/D480. Laser flashes converted both with τ ≈ 200 μs into major photointermediates P510/P530, which reverted back to the dark states with τ ≈ 15-100 ms. Both intermediates were assigned to conducting states. Three early intermediates P500/P515 and P390 were detected on a ns to μs time scale. The spectroscopic and electrical data were unified in a photocycle model. The functional expression of VChR we report here paves the way toward a broader structure/function analysis of the recently identified class of light-gated ion channels. Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels that control photomovement of microalgae. In optogenetics, ChRs are widely applied for light-triggering action potentials in cells, tissues, and living animals, yet the spectral properties and photocycle of ChR remain obscure. In this study, we cloned a ChR from the colonial alga Volvox carteri, VChR. After electrophysiological characterization in Xenopus oocytes, VChR was expressed in COS-1 cells and purified.

ChRs gain their light sensitivity and gating properties from the covalently bound chromophore all-trans-retinal, which isomerizes after light absorption (8Hegemann P. Gärtner W. Uhl R. Biophys.

The observation that ChRs rapidly depolarize membranes within a few milliseconds in response to brief light flashes motivated neurophysiologists to use ChRs for controlling nerve cell firing. Originally, three groups in parallel expressed ChR in hippocampal neurons and triggered action potentials by short light pulses. The neurons followed the light stimulation protocols with action potential firing up to 30 Hz (10Ishizuka T. Kakuda M. Araki R. Yawo H. Neurosci.

In all cases, action potentials could be evoked by application of blue light to cells that were naturally light insensitive. The unique properties of ChR opened a new field of optogenetic technology for neuroscience and medical applications (17Zhang F. Wang L.P. Boyden E.S. Deisseroth K. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 18Herlitze S. Landmesser L.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Hausser M. Smith S.L. Nature. 2007; 446: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, despite the significant efforts that were made to make ChR available for such goals (20Abbott A. Nature. 2007; 446: 588-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), the structure/function relationships of ChR, including the photoreactions as well as the ion channeling mechanism, remain unknown. Here we describe the cloning and functional characterization of a ChR from the colonial alga Volvox carteri (VChR; see Fig. 1A). First, VChR was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and confirmed as a light-gated cation channel. Subsequently, it was expressed in COS-1 cells and functionally purified in detergent. This allowed us to obtain time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopic data and gain insight into the spectral properties and photocycle of this protein class. We identified two dark states and three photocycle intermediates with pH-dependent variations. Our studies on the transitions between the different states under various pH and light conditions are interpreted in a model that unifies the photocurrent kinetics and spectroscopic data. Isolation and Cloning of the VChop DNA—Nucleotide sequences homologous to channelopsins Chop1 and Chop2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were searched in a preliminary genome data base of V. carteri that is available within the Chlamydomonas genome project (genome.jgi-psf.org). Chop gene products are opsin apoproteins that form ChRs when reconstituted with the chromophore all-trans-retinal. Using the sequence information from the BLAST search, a 1797-bp fragment of the VChop cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA isolated from a young V. carteri culture. See the supplemental data for details of cloning and sequence information on the resulting VChop cDNA fragment (GenBank™ accession number DQ094781). Heterologous Expression in Xenopus Oocyte—A VChop cRNA fragment encoding VChR1-307 (amino acids 1-307) was synthesized in vitro from NheI-linearized pGEMHE-plasmid (5Nagel G. Ollig D. Fuhrmann M.

Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements on Xenopus oocytes were performed 3-7 days after injection at 22 °C under the conditions described before (21Hegemann P. Ehlenbeck S. Gradmann D. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3911-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Tsunoda S.P. Ewers D. Gazzarrini S. Moroni A. Gradmann D. Hegemann P. Biophys.

The data obtained were normally the averages of three measurements. The resistances of microelectrodes were 0.5-1.5 MΩ. For recording of fast kinetics, 10-ns flashes (400-600 nm) from a Rainbow OPO (OPOTEK, Carlsbad, CA) pumped by the third harmonic of a Brilliant b Nd-YAG-Laser (Quantel, Les Ulis Cedex, France) were applied via a 1-mm light guide. The current amplifier Tec-05X was compensated so that the voltage change was kept below 1 mV at a half-saturating laser flash. The data were recorded at high gain with a sampling rate of 250 kHz. The laser intensity varied from flash to flash within a range of 5%. Bath solution was 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2 with 5 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, or 5 mm citrate, pH 4.0. The conditions for light pulse experiments were 500 ± 5 nm, 2 × 1022 photons m-2 s-1. VChR Expression in COS-1 Cells—For expression in COS-1 cells (ATCC, CRL-1650), a human codon-optimized synthetic VChop DNA fragment (corresponding to amino acids 1-307 of the native protein, accession number DQ094781), plus the C-terminal ETSQVAPA sequence (1D4 epitope (23Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar)) was designed and purchased from GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany). The synthetic VChop DNA was inserted between the EcoRI-NotI sites of the expression vector pMT3 (24Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Oprian D.D. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2119-2122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue culture, transient transfection with the resulting VChR-pMT3 vector, reconstitution with chromophore, and subsequent purification of VChR was performed basically as described for bovine rhodopsin (25Meyer C.K.

Three days after transfection, the cells were harvested and reconstituted with all-trans-retinal (final concentration, 1.5 μm). VChR was solubilized with dodecyl maltoside and purified by immunoaffinity adsorption using rho 1D4 antibody coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). VChR was eluted with 100 μm of an 18-mer peptide corresponding to the C-terminal rhodopsin sequence in 0.03% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 10 mm 1,3-bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino] propane, pH 6.0 (25Meyer C.K.

Eluates were dialyzed and/or concentrated using Centricon YM-10 (Millipore) concentrators and stored at 4 °C or -40 °C. The mutant VChR-K252G was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene). The mouse anti-rhodopsin monoclonal antibody rho 1D4 used for purification and Western blotting of VChR was purchased from the University of British Columbia (Dr. R. Molday). Purified VChR was deglycosylated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spectroscopy—For absorption spectroscopy and slow kinetics at 20 °C, a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) with a spectral resolution of 2 nm was used. The samples were illuminated for 10 s with a blue Luxeon LED (Philips Lumileds, San Jose, CA) with a wavelength of 456 nm, 90 milliwatt cm-2, 2 × 1021 photons m-2 s-1. Transient spectroscopy was performed on a LKS.60 flash photolysis system (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) at 22 °C. Excitation pulses (10 ns, 450 nm) were provided by a tunable Rainbow OPO/Nd-YAG-Laser laser system (see above). Laser energy was adjusted to 3.5 ± 0.16 mJ/shot. The instrument used a Xe-Lamp (150 W) as a monitoring light source, which was pulsed during short time experiments. Monochromators before and after the sample were set to spectral resolutions of 18.6 and 9.3 nm, respectively. For detection, a 1P28 photomultipier (Hamamatsu Photonics) was used, and the signal was recorded with an Infinium Oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies). 32,000 data points were recorded in each measurement and compressed by LKS.60 software to files of 500 data points. 50 of these points were recorded before and 450 after laser excitation. To avoid artifacts and scatter, only data points 60-500 were used for analysis. Data analysis was performed with Matlab 7.01 (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Singular value decomposition of representative data sets was performed to identify significant components that were used for reconstruction of the three-dimensional spectra (see supplemental data). For measurements at pH 6, freshly prepared VChop was used. For experiments at pH 7.3 and 4.5, freshly prepared VChop was dialyzed and/or diluted with buffer containing 0.03% dodecyl maltoside, yielding 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2 with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.3, or 10 mm citrate, pH 4.5, and the pH was measured thereafter. pH titration was performed with 20 mm buffer (citrate, pH 4.5-6; MOPS, pH 7; or Tris, pH 8) in 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.03% dodecyl maltoside. Functional Studies on VChR in Xenopus Oocytes—In the past, ChRs from Chlamydomonas were difficult to express in standard expression systems like Escherichia coli, yeast, or COS cells (27Sineshchekov O.A. Spudich J.L. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co., 2006: 25-42Google Scholar). We therefore isolated a ChR-related cDNA from young V. carteri colonies (Fig. 1A). The cDNA encoded a large Volvox-ChR protein, VChR (599 amino acids), with seven transmembrane helices (TM) and a long C-terminal extension. We only studied the 7TM region of VChR (Fig. 1B) corresponding to amino acids 1-307 (see supplemental data) because earlier work on Chlamydomonas ChR1 and ChR2 (5Nagel G. Ollig D. Fuhrmann M. Kateriya S. Musti A.M. Bamberg E. Hegemann P. Science. 2002; 296: 2395-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 6Nagel G. Szellas T. Huhn W. Kateriya S. Adeishvili N. Berthold P. Ollig D. Hegemann P. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13940-13945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar) showed that the long C-terminal extension had little influence on the ion conducting properties. In VChR-expressing Xenopus oocytes, light pulses evoked an initial transient current that relaxed toward a stationary plateau (steady state; τ1 = 40-85 ms depending on the extracellular H+ concentration (pHo) and membrane voltage (Fig. 2A). The current increased with progressing negative voltage and with decreasing pHo (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the transient fraction of the current was particularly dominant at high pHo and low negative or positive voltage values. After the light is off, the current decays biexponentially with τ2 = 15-25 ms and τ3 = 60-140 ms (-100 mV, pHo 4-7.5). The current amplitude certainly also depends on the light intensity, but the stationary current saturates at lower light intensities than the transient component (Fig. 2, C and D). Upon stimulation with two subsequent light pulses, the transient component of the second photocurrent is reduced in size (light adaptation; Fig. 3, A and B), and the recovery of the transient signal (dark adaptation) depends on the delay between the light pulses (Fig. 3C). The time constant (τ4) of the transient recovery time is about 17 s at pHo 7.5. To further investigate the photocurrent kinetics, cells were stimulated with 10-ns laser flashes of 470-nm light (Fig. 3D). The photocurrent rose with a time constant (τ0) in the range of 200 μs, and the current peaked at around 1 ms after the flash and relaxed to zero biexponentially with a dominant time constant τ2*(>90%) of about 16 ms at pHo 7.5 and -100 mV. Repetitive laser flashes did not significantly promote light adaptation, which we considered as ideal for action spectroscopy. The normalized action spectrum recorded at pHo 7.5 is rhodopsin-shaped with a half-bandwidth of 90 nm and a maximum at 470 nm (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, upon lowering the pHo to 4, the action spectrum was shifted to 484 nm, indicating two different dark states. We further determined that VChR is permeable for H+ ≫ Li+ > Na+ > K+ (Fig. 3F) and poorly permeable for Ca2+ (≤10% of the Na+ conductance) and is in this respect similar to its C. reinhardtii relative ChR2. Spectroscopic Characterization of VChR—To get insight into the photocyle and the gating mechanism of VChR, spectroscopic measurements were performed with purified VChR. We used COS-1 cells to express the VChR 7TM region (amino acids 1-307; see supplemental data) plus nine additional amino acids corresponding to the C terminus of bovine rhodopsin (as epitope tag (23Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 28MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) for purification and detection by protein immunoblotting). The expressed VChR was reconstituted with all-trans-retinal and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography in dodecyl maltoside solution. Fig. 4 shows the purified protein as a double band of 31 and 34 kDa on a SDS-PAGE (left panel) and after protein immunoblotting (right panel). The 34-kDa band disappeared after treatment with glucosidase (PNGase F), suggesting that the protein was partially glycosylated. The spectrum of dark-adapted VChR at pH 6 showed an absorption with vibrational fine structure and two maxima at 450 and 470 nm, indicating a rigid chromophore with protonated retinal-protein Schiff base linkage (Fig. 5A). The absorption is sensitive to hydroxylamine, which extracts the retinal by formation of retinaloxime (dotted line) and allows determination of the molar extinction coefficient ϵ470 ≈ 45.500 m·cm-1 (based on ϵ360 ≈ 54.000 m·cm-1 for retinal oxime) (29Groenendijk G.W. de Grip W.J. Daemen F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Lys-252 in TM7 was identified as the site of retinal attachment, because the K252G mutant did not show any absorption beyond 400 nm (data not shown). Acidification of the medium altered the shape of the VChR spectrum asymmetrically in favor of the long wavelength peak (Fig. 5B). The dark form observed at pH 8 was named D470, whereas the acidic form was termed D480. When the sample was illuminated at pH 6 with a blue LED (456 nm) for 10 s, the absorption again shifted slightly to the red (Fig. 5, A, red versus black spectrum, and C) in a similar manner as observed after acidification. Again, the absorption slightly declined, but in this case the shift was transient with τ ≈ 45 s at 20 °C (Fig. 5, C and D). Next, purified VChR was excited with 10-ns laser flashes (450 nm), and absorption changes were recorded from 300 to 600 nm in 10-nm intervals up to 150 ms after the flash. At pH 7.3, the flashes initiated a fast absorption increase between 480 and 580 nm, which reached 90% of its maximal amplitude already at the first recorded time point (50 ns after the flash). Series of absorption difference spectra at pH 7.3 for the time ranges of 0.3-15 μs and 0.033-1.5 ms after the flash are shown in Fig. 6 (A and B, respectively). The three-dimensional spectra were reconstructed using significant components identified by singular value decompositon (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fastest occurring absorption difference maximum was found at 520 nm (Fig. 6C, Early spectrum), corresponding to an absolute maximum of the photoproduct near 500 nm. Accordingly, this early photocycle intermediate was named P500. It converted with τ ≈ 4 μs into a species termed P390 (Fig. 6A) seen as an absorption difference peak between 370 and 380 nm in the transient spectrum (Fig. 6C, Medium spectrum). P390 decayed with τ ≈ 200 μs into a third photoproduct with an absorption difference maximum at 530 nm (Fig. 6, B and D, Late spectrum). This late intermediate was named P510 according to the estimated absolute absorption maximum. At pH 4.5, flashes again initiated immediate absorption differences but with an early positive absorption difference peak at 535 nm (Fig. 6E), which is clearly red-shifted compared with the early photoproduct monitored at pH 7.3. The corresponding absorption maximum of the photoproduct is between 510 and 520 nm, and the species was termed P515 accordingly. The rise time was again below 100 ns. At later times the absorption difference maximum shifted to ≈550 nm. This late species with a corresponding absorption maximum around 530 nm was named P530. (Fig. 6E). Unfortunately, the resolution of our detection system and the smaller absorption changes under acidic conditions did not allow observation of the transition between P515 and P530. Because no photoproduct equivalent to P390 was observed at pH 4.5, we conclude that only neutral conditions allow the formation or transient accumulation of a photoproduct with deprotonated retinal Schiff base during the VChR photocycle. VChR Is Functionally Similar to Known ChRs from Chlamydomonas—We found that VChR from V. carteri is a functional relative of the two ChRs from C. reinhardtii with closer relation to ChR2. VChR shows electrical properties that are not explained by an earlier discussed three-state model with one closed dark state (Dark), one open state (O), one desensitized (closed and inactive) state (Des), and a single photochemical reaction from Dark to O (6Nagel G. Szellas T. Huhn W. Kateriya S. Adeishvili N. Berthold P. Ollig D. Hegemann P. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13940-13945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). If the Des → Dark reaction is slow, at high light intensities most protein would be trapped in Des, and the stationary current would decay to zero. If the Des → Dark reaction is fast, the model fails to explain the slow recovery of the transient current. In contrast, all observed currents are fully consistent with the four-state model of Fig. 7A originally developed for ChR1 from photocurrent kinetics (21Hegemann P. Ehlenbeck S. Gradmann D. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3911-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It comprises two dark states, D1 and D2, and two conducting states, O1 and O2. On the basis of the present study, the model is extended by the pH dependence of the D1 ⇌ D2 equilibrium of dark-adapted VChR seen as a shift of the action spectrum (Fig. 3E). According to the four-state model, both D1 and D2 convert upon light excitation into separate conducting states, O1 and O2, that are also in equilibrium (21Hegemann P. Ehlenbeck S. Gradmann D. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3911-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, the O2/O1 ratio is assumed to be higher than the D2/D1 ratio, resulting in an accumulation of the weakly conducting state O2 in the light and explaining the decay of the transient current to the stationary level. Nikolic et al. (30Nikolic K. Degenaar P. Toumazou C. Proceedings of the 28th IEEE EMBS Annual International Conference. Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, New YorkAug. 30-Sept. 3, 2006: 1626-1629Google Scholar) quantitatively described the channelrhodopsin photocurrents by an extended three-state model (Fig. 7B) that was already considered earlier qualitatively (6Nagel G. Szellas T. Huhn W. Kateriya S. Adeishvili N. Berthold P. Ollig D. Hegemann P. Bamberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13940-13945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The “Nikolic model” assumes that the recovery of the Dark state from the (closed and desensitized) Des state is accelerated by light. The model is attractive because it describes the photocurrents adequately and involves less rate constants compared with the four-state model. The Nikolic model, however, does not explain the pH-induced shift of the action spectrum. Based on the electrical measurements and spectroscopic data generated for VChR, we are proposing here a photocycle (Fig. 7C) that is a hybrid of the four-state model (Fig. 7A) and the three-state Nikolic model (Fig. 7B). Because the acidic form and the preilluminated species (light-adapted VChR) are virtually identical, although there might be slight differences that are still unknown, we assume that D480 (D2) is an intermediate of the photocycle starting from D470 (D1). D1 and D2 are in a pH-dependent equilibrium, and both states are photoconverted into a conducting state O. The model converges with the fourstate model by assuming a fast equilibrium between O1 and O2 (representing O) and a preferential thermal reaction from O to D2 (D480). A back reaction from O to D1 (D470) is not necessarily excluded but not explicitly needed for explaining the photocurrents. The transient nature of the current is explained in the model shown in Fig. 7C by a low quantum efficiency for the D2 (D480) to O transition rather than by a second conducting state. The three perspectives (Fig. 7, A-C) are kinetically quite equivalent and describe the photocurrents equally well (results of the calculations are available on demand). The assumption of a less efficient photoconversion of D2 (D480) is supported by the small light-induced absorbance changes observed at pH 4.5. Moreover, proteorhodopsin, a microbial rhodopsin from the noncultivated marine γ-protobacterium, shows a red-shifted absorption under moderately acidic conditions, and the photoisomerization is less efficient compared with that of the alkaline form (31Huber R. Kohler T. Lenz M.O. Bamberg E. Kalmbach R. Engelhard M. Wachtveitl J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is known that protonation of the retinal Schiff base counterion in microbial rhodopsins (Glu-118 in VChR) lowers the quantum efficiency of photochemical 13-trans- to cis-isomerization because of a rise of the C13-C14 rotation barrier in the excited state (32Song L. El-Sayed M.A. Lanyi J.K. Science. 1993; 261: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For VChR this results in a reduced stationary photocurrent as soon as the D2/D1 equilibrium increases during illumination. The different amplitudes of the transient and stationary current even at saturating light are alternatively explained by a late photocycle intermediate because it occurs in all other microbial rhodopsins. Formation and decay of a corresponding state N would be adjusted in such a way that under all conditions, less than 60% of VChR is trapped in N. Photocycle of VChR—The UV-visible absorption spectra presented above give a first insight into the absorption properties of the dark states and photointermediates of channelrhodopsin. The pH-dependent spectral equilibrium between D470 and D480 suggests protonation of an amino acid residue in the retinal-binding pocket. This residue is accessible from the extracellular bulk phase because the shift can be induced by extracellular acidification in oocyte experiments. At pH 7.3 the dominant photoproduct P510 is assigned as the conducting state that is relevant under most physiological conditions. The equivalent under acidic conditions is P530. The spectroscopic observations on VChR and most electrophysiological data are summarized by an extended model as shown in Fig. 7D that is compatible with that of Fig. 7C. It comprises two dark states in equilibrium (D470 ⇌ D480) and corresponding photoproducts. Starting from D470, the photoproduct P510 (considered as the dominant conducting state) is populated sequentially via P500 and P390. Because of the strongly blue-shifted absorption, P390 is assumed to be the only photoproduct with deprotonated retinal Schiff base. Based on the assumption that P510 is the conducting state at neutral pH, we conclude that the dark-adapted channel converts from the closed to the open state with τ ≈ 200 μs after light absorption (light gating). This value is compatible with the photocurrent rise, τ0, of the VChR currents in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 3D) and in the living alga (2Holland E.M. Braun F.J. Nonnengasser C. Harz H. Hegemann P. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 924-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Braun F.J. Hegemann P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1668-1678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At acidic pH, a species with deprotonated retinal Schiff base (P390) is not observed, and light gating might be faster compared with alkaline pH conditions. The main intermediates P510 and P530 decay biphasically (τ2 ≈ 20 ms and τ3 ≈ 100 ms), indicating that there is a spectrally similar intermediate N. The D480 → D470 transition functionally reflects the light-dark adaptation process D2 → D1 as recorded by photocurrent measurements, even if the transient photocurrent recovers three times as fast as the slow recovery of D470 after illumination with a light pulse (Fig. 5, C and D). The difference could derive from experimental conditions. The spectral data were obtained with VChR in solution, whereas photocurrents were recorded from VChR in oocyte membranes at different internal and external pH. The transition from D2 → D1 (and thus D480 → D470) is expected to be a two-step process as already proposed before (21Hegemann P. Ehlenbeck S. Gradmann D. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3911-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and possibly comprising an isomerization and deprotonation reaction. The kinetic model presented in this study unifies electrophysiological data with spectral information and should help to interpret photocurrents recorded from intact algae under various physiological conditions. We expect that in algae a shift from D1 to D2 at low pHo and/or high light intensities reduces the H+ and cation influx and prevents major depolarization (3Ehlenbeck S. Gradmann D. Braun F.J. Hegemann P. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 740-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Braun F.J. Hegemann P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1668-1678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Conclusion—The functional purification and spectroscopic characterization of VChR we report here represents a major step toward a detailed structure/function analysis of ChR. It opens the possibility of tailoring ChRs for neuroscience and medical applications. In analogy to the development of green fluorescent proteins with specific absorption/fluorescence properties, desired spectral and kinetic properties of ChR will be obtained by protein engineering and subsequent spectroscopic analysis. This will enable the application of new ChRs with distinct electrical and spectral properties to selected cell types in tissues or living animals to remotely stimulate nerves and to potentially restore color vision in mouse or even human retina (16Bi A.

These proteins also co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with Aβ in this model (Fonte, V., Kapulkin, V., Taft, A., Fluet, A., Friedman, D., and Link, C. D. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 9439–9444). To investigate the molecular basis and biological function of this interaction between HSP-16 and Aβ, we generated transgenic C. elegans animals with high level, constitutive expression of HSP-16.2. We find that constitutive expression of wild type, but not mutant, HSP-16.2 partially suppresses Aβ toxicity. Wild type Aβ-(1–42), but not Aβ single chain dimer, was observed to become sequestered in HSP-16.2-containing inclusions, indicating a conformation-dependent interaction between HSP-16.2 and Aβ in vivo. Constitutive expression of HSP-16.2 could reduce amyloid fibril formation, but it did not reduce the overall accumulation of Aβ peptide or alter the pattern of the predominant oligomeric species. Studies with recombinant HSP-16.2 demonstrated that HSP-16.2 can bind directly to Aβ in vitro, with a preferential affinity for oligomeric Aβ species. This interaction between Aβ and HSP-16.2 also influences the formation of Aβ oligomers in in vitro assays. These studies are consistent with a model in which small chaperone proteins reduce Aβ toxicity by interacting directly with the Aβ peptide and altering its oligomerization pathways, thereby reducing the formation of a minor toxic species.

Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11121) Google Scholar)), even though the specific mechanisms by which the Aβ peptide induces AD pathology have not been resolved. Intracellular Aβ accumulation has also been proposed to underlie the muscle pathology observed in inclusion body myositis (2Askanas V. Engel W.K. Alvarez R.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 31-36PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate Aβ toxicity in a genetically tractable model, we have engineered Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes to express the human Aβ-(1–42) peptide in either body wall muscle (3Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9368-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) or neurons (4Link C.D. Exp.

In C. elegans transgenic models with muscle expression of Aβ, the peptide accumulates in intracellular cytoplasmic deposits (5Link C.D. Johnson C.J. Fonte V. Paupard M. Hall D.H. Styren S. Mathis C.A. Klunk W.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) despite the inclusion of a signal peptide in the transgene construct. The appropriate removal of the signal peptide and the association of Abeta with hsp-3, an ER chaperone homologous to mammalian GRP78/BiP (6Fonte V. Kapulkin V. Taft A. Fluet A. Friedman D. Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9439-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), have led us to propose that Abeta is routed to the secretory pathway in this model but is retrotranslocated out of the ER because it is recognized as an abnormal protein (4Link C.D. Exp. Gerontol. 2006; 41: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated a role for autophagosomes and lysosomes in the clearance of Abeta in this model, suggesting that Abeta may also exist in these subcellular compartments (8Florez-McClure M.L. Hohsfield L.A. Fonte G. Bealor M.T. Link C.D. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Intracellular Abeta is observed in the muscles of IBM patients or in transgenic mouse models of IBM (9Kitazawa M. Green K.N. Caccamo A. LaFerla F.M. Am. J.

Aprahamian T. Walsh K. Rosen K.M. Querfurth H.W. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2165-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although the subcellular distribution of Abeta has not been determined. Intracellular Aβ has also been observed in human brain neurons (11Gouras G.K. Tsai J. Naslund J. Vincent B. Edgar M. Checler F. Greenfield J.P. Haroutunian V. Buxbaum J.D. Xu H. Greengard P. Relkin N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), and the relevance of intracellular Aβ in Alzheimer disease has been supported by studies with the LaFerla 3× transgenic AD mouse model, where accumulation of intracellular Aβ precedes neurofibrillary tangle formation (12Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2003; 39: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). A number of neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson, Huntington, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.) are characterized by intracellular cytoplasmic accumulation of proteins causally associated with theses diseases, and thus the C. elegans transgenic model described in this study may be generally relevant to the proteotoxicity underlying neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, a transgenic C. elegans strain expressing human Aβ has been used recently to investigate the roles of insulin-like signaling and heat shock factor in proteotoxicity (13Cohen E. Bieschke J. Perciavalle R.M. Kelly J.W. Dillin A. Science. 2006; 313: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). A robust finding in these transgenic C. elegans models is the induction of the HSP-16 family of small chaperone proteins by Aβ expression (14Link C.D. Cypser J.R. Johnson C.J. Johnson T.E. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 15Link C.D. Taft A. Kapulkin V. Duke K. Kim S. Fei Q. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). HSP-16 proteins readily co-immunoprecipitate with Aβ in transgenic C. elegans worms and closely associate with intracellular Aβ deposits as observed by immunohistochemistry (16Fonte V. Kapulkin V. Taft A. Fluet A. Friedman D. Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9439-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The HSP-16 family proteins are homologous to αB crystallin and have been shown to have ATP-independent chaperone activity in vitro (17Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that induction of HSP-16 expression by Aβ represents a protective response to the accumulation of an abnormal protein. This protective response could presumably alter Aβ toxicity by promoting Aβ sequestration, degradation, or refolding. Alternatively, the Aβ/HSP-16 interaction might alter Aβ multimerization, leading to a reduction in specific oligomeric or amyloidic toxic species. Here we investigate the putative protective role of HSP-16 by examining the effect of constitutive overexpression of HSP-16 on Aβ toxicity and metabolism in vivo. Our observations of the HSP-16 response to and interaction with Aβ in transgenic C. elegans models parallel observations made for the αB crystallin family proteins in Alzheimer brain. Ten genes have been identified in the human genome that encode small, αB crystallin-homologous proteins (18Taylor R.P. Benjamin I.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), five of which have been reported to have altered expression in AD brains. (To avoid nomenclature confusion, we will refer to these proteins using their unique HUGO identification.) Initial studies demonstrated increased immunoreactivity for CRYAB (αB crystallin) and HSPB1 (Hsp27/28) (19Shinohara H. Inaguma Y. Goto S. Inagaki T. Kato K. J. Neurol. Sci. 1993; 119: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Renkawek K. Voorter C.E. Bosman G.J. van Workum F.P. de Jong W.W. Acta Neuropathol. 1994; 87: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) in AD brains. CRYAB has also been demonstrated to be increased in the temporal cortex of AD brain by mass spectrometry (21Yoo B.C. Kim S.H. Cairns N. Fountoulakis M. Lubec G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and has been observed by immunoelectron microscopy to co-localize with Aβ in lens tissue from AD patients (22Goldstein L.E. Muffat J.A. Cherny R.A. Moir R.D. Ericsson M.H. Huang X. Mavros C. Coccia J.A. Faget K.Y. Fitch K.A. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Chylack Jr., L.T. Bush A.I. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1258-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR has also been used to demonstrate increased accumulation of CRYAB mRNA in select regions of postmortem AD brains (15Link C.D. Taft A. Kapulkin V. Duke K. Kim S. Fei Q. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). CRYAB immunoreactivity is also significantly increased in pathological muscle tissue from patients with IBM, which is characterized by intracellular Aβ deposition (23Banwell B.L. Engel A.G. Neurology. 2000; 54: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) More recent immunohistochemical studies have found HSPB1, HSPB6 (Hsp20), HSPB2, and HSPB8 (Hsp22) associated with senile plaques (24Wilhelmus M.M. Boelens W.C. Otte-Holler I. Kamps B. de Waal R.M. Verbeek M.M. Brain Res. 2006; 1089: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25Wilhelmus M.M. Boelens W.C. Otte-Holler I. Kamps B. Kusters B. Maat-Schieman M.L. de Waal R.M. Verbeek M.M. Acta Neuropathol. 2006; 111: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although αB crystallin-homologous small heat shock proteins (sHSP) have been found reproducibly associated with deposits of Aβ (and other abnormal proteins), the biological relevance of this association is unclear. Studies examining the interaction of sHSPs with Aβ in vitro have produced inconsistent, and sometimes contradictory, results. Stege et al. (26Stege G.J. Renkawek K. Overkamp P.S. Verschuure P. van Rijk A.F. Reijnen-Aalbers A. Boelens W.C. Bosman G.J. de Jong W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) reported that co-incubation of Aβ-(1–40) with CRYAB resulted in a decrease in fibril formation and an increase in toxicity to hippocampal neurons. Liang (27Liang J.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), however, observed a dose-dependent increase in thioflavin T fluorescence (typically associated with increased amyloid fibril formation) when CRYAB was incubated with Aβ-(1–40). A more recent study found incubation of CRYAB with either Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–42) reduced fibril formation (28Raman B. Ban T. Sakai M. Pasta S.Y. Ramakrishna T. Naiki H. Goto Y. Rao ChM. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Incubation of Aβ-(1–40) with either CRYAA (αA-crystallin) or a functional peptide derived from αA-crystallin (mini-αA-crystallin) inhibited both fibril formation and Aβ toxicity to PC12 cells (29Santhoshkumar P. Sharma K.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 267: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, co-incubation of an αB-crystallin-homologous protein from the protozoan parasite Babesia bovis with Aβ-(1–40) inhibited both fibril formation and toxicity to PC12 and SY5Y cells (30Lee S. Carson K. Rice-Ficht A. Good T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HSPB1 was reported to inhibit in vitro amyloidogenesis of Aβ-(1–42) (31Kudva Y.C. Hiddinga H.J. Butler P.C. Mueske C.S. Eberhardt N.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas a more recent study (25Wilhelmus M.M. Boelens W.C. Otte-Holler I. Kamps B. Kusters B. Maat-Schieman M.L. de Waal R.M. Verbeek M.M. Acta Neuropathol. 2006; 111: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) failed to find an effect of HSPB8 on Aβ-(1–42) β-sheet formation or toxicity to human brain pericytes (although HSPB8 did inhibit β-sheet formation and toxicity of an Aβ-(1–40) peptide containing the Q22E substitution associated with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type). The variance in the results described above may stem from the different sHSPs, Aβ peptides, and assays employed. However, none of these studies examined the effects of sHSP/Aβ interactions in vivo, which would address the biological relevance of this interaction more directly. We have therefore used transgenic co-expression of Aβ-(1–42) and HSP-16 in a well studied C. elegans model to investigate the biological effects of the interaction of these proteins in a living animal. We show for the first time that a small heat shock protein can suppress Aβ toxicity in vivo. Transgenic Constructions—The HSP-16.2 coding region was recovered from genomic C. elegans DNA by PCR, using a forward primer tagged with a 5′ KpnI site, and a reverse primer tagged with a 5′ EcoRI site. The PCR fragment was cleaved with KpnI and EcoRI and then inserted between the KpnI and EcoRI sites of myo-3/GFP expression vector pPD118.20, replacing the GFP coding sequence with HSP-16.2. The resulting plasmid, pCL137, was subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (Stratagene QuickChange kit) to generate a myo-3/HSP-16.2 R94G plasmid (pCL187). A parallel in vitro mutagenesis was also performed to introduce the R94G mutation into the HSP-16.2 Escherichia coli expression construct described previously by Leroux et al. (17Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The pCL137 and pCL187 plasmids were independently co-injected along with marker plasmid pCL26 (mtl-2/GFP), which produces strong intestinal GFP expression. Heritable extrachromosomal lines were obtained by screening for GFP fluorescence. A completely stable chromosomally integrated strain, CL2392, was derived from extrachromosomal myo-3/HSP-16.2 strain CL1392 by γ-irradiation as described previously (3Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9368-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Paralysis Scoring—Synchronous populations of transgenic animals were generated by limited egg lay at 16 °C, and worms were allowed to develop for 48 h, thus reaching the third larval stage (L3). The worms were then upshifted to 25 °C and then scored for paralysis, typically starting 24 h after upshift. Animals were scored as paralyzed if they failed to propagate a full sinusoidal contraction after prodding, or if they were associated with a “halo” of ingested bacterial lawn, indicative of an inability to move to access food. In experiments measuring paralysis in extrachromosomal transgenic strains, sibling worms containing the transgene were identified by GFP fluorescence of the marker transgene included in the transgenic array. Identification of transgenic and nontransgenic worms was performed after paralysis scoring to prevent observer bias. Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry—For immunoblot analysis, fourth larval stage nematode populations were harvested, washed free of E. coli by low speed centrifugation, and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of protease inhibitors (Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, P2714). Frozen samples were solubilized by boiling 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer, and protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford assay using Coomassie Plus-200 reagent (Pierce) per the manufacturer's description. Protein samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% acrylamide NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Nybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with anti-HSP-16.2 antisera (gift of Peter Candido) at 1:10,000 dilution, anti-Aβ monoclonal 6E10 (Abcam, ab10146) at 0.7 μg/ml, or anti-actin monoclonal JLA20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) at 1:100 dilution, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for signal detection. For immunofluorescence, nematode populations were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using collagenase/β-mercaptoethanol treatment as described previously (3Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9368-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Anti-HSP-16.2 antisera was used at 1:1000 dilution, and 6E10 was used at 10 μg/ml. Secondary antibodies fluorescently labeled with Alexa dyes (Molecular Probes) were used at 20 μg/ml. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with a digital deconvolution retrofit and Slidebook analysis software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). For quantification of β-amyloid, live adult transgenic worms were stained with the fluorescent amyloid dye X-34 as described previously (5Link C.D. Johnson C.J. Fonte V. Paupard M. Hall D.H. Styren S. Mathis C.A. Klunk W.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and amyloid deposits were imaged under shortwave illumination after destaining. Projection images of optical sections of each stained worm were generated to capture whole body amyloid signal. To exclude the effects of background staining (see Fig. 5B), deposits were first identified by inspection, and then the masking and measurement functions of Slidebook were used to generate measurements of total amyloid signal per anterior region of each worm. Electron Microscopy—Nematodes were prepared for observation in the electron microscope as published previously (32Link C.D. Fonte V. Hiester B. Yerg J. Ferguson J. Csontos S. Silverman M.A. Stein G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1808-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, fourth larval stage animals were flash-frozen in a high pressure freezer (Balzers HPM 010) according to the technique of Dahl and Staehelin (33Dahl R. Staehelin L.A. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1989; 13: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), in which the samples are freeze-substituted with 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.05% uranyl acetate in acetone at –80 °C for 5 days, gradually warmed to room temperature, infiltrated with Araldite/Embed-812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and polymerized. Thin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. The body wall muscles of at least eight animals in each category were imaged at 80 kV on a Phillips CM10 electron microscope. Biochemical Procedures—Recombinant His6-HSP-16.2 fusion protein was purified from a previously described BL21(DE3) E. coli strain containing a pRSET A expression vector in which the hsp-16.2 coding sequence was cloned downstream of a 4-kDa polyhistidine tag, resulting in an easily purified protein active in in vitro chaperone assays (17Leroux M.R. Melki R. Gordon B. Batelier G. Candido E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Induced cell lysates were run through Polyprep columns (Bio-Rad) packed with nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences), and captured His6-HSP-16.2 was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 500 mm imidazole and 0.05% Triton X-100. Appropriate fractions were dialyzed against PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 20% glycerol. His6-HSP-16.2 protein preparations were subsequently biotinylated using an EZ Link Sulfo-NHS-biotinylation kit (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instruction. Oligomerized Aβ-(1–42) was prepared as described by Barghorn et al. (34Barghorn S. Nimmrich V. Striebinger A. Krantz C. Keller P. Janson B. Bahr M. Schmidt M. Bitner R.S. Harlan J. Barlow E. Ebert U. Hillen H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 834-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Lyophilized 50-μg aliquots of Aβ-(1–42) (Sigma) were solubilized in 10 μl of hexafluro-2-propanol and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min to remove secondary structure. After removal of hexafluro-2-propanol by evaporation, Aβ precipitates were first resuspended in 2.2 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) leading to an initial concentration of 5 mm peptide and then diluted to 400 μm peptide with PBS containing 0.2% SDS. The resuspended peptide was incubated for 6 h at 37°C, diluted 3-fold with distilled water, then incubated an additional 18 h at 37 °C. This incubation resulted in the formation of soluble Aβ oligomers in the 38–48-kDa range. For HSP-16.2 pulldown reactions, 5 μg of biotinylated HSP-16.2 was rocked with Aβ oligomer preparations in 1 ml of PBS + 0.02% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min. To capture HSP-16.2-Aβ complexes, 10 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (prewashed in PBS/Triton X-100 buffer) were added to the binding reaction, and the reaction was rocked for another 30 min at 4 °C. The streptavidin-agarose beads were subsequently recovered by low speed centrifugation and washed extensively with cold PBS containing 0.02% Triton X-100. For immunoblot analysis, bead pellets were solubilized in sample buffer, and bound proteins were fractionated as described above. The HSP-16 family in C. elegans consists of four closely related proteins (HSP-16.1, 16.2, 16.41, and 16.48) encoded by six genes. (There are 14 other more divergent αB-crystallin homologs in the C. elegans genome.) As it is not known if any of the HSP-16 proteins have specialized functions, we chose to engineer overexpression of HSP-16.2, which has been the most-studied member of the HSP-16 family. To engineer high level, constitutive HSP-16.2 expression, a genomic fragment containing the hsp-16.2 coding region (including its single intron) was fused to the promoter of the myo-3 gene, which encodes a myosin protein expressed specifically in body wall muscle cells. The chimeric myo-3/HSP-16.2 construct, along with a marker transgene, was introduced into wild type C. elegans strains by microinjection. To control for nonspecific transgene effects, we sought to generate a control transgene in parallel containing a single missense mutation predicted to interfere with HSP-16.2 chaperone function. Given that there are no known natural mutations in HSP-16.2, we engineered an R94G substitution, which is equivalent to the R120G mutation in αB crystallin that is associated with desmin myopathy (see Fig. 1A). The R120G mutation has been shown to reduce in vitro αB-crystallin chaperone activity (35Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 36Chavez Zobel A.T. Loranger A. Marceau N. Theriault J.R. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgenes were introduced by genetic mating into strain CL4176, which has been engineered to have temperature-inducible expression of myo-3-driven human Aβ-(1–42) (15Link C.D. Taft A. Kapulkin V. Duke K. Kim S. Fei Q. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Temperature upshift of CL4176 third larval stage animals results in induction of Aβ expression and an irreversible paralysis that begins ∼24 h after upshift. As shown in Fig. 1B, CL4176 worms containing the myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgene show significantly delayed paralysis, whereas the myo-3/HSP-16.2 R94G transgene has minimal effects on the time of paralysis (Fig. 1C). This experiment takes advantage of the meiotic instability of the extrachromosomal myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgenes, which results in populations of sibling transgenic and nontransgenic animals, allowing phenotypic comparisons of these genotypes under identical conditions. These results demonstrate that HSP-16.2 can partially counter Aβ toxicity and that this effect requires the wild type chaperone activity of HSP-16.2. To investigate the biochemical effects of HSP-16.2 overexpression, the myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgene was chromosomally integrated by γ-irradiation, yielding a completely stable transgenic strain, CL2392. Immunoblots confirmed that this strain overexpressed HSP-16.2 in comparison with the maximal level of HSP-16.2 induced by Aβ expression alone in strain CL4176 (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, overexpressed HSP-16.2 was observed to form inclusions in body wall muscle. These were visible by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2B) and differential interference contrast light microscopy of living animals (Fig. 2C). High pressure freeze electron microscopy demonstrated that the electron-dense HSP-16.2 inclusions were not membrane-bound (Fig. 2D). Although the HSP-16.2 inclusions were commonly found in CL2392 muscle cells, no obvious effect was observed on the motility of these worms. Inclusions were also readily observable by differential interference contrast microscopy in multiple extrachromosomal myo-3/HSP-16.2 lines, thereby ruling out transgene insertion into the chromosome as the cause of inclusion formation. CL2392 (integrated myo-3/HSP-16.2) was crossed to three independent inducible myo-3/Aβ-(1–42) lines, and the resulting dual transgenic lines were assayed for paralysis. For all dual transgenic lines, the presence of the myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgenes significantly reduced paralysis onset, producing a stronger effect than that observed for the extrachromosomal myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgene (likely because of nonmosaic expression of the integrated transgene; see representative plot in Fig. 3A). To determine whether this suppression of paralysis rates was associated with a decrease in accumulation of Aβ in the dual transgenic strains, Aβ levels in the single and dual transgenic lines were assayed by immunoblot (Fig. 3B). Worms were harvested at 24 h after Aβ transgene induction, a time point when there was significantly less paralysis in the dual transgenic strains. Nevertheless, no differences were observed in either monomeric or oligomeric species detected with the anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10 on immunoblots. This result indicates that HSP-16.2 does not promote degradation of Aβ and rules out nonspecific effects on transcription of the Aβ transgenes by the myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgene (e.g. because of competition for myo-3 transcription factors). If HSP-16.2 does not affect Aβ levels, might it alter the cellular distribution of Aβ? To investigate this possibility, dual transgenic lines were examined by immunohistochemistry, probing fixed worms with primary antibodies specific for Aβ and HSP-16. Intramuscular Aβ deposits were dramatically redistributed into the HSP-16.2 inclusions (Fig. 4A). To examine the specificity of this apparent sequestration of Aβ into the HSP-16.2 inclusions, we generated another dual transgenic strain, which contained the myo-3/HSP-16.2 transgene and an inducible myo-3/Aβ single chain dimer construct. Unlike Aβ-(1–42), the Aβ single chain dimer does not form amyloid fibrils when constitutively expressed (37Fay D.S. Fluet A. Johnson C.J. Link C.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1616-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and does not strongly associate with endogenous HSP-16 (16Fonte V. Kapulkin V. Taft A. Fluet A. Friedman D. Link C.D. Proc.

https://openalex.org/W2067083295,"The Yellowstone caldera began a rapid episode of ground uplift in mid-2004, revealed by Global Positioning System and interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements, at rates up to 7 centimeters per year, which is over three times faster than previously observed inflation rates. Source modeling of the deformation data suggests an expanding volcanic sill of approximately 1200 square kilometers at a 10-kilometer depth beneath the caldera, coincident with the top of a seismically imaged crustal magma chamber. The modeled rate of source volume increase is 0.1 cubic kilometer per year, similar to the amount of magma intrusion required to supply the observed high heat flow of the caldera. This evidence suggests magma recharge as the main mechanism for the accelerated uplift, although pressurization of magmatic fluids cannot be ruled out."

https://openalex.org/W1989472173,"The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 has been proposed to be one of the mediators that link obesity-derived chronic inflammation with insulin resistance. Signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been found to impact insulin sensitivity under various pathological conditions, through serine phosphorylation and inhibition of insulin receptor substrate by the downstream effector of mTOR, ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). However, an involvement of mTOR in IL-6-induced insulin resistance has not yet been reported. Here we show that rapamycin, the inhibitor of mTOR signaling, rescues insulin signaling and glycogen synthesis from IL-6 inhibition in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells as well as in mouse primary hepatocytes. IL-6 activates S6K1 in these cells, but unexpectedly, S6K1 is not involved in IL-6 inhibition of insulin signaling, since the effect of IL-6 persists in cells with drastically reduced S6K1 levels induced by RNA interference, suggesting that the function of mTOR signaling is through a mechanism different from the prevailing model of S6K1 phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1. Interestingly, we find that the phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 and STAT3 transcriptional activity are regulated by mTOR upon IL-6 stimulation and that STAT3 is required for IL-6 inhibition of insulin signaling. Furthermore, IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression is inhibited by rapamycin, and ectopic expression of SOCS3 blocks the ability of rapamycin to enhance insulin sensitivity in the presence of IL-6. Taken together, we propose that mTOR plays a key role in IL-6-induced hepatic insulin resistance by regulating STAT3 activation and subsequent SOCS3 expression."

A central GCN5-related N -acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain bears bifunctional decarboxylase/ S -acetyltransferase activity, both unprecedented for the GNAT superfamily. A CurA loading tridomain, consisting of an adaptor domain, the GNAT domain, and an acyl carrier protein, was assessed biochemically, revealing that a domain showing homology to GNAT (GNAT L ) catalyzes (i) decarboxylation of malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) to acetyl-CoA and (ii) direct S -acetyl transfer from acetyl-CoA to load an adjacent acyl carrier protein domain (ACP L ). Moreover, the N-terminal adapter domain was shown to facilitate acetyl-group transfer. Crystal structures of GNAT L were solved at 1.95 angstroms (ligand-free form) and 2.75 angstroms (acyl-CoA complex), showing distinct substrate tunnels for acyl-CoA and holo-ACP L binding. Modeling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that histidine-389 and threonine-355, at the convergence of the CoA and ACP tunnels, participate in malonyl-CoA decarboxylation but not in acetyl-group transfer. Decarboxylation precedes acetyl-group transfer, leading to acetyl-ACP L as the key curacin A starter unit."
https://openalex.org/W2125155254,"Voltage-dependent potassium KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) channels play a prominent role in the control of neuronal excitability. These channels must associate with calmodulin to function correctly and, indeed, a mutation (R353G) that impairs this association provokes the onset of a form of human neonatal epilepsy known as benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC). We show here that perturbation of calmodulin binding leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of KCNQ2, reducing the number of channels that reach the plasma membrane. Interestingly, elevating the expression of calmodulin in the BFNC mutant partially restores the intracellular distribution of the KCNQ channel. In contrast, overexpression of a Ca(2+)-binding incompetent calmodulin or sequestering of calmodulin promotes the retention of wild-type channels in the ER. Thus, a direct interaction with Ca(2+)-calmodulin appears to be critical for the correct activity of KCNQ2 potassium channels as it controls the channels' exit from the ER."

The early developmental bifurcation separating these castes is widely accepted to be strictly environmentally determined. We present evidence that genotype also influences this process. Offspring from four different crosses of nymph- and worker-derived secondary reproductive individuals had strongly differentiated caste and sex ratios, despite uniform rearing conditions. These data fit an X-linked, one-locus-two-allele model. Of five possible genotypes, one was lethal, two resulted in workers, and two resulted in either nymphs or environmentally determined workers.

However, despite deletion of both DPs and PGDS enzymes, no metabolites of PGD2 have been reported in mouse, preventing assessment of biosynthetic response to experimental manipulation in that species. Initial attempts at commercial assay development in humans have focused on 11β-PGF2α (18Watanabe K. Iguchi Y. Iguchi S. Arai Y. Hayaishi O. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α. Both are formed as minor urinary metabolites in monkeys and in a human volunteer following infusion of radiolabeled PGD2 (19Liston T.E. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13172-13180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, paired analysis of 11β-PGF2α by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and the commercially available immunoassay revealed poor concordance in the urine of patients with asthma (20Misso N.L. Aggarwal S. Phelps S. Beard R. Thompson P.J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2004; 34: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Bochenek G. Nizankowska E. Gielicz A. Swierczynska M. Szczeklik A.

Quantitative analysis of the major F-ring metabolite identified in urine after PGD2 infusion in a volunteer, 9α, 11β-dihydroxy-15-oxo-2,3,18,19-tetranorprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid (19Liston T.E. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13172-13180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been reported in human plasma and urine (22Morrow J.D. Guzzo C. Lazarus G. Oates J.A. Roberts 2nd, L.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 937-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and reflects nicely the marked augmentation of PGD2 biosynthesis in systemic mastocytosis (4Roberts L.J. Sweetman 2nd, B.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. Oates J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 1400-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification of a novel D-ring metabolite formed from infused PGD2, 11,15-dioxo-9α-hydroxy-, 2,3,4,5-tetranorprostan-1,20-dioic acid (tetranor PGDM) as an abundant endogenous metabolite of PGD2 in both human and mouse urine. The formation from PGD2 of its F-, J-, and D-ring products is depicted in Fig. 1. Gene manipulations in mice and pharmacological studies in humans implicate COX-1 as the major source of PGD2 as reflected by this metabolite in urine. Authentic [2H6]tetranor PGDM was kindly synthesized on request by Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Authentic 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α,[2H4]11β-PGF2α, and PGD2 were purchased from the same source for use as standards. H218O was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). All mobile phases incorporated HPLC-grade solvents from Honeywell Burdick and Jackson. Reagent-grade acetic acid was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. HPLC-grade ammonium hydroxide was purchased from Mallinckrodt Baker Chemicals. [18O2]2,3-Dinor-11β-PGF2α was prepared as previously described (23Pickett W.C. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Methoxyamine HCl was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. [2H6]Tetranor PGDM, [18O2]2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α, and [2H4]11β-PGF2α were added to 1 ml of human urine or 100 μl of mouse urine and were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min. One half of the urine volume of an aqueous solution of methoxyamine HCl (1 g/ml) was added and allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were purified by solid phase extraction using StrataX C18 cartridges (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The solid phase extraction cartridge was conditioned with 1 ml of acetonitrile and equilibrated with 1 ml of water. The sample was applied to the cartridge, which was then washed with 1 ml of 5% acetonitrile in water and dried with vacuum for 15 min. The analyte and internal standards were eluted from the cartridge using 1 ml of 5% acetonitrile in ethyl acetate. The eluate was collected and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The resulting residue was then reconstituted in 200 μl of 5% acetonitrile in water and filtered by centrifugation using 0.2-μm Nylon Microspin filters purchased from Alltech Associates (Deerfield, IL). A Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) consisting of two LC-20AD-vp pumps, a CBM-20A system controller, and an SIL-5000 autosampler was used for all chromatography. The HPLC column used was a 150 × 2mm Luna C18(2) with 3-μm particles (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phase was generated from water (solvent A) and acetonitrile:methanol, 95:5 (solvent B), both containing 0.005% acetic acid adjusted to pH 5.7 with ammonium hydroxide. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. Separations were carried out with various linear solvent gradients. A Thermo Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra tandem instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated coaxial electrospray source and triple quadrupole analyzer was used in these studies. The electrospray ionization source was maintained at 240 °C and used nitrogen for both sheath and auxiliary gas at 70 and 5 arbitrary units, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion mode with a capillary temperature of 350 °C and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. The source collision-induced dissociation was maintained at 10 eV. The collision gas was argon at 1.5 mTorr. The analyzer was operated in the selected reaction monitoring mode for the analysis of urinary PGD2 metabolites. For analysis of tetranor PGDM, the transitions monitored were m/z 385→336 for the endogenous material and m/z 391→342 for the deuterated internal standard. The collision energy was 15 eV. The transitions for [2H4]11β-PGF2α and endogenous 11β-PGF2α were 357→197 and 353→193, respectively, with collision energy 24 eV. The transition for [18O2]2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α was m/z 329→145 and m/z 325→145 for the endogenous material, collision energy 13 eV. The product ion scan mode was used for spectral analysis of tetranor PGDM. Precursor ions (m/z 385 and 391 for endogenous tetranor PGDM and the [2H6]tetranor PGDM internal standard, respectively) were collisionally activated at 15 eV under 1.5-mTorr argon gas producing the collision-induced dissociation spectra. All studies were performed following protocol review and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Infusion Studies—Vehicle or PGD2 (20, 150, and 500 μg) was infused intraperitoneal into 12-week-old male C57/BL6 mice (n = 5 per group). Urine was collected for 24 h in metabolic cages for analysis of PGD2 metabolites. PGDS Knock-outs—Urine was collected for 24 h from 3- to 4-month-old male wild-type (WT) mice, L-PGDS knock-out mice (kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Urade, Osaka, Japan), and H-PGDS knock-out mice (kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihide Kanaoka, Boston, MA), all on a C57/BL6 background (n = 15 for WT and LPGDS knock-outs and n = 16 for H-PGDS knock-outs). COX Knockdown (KD) and Knock-out (KO) Mice—Urine was collected for 24 h from 2- to 3-month-old COX-1 KD mice (24Yu Y. Cheng Y. Fan J. Chen X.S. Klein-Szanto A. Fitzgerald G.A. Funk C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), COX-1 KOs and their WT controls (n = 7-9 each), and COX-2 KOs (n = 15) and their WT controls (n = 7). Five clinical studies were performed. The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania and by the Advisory Council of the Clinical and Translational Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania. All volunteers were apparently healthy on physical examination, were non-smokers, and refrained from all medications for 2 weeks before and then during the course of the studies. Volunteers with a history of coagulation disorders, a bleeding tendency, drug allergy, or gastrointestinal disorders were excluded from participation in the studies. In the first study, 12 volunteers (6 male and 6 female) received a bolus injection of single dose 3 ng/kg bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) under controlled conditions as we have previously described (25McAdam B.F. Mardini I.A. Habib A. Burke A. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Subjects were admitted to the Clinical and Translational Research Center the evening before the study, and an intravenous infusion of saline was commenced. The study involved a 60-h inpatient stay in the Clinical and Translational Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania comprising an overnight acclimatization phase, a 24-h saline administration control phase, and a 24-h post-LPS study phase. Urinary PGD2 metabolites were assessed in urines collected at the following time intervals before (-24 to -18, -18 to -12, -12 to -6, and -6 to 0 h) and after (0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 12, 12 to 18, and 18 to 24 h) LPS administration. Data were plotted at the midpoint of each corresponding urine collection. Body temperature was recorded at the following time points before (-4 and -2 h) and after (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 h) LPS administration. In the second study, Niacin (600 mg) was administered to two healthy male volunteers. Urinary PGD2 metabolites were assessed in spot urines collected at the following time points before (time 0) and after (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h) niacin administration. In a third study, 18 healthy volunteers (9 male and 9 female) received, in random order, a single dose of placebo or rofecoxib (25 mg) under double-blind conditions, separated by washout periods of at least 2 weeks. Urinary PGD2 metabolites were assessed at 0 and 4 h in spot urine samples that were collected 30 min after voiding. In a fourth study, 8 healthy volunteers were orally administered 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for 9 days. Measurements of urinary PGD2 metabolites were performed predose and 4 h after drug administration on days 1 and 8. In a fifth study, a single dose of aspirin (325 mg) was administered to 18 healthy volunteers (9 males and 9 females). Urinary PGD2 metabolites were assessed in spot urine at time 0 and 4 h after dosing. Data are expressed after correction for urinary creatinine (Cre) concentrations and are reported as nanograms per milligram of Cre. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed initially using a two-way analysis of variance, with subsequent two-tailed comparisons as appropriate. Discovery of Tetranor PGDM—While measuring tetranor PGEM, the major urinary PGE metabolite in mouse urine (26Cheng Y. Wang M. Yu Y. Lawson J. Funk C.D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), four other major peaks, apparently tetranor PGEM isomers, were observed in the mass chromatogram (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Because PGD2 and PGE2 are themselves structural isomers (27Hamberg M. Fredholm B.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 431: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it was surmised that some of these peaks might originate from PGD2. When PGD2 was infused into mice, two of these four peaks were increased dramatically (Fig. 2B, lower panel), consistent with the hypothesis that they corresponded to the analogous D-ring tetranor metabolites. Following addition of authentic [2H6]tetranor PGDM to mouse urine, the deuterated compound coeluted with the endogenous material (Fig. 2, A and B). There are four chromatographic peaks for tetranor PGDM methoxyamine derivatives. However, the two smaller peaks were variably detectable. Mass spectral analysis of human urine also revealed the existence of tetranor PGDM, which differed from mouse only in its abundance relative to tetranor PGEM (Fig. 2C). Co-injection of extracts of urine from mice infused with PGD2 with extracts of human urine indicated that the endogenous peaks corresponding to tetranor PGDM in human urine corresponded to the peaks increased dose dependently by PGD2 infusion in mice (supplemental Fig. S1). Product ion analysis of the [2H6]tetranor PGDM at m/z 391 gave rise to a series of major fragment ions with m/z values of 373, 342, 313, 267, 182, 164, and 142 (Fig. 3A), virtually identical to the product ion spectrum obtained from endogenous tetranor PGDM (m/z 385); m/z 367, 336, 307, 261, 182, 164, and 142 (Fig. 3B). The differences in m/z values between these two groups were either 0 or 6 mass units reflecting fragments with or without deuterium, again consistent with the original hypothesis. The transitions m/z 391 > 336 and m/z 385 > 336 are the same as those for tetranor PGEM, facilitating an integrated approach to lipidomic analysis (28Song W.L. Lawson J.A. Wang M. Zou H. FitzGerald G.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 433: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The assay was highly reproducible, and the D-ring metabolite was chemically stable at -20 °C and -80 °C (supplemental Fig. S2). A study was performed to determine whether tetranor PGDM might activate the DP1 receptor on human platelets (12Oelz O. Oelz R. Knapp H.R. Sweetman B.J. Oates J.A. Prostaglandins. 1977; 13: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Bushfield M. McNicol A. MacIntyre D.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, unlike PGD2 itself, tetranor PGDM did not inhibit platelet aggregation (supplemental Fig. S3). HPLC-MS/MS Analysis of Urinary 2,3-Dinor-11β-PGF2αand 11β-PGF2α—A representative selected reaction monitoring chromatogram of 11β-PGF2α in human urine is shown in Fig. 4A. Transitions characteristic of [2H4]11β-PGF2α (m/z 357→197) and 11β-PGF2α (m/z 353→193) are shown in the upper and lower panel, respectively. A detectable endogenous chromatographic peak that co-eluted with spike was absent from most human urine samples. Some peaks eluted close to, but not coincident with the internal standard, as in Fig. 4A. These peaks were further confirmed to be distinct from endogenous 11β-PGF2α by addition of synthetic exogenous standards at the time of analysis. We surmise that these peaks represent F2-isoprostanes that would have the potential to compete with 11β-PGF2α in an immunoassay and also may not have separated from endogenous 11β-PGF2α under the elution conditions utilized in a GC/MS assay (29O'Sullivan S. Mueller M.J. Dahlén S. Kumlin M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediators. 1999; 57: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α was readily detectable in human urine, it required a long LC program (28Song W.L. Lawson J.A. Wang M. Zou H. FitzGerald G.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 433: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to achieve separation from interfering compounds. A representative selected reaction monitoring chromatogram of 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α in human urine is shown in Fig. 4B. Urinary 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α and 11β-PGF2α were both below the limits of detection (∼1 ng/mg Cre) in mouse urine (data not shown). Comparative Levels of Endogenous Metabolites of PGD2 Metabolites—In human urine, the comparative levels of tetranor PGDM and 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α were 1.5 ± 0.3 ng/mg Cre and 0.6 ± 0.1 ng/mg Cre (p < 0.01), respectively, whereas 11β-PGF2α was usually below the limits of detection (Fig. 5A). Tetranor PGDM was the only metabolite detectable in mouse urine at 8.1 ± 1.3 ng/mg Cre (Fig. 5B). Enzymatic Contributions to the Biosynthesis of PGD2—Both lipocalin (L)-like or hemopoietic (H) PGD synthase may form PGD2in vitro, but it is unclear which PGDS enzyme predominates under varied conditions in vivo. The enzymatic contributions to the biosynthesis of PGD2 were examined by L-PGDS and H-PGDS mutant mouse models. Deletion of either PGDS significantly reduced biosynthesis of PGD2. Tetranor PGDM was suppressed ∼30% on average by deletion of L-PGDS (p < 0.05) and 80% on average by deletion of H-PGDS (p < 0.0001, Fig. 5C). Deletion of H-PGDS had a significantly greater (p < 0.001) impact on urinary tetranor PGDM than did deletion of L-PGDS in mice. Cross-regulation of PGDS enzymes differed in response to gene deletion. Expression of H-PGDS was up-regulated in the aorta of L-PGDS KOs. By contrast, compensatory up-regulation of L-PGDS was not observed in H-PGDS KOs (supplemental Fig. S4). The comparative contribution to metabolite excretion of the COX enzymes in mice was addressed by comparing the impact of genetic manipulation of COX-1 and COX-2. Both KO and KD of COX-1 suppressed urinary tetranor PGDM by ∼90%, whereas deletion of COX-2 failed to alter significantly metabolite excretion (Fig. 5D). In humans, aspirin at a dose of 325 mg inhibits both COXs (30FitzGerald G.A. Oates J.A. Hawiger J. Maas R.L. Roberts L.J. Lawson 2nd, J.A. Brash A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 676-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), whereas rofecoxib (25 mg) and celecoxib (200 mg) inhibit COX-2 selectively (31Fries S. Grosser T. Price T.S. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. DeMarco S. Pletcher M.T. Wiltshire T. FitzGerald G.A. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Corresponding to the results in mice, inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 by aspirin, but not COX-2 alone by rofecoxib, depressed tetranor PGDM (Fig. 6A). Similar results were obtained with urinary 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α (Fig. 6B). Both acute and chronic dosing with a second COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, also failed to depress tetranor PGDM (Fig. 6C). Aspirin decreased urinary tetranor PGDM from 1.71 ± 0.21 ng/mg Cre to 0.86 ± 0.07 ng/mg Cre (p < 0.001, Fig. 7A) and 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α decreased from 0.63 ± 0.11 ng/mg Cre to 0.32 ± 0.04 ng/mg Cre (p < 0.01, Fig. 7B). This dose of aspirin inhibits COX enzymes incompletely, as reflected by comparable suppression of prostaglandin E2 metabolite (tetranor PGEM) and prostacyclin metabolite (PGIM). By contrast, urinary isoprostanes, as reflected by the major F2 isoprostane in urine, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI is unaltered by this regimen (supplemental Fig. S5). Excretion of PGD2 Metabolites in PGD2-infused Mice—The comparative disposition of PGD2 was examined by infusion of exogenous PGD2. Urinary metabolites of PGD2 increased dose dependently in response to the infusion (Fig. 8A). The levels of tetranor PGDM, 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α and 11β-PGF2α attained after the maximal dose (500 μg) of PGD2 were 2498 ± 792 ng/mg Cre, 809 ± 346 ng/mg Cre, and 207 ± 67 ng/mg Cre, respectively (Fig. 8B). Roughly 3-10% of infused PGD2 was excreted as the tetranor PGDM metabolite in mouse urine. The fractional conversion to each metabolite appeared to be uninfluenced by dose. Evoked Biosynthesis of PGD2—LPS evokes a systemic inflammatory response in humans that is accompanied by regulated expression of both COX isozymes ex vivo and augmented biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin (25McAdam B.F. Mardini I.A. Habib A. Burke A. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). LPS induced a mean increase in both tetranor PGDM (1.49 ng/mg Cre at baseline to 2.15 ng/mg Cre at 2 h and 4.36 ng/mg Cre at 4 h after administration, Fig. 9A) and correspondingly in 2,3-dinor-11β-PGF2α from 0.6 ng/mg Cre to 1.2 ng/mg Cre and 2.1 ng/mg Cre, respectively (Fig. 9B). The peak pyrexial response to LPS (from an average 36.6 to 37.8 °C) occurred ∼4 h after administrat"
https://openalex.org/W2146827844,"δ-Catenin was first identified through its interaction with Presenilin-1 and has been implicated in the regulation of dendrogenesis and cognitive function. However, the molecular mechanisms by which δ-catenin promotes dendritic morphogenesis were unclear. In this study, we demonstrated δ-catenin interaction with p190RhoGEF, and the importance of Akt1-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-454 residue of δ-catenin in this interaction. We have also found that δ-catenin overexpression decreased the binding between p190RhoGEF and RhoA, and significantly lowered the levels of GTP-RhoA but not those of GTP-Rac1 and -Cdc42. δ-Catenin T454A, a defective form in p190RhoGEF binding, did not decrease the binding between p190RhoGEF and RhoA. δ-Catenin T454A also did not lower GTP-RhoA levels and failed to induce dendrite-like process formation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Furthermore, δ-catenin T454A significantly reduced the length and number of mature mushroom shaped spines in primary hippocampal neurons. These results highlight signaling events in the regulation of δ-catenin-induced dendrogenesis and spine morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1989829410,"Exposure to inflammatory agents or cytokines causes the suppression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities and expression in liver and primary hepatocyte cultures. We showed previously that phenobarbital-induced CYP2B protein is down-regulated in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes after exposure to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) in a nitric oxide (NO) -dependent manner. In this study, we found that CYP2B proteins in primary rat hepatocyte cultures were suppressed >60% after 6 h of treatment with interleukin-1β (IL-1). This effect was NO-dependent, and treatment of cells with the NO donors (Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl) aminodiazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (NOC-18), S-nitrosoglutathione, and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine also suppressed CYP2B proteins. However, the down-regulation by IL-1 was insensitive to inhibition of cGMP-dependent protein kinases. The down-regulation by IL-1 or NO donors was abolished by treatments with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin that did not affect NO production. The calpain inhibitor E64-d or the lysosomal protease inhibitors NH4Cl and chloroquine did not attenuate the down-regulation of CYP2B by IL-1. Treatment of HeLa cells expressing c-Myc-tagged CYP2B1 with NOC-18 down-regulated its expression and enhanced its ubiquitination. Treatment of rat liver microsomes with S-nitrosoglutathione caused S-nitrosylation of CYP2B protein and enhanced the ubiquitination pattern of CYP2B compared with unmodified CYP2B in an in vitro ubiquitination assay. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that NO-dependent CYP2B ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are dependent on protein modification by reactive nitrogen species.

NO is a free radical molecule with important regulatory roles in vasodilation, neurotransmission, inflammation, and cell signaling (4Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C.M. Free Radic.

Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which was blocked by NOS inhibitors. Three mechanisms are suggested for inhibition of activity; 1) reversible ligation of NO to (primarily ferrous) P450 heme (8Wink D.A. Osawa Y. Darbyshire J.F. Jones C.R. Eshenaur S.C. Nims R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar); 2) oxidation of P450 protein thiols (16Takemura S. Minamiyama Y. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Hirohashi K. Inoue M.

CYP8A1 (prostacyclin synthase) and CYP2B1 have been shown to undergo tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite in cell culture and in vitro, respectively (13Zou M.H. Daiber A. Peterson J.A. Shoun H.

Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that NO production is not globally responsible for the down-regulation of CYP gene expression that occurs in inflammation and infection (18Sewer M.B. Barclay T.B. Morgan E.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Sewer M.B. Morgan E.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Sewer M.B. Morgan E.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 352-358PubMed Google Scholar), several reports suggested that inhibition of NOS can attenuate the down-regulation of some hepatic CYP mRNAs or proteins (21Stadler J. Trockfeld J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 796-801PubMed Google Scholar) or that NO donors can down-regulate some CYP mRNAs (24Hara H. Mitani N. Adachi T. Free Radic.

This evidence is particularly strong for CYP2B proteins (22Khatsenko O.G. Boobis A.R. Gross S.S. Toxicol. Lett. 1997; 90: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Carlson T.J.

CYP2B6 plays a significant role in human drug metabolism and is involved in the detoxification and/or activation of many toxins and carcinogens (27Ingelman-Sundberg M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). CYP2B1 and 2B2, which differ by only three amino acids, are the analogous isoforms in rat and are induced by phenobarbital (28Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). CYP2B1 mRNA expression predominates over CYP2B2 by factors of about 5- and 150-fold in the livers of untreated and PB-treated rat livers, respectively (29Baldwin S.J. Bramhall J.L. Ashby C.A. Yue L. Murdock P.R. Hood S.R. Ayrton A.D. Clarke S.E. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that CYP2B proteins are down-regulated in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes by two independent mechanisms in response to LPS: NO-independent mRNA suppression at lower concentrations and NO-dependent protein suppression at higher concentrations (26Ferrari L. Peng N. Halpert J.R. Morgan E.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this regulation of CYP2B protein by NO derived from NOS enzymes is poorly understood. It has been suggested that the modification of tyrosine and/or cysteine residues by reactive nitrogen species may affect protein stability, enzyme activity, or cell signaling (4Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C.M. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation of iron regulatory protein 2 resulted in ubiquitination of the protein followed by its proteasomal degradation (30Kim S. Wing S.S. Ponka P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For these reasons we hypothesized that modification of amino acid residues of the CYP2B1/2 enzymes by reactive nitrogen species is a signal for their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this idea, we show here that post-transcriptional down-regulation of native CYP2B1/2 in hepatocytes and of Myc-tagged CYP2B1 in HeLa cells are proteasome-dependent and that CYP2B1 undergoes NO-stimulated ubiquitination in HeLa cells and in an in vitro ubiquitination system. Materials and Reagents—Interleukin (IL)-1β and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were purchased from Sigma, and GSNO, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, and NOC-18, acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal, and E64-d were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). NMA, AG, gliotoxin, chloroquine, Williams media, Krebs-Ringer buffer, collagenase, and other general chemicals were acquired from Sigma. Peroxynitrite was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Hemagglutinin-ubiquitin (HA-Ub), Ub-aldehyde (Ub-CHO), ATP-regenerating system, and proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin were purchased from Boston Biochemicals (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies to CYP2B1 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase were kindly provided by Drs. James Halpert (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) and Bettie Sue Masters (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX), respectively. Anti-CYP2C11 was generated in our laboratory as described previously (31Morgan E.T. MacGeoch C. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 471-479PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The KXUal-eGFP vector was provided by Dr. T. J. Murphy (Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). Rat Hepatocyte Isolation and Treatment—Rat hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step in situ collagenase perfusion procedure (19Sewer M.B. Morgan E.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (230–280 g) were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine solution, and then the liver was perfused with 400–500 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 8–10 min. This was followed by perfusion with 0.3 mg/ml collagenase type IV for 10 min. The liver was harvested and gently chopped to release cells, which were filtered through 90-μm mesh. Cells were plated on collagen plates with plating medium containing 5% Nu-Serum (Sigma), and then 3 h later cells were overlaid with new media containing Matrigel (0.234 mg/ml, BD Biosciences). After 24 h the medium was changed to CYP2B medium (Williams E containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 nm insulin, 25 nm dexamethasone, and 10 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin). Cultures were maintained for 6–7 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with regular media changes. Beginning on day 4, cells were treated with 1 mm PB to induce CYP2B expression, and the inducer was present for the rest of the experiment. Other treatments were begun 48 h after initiation of PB induction, as indicated under “Results.” At the conclusion of the experiment, media were removed and reserved for NO assay using the Griess reaction (32Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10839) Google Scholar). Microsome Preparation, Immunoblotting, and Measurement of Microsomal Activities—Livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (230–280 g) or hepatocytes were homogenized or sonicated, respectively, in homogenization buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.125 m potassium chloride, 1.0 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the post-mitochondrial fraction. This fraction was used for all immunoblot assays unless otherwise noted. For preparation of microsomes, the post-mitochondrial fraction was centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant from ultracentrifugation was considered the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet was washed with microsome storage buffer (0.25 m sucrose containing protease inhibitor mixture) and homogenized in the same buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described by Ferrari et al. (26Ferrari L. Peng N. Halpert J.R. Morgan E.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Primary antibody (rat CYP2B1 antibody, diluted 1:20,000) was incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was detected with ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences) on x-ray film. All assays were performed within a linear range, and the intensity of stained bands was measured by Kodak imaging software. Pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity of hepatic microsomes from PB-treated rats was measured from the rate of appearance of the fluorescent product resorufin as described previously (33Li-Masters T. Morgan E.T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 252-257PubMed Google Scholar). Biotin-switch Detection of Nitrosylated Proteins—S-Nitrosocysteine-containing proteins were specifically detected by the biotin-switch method with minor modifications (34Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE 2001,. 2001; : PL1Google Scholar, 35Zhang Y.H. Keszler A. Broniowska K.A. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocyte microsomes were incubated with HEPES-EDTA buffer containing 0.1 mm neocuproine, 0.4% CHAPS, and 20 mm methyl methanethiosulfonate at 50 °C in the dark for 20 min to block free unmodified thiols. After removing salts from the reaction, the S-nitrosothiols were biotinylated by reaction with 12.5 mmN-[6-(biotinamido) hexyl]-3-(2 pyridyldithio) propionamide and 0.75 mm ascorbate for 1 h at room temperature. The biotinylated protein was pulled down with immobilized Neutravidin (Pierce) and separated on SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—The in vitro ubiquitination assay was carried out by the method of Song and DeBose-Boyd (36Song B.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28798-28806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with modifications. For preparation of the cytosolic fraction, livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (230–250 g) were excised, cut into small pieces, and homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.2, containing 250 mm sorbitol, 70 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm potassium EGTA, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, then the supernatants were subjected to centrifugation at 186,000 × g for 45 min. This was repeated, and the final cytosolic supernatant (80 mg/ml protein) was separated into aliquots and stored at –80 °C. For experiments, tubes were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and placed on ice until use. For preparation of microsomes, male Sprague-Dawley rats (230–250 g) were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg PB daily for 3 days, and microsomes were prepared 24 h after the last injection from the livers as described above. Microsomes (20 μg) were treated with the indicated chemicals and then incubated with 10 μl of cytosolic fraction, 6 μl of Ub stock (containing 1 mg/ml HA-Ub and 0.01 mg/ml Ub-CHO, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 100 μm MG132) and 2 μl of ATP regenerating system at 37 °C for 20 to 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 300 μl of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1.8% NaCl, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, and 0.02% NaN2). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were carried out in 1× immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture and polyclonal CYP2B antibody at 4 °C overnight with continuous mixing. After incubation, 30 μl of ImmunoPure® Immobilized Protein A Plus (Pierce) was added to the incubation mixture and then incubated an additional 2 h at room temperature. The incubation mixtures were washed 4 times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer by centrifugation, and precipitates were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min with SDS-loading buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Regulation and Ubiquitination of CYP2B1 in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 incubator. Fulllength rat CYP2B1 and CYP2C11 cDNAs were subcloned into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using the EcoRI and SalI sites and named pCMV-2B1 and pCMV-2C11, respectively. The clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pCMV-2B1 or pCMV2C11 were transfected or cotransfected with pCDMA3.1-HA-Ub wild type (37Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) by the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 μg of pCMV2B1 and 1 μg of pCDMA3.1-HA-Ub were mixed with 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) and dropwise applied onto HeLa cell cultures on 60-mm plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with NOC-18 and/or proteasome inhibitors for the indicated times. Cells were harvested and sonicated for 10 s in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA). The cell sonicates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were discarded. CYP2B1 protein in total cell lysates was measured using either an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz) or anti-CYP2B antibody. To immunoprecipitate CYP2B protein, 3 μl of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Thirty microliters of ImmunoPure® Immobilized Protein A Plus (Pierce) was added followed by immunoprecipitation as described above. After SDS-PAGE and blotting, the membrane was incubated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight, and goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase was incubated as a secondary antibody. The ubiquitination signal was detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips with 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected with pCMV-2B1 using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. The fixed coverslips were incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and rabbit anti-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase antibodies (1:500 dilution) in PBS containing 0.1% saponin (Sigma) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with PBS, the slides were incubated with Texas Red- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. After a final wash coverslips were mounted using Flouromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, AL). Fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal fluorescence microscope. RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis with the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and realtime PCR was carried out with SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using ABI 7300 reverse transcription-PCR equipment. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as the normalization control. The primers for CYP 2B1 were antisense (TCACACCGGCTACCAACCCT) and sense (CTGTGGGTCATGGAGAGCTG) primers (38Li H.C. Kupfer D. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1998; 12: 315-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were TGCCAAGTATGATGACATCAAGAAG and AGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGT. Analysis of real-time PCR was carried out by the ΔΔCt method as described by Livak and Schmittgen (39Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (125166) Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional CYP2B Suppression by IL-1 Stimulation—We previously observed that LPS treatment of rat hepatocytes resulted in a rapid NO-dependent down-regulation of CYP2B proteins (26Ferrari L. Peng N. Halpert J.R. Morgan E.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One experiment with IL-1 as the inflammatory stimulus in that study suggested a similar phenomenon (26Ferrari L. Peng N. Halpert J.R. Morgan E.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To further probe the mechanism of this regulation, we decided to use IL-1 because in preliminary experiments the magnitude of the response to LPS proved more variable than that of IL-1. First, we analyzed the time course of CYP2B protein and mRNA regulation by IL-1 in primary rat hepatocytes. Unlike their human homologue CYP2B6, rat CYPs 2B1 and 2B2 have very low basal expression. Therefore, all our experiments were performed in hepatocytes that had been induced with phenobarbital for 48 h before treatment, and the inducer was present throughout the experiments. The primary hepatocytes responded to IL-1 with a robust production of NO, as detected by NO2 + NO3 (NOx) in the culture medium (Fig. 1). NOx production was detected within 6 h and achieved near-maximal levels by 12 h of treatment (Fig. 1B). CYP2B protein was significantly down-regulated by 40% at 6 h and reached 10% of control within 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, CYP2B1 mRNA down-regulation was not significantly affected after 6 or 12 h of treatment and was maximally suppressed to about 41% of control cultures at 24 h (Fig. 1B). Thus, the down-regulation of CYP2B protein was observed before CYP2B1 mRNA down-regulation, demonstrating that the rapid IL-1-stimulated CYP2B down-regulation is post-transcriptional. NO Dependence of IL-1-stimulated Down-regulation of CYP2B Proteins—We next analyzed whether CYP2B protein down-regulation by IL-1 is NO-dependent. As a control, we also measured CYP2C11, a protein that we have previously shown is down-regulated by a slower, pretranslational and NO-independent process (19Sewer M.B. Morgan E.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6. In our experimental system IL-1 stimulated NO production (see Fig. 1B), whereas IL-6 did not cause NO production within 24 h in primary hepatocyte culture (not shown). The CYP2B protein was down-regulated only in IL-1-treated samples but not by IL-6 treatment (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with the NOS inhibitors NMA and AG resulted in complete blockade of NO production in IL-1-stimulated samples (Fig. 2B). These treatments also resulted in complete inhibition of IL-1-stimulated CYP2B protein down-regulation, suggesting that IL-1-stimulated CYP2B down-regulation is NO-dependent. In contrast, none of the treatments affected CYP2C11 protein (Fig. 2B). Because some CYP enzymes can be stabilized by ligand binding, we tested the abilities of AG and NMA to inhibit the pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity (a selective CYP2B substrate (40Honkakoski P. Kojo A. Lang M.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) of microsomes from PB-treated rat liver. Neither NMA nor AG inhibited this activity at concentrations up to 2.5 mm (Fig. 2C). Thus, NMA and AG did not inhibit CYP2B1 degradation by binding to and stabilizing the protein. We also determined the effect of NO donors on CYP2B expression. The NO donors GSNO, NOC-18, and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine each caused CYP2B down-regulation within 24 h of treatment, with NOC-18 being the most efficacious compound and GSNO the least effective (Fig. 2D). Thus, NO donors mimic the effects of IL-1, and taken together, our data show that IL-1-stimulated down-regulation of CYP2Bs is NO-dependent. Elucidation of the Proteases Involved in CYP2B Down-regulation—Modifications of proteins by reactive nitrogen species can alter protein functions in various ways by changing their enzymatic activities, stabilities, or conformations (4Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C.M. Free Radic. Res. 2004; 38: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that high cellular NO levels stimulate the degradation of CYP2B proteins. Therefore, we analyzed the degradation fate of CYP2B by co-treating cells with IL-1 and various protease inhibitors. Induction of inducible NOS by IL-1 via NFκB is dependent on IκB degradation by the proteasome (41Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Therefore, treatment with MG132 at the same time as IL-1 blocked IL-1-stimulated NO production and CYP2B down-regulation (Fig. 3A). To analyze the direct role of the proteasome in NO-dependent CYP2B degradation evoked by IL-1, some cells were treated with MG132 beginning 3 h after IL-1 treatment to allow initiation of inducible NOS transcription (and, thus, NO production). Delayed MG132 treatment resulted in levels of IL-1-stimulated NO production over a 24-h period that were not different from those in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 3A). However, the same treatment blocked the"
https://openalex.org/W1983028318,"Digestion with proteinase K or trypsin yields complementary information on conformational transitions of the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) in the native membrane environment. Distinct digestion patterns are obtained with proteinase K, revealing interconversion of E1 and E2 or E1∼P and E2-P states. The pH dependence of digestion patterns shows that, in the presence of Mg2+, conversion of E2 to E1 pattern occurs (even when Ca2+ is absent) as H+ dissociates from acidic residues. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the Glu309 and Glu771 acidic residues (empty Ca2+-binding sites I and II) are required for stabilization of E2. Glu309 ionization is most important to yield E1. However, a further transition produced by Ca2+ binding to E1 (i.e. E1·2Ca2+) is still needed for catalytic activation. Following ATP utilization, H+/Ca2+ exchange is involved in the transition from the E1∼P·2Ca2+ to the E2-P pattern, whereby alkaline pH will limit this conformational transition. Complementary experiments on digestion with trypsin exhibit high temperature dependence, indicating that, in the E1 and E2 ground states, the ATPase conformation undergoes strong fluctuations related to internal protein dynamics. The fluctuations are tightly constrained by ATP binding and phosphoenzyme formation, and this constraint must be overcome by thermal activation and substrate-free energy to allow enzyme turnover. In fact, a substantial portion of ATP free energy is utilized for conformational work related to the E1∼P·2Ca2+ to E2-P transition, thereby disrupting high affinity binding and allowing luminal diffusion of Ca2+. The E2 state and luminal path closure follow removal of conformational constraint by phosphate. Digestion with proteinase K or trypsin yields complementary information on conformational transitions of the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) in the native membrane environment. Distinct digestion patterns are obtained with proteinase K, revealing interconversion of E1 and E2 or E1∼P and E2-P states. The pH dependence of digestion patterns shows that, in the presence of Mg2+, conversion of E2 to E1 pattern occurs (even when Ca2+ is absent) as H+ dissociates from acidic residues. Mutational analysis demonstrates that the Glu309 and Glu771 acidic residues (empty Ca2+-binding sites I and II) are required for stabilization of E2. Glu309 ionization is most important to yield E1. However, a further transition produced by Ca2+ binding to E1 (i.e. E1·2Ca2+) is still needed for catalytic activation. Following ATP utilization, H+/Ca2+ exchange is involved in the transition from the E1∼P·2Ca2+ to the E2-P pattern, whereby alkaline pH will limit this conformational transition. Complementary experiments on digestion with trypsin exhibit high temperature dependence, indicating that, in the E1 and E2 ground states, the ATPase conformation undergoes strong fluctuations related to internal protein dynamics. The fluctuations are tightly constrained by ATP binding and phosphoenzyme formation, and this constraint must be overcome by thermal activation and substrate-free energy to allow enzyme turnover.

In this study, we used the SERCA1a isoform of skeletal muscle, a well characterized enzyme (1de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 2Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) that utilizes the free energy of ATP for Ca2+ transport against a concentration gradient. The functional unit is a protein monomer consisting of 994 amino acid residues. The sequence is folded into a cluster of 10 segments forming a transmembrane region, and three relatively large domains (“N”, “P,” and “A”) protruding from the cytosolic surface of the membrane (3MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 4Toyoshima C. Sasabe H. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 469-471Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The ATPase cycle begins with high affinity binding of two Ca2+ derived from the cytosolic medium (“outside”), followed by ATP utilization to form a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. Isomerization of the phosphoenzyme intermediate is then coupled to active transport of the bound Ca2+ across the membrane (“inside”). Hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoenzyme is the final step that allows enzyme turnover.The cooperative character of Ca2+ binding as well as the relatively large distance between the catalytic site in the headpiece and the Ca2+-binding sites of the ATPase within the transmembrane region imply that conformational rearrangements of the ATPase protein are involved in the mechanism of catalytic activation and energy transduction. Within the general context of cation transport, these rearrangements were envisioned as interconversions of the E1 and E2 conformations in the ground state of the enzyme and the E1-P to E2-P conformations of the phosphorylated intermediate. In fact, conformational changes were initially detected by spectroscopic experimentation (5Bigelow D. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1113: 323-338Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). High resolution structures were then obtained by crystallographic studies and attributed to different catalytic intermediates (6Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the occurrence of conformational transitions in the native membrane environment is revealed by changes in the patterns of proteolysis (7Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We report here a series of experiments on limited proteolysis with proteinase K or trypsin, yielding complementary information on the conformational effects of pH, temperature, catalytic ligands, and the specific inhibitor thapsigargin (TG). The experimentation was extended to measurements of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport, thereby providing an understanding of how functional events and conformational transitions are related in the native membrane environment, and how free energy is utilized for conformational work linked to active transport.MATERIALS AND METHODSSR vesicles were obtained from rabbit skeletal muscle (8Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Recombinant Ca2+-ATPase was obtained from COS-1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors carrying rabbit WT (3MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ca2+ uptake by SR vesicles was measured at 25 or 35 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 μg of microsomal protein/ml, and 50 μm CaCl2, including 45Ca-labeled isotopic tracer. ATP (3 mm) was added to start the reaction, and at various times, the protein contained in the 1-ml reaction mixture was loaded onto a 0.45-μm Millipore filter by vacuum suction and washed with 15 ml of 2 mm LaCl3 and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The filter was then processed for determination of radioactivity by scintillation counting. A zero time sample was taken before addition of ATP.ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C, in a reaction mixture containing 30 μg of SR protein/ml, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7 (or 50 mm HEPES, pH 8), 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of A23187 ionophore, and 2 mm EGTA, in the presence or in the absence of 2 mm CaCl2. The reaction was started by addition of 2 mm ATP, and samples were taken at serial times for Pi determination by colorimetry (10Lanzetta, P. A., Alvarez, L. J., Reinach, P. S., and Candia, O. A. (19979 Anal. Biochem. 100, 95-97Google Scholar).Enzyme phosphorylation with Pi was estimated following equilibration (5 min at 25 °C) of SR vesicles (0.12 mg/0.2 ml) with 2.0 mm32Pi, in a medium containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.0 (or 100 mm HEPES, pH 8), and 3 mm EGTA, in the presence or the absence of 10 mm MgCl2 and/or 0.1 mm free Ca2+. The reaction was quenched with 0.2 ml of 2.0 m perchloric acid. The quenched reaction mixture (0.3 ml) was filtered through 0.45-μm Millipore filters, and the protein collected on the filters was washed three times with 5 ml of cold 0.125 m perchloric acid, once with 5 ml of cold water, and finally dissolved with dimethylformamide and processed for scintillation counting. Control experiments were performed by quenching samples with perchloric acid before addition of radioactive substrate.Limited proteolytic digestion was performed in reaction mixtures containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 (or MES, pH 6.0, or HEPES, pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05 mg of SR microsomal protein/ml (or 0.4 mg of COS-1 cell microsomes containing recombinant SERCA/ml) and 0.05 mg of proteinase K or trypsin. CaCl2, MgCl2, EGTA, and AMPPCP were added as indicated in the figures. In some experiments, 2 mm KF and 0.1 mm AlCl3 were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min to obtain the fluoroaluminate complex, in the absence or in the presence of nucleotide. Following incubation at 25 °C for various time intervals, the reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid (2.5%), and the protein was solubilized with a medium containing lithium dodecyl sulfate (1%), MOPS (0.312 m), pH 6.8, sucrose (3.75%), β-mercaptoethanol (1.25 mm), and bromphenol blue (0.025%). The samples were then subjected to electrophoretic analysis on 12% gels, and the protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Alternatively, Western blots were obtained using the monoclonal antibody MA3911 or MA3912 (Affinity Bioreagents), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualization with an enhanced chemiluminescence-linked detection system (Pierce). The MA3911 antibody reacts preferentially with the amino-terminal region of the ATPase, whereas the MA3912 reacts preferentially with the carboxyl-terminal region.RESULTSElectrophoresis of ATPase protein subjected to limited digestion with proteinase K (11Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Moller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in the presence of Ca2+ shows an 83-kDa band corresponding to the proteolytic fragment intervening between Glu243 and the carboxyl terminus, and a 28-kDa band corresponding to the complementary fragment between Thr242 and the amino terminus (Fig. 1). Mapping of the fragments with respect to their proximity to the amino or carboxyl termini was confirmed by use of complementary monoclonal antibodies. A 29-30-kDa band, due to cleavage at Ser350-Thr357 and Ile611, is observed as well (12Champeil P. Menguy T. Soulie S. Juul B. de Gracia A.G. Rusconi F. Falson P. Denoroy L. Henao F. le Maire M. Moller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6619-6631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A faint 54-kDa band corresponding to the segment between Glu243 and Val734/Val747 is also visible. The pattern of digestion appears to be the same at pH 6-8, although proteolysis occurs more rapidly at alkaline pH. This pattern, obtained in the presence of Ca2+, is attributed to the E1 state (including various sequential conformations yielding high Ca2+ affinity, cooperative binding of 2 Ca2+, and catalytic activation; see “Discussion”).If the digestion is performed at pH 6 in the absence of Ca2+, additional 95 and 14 kDa bands are noted (Fig. 1), corresponding to complementary fragments between Lys120 and the carboxyl terminus and Leu119 and the amino terminus, respectively. This pattern, obtained in the absence of Ca2+, is attributed to the E2 state (i.e. the ground state of enzyme in the absence of Ca2+, but it is also observed with the phosphorylated intermediate formed by reaction with Pi and the dead end complex of E2 with TG (see below)).We find that when the pH is raised (in the absence of Ca2+) the E2 digestion pattern changes to that observed in the presence of Ca2+ (i.e. E1 pattern), as the 95 kDa is much reduced at pH 7 and disappears at pH 8. This change in digestion pattern does not occur in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2, WT) indicating that, in the absence of Ca2+, alkaline pH and Mg2+ have a complementary effect in inducing a transition to the E1 digestion pattern.FIGURE 2Digestion of WT, E309Q, and E771Q mutants with proteinase K, in the absence of Ca2+ (3 mm EGTA), at pH 6-8 and in the presence or in the absence of 10 mm Mg2+. Recombinant protein, obtained as explained under “Materials and Methods,” was used in these experiments. The 1st lane on the left shows a sample with proteinase K denatured before addition of ATPase. Only the large fragments are shown here to reveal the E1 (83- and 28-kDa bands) or the E2 (additional 95-kDa band) pattern of digestion (see Fig. 1). Note that the WT protein acquires the E1 pattern at alkaline pH only in the presence of Mg2+. The E309Q mutant shows the E2 pattern at any pH, in the presence as well as in the absence of Mg2+. The E771Q mutant acquires the E1 pattern as the pH is raised in the presence as well as in the absence of Mg2+. Digestion was for 30 min at 25 °C. The mutant protein is indicated by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We considered the possibility that control of the ATPase conformation yielding the E1 or E2 digestion patterns resides within the Ca2+-binding sites, even in the absence of Ca2+.We therefore performed proteolysis experiments using recombinant protein containing a single mutation of either the Glu771 or Glu309 in the Ca2+-binding site I and II, respectively (13Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19383-19387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that, in the absence of Ca2+, digestion of E309Q yields the E1 pattern at any pH, regardless of whether Mg2+ is present or not (Fig. 2). This indicates that in the WT protein ionization of the Glu309 carboxyl group has an important role for transition to the E1 conformation. On the other hand, it is also shown in Fig. 2 that the E771Q mutant acquires in great part the E1 digestion pattern as the pH is raised from 6.0to 7.0, either in the presence or in the absence of Mg2+. This suggests that in the WT protein, the Glu771 carboxyl group is involved in conformational stabilization of the E2 state. Lack of such stabilization then allows disruption of the E2 conformation when ionization of the Glu309 (and/or other residues) carboxyl chain is produced by raising the pH. Overall, these experiments indicate that H+ binding to acidic residues at the Ca2+ sites favors the E2 digestion pattern, whereas H+ dissociation favors the E1 digestion pattern even in the absence of Ca2+. The effect of Mg2+ observed with WT protein is likely due to a requirement for additional perturbation when both Glu309 and Glu771 contribute to stabilization of E2 (see “Discussion”).Because the physiological role of shifting E2 to E1 is usually observed in the presence of Ca2+, resulting in catalytic activation, we checked whether acquisition of the E1 digestion pattern at pH 8 in the absence of Ca2+, but in the presence of Mg2+, would be accompanied by ATPase activation. We found no ATP utilization under these conditions (not shown), indicating that Ca2+ (μm) binding to E1 is still required to obtain catalytically active E1·2Ca2+. At any rate, this group of experiments suggests that in the WT protein and in the absence of Ca2+, E2 is stabilized by a cooperative mechanism, including the Glu309 and Glu771 side chains. H+ dissociation from their acidic chains favors a conformation yielding the E1 digestion pattern.Effects of AMPPCP and ATP—It was previously reported that nucleotide binding protects the ATPase from digestion by proteinase K (7Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Ma H. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28938-28943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The inactive analog AMPPCP must be used instead of ATP when Ca2+ is present, to avoid rapid substrate consumption by the activated enzyme. We show here that in the presence of Ca2+ the protective effect of AMPPCP is the same at pH 6-8, whereas digestion retains the E1 pattern (Fig. 3). Half-maximal protection is obtained with a 0.1 mm concentration of AMPPCP, as determined by gel densitometry.FIGURE 3ATP (or AMPPCP) protects the ATPase from digestion by proteinase K. Only the large fragments are reproduced here for each experiment, to show the E1 (83- and 28-kDa bands) or the E2 (additional 95-kDa band) pattern of digestion (see Fig. 1). The leftmost lanes in all panels show samples (controls) with proteinase K denatured before addition of ATPase, in a medium containing no AMPPCP or ATP. In the absence of Ca2+, note that the E1 pattern and a stronger protection by ATP are observed at alkaline pH. Digestion (30 min at 25 °C) and electrophoresis are as explained under “Materials and Methods.” The presence or absence of 50 μm free Ca2+ as well as the pH are given in the figure. The concentration of AMPPCP or ATP was 1 mm, unless otherwise specified (μm) in the figure. The experiment shown in the middle panel was performed at pH 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the absence of Ca2+, ATP has a low protective effect at pH 6, whereas the digestion pattern remains that of E2. However, as the pH is raised to pH 8, as expected (Fig. 1), the digestion pattern is transformed to that of E1. In this case, a more prominent protection by ATP (as well as AMPPCP) is observed (Fig. 3). This indicates that in the E1 state obtained in the presence of Mg2+ and alkaline pH, the level of ATP protection is similar to that observed in the presence of Ca2+. Nevertheless, as stated above, addition of Ca2+ is still required to obtain catalytic activation.Phosphoenzyme Intermediate and the E1-P to E-2P Transition—Following ATP binding in the presence of Ca2+, formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate is the next step in the ATP catalytic cycle. It was previously shown that formation of a stable fluoroaluminate transition state analog of E1∼P·2Ca2+ protects the ATPase from digestion with proteinase K (7Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When we studied the proteinase K digestion pattern of the phosphoenzyme analog in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+ (E-AlF4·2Ca2+versus E-AlF4), we found that E-AlF4·2Ca2+ was digested with the E1 pattern at acid as well as alkaline pH (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the E-AlF4 (as well as the MgF4) analog of E2-P exhibited the E2 digestion pattern at pH 6, while exhibiting the E1 digestion pattern at pH 8 (even though Ca2+ was absent). This experiment indicates that the E1-P to E2-P transition requires H+ binding, and E2-P is stabilized by H+ binding in analogy to E2. For this reason, digestion with proteinase K exhibits the E1-P pattern at alkaline pH, even in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4). Therefore, H+/Ca2+ exchange is a determining factor in the E1∼P·2Ca2+ to E2-P transition, and Ca2+ dissociation depends on this transition.FIGURE 4Formation of E1-P·2Ca2+ and E2-P transition state analogs with AlF4 and protection from proteinase K digestion. The leftmost lanes show samples (controls) with proteinase K denatured before addition of ATPase, at pH 7 and in the absence of AlF4. SR vesicles (0.38 mg/ml) were preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, in the presence or in the absence of 20 μm free CaCl2, and in the absence or presence of 2 mm KFl and 50 μm AlCl3, as indicated. Digestion (30 min at 25 °C) and electrophoresis are as explained under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also studied the effect of pH on the ability of the enzyme to acquire protection from proteinase K digestion following exposure to Pi in the absence of Ca2+. In this case, the E2-P ground state of the catalytic cycle is obtained by reverse phosphorylation. It is shown in Fig. 5A that formation of E2-P by equilibration of the ATPase with Pi (i.e. reversal of the ATPase cycle) produces strong protection, and the remaining digestion exhibits the E2 pattern. Protection by Pi appears similar to that produced by TG (Fig. 5A). However, whereas experiments with TG yield the E2 pattern and a low rate of digestion under all conditions (including alkaline pH, absence of Mg2+, and presence of Ca2+), experiments with Pi yield protection and E2 pattern of digestion only under conditions permitting its covalent reaction with the enzyme (i.e. acid pH, presence of Mg2+, and absence of Ca2+). It is shown in Fig. 5B that the same conditions required for ATPase protection from proteinase K (i.e. acid pH in the absence of Ca2+) are also required for formation of phosphorylated intermediate by utilization of Pi (16Masuda H. de Meis L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Pi concentration yielding half-maximal activity was found to be ∼0.5 mm, both for protection and phosphorylation. It is then apparent that detection of the E1 or E2 digestion patterns is a convenient expedient to monitor both the E1 to E2 and E1-P to E2-P through the ATPase cycle.FIGURE 5A, Pi protects the ATPase from digestion by proteinase K only at acid pH and in the absence of Ca2+. A, digestion (30 min at 25 °C) and electrophoresis are as explained under “Materials and Methods.” Only the large fragments are reproduced here for each experiment, to show the E1 (83- and 28-kDa bands) or the E2 (additional 95-kDa band) pattern of digestion (see Fig. 1). The leftmost lanes show samples (controls) with proteinase K denatured before addition of ATPase. B, high levels of ATPase phosphorylation with Pi (E2-P) are obtained only at acid pH and in the absence of Ca2+. Enzyme phosphorylation with Pi was obtained by equilibration (5 min at 25 °C) of SR vesicles (0.12 mg/0.2 ml) with 2.0 mm32Pi, in a medium containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.5 (or 100 mm HEPES, pH 8), and 3 mm EGTA, in the presence or the absence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 3.1 mm CaCl2. Quenching and phosphoenzyme determination are as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Temperature Dependence of Proteolytic Digestion and Effects of Catalytic Substrates—It is noteworthy that protection by catalytic substrate (Fig. 3) does not involve a primary effect on the digestion pattern but rather a delay of the time course of digestion occurring with the same pattern (E1 or E2, respectively). This suggests that protection may be due to constraint of conformational fluctuations related to internal protein dynamics (17Mueller B. Zhao M. Negrashov I.V. Bennett R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12846-12854Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and required for suitable interaction of the ATPase with the proteolytic enzyme. This is best demonstrated by comparing the ATPase digestion with trypsin at various temperatures.Trypsin produces an initial cut on the surface of the ATPase N domain, acting on a site (Arg505) freely accessible from the aqueous medium. Consequently, a 57- and 46-kDa complementary fragment are produced immediately, with no apparent temperature dependence under our conditions. On the other hand, further digestion is much slower, as the pertinent site (Arg198) is enclosed within the ATPase structure. In fact, it is shown in Fig. 6 that further digestion, yielding the 35- and 23-kDa fragments from the 57-kDa fragment and even smaller fragments derived from the 46-kDa fragment, is temperature-dependent and is much faster at 35 than at 25 °C. Protection by ATP is also much more evident at 35 °C (Fig. 7). It is interesting that the effect of ATP appears to be more pronounced on the 23-kDa than on the 35-kDa fragment, suggesting greater exposure of the latter in the ATP-bound conformation of the enzyme.FIGURE 6ATPase digestion with trypsin is highly temperature-dependent. Digestion was obtained in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7 (or MES, pH 6.0; or HEPES, pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, SR vesicles (0.39 mg of protein/ml), and trypsin (50 μg/ml) at 25 °C (left panel) or 35 °C (right panel) for the time intervals indicated. Electrophoresis was as explained under “Materials and Methods.” The complementary 57-kDa (amino terminus) and 46-kDa fragments (carboxyl terminus) are derived from the first rapid cut at Arg505. The complementary 23-kDa (amino terminus) and 35-kDa fragments (carboxyl terminus) are derived from a slower cut at Arg198. The 1st lanes on the left show a sample with trypsin denatured before addition of ATPase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Protection of ATPase trypsin digestion by ATP is much more evident at higher temperature. Digestion with trypsin was obtained as explained in the legend to Fig. 6. The concentration of ATP (when present) was 1 mm. The leftmost lane shows a sample (control) with trypsin denatured before addition of ATPase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the experiments shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the effect of temperature does not involve direct trypsin activation, because the first cut is produced very fast at all temperatures studied. It is clear that the effect of temperature is to promote conformational fluctuations and unfolding of the ATPase, whereby trypsin access to further proteolytic sites is facilitated. Protection by ATP binding is then produced by domain cross-linking and stabilization of conformational fluctuations, thereby limiting productive interaction of the ATPase with trypsin. We also found that the ADP·E1∼P·2Ca2+ fluoroaluminate analog exhibits very strong protection of the ATPase from digestion with trypsin. The protection is most evident at 35 °C (Fig. 8, left panel). If ADP is omitted, protection by the E1∼P·2Ca2+ analog is significantly weaker (Fig. 8, right panel). The experiments with trypsin digestion demonstrate that substrate (nucleotide) binding and the subsequent formation of phosphoenzyme intermediate produce strong stabilization of conformational fluctuations in the ATPase protein.FIGURE 8Protection of ATPase trypsin digestion by AlF4 and ADP (ADP·E1-P·2Ca2+ analog) at different temperatures. The left panel shows the protective effect of both AlF4 and ADP. The right panel compares protection by AlF4 in the absence and presence of ADP. SR vesicles (0.38 mg/ml) were preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 20 μm free CaCl2, in the absence or in the presence of 2 mm KFl and 50 μm AlCl3, as indicated. 1 mm ADP was added to selected samples, as indicated, previous to digestion with trypsin (50 μg/ml) for 20 min at 25, 30, or 35 °C.

Here, we report a definitive Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) archaic ungulate (Kharmerungulatum vanvaleni genus et species nova) from the Deccan volcano-sedimentary sequences exposed near Kisalpuri village in Central India. This find has important implications for the origin and diversification of early ungulates and raises three possible paleobiogeographic scenarios: (i) Archaic ungulates may have been cosmopolitan in distribution.

https://openalex.org/W2090231899,"Prevotella intermedia is a major periodontopathogen contributing to human gingivitis and periodontitis. Such pathogens release proteases as virulence factors that cause deterrence of host defenses and tissue destruction. A new cysteine protease from the cysteine-histidine-dyad class, interpain A, was studied in its zymogenic and self-processed mature forms. The latter consists of a bivalved moiety made up by two subdomains. In the structure of a catalytic cysteine-to-alanine zymogen variant, the right subdomain interacts with an unusual prodomain, thus contributing to latency. Unlike the catalytic cysteine residue, already in its competent conformation in the zymogen, the catalytic histidine is swung out from its active conformation and trapped in a cage shaped by a backing helix, a zymogenic hairpin, and a latency flap in the zymogen. Dramatic rearrangement of up to 20A of these elements triggered by a tryptophan switch occurs during activation and accounts for a new activation mechanism for proteolytic enzymes. These findings can be extrapolated to related potentially pathogenic cysteine proteases such as Streprococcus pyogenes SpeB and Porphyromonas gingivalis periodontain."

Second, VPg-pUpU is used as a primer to produce full-length genomic RNA. Production of VPg-pUpU is templated by a single adenylate residue located in the loop of an RNA stem-loop structure termed oriI by using a slide-back mechanism. Recruitment of 3Dpol to and its stability on oriI have been suggested to require an interaction between the back of the thumb subdomain of 3Dpol and an undefined region of the 3C domain of viral protein 3CD. We have performed surface acidic-to-alanine-scanning mutagenesis of 3C to identify the surface of 3C with which 3Dpol interacts. This analysis identified numerous viable poliovirus mutants with reduced growth kinetics that correlated to reduced kinetics of RNA synthesis that was attributable to a change in VPg-pUpU production. Importantly, these 3C derivatives were all capable of binding to oriI as well as wild-type 3C. Synthetic lethality was observed for these mutants when placed in the context of a poliovirus mutant containing 3Dpol-R455A, a residue on the back of the thumb required for VPg uridylylation. These data were used to guide molecular docking of the structures for a poliovirus 3C dimer and 3Dpol, leading to a structural model for the 3C(2)-3Dpol complex that extrapolates well to all picornaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2079770658,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a component of cartilage, synovium, ligament, and tendon, yet its normal function is largely unknown. To identify its function we have expressed it in 293 and HeLa cell lines and in primary human chondrocytes. We find that COMP protects these cells against death, either in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor α and is able to block activation of caspase 3, a critical effector caspase. This effect appears to be mediated by the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) family of anti-apoptotic proteins because the levels of XIAP, survivin, cIAP1 and cIAP2 are significantly elevated in the COMP-expressing cells and down-regulation of survivin and XIAP protein levels by small interfering RNAs blocks the ability of COMP to enhance survival. The mRNAs for most of the IAP family members were not increased by COMP, indicating that a translational/post-translational mechanism was involved in their induction. However, in both HeLa cells and chondrocytes, COMP induced survivin mRNA by 5-fold. Thus survivin is the first gene identified to be up-regulated transcriptionally by COMP. The carboxyl-terminal half of the protein comprising the type 3 repeats and the RGD sequence (CaCTD domain) was sufficient to promote survival and to elevate the IAPs. Further, an RGD peptide was able to block the prosurvival effect of COMP and the induction of XIAP and survivin, indicating that survival is likely mediated through integrin signaling.

As a corollary to these genetic studies, it has been demonstrated that COMP is subjected to cleavage via extracellular proteases in the cartilage of patients suffering from various forms of arthritis (16Clark A.G.

Some of the resulting fragments of COMP that are produced from this cleavage appear to be stable and can be easily identified in both the synovival fluid and serum of these patients (16Clark A.G.

In cartilage, COMP is expressed in both the developing and mature tissue (7Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimente E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg A. Heinegard D. J.

In adult cartilage, COMP has been shown to be located primarily in the interterritorial matrix between chondrocytes (22Murphy J.M. Heinegard D. McIntosh A. Sterchi D. Barry F.P. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As such it has been proposed that COMP may directly interact with cells. COMP has been shown to aid in the attachment of cells to surfaces (23Riessen R. Fenchel M. Chen H. Axel D.I. Karsch K.R. Lawler J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Chen F.H. Thomas A.O. Hecht J.T.T. Goldring M.B. Lawler J. J. Biol.

Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A COMP mutation in the type 3 repeat, which occurs in 30% of patients with PSACH, abolishes the ability of COMP to aid in attachment (24Chen F.H. Thomas A.O. Hecht J.T.T. Goldring M.B. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that COMP supports the migration of cells in vitro (23Riessen R. Fenchel M. Chen H. Axel D.I. Karsch K.R. Lawler J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In terms of the extracellular matrix protein, it is presumed that COMP may play a role in the structural integrity of cartilage via its interaction with other extracellular matrix proteins such as the collagens and fibronectin. However, it is not yet known whether COMP plays any role in maintaining the stability of cartilage. Additional studies have indicated that COMP can inhibit cell proliferation while enhancing in vitro chondrogenesis (21Kipnes J. Carlberg A.L. Loredo G.A. Lawler J. Tuan R.S. Hall D.J. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2003; 11: 442-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, expression of COMP in the presence of BMP2 stimulation can lead to a late increase in apoptosis (21Kipnes J. Carlberg A.L. Loredo G.A. Lawler J. Tuan R.S. Hall D.J. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2003; 11: 442-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This latter finding is consistent with the fact that the mutant COMP proteins in multiple epiphysial dysplasia and PSACH appear to mediate apoptosis of chondrocytes in cartilage in vivo (25Hecht J.T. Montufar-Solis D. Decker G. Lawler J. Daniels K. Duke P.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 1: 625-633Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Hecht J.T. Makitie O. Hayes E. Haynes R. Susic M. Montufar-Solis D.

Pathol. 2003; 163: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To better understand the function of COMP, we began transient expression studies in both transformed and nontransformed human cells with the goal of assessing its effects on cell viability. We find that COMP is a potent suppressor of apoptosis in both primary human chondrocytes and transformed cells and that it accomplishes this function by inducing the IAP family of survival proteins. Cell Culture, Transfections, Cell Counts, and Flow Cytometry—HeLa and 293 cells were obtained from the ATCC, whereas human chondrocytes were isolated from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The knee samples were provided by National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) (Philadelphia, PA). The average age was 62 years old (range 52-71 years). To isolate chondrocytes, areas of undamaged cartilage were shaved off the femoral condyles or the tibial plateau. The shavings were washed three times in PBS and then digested with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA in serum-free culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C under agitation. After washing in PBS, the cartilage pieces were minced and then digested with collagenase 2 (Sigma) at 50 μg/ml in serum-free medium overnight at 37 °C under agitation. The chondrocyte suspension was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer, washed in PBS, and plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) plus antibiotic-antimycotic solution. The cells were allowed to adhere, spread, and proliferate for 7-10 days. Chondrocytes were used for experiments between passage 1 and 4, during which time cartilage marker genes were expressed. The actinomycin D was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the TNFα was from R & D Systems, Inc. (Merrisville, NC). Monolayer cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 3 days. All of the transfection experiments were initiated on 50% confluent monolayer cultures. Plasmids (20 μg) were transfected either by the calcium phosphate procedure for 293 cells or by Amaxa nucleofection for human chondrocytes and HeLa cells (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The human COMP cDNA expression plasmid was obtained from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The empty vector was pSec2B (Invitrogen). The cells were rinsed with PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in 10 ml of growth medium, and counted in the presence of trypan blue using a hemocytometer. For cell cycle analysis (flow cytometry), the cells were rinsed once in chilled PBS then trypsinized and resuspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 70% ethanol. The cells were kept on ice for 10 min, pelleted, and then treated with RNase A (180 μg; Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Propidium iodide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 75 mg/ml. Cell cycle analysis was performed on a Coulter Profile 2 flow cytometer. For the TUNEL assay, monolayer cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and then processed as per the manufacturer's recommendation (DeadEnd Tunel System, Promega, Madison, WI). The RGD (cycloRGDFV) and control (cycloRADFV) peptides were purchased from Bachem and used at a concentration of 1 mm. The RGD is a potent inhibitor of integrin signaling, whereas the control peptide is not (40Hammes H.P. Brownlee M. Jonczyk A. Sutter A. Preissner K.T. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). siRNA for human COMP was purchased from Ambion, whereas the siRNAs for survivin and XIAP were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The COMP, XIAP, and survivin siRNAs (100 nm) were transfected into 293 cells, HeLa cells, and chondrocytes as per each manufacturer's recommendation. RNA Isolation and RT/PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Oligo(dT) was used as the primer in the reverse transcription reaction which was followed by a PCR with the appropriate primers. For the RT/PCRs, one mg of total RNA from the cells was used in each reaction. All of the RNA samples were DNase I-treated prior to the PCRs. Additionally, as a control, PCR done in the absence of reverse transcriptase was negative for any ethidium bromide-stained bands (data not shown). Protein Analysis and Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant fraction was termed “cytosol.” The nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer consisting of 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were then spun at 14,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the residual nuclear material, and the supernatant fraction was termed “nuclear extract.” For analysis of secreted COMP proteins, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. The medium was harvested, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the medium were added to two volumes of ice-cold acetone, and the proteins were precipitated at -20 °C, as by Jordan-Sciutto et al. (28Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Logan T.J. Norton P. Derfoul A. Dodge G.R. Hall D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein precipitate was then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer in either the presence or absence of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. Additionally, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader assay kit (Serotec, Seattle, WA) for COMP was used to determine COMP protein levels secreted into the medium. For generation of conditioned medium, 293 cells were transfected with the COMP plasmid, and 24 h post-transfection the cells were washed, and serum free medium was added for an additional 48 h. COMP concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For immunoblotting, the proteins were electrophoretically resolved by SDS-PAGE (40 μg of protein/lane) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were then washed in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in TBST. Anti-human COMP antibody (Serotec, Raleigh, NC) was used at a concentration of 1:500. The blot was then washed three times, 10 min each, in TBST and then incubated with a 1:2,500 dilution of secondary antibody conjugated to either alkaline phosphatase (Protoblot System) or to horseradish peroxidase (Chemiluminescence) for 1 h at room temperature in TBST. The blots were then processed using either the Protoblot system (Promega) using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazoleum (BCIP/NBT) as a color developer or using the Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate System (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. COMP Enhances Cell Survival in 293 Cells—It has been previously demonstrated that expression of COMP, as either a wild type or mutant form, can affect the level of apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro (21Kipnes J.

Pathol. 2003; 163: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To explore an effect of COMP on apoptosis, we began transient transfection experiments using a COMP expression plasmid in 293 cells. These cells represent an excellent cell line to test the biological effects of COMP because they are effectively null for COMP expression (they express no detectable COMP by either RT/PCR analysis of RNA or by immunoblotting of cell extracts or conditioned medium). Also, very high transfection efficiencies can be obtained in 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method (50-80%, based on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining), which makes them very useful in transient expression studies. 293 cells were transfected with a human COMP expression vector and then monitored for expression of the COMP protein. Immunoblots of cytosolic and secreted proteins from the cells showed detectable levels of the protein (Fig. 1A). When these same analyses were performed in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol in the Laemmli sample buffer, the COMP protein migrated as a very large molecular complex (>500 kDa), indicating that it had likely formed a pentamer in solution (Fig. 1B). When the concentration of COMP was assessed in 293 cell medium following the transfection, the levels were on average about 3.5 μg/ml. Given that its pentameric molecular mass is 524 kDa, it would suggest an 8 nm concentration of COMP in the media. To determine whether the expression of COMP affected the cells in any way, total viable adherent cell numbers were assessed at 24 h post-transfection. From Fig. 1C, it is clear that the calcium phosphate-mediated transfection led to a decrease in viable cell numbers, a phenomena that is well known (29Renzing J. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1995; 4: 1865-1868Google Scholar, 30Rodriguez A. Flemington E.K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Carvalho-Bittencourt M. Saas P. Resnay S.

This toxicity appears independent of the plasmid used to transfect the cells in that transfection of a number of vectors leads to a significant decrease in cell number (Fig. 1C). However, as seen in Fig. 1C, COMP expression in these cells resulted in an increase in viable cell number (4-7-fold) at 24 h post-transfection compared with the vector controls. We next assessed whether the increase in cell numbers following COMP expression was due to a reduction in apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 1D, there is a 3-fold decrease in apoptosis in the COMP expressing cultures at 24 h post-transfection, as assessed by either flow cytometry analysis, evident as cells with less than a 2 n DNA content, or by TUNEL assay. These data indicate that the increase in cell number following COMP expression is due at least in part to a decrease in apoptosis. As a control for these studies, a COMP siRNA obtained from Ambion was cotransfected with the COMP expression plasmid. As seen in the Western blot (Fig. 2A), the COMP siRNA reduces the level of COMP protein in these cells compared with the cells transfected with the control siRNA. Correspondingly, the COMP siRNA blocks the ability of the COMP expression plasmid to enhance cell survival as measured either by total viable cells (Fig. 2B) or by a percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that simple transfection of the COMP expression plasmid into cells is not sufficient to aid in survival but that production of the COMP protein is required. Thus ectopic expression of COMP in these cells appears to aid in cell survival. To determine whether the survival effect is specific for COMP, an additional secreted protein was expressed in these 293 cells (prostate-specific antigen). We found that prostate-specific antigen was not able to protect the cells against apoptosis when compared with cell expressing COMP (data not shown). COMP Induces the IAP Family of Prosurvival Proteins in 293 Cells—To more thoroughly explore the nature of the apoptosis inhibited by COMP, we examined the levels of a number of active caspases, the mediators of the apoptotic response. We assessed active effector caspases 3, 6, and 7, the TNFα-activated caspase 8, and the stress-responsive/endoplasmic reticulum caspases 10 and 12. As seen in the immunoblot (Fig. 3A), active caspase 3 is present in the control-transfected cells, yet its level is reduced in the COMP-expressing cells. Further, levels of procaspase 3 (uncleaved) are slightly increased in the COMP-expressing cells. An examination of the other caspases (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12) did not reveal any COMP-mediated changes following transfection (data not shown). Therefore, these data show that COMP inhibits the activation of caspase 3. To identify the mechanism by which COMP blocks the activation of caspase 3 and protects cells from apoptosis, we examined the levels of a number of apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. It would be expected that COMP would affect the levels of some of these pro- and antiapoptotic factors, thereby mediating an effect on cell survival. These factors comprise mitochondrial (cytochromeC/Bcl2) and non-mitochondrial (Akt) mediators of apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 3B, a number of these proteins are not affected by COMP, which includes Akt, Akt1, phosphoAkt(Ser), cytochrome C, Bcl2, phosphoBcl2(Ser), BclXL, and Mcl1. These data indicate that the block to caspase 3 activation and apoptosis is not through the regulation of these factors. The IAP family of survival proteins was then examined because they act to directly block caspase 3 activation (33Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 34LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The levels of XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and survivin were significantly increased in the COMP-expressing cells (Fig. 3C, left panels). To determine whether the increase in levels of these proteins was due to an increase in their cognate mRNAs, RT/PCR analysis was performed. As seen in Fig. 3C (right panels), the levels of their corresponding mRNAs were not affected by COMP. Because it has been demonstrated that NF-κB transcriptionally induces the IAP family of proteins (33Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 34LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), we examined levels of NF-κB in the control and COMP-expressing cells. We found no increase in NF-κB or phosphoNF-κB in the COMP-expressing cells (data not shown), which is consistent with the fact that the IAP transcripts are not up-regulated by COMP. These data would indicate that the elevation in cIAP1, cIAP2, survivin, and XIAP protein levels are likely regulated at the translational/post-translational level. XIAP and Survivin Induction Mediates the Survival Effect of COMP in 293 Cells—To determine whether these IAP family members mediate the survival effect of COMP in 293 cells, siRNA experiments were performed in an attempt to reduce their levels. XIAP and survivin were chosen as targets because they are the most potent inhibitors of caspase 3 (33Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Following transfection of the XIAP and survivin siRNAs, their cellular protein levels were reduced by 3-4-fold compared with the control siRNA plasmid (Fig. 4, A and B). When the cells were analyzed for levels of apoptosis, as shown in Fig. 4C, COMP was not able to optimally enhance cell survival in the presence of either the XIAP or survivin siRNAs. The survivin siRNA was not as effective as the XIAP siRNA in blocking the antiapoptotic effect of COMP, suggesting differences in the way these two proteins mediate cell survival. These data indicate that COMP mediates cell survival at least in part through an elevation the XIAP and survivin proteins. COMP Expression in 293 and HeLa Cells Leads to Resistance to TNFα—From the data above it appears that expression of COMP reduces the level of transfection-mediated cell death in 293 cells. It was next important to determine whether induction of cell death by the addition o"

In this study we tested whether this interaction is required for extracellular stimuli to efficiently regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release. Using cultured pig kidney LLC-PK1 cells as a model, we demonstrated that graded knockdown of the cellular Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit resulted in a parallel attenuation of ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release. When the knockdown cells were rescued by knocking in a rat α1, the expression of rat α1 restored not only the cellular Na/K-ATPase but also ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release. Mechanistically, this defect in ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release was neither due to the changes in the amount or the function of cellular IP3 and P2Y receptors nor the ER Ca2+ content. However, the α1 knockdown did redistribute cellular IP3 receptors. The pool of IP3 receptors that resided close to the plasma membrane was abolished. Because changes in the plasma membrane proximity could reduce the efficiency of signal transmission from P2Y receptors to the ER, we further determined the dose-dependent effects of ATP on protein kinase Cϵ activation and ER Ca2+ release. The data showed that the α1 knockdown de-sensitized the ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release but not PKCϵ activation. Moreover, expression of the N terminus of Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit not only disrupted the formation of the Na/K-ATPase-IP3 receptor complex but also abolished the ATP-induced Ca2+ release. Finally, we observed that the α1 knockdown was also effective in attenuating ER Ca2+ release provoked by angiotensin II and epidermal growth factor.

Finally, we observed that the α1 knockdown was also effective in attenuating ER Ca2+ release provoked by angiotensin II and epidermal growth factor. The Na/K-ATPase is a highly expressed integral membrane protein that hydrolyzes ATP to pump Na+ and K+ across the membrane (1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). It also functions as an important signal transducer (2Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that cells appear to contain two functionally separable pools of Na/K-ATPase and that a majority of the cellular Na/K-ATPase is engaged in cellular activities other than pumping ions (3Liang M. Tian J. Liu L. Pierre S. Liu J. Shapiro J. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10585-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nonpumping Na/K-ATPase apparently resides in caveolae and interacts directly with protein kinases, ion channels, and transporters (4Wang H. Haas M. Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Li S. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17250-17259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and Src, for example, forms a functional receptor complex for cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain to activate protein tyrosine phosphorylation (5Nguyen A.N.

Interestingly, recent studies from several laboratories have demonstrated a direct interaction between the α subunit of Na/K-ATPase and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) 2The abbreviations used are:IP3R1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorIP3inositol 1,4,5-triphosphateIP3R2IP3 receptor type 2IP3R3IP3 receptor type 3ERendoplasmic reticulum[Ca2+]iintracellular calciumPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphateDAG1,2-diacylglycerolPLCphospholipase CeYFPenhanced yellow fluorescence proteinPH domainpleckstrin homology domainEGFepidermal growth factorGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFepidermal growth factorPKCprotein kinase CTGthapsigarginAbantibody.

In addition, we have found that ouabain was capable of stimulating the formation of a functional Ca2+-signaling complex consisting of the Na/K-ATPase/Src/PLC-γ/IP3R in LLC-PK1 cells (9Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that the formation of this signaling complex plays an important role in ouabain-induced Ca2+ signal transduction. 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate IP3 receptor type 2 IP3 receptor type 3 endoplasmic reticulum intracellular calcium phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate 1,2-diacylglycerol phospholipase C enhanced yellow fluorescence protein pleckstrin homology domain epidermal growth factor green fluorescent protein epidermal growth factor protein kinase C thapsigargin antibody. The cytosolic free calcium is one of the most important cellular second messengers. Calcium enters the cytosol via the opening of Ca2+ channels that either resides in the plasma membrane or in the membranes of intracellular organelles such as the ER. On the ER, IP3Rs are widely expressed and play an important role in converting the activation of many plasma membrane receptors into intracellular Ca2+ signaling. To date, three isoforms of IP3Rs have been identified, sharing similar but not identical functional properties (11Bosanac I. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The signaling events leading to the ER Ca2+ release from these IP3Rs are initiated by the activation of phospholipase C-coupled plasma membrane receptors such as the Na/K-ATPase and P2Y receptors and subsequent generation of IP3, a ligand for IP3Rs. It has been proposed that the formation of the junctional microdomains that force the proximity of IP3Rs to the plasma membrane receptors provides a mechanism for defining spatially and temporally specific Ca2+ signaling (12Vermassen E. Parys J.B. Mauger J.P. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 787-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For instance, the forced coupling between B2 bradykinin receptors and IP3Rs ensures a robust Ca2+ signaling when the receptor is activated by the ligand in neuronal cells (16Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings raise the question as to whether there is a plasma membrane protein that can function as an anchor to interact and pull the ER IP3Rs to the proximity of the plasma membrane receptors. It is well documented that many G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases are concentrated in caveolae (17Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 18Chini B. Parenti M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because the Na/K-ATPase represents a highly abundant caveolar membrane protein, it is conceivable that the basal interaction between the caveolar Na/K-ATPase and ER IP3Rs could force the proximity of ER IP3Rs to other plasma membrane receptors. Thus, the interaction between the Na/K-ATPase and IP3Rs may not only be important for ouabain-induced ER Ca2+ release but also play a role in other stimuli-induced Ca2+ signaling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of graded knockdown of Na/K-ATPase on ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release. The data presented here clearly demonstrated that the cellular Na/K-ATPase regulates ER Ca2+ release by interacting and targeting the IP3Rs in LLC-PK1 cells. Materials—Fura-2 AM, Image-iT FX signal enhancer, antifade kit, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-goat IgG, and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). U73122 and U73343 were obtained from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Sulfo-NHS-biotin, immobilized streptavidin-agarose beads were obtained from Pierce. Anti-P2Y2 receptor polyclonal antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; anti-YFP polyclonal antibody was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); and anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody was obtained from StressGen Bioreagents Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The sources of other primary antibodies were described previously (9Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Preparation and Culture—LLC-PK1 cells and the Na/K-ATPase α1 knockdown (e.g.A4-11, PY-17, and TCN23-19) and knock-in (AAC-19) cells were maintained in the growth medium as described previously (19Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When cell cultures reached about 80% confluence, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and used for the experiments. Plasmids and Transfection—N-terminal (Ala1-Ser160) of the rat α1 was cloned from rat Na/K-ATPase α1 cDNA provided by Dr. Pressley (Texas Tech University) and inserted in-frame into pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. For calcium imaging, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with various plasmids using calcium phosphate precipitation (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed 24 h after transfection unless indicated otherwise. Calcium Imaging in Live Cells—Intracellular calcium concentration was measured as described previously (9Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with 2 μm Fura-2 AM at 25 °C for 40 min in a physiological salt solution (ECB) containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm d-glucose. Coverslips were placed in a recording/perfusion chamber (model QE-1, Warner Instruments) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (model IX71, Olympus) equipped with a 40× oil-immersion Fluor objective. Excitation light alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and emitted light was recorded at >510 nm. Ratio images were acquired and analyzed using SlideBook software (Slide-Book 4.1.0, Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). Cells were perfused with ECB at 37 °C at the speed of 0.5 ml/min, and then the solution was quickly changed to a nominally calcium-free ECB supplemented with 250 μm EGTA. Cells were excited for 2 ms every 5 s and monitored for less than 30 min. Assay of IP3 Production and PKCϵ Translocation—GFP-fused PLC-δ1 PH domain (PHD-GFP) was used to monitor PIP2 hydrolysis and IP3 production in live cells as described previously (9Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with PHD-GFP in Opti-MEM medium using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h, the cells were exposed to stimulus and monitored for changes in GFP signal in the plasma membrane and the corresponding cytosol. To analyze PKC activation, cells were treated and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Afterward, cells were collected in a buffer containing 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer as described previously (21Mohammadi K. Kometiani P. Xie Z. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42050-42056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C.The supernatant was removed (the cytosolic fraction). The pellet was suspended in the above described buffer to which Triton X-100 (1%) was added and sonicated for 10 s. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected (the particulate fraction). To assay the translocation of PKCϵ, the cytosolic and the particulate fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described before. Immunocytochemistry—Cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 25 °C. Then the cells were permeabilized in fresh phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% saponin for 10 min and blocked with Image-iT FX signal enhancer for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-IP3R3 Ab, goat anti-IP3R2 Ab, and anti-Na/K-ATPase α1 monoclonal Ab) at 4 °C overnight. They were washed and then incubated with suitable Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted using an antifade kit. Image analyses were performed as described previously (6Tian J. Cai T. Yuan Z. Wang H. Liu L. Haas M. Maksimova E. Huang X.Y. Xie Z.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then biotinylated as described previously (3Liang M. Tian J. Liu L. Pierre S. Liu J. Shapiro J. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10585-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27488-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biotinylated cells were then lysed with 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants (500 μg) were mixed with 200 μl of streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads overnight at 4 °C to recover the biotinylated proteins. The recovered proteins and 50 μg cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation of IP3R3 after Transient Transfection—LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with eYFP or αNT-eYFP by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, and lysates were prepared as above. Immunoprecipitation of IP3R3 was conducted as described previously (9Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All traces and immunoblots presented are representative of at least three separate experiments. All quantitative data are given as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed via the Student's t test, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Knockdown of Na/K-ATPase Reduces ATP-induced Ca2+Release in LLC-PK1 Cells—Extracellular ATP is known to modulate Ca2+ mobilization either through the activation of P2Y receptor coupled to a G protein, or through the direct activation of the inotropic P2X receptor. LLC-PK1 cells are known to express both P2X and P2Y receptors (23Harada H. Tai H. Motomura A. Suzuki S. Suketa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C956-C960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Filipovic D.M. Adebanjo O.A. Zaidi M. Reeves W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1070-F1077PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we first determined the properties of ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in LLC-PK1 cells. As depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, when cells were superfused with a nominally Ca2+-free solution, application of 20 μm ATP induced a robust Ca2+ transient, which reached the peak value within 1 min and then declined toward the basal level. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, ATP stimulated a similar but prolonged Ca2+ transient that apparently involved both Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx. To further test whether the ATP-induced Ca2+ transient in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was because of the activation of PLC, the cells were first treated with PLC inhibitor U73122 and then exposed to ATP. As depicted in Fig. 1C, addition of U73122 completely abolished the effect of ATP on intracellular Ca2+. On the other hand, the negative control U73343 did not affect ATP-induced Ca2+ release (data not shown). Thus, we performed the following studies in cells incubated in a nominally Ca2+-free solution to assess the role of Na/K-ATPase in IP3R-mediated ER Ca2+ release. Recently, we have generated several Na/K-ATPase α1 knockdown cell lines from LLC-PK1 cells that were transfected with an α1-specific small interfering RNA (19Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although A4-11 cells express about 44% of α1 subunit in comparison with the control LLC-PK1 cells; PY-17 cells contain less than 10% of α1 subunit (Fig. 2A). When these cells were exposed to 20 μm ATP and monitored for changes in intracellular Ca2+, we observed a significant decrease in ATP-induced Ca2+ release in both A4-11 and PY-17 cells (Fig. 2B). When the peak value was quantified (Fig. 2C), the effect of ATP on intracellular Ca2+ was proportional to the amount of cellular Na/K-ATPase. Moreover, when PY-17 cells were rescued by a rat α1, expression of rat α1 not only restored cellular Na/K-ATPase (19Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but also ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release (Fig. 2, B and C). Taken together, these findings indicate that knockdown of cellular Na/K-ATPase attenuated the ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release. Because this reduction was observed in several knockdown cell lines, was proportional to cellular Na/K-ATPase amounts, and could be rescued by expression of exogenous Na/K-ATPase, it was unlikely a cloning artifact. Inhibition of Na/K-ATPase by Ouabain Does Not Attenuate ATP-induced Ca2+Release—We showed previously that Na/K-ATPase knockdown resulted in a significant inhibition of cellular sodium pump activity and a subsequent increase in intracellular Na+ concentration (3Liang M. Tian J. Liu L. Pierre S. Liu J. Shapiro J. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10585-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To rule out that the attenuation of ATP-induced Ca2+ release is because of a simple inhibition of cellular Na/K-ATPase activity and subsequent increase in intracellular Na+ concentration, we first compared the basal Ca2+ in different cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, there was no detectable difference in basal Ca2+ among these cell lines. Furthermore, when LLC-PK1 cells were treated with different concentrations of ouabain and then measured for ATP-induced Ca2+ release, we found that neither 50% inhibition (1 μm) nor 100% inhibition (10 μm) of Na/K-ATPase by ouabain (25Haas M. Wang H. Tian J. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18694-18702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) changed ATP-induced Ca2+ release in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 2D). Na/K-ATPase Knockdown Does Not Affect Purinergic Receptor Function and ER Calcium Contents—To date, pharmacological characterization and molecular cloning have identified eight P2Y receptor subtypes, of which P2Y2 receptor is highly expressed in renal epithelial cells (26Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that LLC-PK1 cells expressed both IP3R2 and IP3R3 (9Yuan Z. Cai T. Tian J. Ivanov A.V. Giovannucci D.R. Xie Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To test whether changes in the cellular amount of Na/K-ATPase affect the expression of P2Y receptor and IP3R, we performed Western blot analysis of the total cell lysates from control LLC-PK1 cells, the knockdown and knock-in cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, knockdown of Na/K-ATPase did not change the expression of these receptors. Binding of ATP to P2Y receptor activates PLC-β, which subsequently catalyzes the production of second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3. To determine whether Na/K-ATPase knockdown affected the P2Y receptor function, we measured the effect of ATP on DAG production using PKCϵ activation as an indicator. As shown in Fig. 3B, cells were stimulated with 20 μm ATP for 5 min. Analysis of PKCϵ translocation demonstrated a similar activation of PKCϵ by ATP in control LLC-PK1, Na/K-ATPase knockdown and knock-in cells (Fig. 3C). To seek further support, we also measured ATP-induced IP3 production in live cells using a GFP-fused PLC-δ1 PH domain protein as a probe (27Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The imaging analysis was conducted in the control LLC-PK1 cells and another α1 knockdown TCN23-19 cell line. Like PY-17 cells, TCN23-19 cells expressed about 10% of Na/K-ATPase in comparison with the control LLC-PK1 cells (19Liang M. Cai T. Tian J. Qu W. Xie Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release was similarly attenuated as in PY-17 cells (Fig. 3D). Importantly, expression of rat α1 in TCN23-19 cells also restored the effect of ATP on ER Ca2+ release (data not shown). However, unlike PY-17 cells, these cells did not express YFP, making it easier to run GFP imaging analysis and immunostaining. As depicted in Fig. 3E, cells were transiently transfected with the vector expressing GFP-fused PLC-δ1 PH domain. In unstimulated cells, the PH domain bound to PIP2 and mainly associated with the plasma membrane. When PIP2 was hydrolyzed by PLC to produce IP3 in response to the addition of 20 μm ATP, the PH domain translocated into the cytoplasm together with IP3. This resulted in an increase in intensity of cytosolic GFP and a concomitant decrease in the plasma membrane GFP signal and thus an overall increase in the ratio of cytosol versus membrane GFP signal (Fig. 3E). Consistent with the findings of Fig. 3B, we found that the Na/K-ATPase knockdown did not significantly change the ATP-induced IP3 production. Taken together, the above findings indicate that the attenuation of ATP-induced Ca2+ release in Na/K-ATPase knockdown cells is unlikely because of the changes in the number and function of P2Y receptors. To rule out that the Na/K-ATPase knockdown reduced ER Ca2+ contents, we determined cellular Ca2+ after the cells were treated with TG. TG-induced ER Ca2+ depletion has been used by many investigators as an indirect measurement of ER calcium content (28Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We found no significant difference in the amount of Ca2+ released by TG treatment in control LLC-PK1 cells and Na/K-ATPase knockdown cells (Fig. 3F). Knockdown of Na/K-ATPase Changes the Cellular Distribution of IP3Rs—Because the Na/K-ATPase interacts with IP3R, it is quite possible that this interaction plays an important role in regulating the subcellular distribution of IP3Rs. To test this hypothesis, the distribution of IP3 receptor subtypes was investigated by immunocytochemistry. As depicted in Fig. 4, A and B, IP3R2 or IP3R3 antibody-labeled LLC-PK1 cells showed a punctated ER staining pattern. Interestingly, there was also a clear cell periphery distribution of both IP3R2 and IP3R3. Such staining pattern has been reported previously in confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (29Bush K.T.

Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4048-4056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the IP3R resided at the cell periphery was co-localized with the Na/K-ATPase, LLC-PK1 cells were double labeled with a polyclonal anti-IP3R2 and a monoclonal anti-α1 antibody. As expected, Na/K-ATPase showed a continuous plasma membrane staining pattern and was co-localized with IP3R2 (Fig. 4C). Because anti-IP3R3 antibody produced a much clearer cell periphery signal, we repeated the same staining of IP3R3 in the TCN23-19 cells. Although the overall density of IP3R3 in TCN23-19 cells was similar to that in the control LLC-PK1 cells, knockdown of the Na/K-ATPase caused a significant change in subcellular distribution of IP3R3. Specifically, the cell periphery distribution of the IP3R3 was totally abolished (Fig. 4D). Because IP3R could reside in the plasma membrane (22Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27488-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cell periphery distributed IP3R may come from two pools as follows: one from the IP3R in the plasma membrane and the other from the IP3R in the ER membrane that is in close proximity to the plasma membrane. To distinguish these two pools, we performed the cell surface biotinylation study. Quantitative analysis indicated that about 1.8% of total cellular IP3R3 was biotinylated in LLC-PK1 cells. Because the same procedure failed to detect any calnexin, a known 90-kDa integral ER membrane protein, in the biotinylated samples (Fig. 4E), the detected IP3R3 most likely resided in the plasma membrane, which is consistent with the prior observations (22Tanimura A. Tojyo Y. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27488-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the same experiments were performed in both TCN23-19 and PY-17 cells, we detected the same amount of biotin-labeled IP3R3 as in the control LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, the disappearance of cell periphery IP3R3 in TCN23-19 cells was likely because of the redistribution of IP3R3s that resided in proximity to the plasma membrane. Na/K-ATPase Facilitates the Signal Transmission from the Plasma Membrane Receptors to ER IP3 Receptors—The above data suggest that the Na/K-ATPase may function as a plasma membrane scaffold, forcing the proximity and facilitating the coupling between the ER IP3R and the plasma membrane P2Y receptor. Should this be the case, we would expect that exposure of PY-17 cells to a higher concentration of ATP might compensate for the deficiency in coupling of ER IP3R to the P2Y receptor if higher concentration of ATP can activate additional receptors. To test this, we first compared the effects of 20, 50, and 100 μm ATP on PKCϵ activation and found that the activation of PKCϵ reached the maximal level by 50 μm ATP in both LLC-PK1 and PY-17 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). The effects of ATP on ER Ca2+ release were also dose-dependent (Fig. 5C). Significant effect was observed when LLC-PK1 cells"
https://openalex.org/W2054132454,"Environmental stress (nutritive, chemical, electromagnetic and thermal) has been shown to disrupt central nervous system (CNS) development in every model system studied to date. However, empirical linkages between stress, specific targets in the brain, and consequences for behavior have rarely been established. The present study experimentally demonstrates one such linkage by examining the effects of ecologically-relevant thermal stress on development of the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body (MB), a conserved sensory integration and associative center in the insect brain. We show that a daily hyperthermic episode throughout larval and pupal development (1) severely disrupts MB anatomy by reducing intrinsic Kenyon cell (KC) neuron numbers but has little effect on other brain structures or general anatomy, and (2) greatly impairs associative odor learning in adults, despite having little effect on memory or sensory acuity. Hence, heat stress of ecologically relevant duration and intensity can impair brain development and learning potential."

In this work, we show that erucylphosphohomocholine, a new antineoplastic compound, significantly decreased ATP synthesis in isolated rat liver mitochondria at a concentration of 50 μm or higher via permeabilization of the inner membrane. At a concentration of 25 μm, it induced a moderate swelling of mitochondria, a slight decrease of the inner membrane potential, and an increase in state 4 respiration without an essential influence on state 3 respiration or the outer membrane permeability to cytochrome c. We found that cyclosporin A did not prevent mitochondrial swelling induced by 25–100 μm erucylphosphohomocholine. Moreover, cyclosporin A induced a fast drop of the inner membrane potential in the presence of 25–50 μm erucylphosphohomocholine that seems to be due to a strong synergistic inhibition of the respiratory activity.

Our previous studies have shown that the pro-apoptotic activity of ErPC3 is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (10Kugler W. Linnemannstöns K. Veenman L. Gavish M.

Our data showed that the ErPC3-mediated decrease of ATP synthesis involves a direct cyclosporin A (CsA)-insensitive permeabilization of the inner membrane. We have also discovered an unusual synergistic inhibition of ADP-dependent respiration of mitochondria in the presence of both CsA and ErPC3. The mechanism of this effect does not seem to be directly related to the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). We found that bongkrekate (BK) or atractyloside (ATR) at concentrations completely blocking the ANT activity cannot prevent the inner membrane potential drop caused by the addition of CsA to ErPC3-treated mitochondria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDrugs and Assay Material—Erucylphosphohomocholine (ErPC3, erufosine™) was generously provided by Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Liestal, Switzerland). Cyclosporin A, bongkrekate, atractyloside, oligomycin, antimycin A, myxothiazol, rotenone, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The cell death detection ELISAPLUS (cell death kit) was from Roche Applied Science.Isolation of Mitochondria—Liver mitochondria from male Sprague-Dawley rats (4–6 month, starved overnight) were isolated according to the method of Schneider and Hogeboom (13Schneider W.C. Hogeboom G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 183: 123-128Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with modifications. Cooled liver was homogenized in the medium containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA-KOH, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (free fatty acids), 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, at 2–4 °C. MgCl2 was included in the homogenization medium to prevent cytochrome c adsorption on mitochondria (14Lemeshko V.V. J. Biol.

After two washes with the medium containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 50 μm EGTA-KOH, 0.3 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, mitochondria were finally resuspended in 1 ml of the same medium lacking BSA. Protein content was evaluated by a fast volumetric test described earlier (15Lemeshko V.V. Arch. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab ATP Synthesis Monitoring—Real-time ATP synthesis by mitochondria was monitored through accumulating NADPH by registering its fluorescence (365/450 nm) from one corner of the cuvette as described earlier (16Lemeshko V.V. Kaliman P.A. Belostotskaya L.I. Uchitel A.A. Biokhimiya (Mosc.). 1982; 47: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation medium was composed of 100 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm succinate, 40 mm d-glucose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4 (SKPS medium), without or with ErPC3 at 50 or 100 μm. The components of an ATP-registering system (AS) (5 units of hexokinase, 2.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mm NADP+, 0.35 mm AMP, 5 μm ADP, and 2 mm MgCl2) were added 1 min after mitochondria, 0.5 mg of protein/ml, and 2.5 μm rotenone addition. As a control, 0.5 mm ATP was added to be sure that the AS activity was not a limiting factor.Measurement of the Inner Membrane Potential—The inner membrane potential of mitochondria was monitored fluorometrically using safranin O as described previously (17Lemeshko V.V.

Bernhardt, University of Regensburg, Germany. U87MG cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium, U118MG cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Jurkat cells in RPMI 1640. The following components were also added to the culture media: heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 10% (U87MG, Jurkat) or 5% (U118MG), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100μg/ml streptomycin. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Eagle's minimal essential medium were supplemented with 1% of sodium pyruvate and 1% of non-essential amino acids. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity.Quantitative Analysis of Apoptosis—Cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments indicative of ongoing apoptosis were measured using the cell death kit following the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (8Kugler W. Erdlenbruch B. Junemann A. Heinemann D. Eibl H. Lakomek M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1160-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, for apoptosis induction, 1 × 104 human glioma or Jurkat cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates and treated after 24 h with various drugs or with vehicle as control for 12 h. To analyze the effects of the inhibitors on ErPC3-induced apoptosis, the cells were preincubated for 1 h with CsA or oligomycin before treatment with ErPC3 at 45 μm (U87MG), 15 μm (U118MG), or 25 μm (Jurkat). Under these conditions, the cell lines showed clear signs of apoptosis using the cell death kit and caspase-3 processing as a readout (data not shown). Absorption indicative of apoptosis was measured using a Sunrise microplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd.).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAlkylphosphocholines induce apoptosis in a variety of glioblastoma cell lines (8Kugler W. Erdlenbruch B. Junemann A. Heinemann D. Eibl H. Lakomek M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1160-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Hilgard P. Klenner T. Stekar J. Unger C. Cancer Chemother.

Pasternak G.W. Gavish M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9924-9935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which are known to be resistant to various treatments. We have examined the effects of ErPC3, one of the most effective anticancer alkylphosphocholines, on the cells and found that ErPC3 induced tumor cell death at concentrations of 15 μm (U118MG), 45 μm (U87MG), and 25 μm (Jurkat cells) (Fig. 1). Oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial H+-ATPase, essentially increased the viability of ErPC3-treated cells. This might be explained by a prevention of mitochondrial hydrolysis of glycolytically produced ATP, assuming that ErPC3 caused an uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation system.The protective effect of CsA, which is known to block the opening of the classical permeability transition pore (21Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), was significantly less than that of oligomycin (Fig. 1). Theoretically, it is possible that ErPC3 causes uncoupling by two ways: by a direct increase of the inner membrane permeability to ions and by a further activation of the permeability transition pore opening. Only the latter should be inhibited by CsA, whereas oligomycin is able to inhibit ATP hydrolysis in mitochondria activated by both mechanisms. The relatively high concentrations of oligomycin and CsA needed to achieve maximum protection might be associated with the presence of serum albumin in the incubation media. We suggest that the difference in the protective effects of oligomycin and CsA against ErPC3-induced cell death for different tumor cell lines (Fig. 1) may relate to a specificity of the energy metabolism in each of these cell lines.The mechanisms of antineoplastic activity of alkylphosphocholines are not known, although indirect evidence suggests that mitochondria might be involved in this process (1Handrick R. Rubel A. Faltin H. Eibl H. Belka C. Jendrossek V. Radiother. Oncol. 2006; 80: 199-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Rubel A. Handrick R. Lindner L.H. Steiger M.

Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the direct effects of this class of anticancer drugs on isolated mitochondria have not been studied so far. Therefore, we have analyzed the influence of ErPC3 on respiration, inner membrane potential, and swelling of isolated rat liver mitochondria. According to the data presented in Fig. 2A, ErPC3 at a concentration of 50 μm significantly decreased ATP synthesis in mitochondria. The inhibition at 100 μm ErPC3 increased progressively with time, leading to a complete collapse of this process, presumably due to a direct permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes. Under these conditions, the fast response to exogenous ATP (Fig. 2A) shows that ErPC3 indeed affected ATP synthesis but not the activity of ATP-registering enzyme system.FIGURE 2The influence of ErPC3 on ATP synthesis and respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria.

A higher increase in state 4 respiration, accelerating in time, and a marked inhibition of state 3 respiration were observed at 50 μm ErPC3 (Fig. 2B, line f) resulting in a more significant decrease of RCR.The inhibition of state 4 and especially state 3 respiration, resulting in a decrease of RCR, was observed in the presence of both 1 μm CsA and 25 μm ErPC3 (Table 1). A stronger synergistic inhibition of the ADP-dependent respiration was detected at 1 μm CsA and 50 μm ErPC3 (Fig. 2, line f). We found that FCCP-uncoupled respiration was significantly less sensitive to this combined action of CsA and ErPC3 (Table 1, State 3u, and Fig. 2B, lines e and f). The partially inhibited FCCP-uncoupled respiration at 50 μm ErPC3 could be slightly reactivated by exogenous 20 μm cytochrome c (Fig. 2B, line f), indicating that at this and higher concentrations, ErPC3 might cause rupture or permeabilization of the outer membrane, inducing cytochrome c release. The synergistic inhibition of state 3 respiration by CsA and ErPC3 was also accompanied by a significant increase in the ratio of FCCP-uncoupled to state 3 respiration rates (Table 1, 3u/3 ratio).We have observed that ErPC3 at 25 μm did not permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane; the respiration rate in the presence of exogenous cytochrome c and ascorbate as substrate of oxidation was not altered by ErPC3 in the absence or presence of CsA (Table 1, Asc + CytC). In addition, maximum cytochrome c oxidase activity of mitochondria was not changed under these conditions (Table 1, Asc + CytC + TMPD).CsA at 1 μm concentration caused a complete protection of mitochondria against permeabilization by 75 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 3A, curves a (potential) and b (light dispersion)). On the contrary, in the absence of CsA, we have observed a fast decrease of the inner membrane potential (Fig. 3B, curve a) and subsequent opening of the classical Ca2+ potential-dependent permeability transition pore, accompanied with a high amplitude swelling of mitochondria (Fig. 3B, curve b). In the presence of CsA, the addition of 25 μm ErPC3 after completion of calcium accumulation or to the mitochondria without calcium addition caused a decrease of the inner membrane potential that developed with a lag period (Fig. 3, A, curve a, and C, curve a, respectively). Before that, a decline in light dispersion, starting just after ErPC3 addition, was observed (Fig. 3, A, curve a, and C, curve a, respectively, for the presence and absence of calcium).FIGURE 3The influence of ErPC3 on the inner membrane potential and swelling of mitochondria. Mitochondria (Mc), 0.5 mg of protein/ml, and 2.5 μm rotenone were added to SKPH medium supplemented with 5 mm succinate-KOH and 10 μm safranin O. The inner membrane potential generation was accompanied with a decrease of safranin O fluorescence (520/580 nm, curves a and c), and mitochondrial swelling was reflected in a decrease of light dispersion (640 nm, curves b and d).

When CsA was added simultaneously with 25μm ErPC3, the curves were almost identical to those presented in Fig. 3C (data not shown). On the other hand, the addition of CsA after a 2-min preincubation of mitochondria with 25 or 50 μm ErPC3 caused a very fast drop of the inner membrane potential (Fig. 3D, curves a and c, respectively) without an additional marked influence on light dispersion (Fig. 3D, curves b and d, respectively).The moderate increase in state 4 respiration observed at 25 μm ErPC3 (Table 1, Fig. 2B, line e) and 50 μm ErPC3 (Fig. 2B, line f) was in agreement with the slight decrease of the inner membrane potential (Fig. 3D, curves a and c, respectively). We suggest that the inner membrane potential drop, caused by the combined action of ErPC3 and CsA, was the result of both a slight permeabilization of the inner membrane to ions and a relatively strong synergistic inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. According to the data of Azzone et al. (22Azzone G.F. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), at a certain concentration of malonate, state 3 respiration of rat liver mitochondria was inhibited by ∼90%, whereas the FCCP-dependent respiration (20 pmol of FCCP/mg of protein) was decreased by only 25%. In our experiments, we have observed a similar effect; the addition of CsA in the presence of 25 μm ErPC3 caused inhibition of the respiration rate by 81% in state 3 but only by 14% in state 3u with FCCP (Fig. 2B, line e). The inhibition was even stronger, by 93 and 41%, respectively, in the presence of 50 μm ErPC3 (Fig. 2B, line e).ErPC3 at a concentration of 100 μm caused the inner membrane potential drop even in the absence of CsA. The potential drop started with a lag period of ∼2 min (Fig. 3E, curve a), during which a relatively fast mitochondrial swelling of high amplitude was observed (Fig. 3E, curve b). A very striking additional phase of light dispersion decrease developed after an almost complete drop of the inner membrane potential. This suggests that ErPC3 acts on the mitochondrial membrane by more than one mechanism. The presence of CsA significantly shortened the lag period of the inner membrane potential drop (Fig. 3E, curve c) but did not affect the initial phase of mitochondrial swelling. We have observed only slight retardation of the second phase of light dispersion decrease (Fig. 3E, curve d) observed in the presence of 100 μm ErPC3.The effects of CsA on mitochondria are usually associated with the prevention of permeability transition pore opening, frequently attributed to a complex formed by ANT and the voltage-dependent anion channel. However, the exact nature of this pore is currently under strong revision (23Rasola A. Bernardi P. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 815-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). According to an alternative concept of He and Lemasters (24He L. Lemasters J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), the permeability transition pore might be formed by aggregation of damaged membrane proteins including ANT as the most abundant protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this work, we discovered a new effect of CsA, a fast drop of the inner membrane potential induced by the addition of CsA to mitochondria preincubated with the new anticancer compound ErPC3. To our knowledge, this effect has been not described in the literature previously. The strong inhibition of the respiration rate in metabolic state 3 when compared with state 3u by both CsA and ErPC3 might indicate a possible involvement of the ANT. This prompted us to evaluate the influence of BK and ATR on the reported synergistic effect of CsA and ErPC3. BK and ATR are specific inhibitors of the ANT, known as an antagonist and an agonist, respectively, of the permeability transition pore. As shown in Fig. 3F, 10 μm BK and 10 μm ATR completely inhibited the oxidation of endogenous NAD(P)H in response to the addition of ADP. However, they did not prevent, but even accelerated, the drop of the inner membrane potential induced by CsA and ErPC3 (Fig. 3, G, curve a, and H, curve a, respectively for BK and ATR) without an essential influence on the light dispersion changes (Fig. 3, G, curve b, and H, curve b, respectively for BK and ATR). The oligomycin-sensitive H+-ATPase activity of mitochondria, measured in the presence of 50 μm ErPC3 and 0.1 mm 2,4-dinitrophenol, was also not affected by CsA (data not shown). Thus, these data show that the synergistic inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by CsA and ErPC3 did not result from the inhibition of the ANT or H+-ATPase. Nevertheless, according to our other findings, a knock-down of the ANT isoform 2 reduced the apoptotic effects of ErPC3 (25Held-Kuznetsov V. Premkumar A. Veenman L. Kugler W. Leschiner S. Spanier I.
