We created datasets of standardized nail images using a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) trained to distinguish the nail from the background. We used R-CNN to generate training datasets of 49,567 images, which we then used to fine-tune the ResNet-152 and VGG-19 models. The validation datasets comprised 100 and 194 images from Inje University (B1 and B2 datasets, respectively), 125 images from Hallym University (C dataset), and 939 images from Seoul National University (D dataset). The AI (ensemble model; ResNet-152 + VGG-19 + feedforward neural networks) results showed test sensitivity/specificity/ area under the curve values of (96.0 / 94.7 / 0.98), (82.7 / 96.7 / 0.95), (92.3 / 79.3 / 0.93), (87.7 / 69.3 / 0.82) for the B1, B2, C, and D datasets. With a combination of the B1 and C datasets, the AI Youden index was significantly (p = 0.01) higher than that of 42 dermatologists doing the same assessment manually. For B1+C and B2+ D dataset combinations, almost none of the dermatologists performed as well as the AI. By training with a dataset comprising 49,567 images, we achieved a diagnostic accuracy for onychomycosis using deep learning that was superior to that of most of the dermatologists who participated in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2782609842,"The use of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect the presence of species depends on the seasonal activity of the species in the sampled habitat. eDNA may persist in sediments for longer than it does in water, and analysing sediment could potentially extend the seasonal window for species assessment. Using the great crested newt as a model, we compare how detection probability changes across the seasons in eDNA samples collected from both pond water and pond sediments. Detection of both aquatic and sedimentary eDNA varied through the year, peaking in the summer (July), with its lowest point in the winter (January): in all seasons, detection probability of eDNA from water exceeded that from sediment. Detection probability of eDNA also varied between study areas, and according to great crested newt habitat suitability and sediment type. As aquatic and sedimentary eDNA show the same seasonal fluctuations, the patterns observed in both sample types likely reflect current or recent presence of the target species. However, given the low detection probabilities found in the autumn and winter we would not recommend using either aquatic or sedimentary eDNA for year-round sampling without further refinement and testing of the methods."
https://openalex.org/W2792433057,"The increasing availability of food supplements, aggressive media advertising, and common beliefs that these substances have only positive effects on health and sport performance indicate a need for continuous monitoring of this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to investigate the habits and beliefs related to diet supplementation among medical, health professional, and other university/high school students by means of a cross-sectional anonymous survey online. Among the respondents aware of supplements, 37.4% were taking or had taken them in the past. Food supplement use was more common among university students (in particular, those in health professional graduate courses) than high school students. Individual sport practice, rather than team sport, was associated with higher likelihood of food supplement use. Multivitamins were most commonly used, while weight-loss formulations were the least popular. Strikingly, filling nutrient gaps was statistically not considered the main reason for taking food supplements. Instead, they were used to enhance mental performance or enhance well-being. There was statistical evidence that students not enrolled in health or medical professional studies strongly agreed more often than medical students that taking food supplements prevents illness. These results indicate a striking difference between the evidence-based and personal reasons for food supplement use. Arguably, it calls for an improvement in education about diet supplementation and a change in attitude of health care providers to its implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2784627779,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) is important for reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin from the synaptic cleft and is also the target of most antidepressants. It has previously been shown that cholesterol in the membrane bilayer affects the conformation of SERT. Although recent crystal structures have identified several potential cholesterol-binding sites, it is unclear whether any of these potential cholesterol sites are occupied by cholesterol and functionally relevant. In the present study, we focus on the conserved cholesterol site 1 (CHOL1) located in a hydrophobic groove between TM1a, TM5, and TM7. By molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate a strong binding of cholesterol to CHOL1 in a membrane bilayer environment. In biochemical experiments, we find that cholesterol depletion induces a more inward-facing conformation favoring substrate analog binding. Consistent with this, we find that mutations in CHOL1 with a negative impact on cholesterol binding induce a more inward-facing conformation, and, vice versa, mutations with a positive impact on cholesterol binding induce a more outward-facing conformation. This shift in transporter conformation dictated by the ability to bind cholesterol in CHOL1 affects the apparent substrate affinity, maximum transport velocity, and turnover rates. Taken together, we show that occupation of CHOL1 by cholesterol is of major importance in the transporter conformational equilibrium, which in turn dictates ligand potency and serotonin transport activity. Based on our findings, we propose a mechanistic model that incorporates the role of cholesterol binding to CHOL1 in the function of SERT.

Depression is a severe psychiatric disorder with enormous socioeconomic impact. The underlying etiology of depression remains elusive, but the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is believed to play a prominent role.

The activity of hSERT can also be modulated by other mechanisms. As a transmembrane protein that undergoes considerable conformational changes to translocate Na+, Cl−, and serotonin across the membrane, the transporter is most likely sensitive to the physiochemical characteristics of the surrounding membrane as well as specific interactions with particular lipids. Despite only accounting for 2% of the total body mass, the human brain contains ∼23% of the total cholesterol in the body (1Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Thematic review series: brain Lipids.

Cholesterol is very important to brain development as well as neuronal function and synaptogenesis (2Mauch D.H. Nägler K. Schumacher S. Göritz C. Müller E.C. Otto A. Pfrieger F.W. CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol.Science. 2001; 294 (11701931): 1354-135710.1126/science.294.5545.1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Much of brain cholesterol is found in myelin sheaths, where it is crucial for function (3Saher G. Brügger B. Lappe-Siefke C. Möbius W. Tozawa R. Wehr M.C. Wieland F. Ishibashi S. Nave K.A.

Although cholesterol is enriched in specific sphingomyelin-rich microdomains with unique biophysical properties, so-called lipid rafts, cholesterol is also distributed heterogeneously in the plasma membrane (9Wüstner D. Plasma membrane sterol distribution resembles the surface topography of living cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18 (17065557): 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and therefore interaction between membrane protein and cholesterol is also possible independent of lipid raft association. A role for cholesterol in modulating ligand binding to SERT has earlier been described (10Scanlon S.M. Williams D.C. Schloss P.

Tate C.G. Wynne S. Williams C. Haase J. Partitioning of the serotonin transporter into lipid microdomains modulates transport of serotonin.J. Biol.

A conformational effect of cholesterol on dopamine transporter (DAT) conformation and mobility has also been demonstrated (12Jones K.T. Zhen J. Reith M.E.

Specifically, we have previously shown that cholesterol depletion shifts the conformational equilibrium of hSERT toward a more inward-facing conformation (15Bjerregaard H. Severinsen K. Said S.

In crystal structures of the Drosophila dopamine transporter (dDAT), Gouaux and co-workers found first a cholesterol site (CHOL1) (16Penmatsa A. Wang K.H. Gouaux E.

The location of CHOL1 at the interface between the scaffold (TM5) and the conformationally flexible bundle (TM1a and TM7) (19Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H.

TM1a is of particular interest in the conformational role of cholesterol because this region has been shown to undergo large conformational changes in LeuT and MhsT during the transition from outward-facing to inward-facing conformation (20Krishnamurthy H. Gouaux E.

Similarly, TM5 has been shown to line the intracellular permeation pathway in SERT and be more accessible in the inward-facing conformation (25Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. The cytoplasmic substrate permeation pathway of serotonin transporter.J. Biol.

TM7 is part of the conformationally mobile bundle consisting of TM1–2 and TM6–7 and may move in concert with TM1a relative to TM5. CHOL1 is a shallow hydrophobic cavity facing the inner leaflet of the membrane (Fig. 1A). The main hypotheses in the current study are therefore as follows: 1) a cholesterol molecule bound to CHOL1 is responsible for the conformational effect of cholesterol on hSERT and 2) this conformational effect of cholesterol is crucial for transporter function. We decided to test the hypothesis that cholesterol bound to the site lined by TM1a, TM5, and TM7 is responsible for a conformational effect of cholesterol by introducing mutations in this cholesterol site and determining the effect of these mutations on the conformation and function of hSERT and by performing molecular dynamics simulations to study the occupancy of specific cholesterol sites by cholesterol. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that CHOL1 is a highly occupied binding site for cholesterol in a lipid environment. Furthermore, we find that mutations in the cholesterol site shift the conformational equilibrium in a predictable pattern. We also find that this shift in conformation by mutation of the cholesterol site is accompanied by a simultaneous shift in apparent substrate affinity and velocity that closely mirrors the extent and direction of the conformational change induced by mutating CHOL1. Overall, we find that cholesterol binding to CHOL1 lined by TM1a, TM5, and TM7 stabilizes the outward-facing conformation, which accelerates serotonin uptake, and that cholesterol dissociation from this site results in a more inward-facing conformation, which impedes serotonin uptake. These findings point to cholesterol binding to CHOL1 as an important modulator of hSERT transport activity and ligand potency. We first established the Amplex Red method for quantifying membrane cholesterol (Fig. 2B). The use of MβCD has been the preferred method for manipulating the plasma membrane cholesterol content to study the effect on monoamine transporter function, usually removing cholesterol from both raft and non-raft domains (27Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Use of cyclodextrins to manipulate plasma membrane cholesterol content: evidence, misconceptions and control strategies.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768 (17493580): 1311-132410.1016/j.bbamem.2007.03.026Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). MβCD depleted cholesterol from HEK-293-MSR membranes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). To measure conformational changes in hSERT, we relied on the hSERT_C5X_S277C construct described earlier (15Bjerregaard H. Severinsen K. Said S. Wiborg O. Sinning S. A dualistic conformational response to substrate binding in the human serotonin transporter reveals a high affinity state for serotonin.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (25614630): 7747-775510.1074/jbc.M114.573477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Mechanism for alternating access in neurotransmitter transporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Crude membranes with the construct were subjected to a conformation-dependent inactivation with 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), where [125I]RTI-55 binding was subsequently used to quantify remaining active transporter. We found that increased cholesterol depletion increased MTSEA sensitivity (Fig. 2D), reflecting an increased accessibility of S277C and thus a more inward-facing conformation of hSERT. The conformation of hSERT (represented by MTSEA IC50) is linearly dependent on membrane cholesterol (Fig. 2E). Confident that we had a reliable system for cholesterol depletion and quantification of SERT conformation, we proceeded to test whether the hSERT_C5X_S277C construct behaved pharmacologically similar to hSERT WT when subjected to cholesterol depletion. To do so, we subjected the hSERT_C5X_S277C construct along with hSERT WT to cholesterol depletion with MβCD followed by a radioligand equilibrium binding experiment (Fig. 3). We found that cholesterol depletion did not induce any statistically significant changes in the parameters for RTI-55 equilibrium binding to either hSERT WT or hSERT_C5X_S277C (Fig. 3). We therefore conclude that hSERT_C5X_S277C is a valid model of hSERT WT in cholesterol depletion and RTI-55 binding. Previous studies on SERT and DAT have reported moderate changes in ligand affinity or inhibitor potency after cholesterol depletion as a result of conformational changes. We hypothesized that if cholesterol depletion favored a more inward-facing conformation, then the potency of ligands that bind to or induce an inward-facing conformation (i.e. serotonin, ibogaine, and noribogaine) would probably increase in potency. Indeed, in an equilibrium binding competition experiment with [125I]RTI-55 as the radioligand, we observed a dose-dependent increase in potency of serotonin (5-HT), ibogaine, and noribogaine at increasing concentrations of MβCD (Fig. 4, A–C). For ligands that are believed to bind to an outward-facing conformation (e.g. imipramine, S-citalopram, and cocaine) (28Tavoulari S. Forrest L.R. Rudnick G. Fluoxetine (Prozac) binding to serotonin transporter is modulated by chloride and conformational changes.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 (19641126): 9635-964310.1523/JNEUROSCI.0440-09.2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we observed no significant changes in potency except for cocaine inhibition of RTI-55 binding to hSERT WT after treatment with 20 mg/ml MβCD (Fig. 4C), similar to what has been described by others (13Hong W.C. Amara S.G. Membrane cholesterol modulates the outward facing conformation of the dopamine transporter and alters cocaine binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20688912): 32616-3262610.1074/jbc.M110.150565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We also observed very similar responses in hSERT WT and hSERT_C5X_S277C (Fig. 4C), again supporting that hSERT_C5X_S277C is a valid model of hSERT WT in studying ligand binding as a result of conformational changes induced by cholesterol depletion. We hypothesized that cholesterol binding to CHOL1 may be responsible for the conformational effect of cholesterol on hSERT. To qualify whether CHOL1 is indeed a bona fide cholesterol site, we performed a molecular dynamics simulation of hSERT in a POPC/CHOL lipid bilayer with a 4:1 molecular ratio. We used the Martini coarse-grain (CG) force field to model the system (29Marrink S.J. Tieleman D.P. Perspective on the Martini model.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2013; 42 (23708257): 6801-682210.1039/c3cs60093aCrossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The simplification of the interactions, while keeping close to atomistic resolution, allowed us to sample time scales relevant to the study of lipid-protein interactions (30Periole X. Marrink S.-J. The Martini coarse-grained force field.in: Monticelli L. Salonen E. Biomolecular Simulations: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2013: 533-565Crossref Google Scholar, 31Periole X.

Rev. 2017; 117 (28073248): 156-18510.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00344Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The volume map of cholesterol density extracted from the CG molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation indicates that cholesterol preferentially visits a few “hot spots” on the surface of hSERT (Fig. 5a). Most notably, we found high cholesterol densities in the region around TM1. Two of these densities correspond to CHOL1 (TM1/TM5) and CHOL2 (TM2/TM7) described previously in the dDAT crystal structure (Fig. 5b) (17Wang K.H. Penmatsa A. Gouaux E. Neurotransmitter and psychostimulant recognition by the dopamine transporter.Nature. 2015; 521 (25970245): 322-32710.1038/nature14431Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the binding of cholesterol at the TM1/TM5/TM7 interface is relevant for hSERT in biological membranes. The details of the other cholesterol-binding sites go beyond the scope of the present paper but have been described by us in a recent related paper (58Zeppelin T. Ladefoged L.K. Sinning S. Periole X. Schiøtt B. A direct interaction of cholesterol with the dopamine transporter prevents its out-to-inward transition.PLoS Comp. Biol. 2018; (29329285)10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005907Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If cholesterol binding to the site lined by TM1a, TM5, and TM7 stabilizes the outward-facing conformation and, vice versa, if cholesterol dissociation from this site stabilizes a more inward-facing conformation, then mutations that weaken cholesterol binding would result in a more inward-facing conformation, and conversely, mutations improving cholesterol affinity would result in a more outward-facing conformation. To study conformational changes, we introduced all CHOL1 mutants in the hSERT_C5X_S277C background and isolated crude membranes from cells expressing these mutants. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) assay, both before and after cholesterol depletion, we were able to determine the conformational effect of the CHOL1 mutants and the conformational effect of cholesterol depletion on these mutants (Fig. 6). We chose the mutants based on the structure of dDAT (16Penmatsa A. Wang K.H. Gouaux E. X-ray structure of dopamine transporter elucidates antidepressant mechanism.Nature. 2013; 503 (24037379): 85-9010.1038/nature12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) with cholesterol (PDB code 4M48) and hSERT (18Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532 (27049939): 334-33910.1038/nature17629Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) (PDB code 5I73) (see Fig. 1C). Val-86 is located in TM1a at the bottom of the cholesterol site but at 5.4 Å, most likely too far from cholesterol to interact directly (Fig. 1C). Nevertheless, we wanted to see whether introduction of a potential hydrogen-bonding partner for the cholesterol hydroxyl group by the V86S mutation would increase cholesterol affinity and result in a shift toward a more outward-facing conformation. Although we see a minor shift of the conformation in this direction as a consequence of the mutation, it is not significantly different from that observed for the WT or V86A and suggests that Val-86 is too distant from cholesterol for mutations to affect cholesterol affinity. Leu-89 interacts with the A-ring of the cyclic sterane substructure in cholesterol with 3.7 Å between the dDAT Leu-37 (corresponding to hSERT Leu-89) side chain and C4 of cholesterol (Fig. 1C). The almost isosteric L89N mutation primarily introduces polarity in this region, which we predict would repel the hydrophobic sterane substructure of cholesterol and weaken cholesterol binding. Indeed, this mutation results in the largest shift of the conformational equilibrium among the mutants, and the shift is, as predicted, toward a more inward-facing conformation, similar to the conformational effect of depleting cholesterol. On the other hand, the L89V mutation was intended as a relatively neutral mutation that shortens the side chain by a single methylene, thus possibly decreasing the ability to interact favorably with cholesterol slightly but not introducing any repulsion as such. As expected, we observed a blunted conformational effect of the mutation relative to L89N and that L89V did not introduce any conformational change that is significantly different from the WT. Leu-90 lines the hydrophobic groove utilized by cholesterol and is located on the hydrophobic face of the sterane substructure only 4.2 Å from the C19 methyl group of cholesterol (Fig. 1C). Similar to the two mutations in Leu-89, we expect that introducing polarity in the form of the L90N mutation or weakening the hydrophobic interaction by retracting the side chain of Leu-90 in the form of the L90V mutation would result in a more inward-facing conformation if cholesterol binding to CHOL1 is responsible for the conformational effect of cholesterol. As expected, we observed that both mutations resulted in a significantly more inward-facing conformation, consistent with our hypothesis that cholesterol induces a more outward-facing conformation when bound to CHOL1. The aromatic part of Tyr-289 is facing cholesterol at a distance of 4.6 Å, but at the same time, the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine appears to form a hydrogen bond to Thr-371 (Fig. 1C). No mutations can address the role of Tyr-289 in interacting with cholesterol without simultaneously affecting the hydrogen bond to Thr-371. However, we were also interested in studying the potential role of this evolutionarily conserved hydrogen bond between Tyr-289 and Thr-371 in the conformational equilibrium of hSERT because it may be important when the bundle and Thr-371 move relative to the scaffold and Tyr-289. This hydrogen bond is accessible via the Y289F and T371A mutations, and the prediction would be that disrupting the hydrogen bond by either mutation could possibly facilitate the transition to an inward-facing conformation. We did not observe any conformational effect of the Y289F mutation, but we did observe a more inward-facing conformation for T371A (Fig. 6). A conformational effect from only one of the mutations but not both points to a negligible role of breaking the hydrogen bond in the conformational equilibrium, but the conservation of the two residues may instead suggest a role in the folding of the transporter. T371A would appear to be too distant from cholesterol to coordinate it directly (Fig. 1C), but aside from its hydrogen bond to Tyr-289, it also forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Val-367 one helix turn away and may to some extent line up Val-367 to interact favorably with the B and D cycles in cholesterol. Indeed, as expected, we do observe that introducing polarity via the mutation V367N does result in a more inward-facing conformation (Fig. 6) consistent with decreased cholesterol binding and an ensuing shift in conformation relative to WT or the control V367A. Alternatively, T371A could also destabilize Tyr-289 and thereby indirectly destabilize cholesterol binding. In the dDAT structure, the isooctyl tail of cholesterol is nestled between Leu-276 (hSERT Leu-292), Leu-277 (hSERT Ser-293), Leu-280 (hSERT Leu-296), and Ile-358 (hSERT Val-374) (see Fig. 1C). It is obvious that the two diverging residues in hSERT will result in a larger and less hydrophobic"
https://openalex.org/W2792827143,"Background Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer among women in the developing countries including Ethiopia. Precancerous lesions can be developed and risk to the development of cervical cancer over time. Early identification of the precancerous lesion and its risk factor is paramount in preventing cervical cancer. However, the determinants of cervical precancerous lesions are not well documented in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study is conducted to determine factors associated with cervical precancerous lesion among women screened for cervical cancer. Methods A hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted in selected health facilities in Addis Ababa from March to April 2016. Data were collected from 114 cases and 229 controls using an interviewer-administered questionnaire, entered to Epi Info version 7, and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Odds ratios with its 95% confidence intervals and two-tailed P-value were calculated. Variables with P-value ≤ 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression model. Results Women aged 40–49 years had 2.4-fold higher odds of precancerous lesions compared to those aged 30–39 (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.4, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.27–4.54). Women having history of sexually transmitted infections were significantly associated with cervical precancerous lesion compared to their counterparts (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 3.20, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.26–8.10). Similarly, those women who had two or more lifetime sexual partners (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.17 95% Confidence Interval: 1.01–4.67), and women whose husbands had two or more lifetime sexual partners (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 3.03, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.25, 7.33) had higher odds of cervical precancerous lesions. Conclusions Older age, history of multiple sexual partners and sexual transmitted infections were associated with increased risk of precancerous lesion. Therefore, women with higher risk of precancerous lesions should be encouraged to be screened more frequently for cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2792420397,"Omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (ω-3 FAD, D15D) is a key enzyme for α-linolenic acid (ALA) biosynthesis. Both chia (Salvia hispanica) and perilla (Perilla frutescens) contain high levels of ALA in seeds. In this study, the ω-3 FAD gene family was systematically and comparatively cloned from chia and perilla. Perilla FAD3, FAD7, FAD8 and chia FAD7 are encoded by single-copy (but heterozygous) genes, while chia FAD3 is encoded by 2 distinct genes. Only 1 chia FAD8 sequence was isolated. In these genes, there are 1 to 6 transcription start sites, 1 to 8 poly(A) tailing sites, and 7 introns. The 5'UTRs of PfFAD8a/b contain 1 to 2 purine-stretches and 2 pyrimidine-stretches. An alternative splice variant of ShFAD7a/b comprises a 5'UTR intron. Their encoded proteins harbor an FA_desaturase conserved domain together with 4 trans-membrane helices and 3 histidine boxes. Phylogenetic analysis validated their identity of dicot microsomal or plastidial ω-3 FAD proteins, and revealed some important evolutionary features of plant ω-3 FAD genes such as convergent evolution across different phylums, single-copy status in algae, and duplication events in certain taxa. The qRT-PCR assay showed that the ω-3 FAD genes of two species were expressed at different levels in various organs, and they also responded to multiple stress treatments. The functionality of the ShFAD3 and PfFAD3 enzymes was confirmed by yeast expression. The systemic molecular and functional features of the ω-3 FAD gene family from chia and perilla revealed in this study will facilitate their use in future studies on genetic improvement of ALA traits in oilseed crops."
https://openalex.org/W2790020775,"Muscle and fasciocutaneous flaps taken from autologous donor sites are currently the most utilized approach for trauma repair, accounting annually for 4.5 million procedures in the US alone. However, the donor tissue size is limited and the complications related to these surgical techniques lead to morbidities, often involving the donor sites. Alternatively, recent reports indicated that extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds boost the regenerative potential of the injured site, as shown in a small cohort of volumetric muscle loss patients. Perfusion decellularization is a bioengineering technology that allows the generation of clinical-scale ECM scaffolds with preserved complex architecture and with an intact vascular template, from a variety of donor organs and tissues. We recently reported that this technology is amenable to generate full composite tissue scaffolds from rat and non-human primate limbs. Translating this platform to human extremities could substantially benefit soft tissue and volumetric muscle loss patients providing tissue- and species-specific grafts. In this proof-of-concept study, we show the successful generation a large-scale, acellular composite tissue scaffold from a full cadaveric human upper extremity. This construct retained its morphological architecture and perfusable vascular conduits. Histological and biochemical validation confirmed the successful removal of nuclear and cellular components, and highlighted the preservation of the native extracellular matrix components. Our results indicate that perfusion decellularization can be applied to produce human composite tissue acellular scaffolds. With its preserved structure and vascular template, these biocompatible constructs, could have significant advantages over the currently implanted matrices by means of nutrient distribution, size-scalability and immunological response."
https://openalex.org/W2788568941,"As a salt-adaptive plant, the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) requires a suitable mechanism to adapt to the stress of saline soils. There is growing evidence that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression in response to abiotic stresses, including salinity. Thus, the present study sought to examine the differential methylation status that occurs in the date palm genome when plants are exposed to salinity, and to identify salinity responsive genes that are regulated by DNA methylation. To achieve these, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was employed and mRNA was sequenced from salinity-treated and untreated roots. The WGBS analysis included 324,987,795 and 317,056,091 total reads of the control and the salinity-treated samples, respectively. The analysis covered about 81% of the total genomic DNA with about 40% of mapping efficiency of the sequenced reads and an average read depth of 17-fold coverage per DNA strand, and with a bisulfite conversion rate of around 99%. The level of methylation within the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was significantly (p < 0.05, FDR ≤ 0.05) increased in response to salinity specifically at the mCHG and mCHH sequence contexts. Consistently, the mass spectrometry and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the global DNA methylation in response to salinity. mRNA sequencing revealed the presence of 6,405 differentially regulated genes with a significant value (p < 0.001, FDR ≤ 0.05) in response to salinity. Integration of high-resolution methylome and transcriptome analyses revealed a negative correlation between mCG methylation located within the promoters and the gene expression, while a positive correlation was noticed between mCHG/mCHH methylation rations and gene expression specifically when plants grew under control conditions. Therefore, the methylome and transcriptome relationships vary based on the methylated sequence context, the methylated region within the gene, the protein-coding ability of the gene, and the salinity treatment. These results provide insights into interplay among DNA methylation and gene expression, and highlight the effect of salinity on the nature of this relationship, which may involve other genetic and epigenetic players under salt stress conditions. The results obtained from this project provide the first draft map of the differential methylome and transcriptome of date palm when exposed to an abiotic stress."

PPARs are essential to adipocyte plasticity, but its isolated role in the browning phenomenon is not clear. This study aimed to examine whether activation of PPAR-α or PPAR-β/δ could induce beige cell depots in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice. Material and methods Sixty animals were randomly assigned to receive a control diet (C, 10% lipids) or a high-fat diet (HF, 50% lipids) for ten weeks. Then each group was re-divided to begin the treatments that lasted 4 weeks, totalizing six groups: C, C-α (C plus PPAR-α agonist, 2.5 mg/kg BM), C-β (C plus PPAR-β/δ agonist, 1 mg/kg BM), HF, HF-α (HF plus PPAR-α agonist), HF-β (HF plus PPAR-β/δ agonist). Results HF animals presented with overweight, glucose intolerance and subcutaneous white adipocyte hypertrophy. Both treatments significantly attenuated these parameters. Browning, verified by UCP1 positive beige cells and enhanced body temperature, was just observed in PPAR-α treated groups. PPAR-α agonism also elicited an enhanced gene expression of the thermogenesis effector UCP1, the beige-selective gene TMEM26 and the PRDM16, an essential gene for brown-like phenotype maintenance in the beige adipocytes when compared to their counterparts. The enhanced CIDEA and the reduced UCP1 gene levels might justify the white phenotype predominance after the treatment with the PPAR-β/δ agonist. Conclusions This work provides evidence that the PPAR-β/δ agonist ameliorated metabolic disorders through enhanced beta-oxidation and better tolerance to glucose, whereas the PPAR-α agonism was confirmed as a promising therapeutic target for treating metabolic diseases via beige cell induction and enhanced thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2793008795,"We investigated the cytogenetic and gene expression responses of peripheral blood cells of non-human primates (NHP, Macaca mulatta) that were whole-thorax irradiated with a single dose of 10 Gy. In this model, partial irradiation of NHPs in the thoracic region (Whole Thorax Lung Irradiation, WTLI) allows the study of late radiation-induced lung injury, while avoiding acute radiation syndromes related to hematopoietic and gastrointestinal injury. A transient drop in circulating lymphocytes and platelets was seen by 9 days, followed by elevations in respiratory rate, circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes at 60-100 days, corresponding to computed tomography (CT) and histologic evidence of pneumonitis, and elective euthanasia of four animals. To evaluate long-term DNA damage in NHP peripheral blood lymphocytes after 10 Gy WTLI, we used the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay to measure chromosomal aberrations as post-mitotic micronuclei in blood samples collected up to 8 months after irradiation. Regression analysis showed significant induction of micronuclei in NHP blood cells that persisted with a gradual decline over the 8-month study period, suggesting long-term DNA damage in blood lymphocytes after WTLI. We also report transcriptomic changes in blood up to 30 days after WTLI. We isolated total RNA from peripheral blood at 3 days before and then at 2, 5 and 30 days after irradiation. We identified 1187 transcripts that were significantly changed across the 30-day time course. From changes in gene expression, we identified biological processes related to immune responses, which persisted across the 30-day study. Response to oxygen-containing compounds and bacteria were implicated by gene-expression changes at the earliest day 2 and latest, day 30 time-points. Gene expression changes suggest a persistent altered state of the immune system, specifically response to infection, for at least a month after WTLI."

Individualized secondary data retrieved from the 2014 European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) for Spain were used to conduct a cross-sectional epidemiological study (n = 18926). PA was assessed by two different measures: a specific designed variable for EHIS and a leisure time PA frequency-based query of the national survey. Diseases analyzed were hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, depression and anxiety. The use of prescription medication was also included in the study. Weighted percentages were computed and contingency tables were calculated to describe PA by levels of the traits and sociodemographic characteristics. Chi-square test was used to compare percentages between groups and weighted logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between PA and the prevalence of the disease. About 73% of the Spanish population performs no PA at all or only occasionally during their leisure time, and only one third meets minimum PA international guidelines (≥ 150min/week). Men are considerably more active than women and less PA is observed as the education level decreases and as age increases. The risk of the diseases evaluated was up to three times higher among inactive individuals. This study provides national population-based estimations highlighting the impact of PA in Spain, not only in the prevalence of some of the major non-communicable diseases but also in reducing prescription medication, and the potential sex and socioeconomic influence."
https://openalex.org/W2792362326,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an age-related disease, affecting a majority of elderly men worldwide. Medical management of BPH is an alternative to surgical treatment of this disease. Currently, α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) antagonists are among the first line drugs to treat BPH by reducing the tension of urinary track and thus the obstructive symptoms in voiding. In drug development, old male dogs with spontaneous BPH are considered the golden standard of the animal models. However, old dogs (>6 years) are expensive and not all old dogs develop BPH. So it is necessary to develop more accessible animal models for drug efficacy evaluation. Here we describe the development of testosterone-induced BPH models in both rats and young adult dogs and their applications in the in vivo evaluation of α1-AR antagonist. The BPH rats and dogs induced by chronic testosterone treatment have significantly increased micturition frequency and reduced mean voided volume, very similar to the clinical symptoms of BPH patients. Silodosin, an α1-AR antagonist, significantly reduces the urinary frequency and increases the voided volume in BPH model animals in a dose-dependent manner. The results demonstrate that testosterone-induced BPH rat and dog models might provide a more efficient way to evaluate micturition behavior in anti-BPH drug studies."

Our aim was to develop an automated morphometric analysis process to characterize the anatomy of α-cell and exocrine pancreas in patients with T1D, using the publicly available slides of the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors (nPOD).The ratio of β- and α-cell area to total tissue area were quantified in 75 patients with T1D (thereafter patients) and 66 control subjects (thereafter controls), on 2 insulin-stained and 4 glucagon-stained slides from both the head and the tail of the pancreas. The β- and α-cell masses were calculated in the 66 patients and the 50 controls for which the pancreas weight was available. Non-exocrine-non-endocrine tissue area (i.e. non-acinar, non-insular tissue) to total tissue area ratio was evaluated on both insulin- and glucagon-stained slides. Results were expressed as mean ±SD.An automated quantification method was set up using the R software and was validated by quantification of β-cell mass, a well characterized parameter. β-cell mass was 29.6±112 mg in patients and 628 ±717 mg in controls (p<0.0001). α-cell mass was 181±176 mg in patients and 349 ±241mg in controls (p<0.0001). Non-exocrine-non-endocrine area to total tissue area ratio was 39±9% in patients and 29± 10% in controls (p<0.0001) and increased with age in both groups, with no correlation with diabetes duration in patients.The absolute α-cell mass was lower in patients compared to controls, in proportion to the decrease in pancreas weight observed in patients. Non-exocrine-non-endocrine area to total tissue area ratio increased with age in both groups but was higher in patients at all ages."
https://openalex.org/W2783333988,"Protein SUMOylation has been reported to play a role in innate immune response, but the enzymes, substrates, and consequences of the specific inflammatory signaling events are largely unknown. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are abundantly produced during macrophage activation and required for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that SENP3 is a redox-sensitive SUMO2/3 protease. To explore any links between reversible SUMOylation and ROS-related inflammatory signaling in macrophage activation, we generated mice with Senp3 conditional knock-out in myeloid cells. In bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced in vitro and in vivo inflammation models, we found that SENP3 deficiency markedly compromises the activation of TLR4 inflammatory signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages exposed to LPS. Moreover, Senp3 conditional knock-out mice were significantly less susceptible to septic shock. Of note, SENP3 deficiency was associated with impairment in JNK phosphorylation. We found that MKK7, which selectively phosphorylates JNK, is a SENP3 substrate and that SENP3-mediated deSUMOylation of MKK7 may favor its binding to JNK. Importantly, ROS-dependent SENP3 accumulation and MKK7 deSUMOylation rapidly occurred after LPS stimulation. In conclusion, our findings indicate that SENP3 potentiates LPS-induced TLR4 signaling via deSUMOylation of MKK7 leading to enhancement in JNK phosphorylation and the downstream events. Therefore this work provides novel mechanistic insights into redox regulation of innate immune responses."

Materials and methods A consensus map of lentil (Lens culinaris ssp. culinaris Medikus) was constructed using three different lentils recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, including “CDC Redberry” x “ILL7502” (LR8), “ILL8006” x “CDC Milestone” (LR11) and “PI320937” x “Eston” (LR39). Results The lentil consensus map was composed of 9,793 DArT markers, covered a total of 977.47 cM with an average distance of 0.10 cM between adjacent markers and constructed 7 linkage groups representing 7 chromosomes of the lentil genome. The consensus map had no gap larger than 12.67 cM and only 5 gaps were found to be between 12.67 cM and 6.0 cM (on LG3 and LG4). The localization of the SNP markers on the lentil consensus map were in general consistent with their localization on the three individual genetic linkage maps and the lentil consensus map has longer map length, higher marker density and shorter average distance between the adjacent markers compared to the component linkage maps. Conclusion This high-density consensus map could provide insight into the lentil genome. The consensus map could also help to construct a physical map using a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome library and map based cloning studies. Sequence information of DArT may help localization of orientation scaffolds from Next Generation Sequencing data."
https://openalex.org/W2783669838,"Understanding the drivers of variability in the composition of fish assemblages across the Indo-Pacific region is crucial to support coral reef ecosystem resilience. Whilst numerous relationships and feedback mechanisms between the functional roles of coral reef fishes and reef benthic composition have been investigated, certain key groups, such as the herbivores, are widely suggested to maintain reefs in a coral-dominated state. Examining links between fishes and reef benthos is complicated by the interactions between natural processes, disturbance events and anthropogenic impacts, particularly fishing pressure. This study examined fish assemblages and associated benthic variables across five atolls within the Chagos Archipelago, where fishing pressure is largely absent, to better understand these relationships. We found high variability in fish assemblages among atolls and sites across the archipelago, especially for key groups such as a suite of grazer-detritivore surgeonfish, and the parrotfishes which varied in density over 40-fold between sites. Differences in fish assemblages were significantly associated with variable levels of both live and recently dead coral cover and rugosity. We suggest these results reflect differing coral recovery trajectories following coral bleaching events and a strong influence of ‘bottom-up’ control mechanisms on fish assemblages. Species level analyses revealed that Scarus niger, Acanthurus nigrofuscus and Chlorurus strongylocephalos were key species driving differences in fish assemblage structure. Clarifying the trophic roles of herbivorous and detritivorous reef fishes will require species-level studies, which also examine feeding behaviour, to fully understand their contribution in maintaining reef resilience to climate change and fishing impacts."

We previously demonstrated that DENN domain-containing protein 3 (DENND3), a GEF for Rab12, is regulated through phosphorylation during macroautophagy (9Xu J. Fotouhi M. McPherson P.S. Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16 (25925668): 709-71810.15252/embr.201440006Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Xu J.

Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a conserved process functioning in degradation of macromolecules. Upon specific stimulation, such as starvation, selective cellular materials are sequestered into a double membrane organelle, the autophagosome. Following fusion with lysosomes, the materials enclosed in the autophagosome are degraded, and the resulting products, such as amino acids, are released into the cytosol for reuse (11Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. The role of Atg proteins in autophagosome formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27 (21801009): 107-13210.1146/annurev-cellbio-092910-154005Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). DENND3 plays a vital role in this process. Upon starvation, the most upstream kinase in the autophagy process, Unc-51–like kinase (ULK), phosphorylates DENND3, activating its GEF activity toward Rab12. Active Rab12 facilitates the traffic of autophagosomes toward lysosomes (9Xu J. Fotouhi M. McPherson P.S. Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16 (25925668): 709-71810.15252/embr.201440006Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition to ULK-mediated phosphorylation, DENND3 is regulated by an intramolecular interaction that autoinhibits its GEF activity at the steady state (12Xu J. McPherson P.S. Regulation of DENND3, the exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab12 through an intramolecular interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28249939): 7274-728210.1074/jbc.M116.772434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Caplan S.

Phosphorylation of Tyr-940 within DENND3 counters the intramolecular interaction and renders an open conformation of DENND3, resulting in enhanced GEF activity toward Rab12 (12Xu J. McPherson P.S. Regulation of DENND3, the exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab12 through an intramolecular interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28249939): 7274-728210.1074/jbc.M116.772434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Caplan S.

Tyr-940 resides in a region of DENND3 thought to be unstructured. Through generation of a series of protein constructs followed by expression studies, we identified a stable region surrounding Tyr-940 and solved its 3D structure at 1.85 Å resolution. Based on its structure and function, we propose the term PHenn, for PH-like domain binding to a DENN domain. We demonstrate that the PHenn domain functions as a novel actin-binding module and that the actin and DENN domain interactions are required for the role of DENND3 in autophagy. The N terminus of DENND3 has a DENN domain, which is preceded by an N-terminal 79-amino acid extension. We refer to the two regions collectively as the extended-DENN (Ext-DENN) domain. The C terminus contains a WD40 repeats domain (Fig. 1A). The region between these domains is termed the linker. We previously demonstrated an intramolecular interaction between Ext-DENN and the linker that autoinhibits DENND3 GEF activity at steady state (12Xu J. McPherson P.S. Regulation of DENND3, the exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab12 through an intramolecular interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28249939): 7274-728210.1074/jbc.M116.772434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Importantly, the phosphorylation status of Tyr-940 near the C terminus of the linker regulates this intramolecular interaction. Using PSIPRED, a secondary structure prediction tool (14Jones D.T. Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292 (10493868): 195-20210.1006/jmbi.1999.3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (4464) Google Scholar), we noticed that the region surrounding Tyr-940 contains clustered α-helices and β-sheets, a sign of a structured domain. We thus sought to solve the structure of the linker through crystallography. The purified full-length linker failed to produce protein amenable to crystal formation. We thus generated a series of constructs involving progressive deletion of the N-terminal side of the linker until we mapped a minimal region that retained binding to the Ext-DENN and was suitable for structural studies. The construct, encoding residues 720–973, bound to FLAG-Ext-DENN in pulldown experiments to the same extent as full-length linker (Fig. 1B). Crystals generated from the 720–973 construct diffracted to better than 2 Å resolution. To determine the phases, the protein was labeled with selenomethionine, and the structure was solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined to 1.85 Å. Statistics of data collection and refinement are shown in Table S1. The structure, termed a PHenn domain, is present in two copies in the asymmetric unit. The molecules are very similar to each other with a root mean square deviation of atomic positions of 0.63 Å over 206 Cα atoms (Fig. S1A). We observed residues 722–946 (chain A) and 723–947 (chain B) in the electron density map. The N-terminal residues 720–721 and the C-terminal residues 948–973 are absent in the model due to disorder. The structure shows a large helical bundle capped by a sandwich of two β-sheets stacked perpendicularly to each other (Fig. 1C). The β-sheets in combination with the following helix form a characteristic pleckstrin homology (PH)-like fold (yellow in Fig. 1D). The PH-like fold is an integral part of the larger domain, as it is preceded by four α-helices and followed by another three α-helices, all of which make up the helical bundle (Fig. 1D). Previous studies demonstrated a key role for Tyr-940 in regulating the GEF activity of the DENN domain via an intramolecular interaction with the Ext-DENN region (12Xu J. McPherson P.S. Regulation of DENND3, the exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab12 through an intramolecular interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28249939): 7274-728210.1074/jbc.M116.772434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Tyr-940 is positioned at the surface made by the junction of four helices on the opposite site of the PH subdomain (Fig. S1B). The side chain of Tyr-940 is solvent-accessible and is primed for contacts with the Ext-DENN (Fig. S1B). Moreover, when evolutionarily conserved regions of the PHenn domain were mapped onto the surface of the structure (gray, poorly conserved regions; green, highly conserved regions), we noticed that one of the most highly conserved surfaces is centered on Tyr-940 (Fig. S1C). This further highlights the physiological relevance of the intramolecular interaction. The most unusual structural feature of the PHenn domain is a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Phe-856, Leu-857, Leu-858, and Leu-859) that make up a hydrophobic β-turn that protrudes from the structure (Fig. 2A). On the outside surface of the β-sheet, the hydrophobic surface extends on either side by Val-854 and Ile-861 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, in the crystal, the hydrophobic β-turn is stabilized by interactions between DENND3 molecules (Fig. 2B). We previously observed that DENND3 self-associates (12Xu J. McPherson P.S. Regulation of DENND3, the exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab12 through an intramolecular interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28249939): 7274-728210.1074/jbc.M116.772434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and wondered whether the PHenn domain contributes to DENND3 oligomerization. We thus performed pulldown experiments using the GST-PHenn domain with cell lysates expressing FLAG-tagged PHenn domain but detected no interaction (Fig. 2C). To test a possible role of the hydrophobic β-turn in the context of the full-length protein, we mutated both Leu-857 and Leu-858 to either glutamine or serine (labeled L to Q or L to S in Fig. 2). The interaction of full-length FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged DENND3 proteins was not altered by the mutations (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the hydrophobic β-turn is not involved in the oligomerization of DENND3. The interaction between the PHenn domains seen in the crystal is probably limited to the process of crystal formation. To test whether the hydrophobic β-turn is involved in the intramolecular interaction between PHenn domain and the Ext-DENN, we performed pulldown experiments using the GST-PHenn domain with cell lysates expressing FLAG-tagged Ext-DENN. As shown in Fig. 2E, the binding between Ext-DENN and the PHenn domain was abolished by the L857Q/L858Q double mutation in the PHenn domain, suggesting that the hydrophobic β-turn is critical for the intramolecular interaction. Release of the intramolecular interaction, leading to up-regulation of GEF activity, would leave the hydrophobic cluster exposed. In some cases, clustered hydrophobic residues insert into lipid bilayers, such as what is seen in the N-BAR domain of endophilin, which anchors into membranes through hydrophobic residues in its N-terminal amphipathic helix (15Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. Mechanism of endophilin N-BAR domain-mediated membrane curvature.EMBO J. 2006; 25 (16763559): 2898-291010.1038/sj.emboj.7601174Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 16Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. Endophilin BAR domain drives membrane curvature by two newly identified structure-based mechanisms.EMBO J. 2006; 25 (16763557): 2889-289710.1038/sj.emboj.7601176Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the hydrophobic β-turn would insert into membranes upon release of the intramolecular interaction. We thus compared the membrane pool of wildtype DENND3 with that of DENND3 with L857Q/L858Q mutations using subcellular fractionation experiments. Postnuclear supernatants from lysates expressing the DENND3 proteins were centrifuged at 200,000 × g, and the membrane (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions were analyzed. Whereas Na+K+-ATPase, an integral membrane protein was found in the pellet and GAPDH, a cytosolic protein, was found mainly in the supernatant, the L857Q/L858Q mutant was found mainly in the membrane fraction, the same as wildtype DENND3 (Fig. S2, A and B). Thus, the hydrophobic β-turn does not appear to be a determinant of membrane association of DENND3. PH domains are well-known for their property to bind phosphatidylinositol (17Lemmon M.A. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and phosphoinositides.Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2007; (17233582): 81-9310.1042/BSS0740081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus tested for the association of the PHenn domain with an array of lipid species using the GST-PHenn fusion protein overlay assay with hydrophobic membrane strips spotted with various lipid species (Fig. S2C). As for GST, the GST-PHenn domain failed to bind any lipid species, whereas the GST-PH domain of PLC-δ1 bound to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as expected (18Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Specific and high-affinity binding of inositol phosphates to an isolated pleckstrin homology domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92 (7479822): 10472-1047610.1073/pnas.92.23.10472Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2C). This suggests that the PHenn domain of DENND3 does not possess lipid-binding activity. To investigate whether the hydrophobic β-turn is involved in the role of DENND3 in autophagy, we performed knockdown/rescue experiments. As shown previously (9Xu J. Fotouhi M. McPherson P.S. Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16 (25925668): 709-71810.15252/embr.201440006Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), upon starvation, reduced p62 levels and increased LC3 lipidation levels indicate the induction of autophagy (Fig. 2F, lanes 1 and 2). Knockdown of DENND3 compromises autophagy, as indicated by the reduced level of lipidated LC3 and the elevated level of p62 (Fig. 2F, lane 3). Importantly, the inhibited autophagy resulting from DENND3 knockdown is rescued with re-expression of wildtype DENND3 (Fig. 2F, lane 4), but not with the L857Q and L858Q mutant, which has compromised hydrophobicity at the β-turn of the PHenn domain (Fig. 2F, lane 5). This suggests that the hydrophobic β-turn is involved in the role of DENND3 in starvation-induced autophagy, supporting the hypothesis that, besides the intramolecular interaction, the β-turn interacts with an unknown binding partner when it is not occupied by the Ext-DENN region and that this interaction is required for the proper function of DENND3 in autophagy. Structure-based alignment using the Dali server (19Holm L. Rosenström P.

Schaller M.D. Eck M.J. Crystal structure of the FERM domain of focal adhesion kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 (16221668): 252-25910.1074/jbc.M509188200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. S3). FERM domains consist of three subdomains, a ubiquitin-like fold, an acyl-CoA–binding protein–like fold, and a PH domain fold (22Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. Structural basis of the membrane-targeting and unmasking mechanisms of the radixin FERM domain.EMBO J. 2000; 19 (10970839): 4449-446210.1093/emboj/19.17.4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). FERM domains are frequently found in actin-binding proteins, and it is reported that the isolated PH subdomain of FERM domains binds to filamentous actin (F-actin) (23Lee H.S. Bellin R.M. Walker D.L. Patel B. Powers P. Liu H. Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Liddington R.C. Volkmann N. Hanein D. Critchley D.R. Robson R.M. Characterization of an actin-binding site within the talin FERM domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343 (15465061): 771-78410.1016/j.jmb.2004.08.069Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether the PHenn domain of DENND3 binds to F-actin. Purified GST-PHenn domain, GST alone, or purified actinin, a known F-actin–binding protein, was incubated with purified, preassembled F-actin and then subjected to ultracentrifugation, which is capable of pelleting F-actin but not monomeric actin. After centrifugation in the absence of F-actin, purified GST, GST-PHenn domain, and actinin remained in the supernatant (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 3, and 13). In contrast, in the presence of F-actin, the DENND3 GST-PHenn domain sedimented (Fig. 3A, lane 10), as did actinin (Fig. 3A, lane 12), but GST remained in the supernatant (Fig. 3A, lane 8). Purified full-length DENND3 also co-sedimented with F-actin (Fig. 3B), and the GST-PHenn domain bound to endogenous actin from rat tissue lysates (Fig. 3C). Together, these data demonstrate that the PHenn domain is a novel actin-binding module. To investigate whether actin binding is required for the role of DENND3 in autophagy, we sought to map the interaction between actin and DENND3 through site-directed mutagenesis. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase interacts with F-actin through basic amino acids close to the N terminus of its PH domain (24Yao L. Janmey P. Frigeri L.G. Han W. Fujita J. Kawakami Y. Apgar J.R. Kawakami T. Pleckstrin homology domains interact with filamentous actin.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (10391917): 19752-1976110.1074/jbc.274.28.19752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We thus mutated surface-exposed Arg and Lys residues around the N-terminal region of the first β-sheet of the PHenn domain of DENND3. We screened for actin binding by pulldown experiments with GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 4A, 10 μg of the GST-PHenn domain with mutations at Lys-812, Arg-815, Lys-819, Arg-834, or Arg-844 has compromised actin binding compared with wildtype protein. In contrast, mutation of both Leu-857 and Leu-858 to glutamine in the β-turn of the PHenn domain does not influence binding (Fig. 4A, compare lane 3 with lane 9). Even with increased amounts of the GST-PHenn domain up to 30 μg, R815E and K819E still exhibit clear defects in binding to actin (Fig. 4B). We then performed actin sedimentation experiments with these mutants (Fig. 4C). Whereas the majority of wildtype PHenn domain and of the L857Q/L858Q mutant co-sediments with F-actin, the mutants of the basic residues have less co-sedimentation. Among these mutants, R844E, which resides on a loop connecting the first and second β-sheets, has only a subtle reduction of actin binding (Fig. 4, A and C). The basic residues with obvious defects in actin binding cluster on a surface of the PHenn domain, rendering a binding platform (Fig. 4D). To test the role of actin binding in autophagy, we performed knockdown/rescue experiments. As shown previously, knockdown of DENND3 counters the change of p62 and LC3 induced by starvation, indicating that autophagy is inhibited (Fig. 5A, lane 3). The compromised autophagy resulting from DENND3 knockdown is rescued with re-expression of wildtype DENND3 (Fig. 5A, lane 4), but not with the Arg-815 or Lys-819 mutants (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6). These data demonstrate that actin binding is required for the role of DENND3 in autophagy.Figure 5Actin binding is required for DENND3-mediated autophagy. A, defect in actin binding impairs DENND3-dependent autophagy. Cells were treated with control siRNA or with siRNA for human DENND3. Cells treated with DENND3 siRNA were subsequently mock-transfected or transfected with wildtype mouse DENND3 or mouse DENND3 with Arg-815/Lys-819 mutation. The cells were subsequently starved with EBSS, and then lysates were processed for Western blotting with anti-pSer-554 of DENND3, anti-FLAG, anti-p62, anti-LC3, or anti-GAPDH antibody. Relative p62 and LC3-II level were determined from three repeats. Bars, mean ± S.D. (error bars). Statistical analysis employed one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. *, p < 0.05; n.s., not significant. B, the DENND3 PHenn domain binds myosin. Rat lung lysates were incubated with GST, GST-PHenn domain 720–973 (codon-optimized construct), or GST-Rab12 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins specifically bound to the beads were processed for Western blotting with anti-myosin IIA antibody. C, actin binding is required for the DENND3 PHenn domain to interact with myosin IIA. Rat lung lysates were incubated with 30 μg of GST, GST-PHenn domain, or GST-PHenn domain with mutation at Lys-812, Arg-815, Lys-819, Arg-834, Arg-844, or Leu-857 and Leu-858 (L to Q) that was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins specifically bound to the beads were processed for Western blotting with anti-myosin IIA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Actin has essential roles in multiple aspects of autophagy, which includes providing tracks for myosin-based traffic (25Kast D.J. Dominguez R. The cytoskeleton-autophagy connection.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 (28441569): R318-R32610.1016/j.cub.2017.02.061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Previously, we had predicted that Rab12, the substrate of DENND3 that engages in autophagosome trafficking, associates with a motor protein to achieve its role in autophagy (9Xu J. Fotouhi M. McPherson P.S. Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16 (25925668): 709-71810.15252/embr.201440006Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because we identified the PHenn domain of DENND3 as a novel actin-binding module, we tested whether Rab12 binds to actin motor protein myosin. Among the three non-muscle myosins, IIA, IIB, and IIC, that we tested (26Conti M.A. Adelstein R.S. Nonmuscle myosin II moves in new directions.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121 (18096687): 11-1810.1242/jcs.007112Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), endogenous myosin IIA has robust binding with the GST-Rab12 fusion protein (Fig. 5B). In addition, we found that the GST-PHenn domain of DENND3 interacts with endogenous myosin IIA (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, PHenn domain mutants with defects in actin binding also have compromised interactions with myosin IIA (Fig. 5C), which suggests that actin may bridge the binding between DENND3 and myosin IIA. Upon starvation, ULK-mediated phosphorylation of DENND3 activates Rab12, which localizes at autophagosome and facilitates autophagosome trafficking (9Xu J. Fotouhi M. McPherson P.S. Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16 (25925668): 709-71810.15252/embr.201440006Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Considering that ULK-mediated activation of myosin II is also required for starvation-induced autophagy (27Tang H.W. Wang Y.B. Wang S.L. Wu M.H. Lin S.Y. Chen G.C. Atg1-mediated myosin II activation regulates autophagosome formation during starvation-induced autophagy.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21169990): 636-65110.1038/emboj.2010.338Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), autophagosome-associated Rab12 may traffic along actin through interacting with myosin IIA. In this way, this functional protein complex of myosin IIA, DENND3, and Rab12 lies downstream of ULK upon starvation. The close proximity within the protein complex may facilitate the immediate coupling of Rab12 with myosin IIA to transport autophagosome along actin to fuse with lysosome/endosome after Rab12 is recruited and activated by DENND3 during autophagy. The PH domain is well-known as a phosphatidylinositol lipid-binding module (17Lemmon M.A. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and phosphoinositides.Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2007; (17233582): 81-9310.1042/BSS0740081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, it has diverse functions in GEFs. For example, the PH domain of Ras-GRF binds to βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (28Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2792248346,"Modern biomedical research aims at drawing biological conclusions from large, highly complex biological datasets. It has become common practice to make extensive use of high-throughput technologies that produce big amounts of heterogeneous data. In addition to the ever-improving accuracy, methods are getting faster and cheaper, resulting in a steadily increasing need for scalable data management and easily accessible means of analysis. We present qPortal, a platform providing users with an intuitive way to manage and analyze quantitative biological data. The backend leverages a variety of concepts and technologies, such as relational databases, data stores, data models and means of data transfer, as well as front-end solutions to give users access to data management and easy-to-use analysis options. Users are empowered to conduct their experiments from the experimental design to the visualization of their results through the platform. Here, we illustrate the feature-rich portal by simulating a biomedical study based on publically available data. We demonstrate the software’s strength in supporting the entire project life cycle. The software supports the project design and registration, empowers users to do all-digital project management and finally provides means to perform analysis. We compare our approach to Galaxy, one of the most widely used scientific workflow and analysis platforms in computational biology. Application of both systems to a small case study shows the differences between a data-driven approach (qPortal) and a workflow-driven approach (Galaxy). qPortal, a one-stop-shop solution for biomedical projects offers up-to-date analysis pipelines, quality control workflows, and visualization tools. Through intensive user interactions, appropriate data models have been developed.

https://openalex.org/W2792863726,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. Development of resistance towards cytostatic drugs like the GBM standard drug temozolomide is a severe problem in GBM treatment. One potential source of GBM relapse could be so called cancer stem like cells (CSCs). These represent an undifferentiated subpopulation of cells with high potential for tumor initiation. Furthermore, it has been shown that differentiated GBM cells can regain CSC properties when exposed to continuous temozolomide treatment in vitro. In this study, treatment of several primary GBM cell lines with clinically relevant doses of temozolomide increased their tumorigenicity as determined by colony formation assays in soft agar. Increased tumorigenicity is a known property of CSCs. Hence, therapy options that specifically target CSCs are under investigation. CSCs appear to be particularly dependent on mitochondria biogenesis which may represent a useful target for CSC elimination. Toxicity towards mitochondria is a known side effect of several antibiotics. Thus, addition of antibiotics like doxycycline may represent a useful tool to inhibit CSCs in GBM. Here, we show that combining temozolomide treatment of primary GBM cells with doxycycline could counteract the increase of tumorigenicity induced by temozolomide treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2791306995,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of echogenic foci with comet-tail artifact in histologically proven thyroid nodules, and to determine the types of echogenic foci with comet-tail artifact that are associated with malignancy. We retrospectively analyzed the sonographic findings of echogenic foci with comet-tail artifact, present in thyroid nodules in 63 patients who underwent surgery for thyroid nodules at our institution between January 2016 and September 2016. The sonographic findings (appearance and background of echogenic foci, shape of comet-tail artifact) in benign and malignant nodules were compared. Seventy-one (7.4%) nodules with ultrasound finding of echogenic foci with comet-tail artifact were encountered in 962 thyroid nodules of 556 patients; 25 of these were benign, and 46 were malignant. Among the echogenic foci with comet-tail artifact categories, those (11/11, 100%) freely distributed in cystic components were all in benign nodules, whereas those (48/67, 71.6%) any part of echogenic foci or comet-tail artifact associated with solid components, were more common in malignant nodules (P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the appearance of echogenic foci and the shape of comet-tail between the benign and malignant nodules (P = 0.139, P = 0.626, respectively). Echogenic foci with comet-tail artifact freely distributed in cystic component may predict a benign nodule; those associated with solid components cannot be considered a benign finding."
https://openalex.org/W2790562669,"Purpose Higher background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) could be used for stratification of MRI screening programs since it might be related to a higher breast cancer risk. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to correlate BPE to patient and tumor characteristics in women with unilateral MRI-screen detected breast cancer who participated in an intermediate and high risk screening program. As BPE in the affected breast may be difficult to discern from enhancing cancer, we assumed that BPE in the contralateral breast is a representative measure for BPE in women with unilateral breast cancer. Materials and methods This retrospective study was approved by our local institutional board and a waiver for consent was granted. MR-examinations of women with unilateral breast cancers screen-detected on breast MRI were evaluated by two readers. BPE in the contralateral breast was rated according to BI-RADS. Univariate analyses were performed to study associations. Observer variability was computed. Results Analysis included 77 breast cancers in 76 patients (age: 48±9.8 years), including 62 invasive and 15 pure ductal carcinoma in-situ cases. A negative association between BPE and tumor grade (p≤0.016) and a positive association with progesterone status (p≤0.021) was found. The correlation was stronger when only considering invasive disease. Inter-reader agreement was substantial. Conclusion Lower BPE in the contralateral breast in women with unilateral breast cancer might be associated to higher tumor grade and progesterone receptor negativity. Great care should be taken using BPE for stratification of patients to tailored screening programs."
https://openalex.org/W2793229123,"Aging is associated with a large heterogeneity in the extent of age-related changes in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. All these functions can influence the performance in complex tasks like car driving. The present study aims to identify potential differences in underlying cognitive processes that may explain inter-individual variability in driving performance. Younger and older participants performed a one-hour monotonous driving task in a driving simulator under varying crosswind conditions, while behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded. Overall, younger and older drivers showed comparable driving performance (lane keeping). However, there was a large difference in driving lane variability within the older group. Dividing the older group in two subgroups with low vs. high driving lane variability revealed differences between the two groups in electrophysiological correlates of mental workload, consumption of mental resources, and activation and sustaining of attention: Older drivers with high driving lane variability showed higher frontal Alpha and Theta activity than older drivers with low driving lane variability and-with increasing crosswind-a more pronounced decrease in Beta activity. These results suggest differences in driving strategies of older and younger drivers, with the older drivers using either a rather proactive and alert driving strategy (indicated by low driving lane variability and lower Alpha and Beta activity), or a rather reactive strategy (indicated by high driving lane variability and higher Alpha activity)."
https://openalex.org/W2793579434,"Men outperform women in many athletic endeavors due to physiological and anatomical differences (e.g. larger and faster muscle); however, the observed sex differences in elite athletic performance are typically larger than expected, and may reflect sex-related differences in opportunity or incentives. As collegiate rowing in the United States has been largely incentivized for women over the last 20 years, but not men, the purpose of this study was to examine sex differences in elite rowing performance over that timeframe. Finishing times from grand finale races for collegiate championship on-water performances (n = 480) and junior indoor performances (n = 1,280) were compared between men and women across 20 years (1997-2016), weight classes (heavy vs. lightweight) and finishing place. Participation of the numbers of men and women rowers were also quantified across years. Men were faster than women across all finishing places, weight classes and years of competition and performance declined across finishing place for both men and women (P<0.001). Interestingly, the reduction in performance time across finishing place was greater (P<0.001) for collegiate men compared to women in the heavyweight division. This result is opposite to other sports (e.g. running and swimming), and to lightweight rowing in this study, which provides women fewer incentives than in heavyweight rowing. Correspondingly, participation in collegiate rowing has increased by ~113 women per year (P<0.001), with no change (P = 0.899) for collegiate men. These results indicate that increased participation and incentives within collegiate rowing for women vs. men contribute to sex differences in athletic performance."
https://openalex.org/W2793614471,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of exposure to a life-threatening event. Currently, pharmacological treatments are limited by high rates of relapse, and novel treatment approaches are needed. We have recently demonstrated that propranolol, a β-adrenergic antagonist, inhibited aversive memory reconsolidation in animals. Following this, in an open-label study 70% of patients with PTSD treated with propranolol during reactivation of traumatic memory exhibited full remission. However, the reason why 30% of these patients did not respond positively to propranolol treatment is still unclear. One of the major candidates as factor of treatment resistance is the patient's early-life traumatic history. To test the role of this factor, mice with pre- or postnatal stress are being tested in fear conditioning and in a new behavioral task, the ""city-like"", specifically designed as a mouse model of PTSD. After reactivation of the traumatic event, mice received propranolol injection to block the noradrenergic system during memory reconsolidation. Results show that, in the ""city-like"" test, control mice strongly avoided the shock compartment but also the compartments containing cues associated with the electric shocks. Injection of propranolol after reactivation greatly reduced the memory of the traumatic event, but this effect was not present when mice had received pre- or postnatal stress. Moreover, propranolol produced only a very weak effect in the fear conditioning test, and never changed the corticosterone level whatever the behavioral experiment. Taken together our results suggest that our new behavioural paradigm is well adapted to PTSD study in mice, and that early stress exposure may have an impact on propranolol PTSD treatment outcome. These data are critical to understanding the effect of propranolol treatment, in order to improve the therapeutic protocol currently used in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2783504718,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85 (Ag85) enzymes catalyze the transfer of mycolic acid (MA) from trehalose monomycolate to produce the mycolyl arabinogalactan (mAG) or trehalose dimycolate (TDM). These lipids define the protective mycomembrane of mycobacteria. The current model of substrate binding within the active sites of Ag85s for the production of TDM is not sterically and geometrically feasible; additionally, this model does not account for the production of mAG. Furthermore, this model does not address how Ag85s limit the hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate while catalyzing acyl transfer. To inform an updated model, we obtained an Ag85 acyl-enzyme intermediate structure that resembles the mycolated form. Here, we present a 1.45-Å X-ray crystal structure of M. tuberculosis Ag85C covalently modified by tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), an esterase inhibitor that suppresses M. tuberculosis growth and mimics structural attributes of MAs. The mode of covalent inhibition differs from that observed in the reversible inhibition of the human fatty-acid synthase by THL. Similarities between the Ag85-THL structure and previously determined Ag85C structures suggest that the enzyme undergoes structural changes upon acylation, and positioning of the peptidyl arm of THL limits hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme adduct. Molecular dynamics simulations of the modeled mycolated-enzyme form corroborate the structural analysis. From these findings, we propose an alternative arrangement of substrates that rectifies issues with the previous model and suggest a direct role for the β-hydroxy of MA in the second half-reaction of Ag85 catalysis. This information affords the visualization of a complete mycolyltransferase catalytic cycle."

However, data on the interaction of periodontal and respiratory health is limited. We aimed to evaluate whether periodontal health status, assessed by the Community Periodontal Index (CPI), was related to lung function among young and middle-aged adults in two Norwegian cohorts.Periodontal health status and lung function were measured among 656 participants in the Norwegian part of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECHRS III) and the RHINESSA offspring study. Each participant was given a CPI-index from 0 to 4 where higher values reflect poorer periodontal status. The association between CPI and lung function was estimated with linear regression adjusting for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, exercise, education, use of antibiotics, inhaled medication and corrected for clustering within families.Participants with CPI 3-4 had significantly lower FEV1/FVC ratio compared to participants with CPI 0, b (95% CI) = -0.032 (-0.055, -0.009). Poorer periodontal health was associated with a significant decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio with an adjusted regression coefficient for linear trend b (95% CI) = -0.009 (-0.015, -0.004) per unit increase in CPI. This negative association remained when excluding asthmatics and smokers (-0.014 (-0.022, -0,006)).Poorer periodontal health was associated with increasing airways obstruction in a relatively young, healthy population. The oral cavity is united with the airways and our findings indicate an opportunity to influence respiratory health by improving oral health."
https://openalex.org/W2783229337,"The western blotting technique is widely used to analyze protein expression levels and protein molecular weight. The chemiluminescence method is mainly used for detection due to its high sensitivity and ease of manipulation, but it is unsuitable for detailed analyses because it cannot be used to detect multiple proteins simultaneously. Recently, more attention has been paid to the fluorescence detection method because it is more quantitative and is suitable for the detection of multiple proteins simultaneously. However, fluorescence detection can be limited by poor image resolution and low detection sensitivity. Here, we describe a method to detect fluorescence in western blots using fluorescence microscopy to obtain high-resolution images. In this method, filters and fluorescent dyes are optimized to enhance detection sensitivity to a level similar to that of the chemiluminescence method."
https://openalex.org/W2791583389,"Background Globally, steatosis is the commonest type of liver pathology and is closely associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity is common in urban African females but no data is available on hepatic fat content in this population group when compared to other ethnic groups. The aim of this study was therefore to compare hepatic fat content in woman from different ethnic groups in South Africa and to characterise the principle determinants of liver fat. Materials and methods A convenience sample of 106 (48 Indian, 29 African and 29 Caucasian) female volunteers aged 20–60 years and having no history of cardiometabolic disorders were recruited. Hepatic fat was determined from CT scans using the liver-spleen attenuation ratio (LAR), which decreases with increasing levels of hepatic fat. Anthropometric and cardiometabolic parameters were measured with insulin resistance determined using the HOMA index and dysglycaemia defined as fasting glucose ≥5.60 mmol/L. Results The African subjects had significantly lower hepatic fat content (LAR as median [interquartile range]: 1.35 [1.28, 1.41]) than the Indian (1.22 [1.10, 1.35]; p<0.005) and Caucasian (1.27 [1.16, 1.33]; p<0.05) females even though they had significantly higher BMIs than both groups (p<0.0005 and p<0.05, respectively). Linear regression showed that: subcutaneous abdominal fat was a significant (unstandardised β = 0.007; p = 0.03) negative, whilst insulin resistance (β = -0.97; p = 0.01) and dysglycaemia (β = -3.58; p = 0.01) were significant positive determinants of liver fat; higher hepatic fat levels in subjects with the metabolic syndrome were explained by insulin resistance and dysglycaemia. Discussion African ethnicity is associated with low liver fat content. Subcutaneous abdominal fat protects against steatosis, possibly by acting as a triglyceride reservoir. Insulin resistance and dysglycaemia lead to greater hepatic fat deposition and explain higher liver fat levels in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. These observations must be further investigated in longitudinal surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2791855320,"The use of glyphosate, as a post-emergence broad-spectrum herbicide in genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant (GT) cotton, supposes a big change in weed management programs with respect to a conventional regime. Thus, alterations in arable flora and arthropod fauna must be considered when evaluating their potential impacts. A 3-year farm-scale study was conducted in a 2-ha GT cotton crop, in southern Spain, to compare the effects of conventional and glyphosate herbicide regimes on weed abundance and diversity and their consequences for ground-dwelling predators. Surveys reveal that weed density was relatively low within all treatments with a few dominant species, with significantly higher weed densities and modifications of the floristic composition in glyphosate-treated plots that led to an increase in the abundance of Portulaca oleracea and to a reduction in plant diversity. The activity-density of the main predatory arthropod taxa (spiders, ground beetles, rove beetles and earwigs) varied among years, but no significant differences were obtained between conventional and glyphosate herbicide regimes. However, significant differences between treatments were obtained for ground beetles species richness and diversity, being higher under the glyphosate herbicide regime, and a positive correlation with weed density could be established for both parameters. The implications of these findings to weed control in GT cotton are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2783818376,"The honeybee olfactory pathway comprises an intriguing pattern of convergence and divergence: ~60.000 olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) convey olfactory information on ~900 projection neurons (PN) in the antennal lobe (AL). To transmit this information reliably, PNs employ relatively high spiking frequencies with complex patterns. PNs project via a dual olfactory pathway to the mushroom bodies (MB). This pathway comprises the medial (m-ALT) and the lateral antennal lobe tract (l-ALT). PNs from both tracts transmit information from a wide range of similar odors, but with distinct differences in coding properties. In the MBs, PNs form synapses with many Kenyon cells (KC) that encode odors in a spatially and temporally sparse way. The transformation from complex information coding to sparse coding is a well-known phenomenon in insect olfactory coding. Intrinsic neuronal properties as well as GABAergic inhibition are thought to contribute to this change in odor representation. In the present study, we identified intrinsic neuronal properties promoting coding differences between PNs and KCs using in-situ patch-clamp recordings in the intact brain. We found very prominent K+ currents in KCs clearly differing from the PN currents. This suggests that odor coding differences between PNs and KCs may be caused by differences in their specific ion channel properties. Comparison of ionic currents of m- and l-ALT PNs did not reveal any differences at a qualitative level."

In this study, the mRNA of a fusion transposase derived from the pESNT-PBase plasmid and a pBHSA plasmid containing the HSA gene under the control of a fibroin light chain (FL) promoter were co-injected into fertilized eggs. Fifty-six transgenic silkworm pedigrees expressing theexogenous recombinant HSA (rHSA) in the posterior silk glands (PSGs) with stable inheritance were successfully obtained. The SDS-PAGE and Western blot results confirmed that the rHSA was secreted into the transgenic silkworm cocoon, and the rHSA could be easily extracted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In our research, the isolated highest amount rHSA constituted up to 29.1% of the total soluble protein of the cocoon shell, indicating that the transgenic silkworm produced an average of 17.4 μg/mg of rHSA in the cocoon shell. The production of soluble rHSA in the PSGs by means of generating transgenic silkworms is a novel approach, whereby a large amount of virus-free and functional HSA can be produced through the simple rearing of silkworms."
https://openalex.org/W2792826980,"The association of anti-EGFR to gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) chemotherapy did not improve survival in biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) patients. Multiple mechanisms might be involved in the resistance to anti-EGFR. Here, we explored the mutation profile of EGFR extracellular domain (ECD), of tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), and its amplification status. EGFR mutational status of exons 12, 18–21 was analyzed in 57 tumors by Sanger sequencing. EGFR amplification was evaluated in 37 tumors by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH). Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated using the log-rank test. Six patients had mutations in exon 12 of EGFR ECD and 7 in EGFR TKD. Neither EGFR ECD nor TKD mutations affected progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in the entire population. In the panitumumab plus GEMOX (P-GEMOX) arm, ECD mutated patients had a worse OS, while EGFR TKD mutated patients had a trend towards shorter PFS and OS. Overall, the presence of mutations in EGFR or in its transducers did not affect PFS or OS, while the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) mutated patients had a worse prognosis compared to WT. Nineteen out of 37 tumors were EGFR amplified, but the amplification did not correlate with survival. ECC EGFR amplified patients had improved OS, whereas the amplification significantly correlated with poor PFS (p = 0.03) in gallbladder carcinoma patients. The high molecular heterogeneity is a predominant feature of BTC: the alterations found in this work seem to have a prognostic impact rather than a predictive role towards anti-EGFR therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2784150934,"Platelets regulate vascular integrity by secreting a host of molecules that promote hemostasis and its sequelae. Given the importance of platelet exocytosis, it is critical to understand how it is controlled. The t-SNAREs, SNAP-23 and syntaxin-11, lack classical transmembrane domains (TMDs), yet both are associated with platelet membranes and redistributed into cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts when platelets are activated. Using metabolic labeling and hydroxylamine (HA)/HCl treatment, we showed that both contain thioester-linked acyl groups. Mass spectrometry mapping further showed that syntaxin-11 was modified on cysteine 275, 279, 280, 282, 283, and 285, and SNAP-23 was modified on cysteine 79, 80, 83, 85, and 87. Interestingly, metabolic labeling studies showed incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the t-SNAREs increased although the protein levels were unchanged, suggesting that acylation turns over on the two t-SNAREs in resting platelets. Exogenously added fatty acids did compete with [3H]palmitate for t-SNARE labeling. To determine the effects of acylation, we measured aggregation, ADP/ATP release, as well as P-selectin exposure in platelets treated with the acyltransferase inhibitor cerulenin or the thioesterase inhibitor palmostatin B. We found that cerulenin pretreatment inhibited t-SNARE acylation and platelet function in a dose- and time-dependent manner whereas palmostatin B had no detectable effect. Interestingly, pretreatment with palmostatin B blocked the inhibitory effects of cerulenin, suggesting that maintaining the acylation state is important for platelet function. Thus, our work shows that t-SNARE acylation is actively cycling in platelets and suggests that the enzymes regulating protein acylation could be potential targets to control platelet exocytosis in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2793199415,"Activation of CD4 T cells leads to their metabolic reprogramming which includes enhanced glycolysis, catalyzed through hexokinase enzymes. Studies in some systems indicate that the HK2 isoform is the most up regulated isoform in activated T cells and in this report the relevance of this finding is evaluated in an infectious disease model. Genetic ablation of HK2 was achieved in only T cells and the outcome was evaluated by measures of T cell function. Our results show that CD4 T cells from both HK2 depleted and WT animals displayed similar responses to in vitro stimulation and yielded similar levels of Th1, Treg or Th17 subsets when differentiated in vitro. A modest increase in the levels of proliferation was observed in CD4 T cells lacking HK2. Deletion of HK2 led to enhanced levels of HK1 indicative of a compensatory mechanism. Finally, CD4 T cell mediated immuno-inflammatory responses to a virus infection were similar between WT and HK2 KO animals. The observations that the expression of HK2 appears non-essential for CD4 T cell responses against virus infections is of interest since it suggests that targeting HK2 for cancer therapy may not have untoward effects on CD4 T cell mediated immune response against virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2784969714,"Aminotransferases are pyridoxal 5′-phosphate–dependent enzymes that catalyze reversible transamination reactions between amino acids and α-keto acids, and are important for the cellular metabolism of nitrogen. Many bacterial and eukaryotic ω-aminotransferases that use l-ornithine (Orn), l-lysine (Lys), or γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) have been identified and characterized, but the corresponding enzymes from archaea are unknown. Here, we examined the activity and function of TK2101, a gene annotated as a GABA aminotransferase, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis. We overexpressed the TK2101 gene in T. kodakarensis and purified and characterized the recombinant protein and found that it displays only low levels of GABA aminotransferase activity. Instead, we observed a relatively high ω-aminotransferase activity with l-Orn and l-Lys as amino donors. The most preferred amino acceptor was 2-oxoglutarate. To examine the physiological role of TK2101, we created a TK2101 gene–disruption strain (ΔTK2101), which was auxotrophic for proline. Growth comparison with the parent strain KU216 and the biochemical characteristics of the protein strongly suggested that TK2101 encodes an Orn aminotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of l-Pro. Phylogenetic comparisons of the TK2101 sequence with related sequences retrieved from the databases revealed the presence of several distinct protein groups, some of which having no experimentally studied member. We conclude that TK2101 is part of a novel group of Orn aminotransferases that are widely distributed at least in the genus Thermococcus, but perhaps also throughout the Archaea."
https://openalex.org/W2789531717,"The power system always has several variations in its profile due to random load changes or environmental effects such as device switching effects when generating further transients. Thus, an accurate mathematical model is important because most system parameters vary with time. Curve modeling of power generation is a significant tool for evaluating system performance, monitoring and forecasting. Several numerical techniques compete to fit the curves of empirical data such as wind, solar, and demand power rates. This paper proposes a new modified methodology presented as a parametric technique to determine the system's modeling equations based on the Bode plot equations and the vector fitting (VF) algorithm by fitting the experimental data points. The modification is derived from the familiar VF algorithm as a robust numerical method. This development increases the application range of the VF algorithm for modeling not only in the frequency domain but also for all power curves. Four case studies are addressed and compared with several common methods. From the minimal RMSE, the results show clear improvements in data fitting over other methods. The most powerful features of this method is the ability to model irregular or randomly shaped data and to be applied to any algorithms that estimating models using frequency-domain data to provide state-space or transfer function for the model."
https://openalex.org/W2791842358,"Purpose The aims of this study are to describe the epidemiological characteristics of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions in a private hospital in Brazil and to determine trends in medical practice for comparison with previous studies. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the anterior cruciate ligament institutional register to obtain data from all patients who underwent primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction from July 2014 to June 2016. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sample. Specific statistical tests were used to assess associations between the meniscal lesion and other variables. Results During the study period, 72.6% out of 500 patients were male. The mean age at surgery was 35.1 years. The mean age was higher among females than among males (37.3 ± 12.1 vs 34.3 ± 10.8 years). The median time from injury to surgery was 44 days. The most common femoral and tibial fixations used were suspensory fixation (60.8%) and interference screw (96%), respectively. The most commonly used graft was hamstring tendon (70.2%), followed by bone-patellar tendon-bone (28.8%). A meniscal lesion was noted in 44.8% of cases. Partial meniscectomy was performed in 69.5% of meniscal lesions, and meniscal repair was performed in 14.1% of lesions. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.4 days. The proportion of men in the group of patients with an associated meniscal lesion was higher than that in the group of patients without a meniscal lesion (p = 0.007). Conclusions In this study, we identified that the vast majority of surgeries were performed in male patients in all age groups, and patients older than 30 years and with a short time from injury to surgery predominated. Concerning surgical technique, we noted a low rate of meniscal repair and a higher preference for the use of hamstring graft and suspensory fixation on the femoral side."
https://openalex.org/W2791845915,"SUMO proteases of the SENP/Ulp family are master regulators of both sumoylation and desumoylation and regulate SUMO homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. SUMO conjugates rapidly increase in response to cellular stress, including nutrient starvation, hypoxia, osmotic stress, DNA damage, heat shock, and other proteotoxic stressors. Nevertheless, little is known about the regulation and targeting of SUMO proteases during stress. To this end we have undertaken a detailed comparison of the SUMO-binding activity of the budding yeast protein Ulp1 (ScUlp1) and its ortholog in the thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus, KmUlp1. We find that the catalytic UD domains of both ScUlp1 and KmUlp1 show a high degree of sequence conservation, complement a ulp1Δ mutant in vivo, and process a SUMO precursor in vitro. Next, to compare the SUMO-trapping features of both SUMO proteases we produced catalytically inactive recombinant fragments of the UD domains of ScUlp1 and KmUlp1, termed ScUTAG and KmUTAG respectively. Both ScUTAG and KmUTAG were able to efficiently bind a variety of purified SUMO isoforms and bound immobilized SUMO1 with nanomolar affinity. However, KmUTAG showed a greatly enhanced ability to bind SUMO and SUMO-modified proteins in the presence of oxidative, temperature and other stressors that induce protein misfolding. We also investigated whether a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in the UD domain of KmULP1 that is not conserved in ScUlp1 may contribute to the SUMO-binding properties of KmUTAG. In summary, our data reveal important details about how SUMO proteases target and bind their sumoylated substrates, especially under stress conditions. We also show that the robust pan-SUMO binding features of KmUTAG can be exploited to detect and study SUMO-modified proteins in cell culture systems."
https://openalex.org/W2783126637,"Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterised by the recurrent and unpredictable interruptions of normal brain function, called epileptic seizures. The present study attempts to derive new diagnostic indices which may delineate between ictal and interictal states of epilepsy. To achieve this, the nonlinear modeling approach of global principal dynamic modes (PDMs) is adopted to examine the functional connectivity of the temporal and frontal lobes with the occipital brain segment using an ensemble of paediatric EEGs having the presence of epileptic seizure. The distinct spectral characteristics of global PDMs are found to be in line with the neural rhythms of brain dynamics. Moreover, we find that the linear trends of associated nonlinear functions (ANFs) associated with the 2nd and 4th global PDMs (representing delta, theta and alpha bands) of Fp1-F3 may differentiate between ictal and interictal states of epilepsy. These findings suggest that global PDMs and their associated ANFs may offer potential utility as diagnostic neural measures for ictal and interictal states of epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2783276827,"Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of daily text messages as a means to improve caregivers’ adherence to infant micronutrient powder (MNP) in rural Shaanxi Province of China. Methodology 638 infants aged 6–11 months in 234 villages were involved in a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT). All caregivers were given free infant MNP packets at baseline in April 2013 and the follow-up survey was in July 2013. We randomly assigned 318 infants in 117 villages to treatment group (receiving daily text message) and 320 infants in the other 117 villages as control group. Results On average, daily text messages increased the number of MNP packets fed (marginal effect = 4.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.16, 9.10). The text message is more likely to increase the consumption of MNP packets if the primary caregiver was the mother (marginal effect = 12.19; 95% CI = 0.69, 23.68). Receiving the text message appears to significantly increase the likelihood of full adherence when the primary caregiver can either check (odds ratio = 2.93; 95% CI = 1.34, 6.40) or knows how to send (odds ratio = 3.26; 95% CI = 1.53, 6.97) text messages. Conclusion Daily text messages improved the consumption of infant MNP packets. However, the impact was not large enough to increase the probability of caregivers being fully adherent to the feeding instruction, which is to feed 5–7 packets per week as recommended.

https://openalex.org/W2793408950,"Expression of the opioid peptide genes proopiomelanocortin (Pomc), proenkephalin (Penk), and prodynorphin (Pdyn), in immune cells plays a key role in endogenous pain control. In a rat model of painful unilateral paw inflammation, we isolated cells from popliteal lymph nodes and evaluated the role of CpG island C5-methylation on the transcriptional activation of those genes. Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation, we sorted gDNA into methylated (me) and non-me fractions and then determined the CpG island methylation status of each fraction via quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR). In silico analysis by MethPrimer software identified one CpG island in Pdyn and three each in Pomc and Penk. No substantial changes in C5-methylation of any gene were observed. In conclusion, the CpG island methylation status does not seem to be a key regulator of opioid gene activation in immune cells during peripheral tissue inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2783133604,"Non-uniform shortening of the action potential duration (APD90) in different myocardial regions upon heart rate acceleration can set abnormal repolarization gradients and promote arrhythmia. This study examined whether spatial heterogeneities in APD90 restitution can be amplified by drugs with clinically proved proarrhythmic potential (dofetilide, quinidine, procainamide, and flecainide) and, if so, whether these effects can translate to the appropriate changes of the ECG metrics of ventricular repolarization, such as JT intervals. In isolated, perfused guinea-pig heart preparations, monophasic action potentials and volume-conducted ECG were recorded at progressively increased pacing rates. The APD90 measured at distinct ventricular sites, as well as the JTpeak and JTend values were plotted as a function of preceding diastolic interval, and the maximum slopes of the restitution curves were determined at baseline and upon drug administration. Dofetilide, quinidine, and procainamide reverse rate-dependently prolonged APD90 and steepened the restitution curve, with effects being greater at the endocardium than epicardium, and in the right ventricular (RV) vs. the left ventricular (LV) chamber. The restitution slope was increased to a greater extent for the JTend vs. the JTpeak interval. In contrast, flecainide reduced the APD90 restitution slope at LV epicardium without producing effect at LV endocardium and RV epicardium, and reduced the JTpeak restitution slope without changing the JTend restitution. Nevertheless, with all agents, these effects translated to the amplified epicardial-to-endocardial and the LV-to-RV non-uniformities in APD90 restitution, paralleled by the increased JTend vs. JTpeak difference in the restitution slope. In summary, these findings suggest that arrhythmic drug profiles are partly attributable to the accentuated regional heterogeneities in APD90 restitution, which can be indirectly determined through ECG assessments of the JTend vs. JTpeak dynamics at variable pacing rates."
https://openalex.org/W2785129179,"Background KANSL1 haploinsufficiency causes Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS), characterized by dysmorphic features and intellectual disability; amiable personality, congenital malformations and seizures also commonly occur. The epilepsy phenotypic spectrum in KdVS is broad, but most individuals have focal seizures with some having a phenotype resembling the self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood (SFEC). We hypothesized that variants in KANSL1 contribute to pathogenesis of SFEC. Materials and methods We screened KANSL1 for single nucleotide variants in 90 patients with SFEC. We then screened a cohort of 208 patients with two specific SFEC syndromes, childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS) and atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS) for KANSL1 variants. The second cohort was also used to evaluate minor allelic variants that appeared overrepresented in the initial cohort. Results One variant, p.Lys104Thr, was predicted damaging and appeared overrepresented in our 90-patient cohort compared to Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) allele frequency (0.217 to 0.116, with no homozygotes in gnomAD). However, there was no difference in p.Lys104Thr allele frequency in the follow-up CECTS/ACECTS cohort and controls. Four rare KANSL1 variants of uncertain significance were identified in the CECTS/ACECTS cohort. Discussion Our data do not support a major role for KANSL1 variants in pathogenesis of SFEC."
https://openalex.org/W2791259925,"The inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors are implicated in numerous physiological processes, including cognition and inhibition of neurotransmission, rendering them important molecular targets for many classes of drugs. Functionally, the entire GABAAR family of receptors can be subdivided into phasic, fast acting synaptic receptors, composed of α-, β- and γ-subunits, and tonic extrasynaptic receptors, many of which contain the δ-subunit in addition to α- and β-subunits. Whereas the subunit arrangement of the former group is agreed upon, that of the αβδ GABAARs remains unresolved by electrophysiological and pharmacological research. To resolve such issues will require biophysical techniques that demand quantities of receptor that have been previously unavailable. Therefore, we have engineered a stable cell line with tetracycline inducible expression of human α4-, β3- and N-terminally Flag-tagged δ-subunits. This cell line achieved a specific activity between 15 and 20 pmol [3H]muscimol sites/mg of membrane protein, making it possible to obtain 1 nmole of purified α4β3δ GABAAR from sixty 15–cm culture dishes. When induced, these cells exhibited agonist–induced currents with characteristics comparable to those previously reported for this receptor and a pharmacology that included strong modulation by etomidate and the δ-subunit-specific ligand, DS2. Immunoaffinity purification and reconstitution in CHAPS/asolectin micelles resulted in the retention of equilibrium allosteric interactions between the separate agonist, anesthetic and DS2 sites. Moreover, all three subunits retained glycosylation. The establishment of this well–characterized cell line will allow molecular level studies of tonic receptors to be undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W2793591709,"Optic flow patterns generated by self-motion relative to the stationary environment result in congruent visual-vestibular self-motion signals. Incongruent signals can arise due to object motion, vestibular dysfunction, or artificial stimulation, which are less common. Hence, we are predominantly exposed to congruent rather than incongruent visual-vestibular stimulation. If the brain takes advantage of this probabilistic association, we expect observers to be more sensitive to visual optic flow that is congruent with ongoing vestibular stimulation. We tested this expectation by measuring the motion coherence threshold, which is the percentage of signal versus noise dots, necessary to detect an optic flow pattern. Observers seated on a hexapod motion platform in front of a screen experienced two sequential intervals. One interval contained optic flow with a given motion coherence and the other contained noise dots only. Observers had to indicate which interval contained the optic flow pattern. The motion coherence threshold was measured for detection of laminar and radial optic flow during leftward/rightward and fore/aft linear self-motion, respectively. We observed no dependence of coherence thresholds on vestibular congruency for either radial or laminar optic flow. Prior studies using similar methods reported both decreases and increases in coherence thresholds in response to congruent vestibular stimulation; our results do not confirm either of these prior reports. While methodological differences may explain the diversity of results, another possibility is that motion coherence thresholds are mediated by neural populations that are either not modulated by vestibular stimulation or that are modulated in a manner that does not depend on congruency."
https://openalex.org/W2782921033,"Histones H1 or linker histones are highly dynamic proteins that diffuse throughout the cell nucleus and associate with chromatin (DNA and associated proteins). This binding interaction of histone H1 with the chromatin is thought to regulate chromatin organization and DNA accessibility to transcription factors and has been proven to involve a kinetic process characterized by a population that associates weakly with chromatin and rapidly dissociates and another population that resides at a binding site for up to several minutes before dissociating. When considering differences between these two classes of interactions in a mathematical model for the purpose of describing and quantifying the dynamics of histone H1, it becomes apparent that there could be several assembly pathways that explain the kinetic data obtained in living cells. In this work, we model these different pathways using systems of reaction-diffusion equations and carry out a model comparison analysis using FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) experimental data from different histone H1 variants to determine the most feasible mechanism to explain histone H1 binding to chromatin. The analysis favors four different chromatin assembly pathways for histone H1 which share common features and provide meaningful biological information on histone H1 dynamics. We show, using perturbation analysis, that the explicit consideration of high- and low-affinity associations of histone H1 with chromatin in the favored assembly pathways improves the interpretation of histone H1 experimental FRAP data. To illustrate the results, we use one of the favored models to assess the kinetic changes of histone H1 after core histone hyperacetylation, and conclude that this post-transcriptional modification does not affect significantly the transition of histone H1 from a weakly bound state to a tightly bound state."
https://openalex.org/W2793017822,"Recently, a new approach has been introduced that leverages and over-provisions energy storage devices (ESDs) in data centers for performing power capping and facilitating capex/opex reductions, without performance overhead. To fully realize the potential benefits of the hierarchical ESD structure, we propose a comprehensive design, control, and provisioning framework including (i) designing power delivery architecture supporting hierarchical ESD structure and hybrid ESDs for some levels, as well as (ii) control and provisioning of the hierarchical ESD structure including run-time ESD charging/discharging control and design-time determination of ESD types, homogeneous/hybrid options, ESD provisioning at each level.

https://openalex.org/W2782796367,"To investigate the molecular mechanisms of sub-acutely aging and demonstrate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at the Guanyuan (CV 4), Zusanli (ST 36) and Baihui (DU 20) acupoint on the sub-acutely aging brain, cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics analyses were carried out. Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were selected and randomly divided into three groups: the control group (C), the sub-acutely aging model group (M) and the electroacupuncture group (M+EA). Sub-acutely aging model rats were obtained by D-galactose s.c. injection continuously for 40 days. Total RNA was extracted from the hippocampus area of brains in three groups for cDNA microarrays. The data of different groups were compared and analyzed by differential expression analysis, Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and quantitative real-time PCR. According to the results, 4052 DE genes were identified in our study. Among them, there were 3079 differentially expressed (DE) genes between group M and group C, and these genes are associated with the aging of rats. Moreover, 983 genes were expressed differently in group M+EA compared with group M, revealing that points stimuli could regulate gene expression in brain with aging. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and KEGG enrichment were performed to further classify the differential expression genes. Important GO terms and KEGG pathways connected with sub-acutely aging EA effects were identified. At last, 3 significant differentially expressed genes were selected for real-time quantitative PCR to clarify the cDNA microarray results. In conclusion, the cDNA microarray data first compared and analyzed the differences of gene expression profile in the hippocampus of rats in different groups, which contribute to our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of EA towards sub-acutely aging."
https://openalex.org/W2793026202,"With new strains of Acinetobacter baumannii undergoing genomic analysis, it has been possible to define regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs), encoding specific adaptive elements. For a selected RGP from a community-derived isolate of A. baumannii, we outline sequences compatible with biosynthetic machinery of surface polysaccharides, specifically enzymes utilized in the dehydration and conversion of UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-D-GlcNAc). We have determined the crystal structure of one of these, the epimerase Ab-WbjB. This dehydratase belongs to the 'extended' short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, related in fold to previously characterised enzymes CapE and FlaA1. Our 2.65Å resolution structure of Ab-WbjB shows a hexamer, organised into a trimer of chain pairs, with coenzyme NADP+ occupying each chain. Specific active-site interactions between each coenzyme and a lysine quaternary group of a neighbouring chain interconnect adjacent dimers, so stabilising the hexameric form. We show UDP-GlcNAc to be a specific substrate for Ab-WbjB, with binding evident by ITC (Ka = 0.23 μmol-1). The sequence of Ab-WbjB shows variation from the consensus active-site motifs of many SDR enzymes, demonstrating a likely catalytic role for a specific threonine sidechain (as an alternative to tyrosine) in the canonical active site chemistry of these epimerases."
