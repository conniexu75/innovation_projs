https://openalex.org/W4212967725,"The animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown despite reports of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Asian Rhinolophus bats1–4, including the closest virus from R. affinis, RaTG13 (refs. 5,6), and pangolins7–9. SARS-CoV-2 has a mosaic genome, to which different progenitors contribute. The spike sequence determines the binding affinity and accessibility of its receptor-binding domain to the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is responsible for host range10–12. SARS-CoV-2 progenitor bat viruses genetically close to SARS-CoV-2 and able to enter human cells through a human ACE2 (hACE2) pathway have not yet been identified, although they would be key in understanding the origin of the epidemic. Here we show that such viruses circulate in cave bats living in the limestone karstic terrain in northern Laos, in the Indochinese peninsula. We found that the receptor-binding domains of these viruses differ from that of SARS-CoV-2 by only one or two residues at the interface with ACE2, bind more efficiently to the hACE2 protein than that of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Wuhan from early human cases, and mediate hACE2-dependent entry and replication in human cells, which is inhibited by antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. None of these bat viruses contains a furin cleavage site in the spike protein. Our findings therefore indicate that bat-borne SARS-CoV-2-like viruses that are potentially infectious for humans circulate in Rhinolophus spp. in the Indochinese peninsula. A study reports the detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in Laotian cave-dwelling bats that are also demonstrated to infect human cells through the ACE2 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4213377513,"Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and 'snowflake' configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained 'droplets' on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied."
https://openalex.org/W4212980693,"Einstein's theory of general relativity states that clocks at different gravitational potentials tick at different rates relative to lab coordinates-an effect known as the gravitational redshift1. As fundamental probes of space and time, atomic clocks have long served to test this prediction at distance scales from 30 centimetres to thousands of kilometres2-4. Ultimately, clocks will enable the study of the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics once they become sensitive to the finite wavefunction of quantum objects oscillating in curved space-time. Towards this regime, we measure a linear frequency gradient consistent with the gravitational redshift within a single millimetre-scale sample of ultracold strontium. Our result is enabled by improving the fractional frequency measurement uncertainty by more than a factor of 10, now reaching 7.6 × 10-21. This heralds a new regime of clock operation necessitating intra-sample corrections for gravitational perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W4213222004,"Ever more stringent regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from transportation motivate efforts to revisit materials used for vehicles. High-strength Al-alloys often used in aircrafts could help reduce the weight of automobiles, but are susceptible to environmental degradation. Hydrogen (H) ""embrittlement"" is often pointed as the main culprit, however, the mechanisms underpinning failure are elusive: atomic-scale analysis of H inside an alloy remains a challenge, and this prevents deploying alloy design strategies to enhance the materials' durability. Here we successfully performed near-atomic scale analysis of H trapped in second-phase particles and at grain boundaries in a high-strength 7xxx Al-alloy. We used these observations to guide atomistic ab-initio calculations which show that the co-segregation of alloying elements and H favours grain boundary decohesion, while the strong partitioning of H into the second-phases removes solute H from the matrix, hence preventing H-embrittlement. Our insights further advance the mechanistic understanding of H-assisted embrittlement in Al-alloys, emphasizing the role of H-traps in retarding cracking and guiding new alloy design."
https://openalex.org/W4213197433,"The ambition and effectiveness of climate policies will be essential in determining greenhouse gas emissions and, as a consequence, the scale of climate change impacts1,2. However, the socio-politico-technical processes that will determine climate policy and emissions trajectories are treated as exogenous in almost all climate change modelling3,4. Here we identify relevant feedback processes documented across a range of disciplines and connect them in a stylized model of the climate-social system. An analysis of model behaviour reveals the potential for nonlinearities and tipping points that are particularly associated with connections across the individual, community, national and global scales represented. These connections can be decisive for determining policy and emissions outcomes. After partly constraining the model parameter space using observations, we simulate 100,000 possible future policy and emissions trajectories. These fall into 5 clusters with warming in 2100 ranging between 1.8 °C and 3.6 °C above the 1880-1910 average. Public perceptions of climate change, the future cost and effectiveness of mitigation technologies, and the responsiveness of political institutions emerge as important in explaining variation in emissions pathways and therefore the constraints on warming over the twenty-first century."
https://openalex.org/W4212945630,"Rapid progress in the precision and accuracy of optical atomic clocks over the last decade has advanced the frontiers of timekeeping, metrology, and quantum science. However, the stabilities of most optical clocks remain limited by the local oscillator rather than the atoms themselves, leaving room for further progress. Here we implement a ""multiplexed"" one-dimensional optical lattice clock, in which spatially-resolved, movable ensembles of ultra-cold strontium atoms are trapped in the same optical lattice, interrogated simultaneously by a shared clock laser, and read-out in parallel. By performing synchronized Ramsey interrogations of ensemble pairs we observe atom-atom coherence times up to 26 seconds, a 270-fold improvement over the atom-laser coherence time, demonstrate a relative stability of $9.7(4)\times10^{-18}/\sqrt{\tau}$ (where $\tau$ is the averaging time in seconds), and reach a fractional uncertainty of $8.9(3)\times 10^{-20}$ after 3.3 hours of averaging. These results demonstrate that applications requiring ultra-high-precision comparisons between optical atomic clocks need not be limited by the stability of the local oscillator. With multiple ensemble pairs, we realize a miniaturized clock network consisting of 6 atom ensembles, resulting in 15 unique pairwise clock comparisons with relative stabilities below $3\times10^{-17}/\sqrt{\tau}$. Finally, we demonstrate the capability to simultaneously load spatially-resolved, heterogeneous ensemble pairs of all four stable isotopes of strontium in a lattice. The unique capabilities offered by this platform pave the way for future studies of precision isotope shift measurements, spatially resolved characterization of limiting clock systematics, development of clock-based gravitational wave and dark matter detectors, and novel tests of relativity including measurements of the gravitational redshift at sub-centimeter scales."

Terpene biosynthesis is a case study of how the logic of a modular design can lead to diverse structures with unparalleled efficiency. This work leverages modern nickel-catalyzed electrochemical sp 2 –sp 3 decarboxylative coupling reactions, enabled by silver nanoparticle–modified electrodes, to intuitively assemble terpene natural products and complex polyenes by using simple modular building blocks. The step change in efficiency of this approach is exemplified through the scalable preparation of 13 complex terpenes, which minimized protecting group manipulations, functional group interconversions, and redox fluctuations. The mechanistic aspects of the essential functionalized electrodes are studied in depth through a variety of spectroscopic and analytical techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4212810721,"The energy products of oil and gas majors have contributed significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and planetary warming over the past century. Decarbonizing the global economy by mid-century to avoid dangerous climate change thus cannot occur without a profound transformation of their fossil fuel-based business models. Recently, several majors are increasingly discussing clean energy and climate change, pledging decarbonization strategies, and investing in alternative energies. Some even claim to be transforming into clean energy companies. Given a history of obstructive climate actions and ""greenwashing"", there is a need to objectively evaluate current and historical decarbonization efforts and investment behavior. This study focuses on two American (Chevron, ExxonMobil) and two European majors (BP, Shell). Using data collected over 2009-2020, we comparatively examine the extent of decarbonization and clean energy transition activity from three perspectives: (1) keyword use in annual reports (discourse); (2) business strategies (pledges and actions); and (3) production, expenditures and earnings for fossil fuels along with investments in clean energy (investments). We found a strong increase in discourse related to ""climate"", ""low-carbon"" and ""transition"", especially by BP and Shell. Similarly, we observed increasing tendencies toward strategies related to decarbonization and clean energy. But these are dominated by pledges rather than concrete actions. Moreover, the financial analysis reveals a continuing business model dependence on fossil fuels along with insignificant and opaque spending on clean energy. We thus conclude that the transition to clean energy business models is not occurring, since the magnitude of investments and actions does not match discourse. Until actions and investment behavior are brought into alignment with discourse, accusations of greenwashing appear well-founded."
https://openalex.org/W4213227309,"Solid-state nuclear spins surrounding individual, optically addressable qubits1,2 are a crucial resource for quantum networks3-6, computation7-11 and simulation12. Although hosts with sparse nuclear spin baths are typically chosen to mitigate qubit decoherence13, developing coherent quantum systems in nuclear-spin-rich hosts enables exploration of a much broader range of materials for quantum information applications. The collective modes of these dense nuclear spin ensembles provide a natural basis for quantum storage14; however, using them as a resource for single-spin qubits has thus far remained elusive. Here, by using a highly coherent, optically addressed 171Yb3+ qubit doped into a nuclear-spin-rich yttrium orthovanadate crystal15, we develop a robust quantum control protocol to manipulate the multi-level nuclear spin states of neighbouring 51V5+ lattice ions. Via a dynamically engineered spin-exchange interaction, we polarize this nuclear spin ensemble, generate collective spin excitations, and subsequently use them to implement a quantum memory. We additionally demonstrate preparation and measurement of maximally entangled 171Yb-51V Bell states. Unlike conventional, disordered nuclear-spin-based quantum memories16-24, our platform is deterministic and reproducible, ensuring identical quantum registers for all 171Yb3+ qubits. Our approach provides a framework for utilizing the complex structure of dense nuclear spin baths, paving the way towards building large-scale quantum networks using single rare-earth ion qubits15,25-28."
https://openalex.org/W4213317969,"Marked evolution of properties with minute changes in the doping level is a hallmark of the complex chemistry that governs copper oxide superconductivity as manifested in the celebrated superconducting domes and quantum criticality taking place at precise compositions1-4. The strange-metal state, in which the resistivity varies linearly with temperature, has emerged as a central feature in the normal state of copper oxide superconductors5-9. The ubiquity of this behaviour signals an intimate link between the scattering mechanism and superconductivity10-12. However, a clear quantitative picture of the correlation has been lacking. Here we report the observation of precise quantitative scaling laws among the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), the linear-in-T scattering coefficient (A1) and the doping level (x) in electron-doped copper oxide La2-xCexCuO4 (LCCO). High-resolution characterization of epitaxial composition-spread films, which encompass the entire overdoped range of LCCO, has enabled us to systematically map its structural and transport properties with unprecedented accuracy and with increments of Δx = 0.0015. We have uncovered the relations Tc ~ (xc - x)0.5 ~ (A1□)0.5, where xc is the critical doping in which superconductivity disappears and A1□ is the coefficient of the linear resistivity per CuO2 plane. The striking similarity of the Tc versus A1□ relation among copper oxides, iron-based and organic superconductors may be an indication of a common mechanism of the strange-metal behaviour and unconventional superconductivity in these systems."
https://openalex.org/W4213289678,"In the widely accepted 'unified model'1 solution of the classification puzzle of active galactic nuclei, the orientation of a dusty accretion torus around the central black hole dominates their appearance. In 'type-1' systems, the bright nucleus is visible at the centre of a face-on torus. In 'type-2' systems the thick, nearly edge-on torus hides the central engine. Later studies suggested evolutionary effects2 and added dusty clumps and polar winds3 but left the basic picture intact. However, recent high-resolution images4 of the archetypal type-2 galaxy NGC 10685,6, suggested a more radical revision. The images displayed a ring-like emission feature that was proposed to be hot dust surrounding the black hole at the radius where the radiation from the central engine evaporates the dust. That ring is too thin and too far tilted from edge-on to hide the central engine, and ad hoc foreground extinction is needed to explain the type-2 classification. These images quickly generated reinterpretations of the dichotomy between types 1 and 27,8. Here we present new multi-band mid-infrared images of NGC 1068 that detail the dust temperature distribution and reaffirm the original model. Combined with radio data (J.F.G. and C.M.V.I., manuscript in preparation), our maps locate the central engine that is below the previously reported ring and obscured by a thick, nearly edge-on disk, as predicted by the unified model. We also identify emission from polar flows and absorbing dust that is mineralogically distinct from that towards the Milky Way centre."
https://openalex.org/W4213267659,"Lassa virus (LASV) is a human pathogen, causing substantial morbidity and mortality1,2. Similar to other Arenaviridae, it presents a class-I spike complex on its surface that facilitates cell entry. The virus’s cellular receptor is matriglycan, a linear carbohydrate that is present on α-dystroglycan3,4, but the molecular mechanism that LASV uses to recognize this glycan is unknown. In addition, LASV and other arenaviruses have a unique signal peptide that forms an integral and functionally important part of the mature spike5–8; yet the structure, function and topology of the signal peptide in the membrane remain uncertain9–11. Here we solve the structure of a complete native LASV spike complex, finding that the signal peptide crosses the membrane once and that its amino terminus is located in the extracellular region. Together with a double-sided domain-switching mechanism, the signal peptide helps to stabilize the spike complex in its native conformation. This structure reveals that the LASV spike complex is preloaded with matriglycan, suggesting the mechanism of binding and rationalizing receptor recognition by α-dystroglycan-tropic arenaviruses. This discovery further informs us about the mechanism of viral egress and may facilitate the rational design of novel therapeutics that exploit this binding site. The structure of the complete native spike complex of Lassa virus reveals its membrane topology and the matriglycan-depended recognition of its α-dystroglycan cellular receptor."
https://openalex.org/W4213014503,"Adaptation to nutrient scarcity involves an orchestrated response of metabolic and signaling pathways to maintain homeostasis. We find that in the fat body of fasting Drosophila, lysosomal export of cystine coordinates remobilization of internal nutrient stores with reactivation of the growth regulator target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). Mechanistically, cystine was reduced to cysteine and metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by promoting CoA metabolism. In turn, acetyl-CoA retained carbons from alternative amino acids in the form of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and restricted the availability of building blocks required for growth. This process limited TORC1 reactivation to maintain autophagy and allowed animals to cope with starvation periods. We propose that cysteine metabolism mediates a communication between lysosomes and mitochondria, highlighting how changes in diet divert the fate of an amino acid into a growth suppressive program."
https://openalex.org/W4213377669,"Abstract Aromatic residues cluster in the core of folded proteins, where they stabilize the structure through multiple interactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in the 1970s showed that aromatic side chains can undergo ring flips—that is, 180° rotations—despite their role in maintaining the protein fold 1–3 . It was suggested that large-scale ‘breathing’ motions of the surrounding protein environment would be necessary to accommodate these ring flipping events 1 . However, the structural details of these motions have remained unclear. Here we uncover the structural rearrangements that accompany ring flipping of a buried tyrosine residue in an SH3 domain. Using NMR, we show that the tyrosine side chain flips to a low-populated, minor state and, through a proteome-wide sequence analysis, we design mutants that stabilize this state, which allows us to capture its high-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. A void volume is generated around the tyrosine ring during the structural transition between the major and minor state, and this allows fast flipping to take place. Our results provide structural insights into the protein breathing motions that are associated with ring flipping. More generally, our study has implications for protein design and structure prediction by showing how the local protein environment influences amino acid side chain conformations and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W4212810791,"Hydrolase enzymes, including proteases, are encoded by 2-3% of the genes in the human genome and 14% of these enzymes are active drug targets1. However, the activities and substrate specificities of many proteases-especially those embedded in membranes-and other hydrolases remain unknown. Here we report a strategy for creating mechanism-based, light-activated protease and hydrolase substrate traps in complex mixtures and live mammalian cells. The traps capture substrates of hydrolases, which normally use a serine or cysteine nucleophile. Replacing the catalytic nucleophile with genetically encoded 2,3-diaminopropionic acid allows the first step reaction to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which a substrate fragment is covalently linked to the enzyme through a stable amide bond2; this enables stringent purification and identification of substrates. We identify new substrates for proteases, including an intramembrane mammalian rhomboid protease RHBDL4 (refs. 3,4). We demonstrate that RHBDL4 can shed luminal fragments of endoplasmic reticulum-resident type I transmembrane proteins to the extracellular space, as well as promoting non-canonical secretion of endogenous soluble endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperones. We also discover that the putative serine hydrolase retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (ref. 5) is an aminopeptidase with a preference for removing aromatic amino acids in human cells. Our results exemplify a powerful paradigm for identifying the substrates and activities of hydrolase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W4213131875,"Two forms of associative learning-delay conditioning and trace conditioning-have been widely investigated in humans and higher-order mammals1. In delay conditioning, an unconditioned stimulus (for example, an electric shock) is introduced in the final moments of a conditioned stimulus (for example, a tone), with both ending at the same time. In trace conditioning, a 'trace' interval separates the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus. Trace conditioning therefore relies on maintaining a neural representation of the conditioned stimulus after its termination (hence making distraction possible2), to learn the conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus contingency3; this makes it more cognitively demanding than delay conditioning4. Here, by combining virtual-reality behaviour with neurogenetic manipulations and in vivo two-photon brain imaging, we show that visual trace conditioning and delay conditioning in Drosophila mobilize R2 and R4m ring neurons in the ellipsoid body. In trace conditioning, calcium transients during the trace interval show increased oscillations and slower declines over repeated training, and both of these effects are sensitive to distractions. Dopaminergic activity accompanies signal persistence in ring neurons, and this is decreased by distractions solely during trace conditioning. Finally, dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptor signalling in ring neurons have different roles in delay and trace conditioning; dopamine D1-like receptor 1 mediates both forms of conditioning, whereas the dopamine D2-like receptor is involved exclusively in sustaining ring neuron activity during the trace interval of trace conditioning. These observations are similar to those previously reported in mammals during arousal5, prefrontal activation6 and high-level cognitive learning7,8."

This study aimed to measure process and outcome indicators related to the quality of care provided to non-COVID-19 elderly patients affected by HF in Emilia-Romagna, a region of Italy severely hit by the pandemic.We collected the hospital discharge records of all patients admitted to the hospitals of Emilia-Romagna with a diagnosis of HF from January to May in the years 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and 2020 (pandemic period). We analyzed surgery rate, surgery delays, length of hospital stay, timely rehabilitation, and 30-day mortality for each HF patient. We evaluated monthly data (2020 vs. 2019) with the chi-square and t-test, where appropriate. Logistic regression was used to investigate the differences in 30-day mortality.Our study included 5379 patients with HF. In April and May 2020, there was a significant increase in the proportion of HF patients that did not undergo timely surgery. In March 2020, we found a significant increase in mortality (OR = 2.22). Male sex (OR = 1.92), age ≥90 years (OR = 4.33), surgery after 48 hours (OR = 3.08) and not receiving surgery (OR = 6.19) were significantly associated with increased mortality. After adjusting for the aforementioned factors, patients hospitalized in March 2020 still suffered higher mortality (OR = 2.21).There was a reduction in the overall quality of care provided to non-COVID-19 elderly patients affected by HF, whose mortality increased in March 2020. Patients' characteristics and variations in processes of care partially explained this increase. Policymakers and professionals involved in the management of COVID-19 patients should be aware of the needs of patients with other health needs, which should be carefully investigated and included in future emergency preparedness and response plans."

https://openalex.org/W4212855633,"Bangladesh is a South Asian developing country trying to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-3 and the objective of the Rural Electrification Board (REB) regarding child mortality. Infectious diseases are leading causes of child mortality, and lack of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) among infants aged 0-6 months increases child morbidity and mortality from various infectious diseases in developing countries. However, as per existing literature, no study has been conducted yet to determine the lack of EBF practice effect on child mortality in Bangladesh. With this backdrop, the authors intend to measure the likelihood of infectious diseases due to the lack of EBF of infants aged 0-6 months in Bangladesh.This study used Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data over 1996-97 to 2017-18. The mothers of infants aged 0-6 months who were willingly participated in the BDHSs were considered to include in our analysis. Initially, there were 9,133 cases in the combined dataset. After filtering, there were 5,724 cases in the final dataset. We have considered diarrhea (D), acute respiratory infection (ARI) separately as well as the presence of either D or ARI or both and named as CoDARI as outcome variables. This study used both graphical and statistical techniques (Chi-square test, Wald test, and logistic regression) to analyze the data. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to quantify the likelihood of infectious diseases due to lack of EBF practice and its elasticity, respectively.The EBF practice got a conspicuous increasing trend, but the prevalence of infectious diseases was declined from 0 to 3 months of age of infants, whereas an inverse scenario is observed between 4-6 months. The significance of that inverse relationship was confirmed by p-value corresponding to the chi-square test and the Wald test of the adjusted regression coefficients after adjusting the associated factor's effect on infectious diseases. The adjusted ORs also concluded that the lack of EBF practice up to six months of age could enhance the risk of D, ARI, and CoDARI by 2.11 [95% CI: 1.56-2.85], 1.43 [95% CI: 1.28-1.60], and 1.48 [95% CI: 1.32-1.66] times higher, respectively.Findings of this study emphasize the importance of EBF up to six months of age of infants against diarrhea and ARI specific morbidity and mortality. Our results also agreed to the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and National Nutrition Programme of Ethiopia (NNPE) that the EBF practice for the first six months of age could be a best, cost-effective, long-lasting natural preventive way to reduce the child morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases in developing countries. Therefore, findings would help policymakers ensuring the achievement target of REB and SDG-3 associated with the health sector in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4213277405,"Uganda confirmed its first COVID-19 case in March 2020, leading to country-wide closures and a stay-at-home order. Infectious disease pandemics can overwhelm adaptive coping capacity (e.g., general self-efficacy and resilience) and increase the risk for mental distress. For individuals experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and cohabitating with a perpetrator, stay-at-home orders can also increase risk of violence, which can further exacerbate mental distress. The present study explores women's perceived self-efficacy and resilient coping, mental health outcomes (depression and COVID-19 related anxiety), hazardous alcohol use and IPV in the context of Uganda's national 2020 lockdown.A phone-based survey was undertaken from June-August of 2020 in Wakiso District, Uganda. The study sample consisted of Africa Medical and Behavioral Sciences Organization (AMBSO) Population Health Surveillance (APHS) study participants who agreed to be contacted for future research. The analytic sample was restricted to women aged 13-80 years. Bivariate analysis and multivariable models explored associations between experiences of IPV and measures of adaptive coping, mental health and alcohol use.A total of 556 women aged 13-79 years (mean age of 33.4 years) participated. Over half (55%) were currently married. The majority (60%) reported a decrease in alcohol use during the lockdown. Nearly half of the sample were experiencing physical or verbal IPV and reported an increase in violence during the lockdown. In adjusted analysis, alcohol use was associated with four times greater odds of recent physical IPV (aOR 4.06, 95% CI = 1.65-10.02, p = 0.0024), while participants had lower odds of experiencing any form of IPV as general self-efficacy increased (aOR 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99, p = 0.0308).Lockdown measures in Uganda may have mitigated increased alcohol consumption. IPV was exacerbated during lockdown; more than 2 in 5 IPV victims experienced increased physical or verbal violence. Development of programming and policies aimed at mitigating women's risk of IPV during future lockdowns are needed."

https://openalex.org/W4213247366,"Introduction Gender-based violence (GBV) policies and services in the United States (U.S.) have historically been underfunded and siloed from other health services. Soon after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports emerged noting increases in GBV and disruption of health services but few studies have empirically investigated these impacts. This study examines how the existing GBV funding and policy landscape, COVID-19, and resulting state policies in the first six months of the pandemic affect GBV health service provision in the U.S. Methods This is a mixed method study consisting of 1) an analysis of state-by-state emergency response policies review; 2) a quantitative analysis of a survey of U.S.-based GBV service providers (N = 77); and 3) a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with U.S.-based GBV service providers (N = 11). Respondents spanned a range of organization types, populations served, and states. Results Twenty-one states enacted protections for GBV survivors and five states included explicit exemptions from non-essential business closures for GBV service providers. Through the surveys and interviews, GBV service providers note three major themes on COVID-19’s impact on GBV services: reductions in GBV service provision and quality and increased workload, shifts in service utilization, and funding impacts. Findings also indicate GBV inequities were exacerbated for historically underserved groups. Discussion The noted disruptions on GBV services from the COVID-19 pandemic overlaid long-term policy and funding limitations that left service providers unprepared for the challenges posed by the pandemic. Future policies, in emergency and non-emergency contexts, should recognize GBV as essential care and ensure comprehensive services for clients, particularly members of historically underserved groups."
https://openalex.org/W4213119969,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and one of the most common causes of cancer mortality among women worldwide. Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 13 (USP13) gene copy is strongly amplified in human epithelial ovarian cancer, and high USP13 expression is correlated with poor survival outcomes. Yet, its pathological contribution to ovarian tumorigenesis remains unknown. We crossed a conditional Usp13 overexpressing knock-in mouse with a conditional knockout of Trp53 and Pten mouse and generated a novel ovarian cancer genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), which closely recapitulates the genetic changes driving ovarian cancer in humans. Overexpression of USP13 with deletion of Trp53 and Pten in murine ovarian surface epithelium accelerated ovarian tumorigenesis and led to decreased survival in mice. Notably, USP13 greatly enhanced peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors with frequent development of hemorrhagic ascites. The primary and metastatic tumors exhibited morphology and clinical behavior similar to human high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Co-inhibition of USP13 and AKT significantly decreased the viability of the primary murine ovarian cancer cells isolated from the GEMM. USP13 also increased the tumorigenic and metastatic abilities of primary murine ovarian cancer cells in a syngeneic mouse study. These findings suggest a critical role of USP13 in ovarian cancer development and reveal USP13 as a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer."

Though ND is vaccine-preventable, it is a persistent threat to poultry industry across the globe. The disease represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in chickens. To better understand the epidemiology of NDV among commercial and backyard chickens of Odisha, where chicken farming is being prioritized to assist with poverty alleviation, a cross-sectional study was conducted in two distinct seasons during 2018. Choanal swabs (n = 1361) from live birds (commercial layers, broilers, and backyard chicken) and tracheal tissues from dead birds (n = 10) were collected and tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of matrix (M) and fusion (F) genes of NDV. Risk factors at the flock and individual bird levels (health status, ND vaccination status, geographical zone, management system, and housing) were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of the 1371 samples tested, 160 were positive for M gene amplification indicating an overall apparent prevalence of 11.7% (95% CI 10.1-13.5%). Circulation of virulent NDV strains was also evident with apparent prevalence of 8.1% (13/160; 95% CI: 4.8-13.4%). In addition, commercial birds had significantly higher odds (75%) of being infected with NDV as compared to backyard poultry (p = 0.01). This study helps fill a knowledge gap in the prevalence and distribution of NDV in apparently healthy birds in eastern India, and provides a framework for future longitudinal research of NDV risk and mitigation in targeted geographies-a step forward for effective control of ND in Odisha."

https://openalex.org/W4212805566,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and scrub typhus are endemic zoonotic diseases that pose significant public health threats in East Asia. As these two diseases share common clinical features, as well as overlapping disease regions, it is difficult to differentiate between SFTS and scrub typhus. A multiplex reverse-transcription loop‑mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed to detect large segments and GroES genes for SFTS virus (SFTSV) and Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT). The performance of the RT-LAMP assay was compared and evaluated with those of commercial PowerChek™ SFTSV real-time PCR and LiliF™ TSUTSU nested PCR for 23 SFTS and 12 scrub typhus clinical samples, respectively. The multiplex SFTSV/OT/Internal control (IC) RT-LAMP assay showed comparable sensitivity (91.3%) with that of commercial PowerChek™ SFTSV Real-time PCR (95.6%) and higher sensitivity (91.6%) than that of LiliF™ TSUTSU nested PCR (75%). In addition, the multiplex SFTSV/OT RT-LAMP assay showed 100% specificity and no cross-reactivity for blood from uninfected healthy patients and samples from patients infected with other fever viruses. Thus, the multiplex SFTSV/OT/IC RT-LAMP assay could serve as a useful point-of-care molecular diagnostic test for SFTS and scrub typhus."
https://openalex.org/W4212991570,"All stage resistance to stripe rust races prevalent in India was investigated in the European winter wheat cultivar 'Acienda'. In order to dissect the genetic basis of the resistance, a backcross population was developed between 'Acienda' and the stripe rust susceptible Indian spring wheat cultivar 'HD 2967'. Inheritance studies revealed segregation for a dominant resistant gene. High density SNP genotyping was used to map stripe rust resistance and marker regression analysis located stripe rust resistance to the distal end of wheat chromosome 1A. Interval mapping located this region between the SNP markers AX-95162217 and AX-94540853, at a LOD score of 15.83 with a phenotypic contribution of 60%. This major stripe rust resistance locus from 'Acienda' has been temporarily designated as Yraci. A candidate gene search in the 2.76 Mb region carrying Yraci on chromosome 1A identified 18 NBS-LRR genes based on wheat RefSeqv1.0 annotations. Our results indicate that as there is no major gene reported in the Yraci chromosome region, it is likely to be a novel stripe rust resistance locus and offers potential for deployment, using the identified markers, to confer all stage stripe rust resistance."

We describe a high local prevalence in January of 8.5% (CI 4.9-14.2%) for the C29197T mutation, which was over 3-fold higher than the prevalence estimated statewide in California during the same time frame, 2.5% (CI 2.1-2.8%). Using phylogenetic analysis, we discovered that this increase in prevalence was due, at least in part, to a disproportionately large infection cluster of unknown origin. This study emphasizes the importance of sequencing at the local jurisdictional level and demonstrates the impact that regional variation can have when assessing risk due to point mutations that impact clinical test performance. It also reinforces the need for diligent reporting of abnormal test results by clinical laboratories, especially during Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) periods, as additional information is gathered about the target organism and the performance of EUA-authorized tests over time."

Combining results from veterinarian and owner evaluations, the tested product proved to be significantly beneficial in alleviating pain and in reducing the clinical signs in dogs with OA."
https://openalex.org/W4212964695,"The intrusion of magmatic rocks into coal seams affects the coal quality and leads to unforeseen hazards in safety of the coal mines' production. This paper summarizes the mechanism of magmatic rocks intruding into coal seams, depicts the electromagnetic characteristics of the coal seams intruded by magmatic rocks, briefly describes the characteristics of transient electromagnetic method (TEM), and introduces the method of detection by TEM and the data processing steps. Then, the effectiveness of TEM in detecting the ranges of the coal seams intruded by magmatic rocks is theoretically analysed. It is observed that after the intrusion of magmatic rocks in the coal seams, the electromagnetic characteristics (secondary field potential and resistivity) will be dramatically affected, namely high secondary field potential and low resistivity. For experimental verification purposes, this study selects the test project of the Tongxin Minefield in the Datong Coalfield in Shanxi, China as an example, and the accuracy for the detection of the ranges of the coal seams intruded by magmatic rock using TEM is successfully verified."
https://openalex.org/W4213103014,"Modulating the number of muscle stems cells, called satellite cells, during early postnatal development produces long-term effects on muscle growth. We tested the hypothesis that high expression levels of the anti-aging protein Klotho in early postnatal myogenesis increase satellite cell numbers by influencing the epigenetic regulation of genes that regulate myogenesis. Our findings show that elevated klotho expression caused a transient increase in satellite cell numbers and slowed muscle fiber growth, followed by a period of accelerated muscle growth that leads to larger fibers. Klotho also transcriptionally downregulated the H3K27 demethylase Jmjd3, leading to increased H3K27 methylation and decreased expression of genes in the canonical Wnt pathway, which was associated with a delay in muscle differentiation. In addition, Klotho stimulation and Jmjd3 downregulation produced similar but not additive reductions in the expression of Wnt4, Wnt9a, and Wnt10a in myogenic cells, indicating that inhibition occurred through a common pathway. Together, our results identify a novel pathway through which Klotho influences myogenesis by reducing the expression of Jmjd3, leading to reductions in the expression of Wnt genes and inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling."

We have previously found that CD4 T helper 1 (Th1) response is indispensable for the protection against PLC. In the present research, we aimed to test the potent inducers of Th1 responses, live-attenuated Listeria monocytogenes ∆actA/∆inlB strain as preventive/therapeutic vaccine candidate in liver fibrosis, HCC, and CCA. Studies were performed using autochthonous models of HCC and CCA, highly reflecting human disease. L. monocytogenes ∆actA/∆inlB demonstrated strong safety/efficacy in premalignant and malignant liver diseases. The protective mechanism relied on the induction of strong tumor-specific immune responses that keep the development of hepatobiliary cancers under control. Combination therapy, comprising Listeria vaccination and a checkpoint inhibitor blockade significantly extended the survival of HCC-bearing mice even at the advanced stages of the disease. This is the first report on the safety and efficacy of Listeria-based vaccine in liver fibrosis, as well as the first proof of principle study on Listeria-based vaccines in CCA. Our study paves the way for the use of live-attenuated Listeria as safe and efficient vaccine and a potent inducer of protective immune responses in liver fibrosis and hepatobiliary malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4213044925,"Nursing is a profession that care for personal and private aspects of people's lives. Therefore, nurses need to know the basic ethical aspects of nursing which is integral in nursing practices. The purpose of the study was to describe the ethical knowledge, attitude and practice of nurses in the Cape Coast Metropolis of Ghana.A cross-section design was used to collect data from 264 nurses in three selected healthcare facilities in the Metropolis. A structured questionnaire was administered to all the categories of these nurses in the selected facilities. Frequency counts and multiple regression statistics were used to analyze the data.The results show 78% of nurses possess good ethical knowledge, 84% had a positive attitude, while 98% had good ethical practices. The results further show that nurses' professional rank [F (1, 259), 2.35, p = .02] and academic qualification [F (1, 259), 2.67, p = .008] were significant predictors of their ethical knowledge and attitude, respectively.Inadequate resources, poor set up of working areas and understaffing are the major barriers limiting the practice of good ethical standards among the nurses. The Regional Health Directorate, the Ministry of Health and the Managers in charge of the health facilities need to work together to eliminate these barriers as they have the potential to negatively impact quality healthcare delivery in the Metropolis."
https://openalex.org/W4213154228,"The aim of this study was to assess differences in cervical cancer screening and treatment outcomes by HIV status in a routine programmatic setting with a high generalized HIV prevalence. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) are at heightened risk of developing cervical cancer and the World Health Organization recommends all WLHIV who are sexually active be screened, regardless of age. In 2018, Namibia's Ministry of Health and Social Services introduced a screen-and-treat approach using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and ablative treatment with cryotherapy or thermocoagulation with a focus on screening HIV-positive women due to Namibia's 11.5% prevalence of HIV in women aged 15-49. Using program data from October 2018 to March 2020 from seven of the country's 14 regions, we calculated descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to test the statistical significance of differences in VIA-positivity, ineligibility for ablative treatment, treatment completion, and same day treatment completion by HIV status. Between October 2018 and March 2020, the program conducted 14,786 cervical cancer screenings. Among 8,150 women who received their first VIA screening, more WLHIV screened VIA-positive (17%) than HIV-negative women (15%). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02). Among 2,272 women who screened VIA-positive at any screening, 1,159 (82%) completed ablative treatment. This suggests ablative treatment is feasible and acceptable in resource-limited settings. WLHIV were also more likely to complete treatment than HIV-negative women (p<0.01). Differences in health seeking behavior of sub-populations as well as resource availability between service delivery points should be considered for further investigation. Going forward in order to strengthen program implementation and expand screening access and uptake further investigation is needed to determine cancer incidence by HIV status, age, and time since last screening to assess cases that are averted as well as potential rates of overtreatment."
https://openalex.org/W4212827971,"The aim of this pilot study was to develop a Thai-version of a simple swallowing questionnaire, called the T-SSQ, and to evaluate the association between malnutrition risk and swallowing ability, determined objectively by tongue strength and subjectively by the T-SSQ. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine which swallowing indices better estimate malnutrition in older adults.This cross-sectional study comprised two phases: Phase I, development and cross-cultural translation of the T-SSQ; and Phase II, application of the T-SSQ in 60 older adults. In Phase I, content and face validity of the T-SSQ was evaluated by 10 experts and 15 older adults. In Phase II, the convergent validity of the T-SSQ was evaluated by determining its association with objective tongue strength. Nutritional status was evaluated using the Thai-version of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics, and oral and health-related status. Adjusting for covariates, the associations between the two swallowing indices and malnutrition risk were determined using multivariable regression analyses. A cut-off value for low tongue strength was determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and sensitivity analysis between the swallowing indices and malnutrition risk was performed.The T-SSQ comprised 4-items of common signs and symptoms of a swallowing problem. Its content and face validity were verified. Older adults were considered as having a swallowing problem when at least one item was reported. Convergent validity of the subjective index was shown by significantly different tongue strength values between the participants with and without a swallowing problem (p for independent t-test = 0.014). Based on the highest area under the ROC curve, an 18-kPa cut-off value was chosen to classify low tongue strength. Having a swallowing problem and low tongue strength was significantly associated with malnutrition risk. The positive predictive value of the subjective swallowing index was 1.8-fold higher than objective tongue strength.Self-reported swallowing problems determined by the T-SSQ can be used as a subjective index for evaluating swallowing ability in older adults. Subjective swallowing problems and objective tongue strength were associated with malnutrition risk. However, the T-SSQ estimated malnutrition risk better than the objective index."
https://openalex.org/W4212934889,"Background Following the full re-opening of schools in England and emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant, we investigated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in students and staff who were contacts of a confirmed case in a school bubble (school groupings with limited interactions), along with their household members. Methods Primary and secondary school bubbles were recruited into sKIDsBUBBLE after being sent home to self-isolate following a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the bubble. Bubble participants and their household members were sent home-testing kits comprising nasal swabs for RT-PCR testing and whole genome sequencing, and oral fluid swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results During November-December 2020, 14 bubbles were recruited from 7 schools, including 269 bubble contacts (248 students, 21 staff) and 823 household contacts (524 adults, 299 children). The secondary attack rate was 10.0% (6/60) in primary and 3.9% (4/102) in secondary school students, compared to 6.3% (1/16) and 0% (0/1) among staff, respectively. The incidence rate for household contacts of primary school students was 6.6% (12/183) and 3.7% (1/27) for household contacts of primary school staff. In secondary schools, this was 3.5% (11/317) and 0% (0/1), respectively. Household contacts were more likely to test positive if their bubble contact tested positive although there were new infections among household contacts of uninfected bubble contacts. Interpretation Compared to other institutional settings, the overall risk of secondary infection in school bubbles and their household contacts was low. Our findings are important for developing evidence-based infection prevention guidelines for educational settings."
https://openalex.org/W4212951871,"Fine bubbles (FBs) have attracted significant attention in several research fields. Although some reports have argued that FB dispersion is useful as an oxygen (gas) carrier, only a few reports have examined its properties as an oxygen carrier using experimental data. As one of the reasons for this, there are no standard methods for measuring the oxygen content in FB dispersions. Conventional oxygen measurement methods have certain drawbacks in accuracy or speed; thus, it is difficult to use oxygen content as the primary outcome. In this study, we introduce a Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode device (OXYG1-PLUS) for oxygen measurement, allowing the dilution of FB dispersion without the influence of ambient air and the adhesion of FBs on the electrode surface due to its special shape. First, the accuracy of our dilution method was evaluated using pure water as a sample, and it was confirmed that our method could measure with an accuracy of ±0.5 mg/L from the results with conventional dissolved oxygen meters. Second, the oxygen content in FB dispersion was evaluated with our method and a chemical titration method (Winkler’s method), and it was found that our method could measure the oxygen content in FB dispersions quantitively. This method satisfies the easiness (4 steps) and quickness (within 8 min) for a wide range of oxygen contents (0 to 332 mg/L, theoretical range) with low coefficient variation (&lt; 4.7%) and requires a small sample volume (50–500 μL); thus, it is a useful method for measuring the oxygen in FB dispersions."
https://openalex.org/W4213063397,"Methemoglobin (metHb) arises from the oxidation of ferrous hemoglobin (HbFe2+, Hb) to ferric hemoglobin (HbFe3+, metHb), which is unable to bind gaseous ligands such as oxygen (O2) and carbon monoxide (CO), and binds to nitric oxide (NO) significantly slower compared to Hb. Therefore, metHb does not elicit vasoconstriction and systemic hypertension in vivo due to its extremely slow NO scavenging rate in comparison to cell-free Hb, but will induce oxidative tissue injury, demonstrating the potential of using metHb as a control material when studying the toxicity of cell-free Hb. Hence, the goal of this work was to develop a novel manufacturing strategy for production of metHb that is amenable to scale-up. In this study, small scale (e.g. 1 mL reaction volume) screening experiments were initially conducted to determine the optimal molar ratio of Hb to the oxidization agents hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or sodium nitrite (NaNO2) to achieve the highest conversion of Hb into metHb. A spectral deconvolution program was employed to determine the molar fraction of various species (hemichrome, metHb, oxyHb, metHb-[Formula: see text], and NaNO2) in solution during the oxidation reaction. From this analysis, either a 1:1 or 1:5 molar ratio was identified as optimal molar ratios of Hb:NaNO2 (heme basis) that yielded the highest conversion of Hb into metHb with negligible amounts of side products. Hence in order to reduce the reaction time, a 1:5 molar ratio was chosen for large scale (i.e. 1.5 L reaction volume) synthesis of bovine metHb (metbHb) and human metHb (methHb). The biophysical properties of metHb were then characterized to elucidate the potential of using the synthesized metHb as a non-O2 carrying control material. The haptoglobin binding kinetics of metHb were found to be similar to Hb. Additionally, the synthesized metHb was stable in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 50 mM, pH 7.4) at 4°C for approximately one week, indicating the high stability of the material."

To help understand the causal relationship between work stress and disease, we present a computational model of this relationship. That is, drawing from allostatic load theory, we captured the link between work stress and disease in a set of mathematical formulas. With simulation studies, we then examined our model’s ability to reproduce key findings from previous empirical research. Specifically, results from Study 1 suggested that our model could accurately reproduce established findings on daily fluctuations in cortisol levels (both on the group level and the individual level). Results from Study 2 suggested that our model could accurately reproduce established findings on the relationship between work stress and cardiovascular disease. Finally, results from Study 3 yielded new predictions about the relationship between workweek configurations (i.e., how working hours are distributed over days) and the subsequent development of disease. Together, our studies suggest a new, computational approach to studying the causal link between work stress and disease. We suggest that this approach is fruitful, as it aids the development of falsifiable theory, and as it opens up new ways of generating predictions about why and when work stress is (un)healthy."

Fifteen male semi-professional ARF athletes (Mean (SD); age: 22 (3) years, height: 182.3 (6.5) cm, mass: 80.5 (5.1) kg) completed either HWI (HEAT, N = 8, 13 (2) sessions, 322 (69) min exposure, 39.5 (0.3) °C) or acted as a control (CON, N = 7, no water immersion) over 6-weeks. Athletes completed a 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test pre and post-intervention to assess intermittent running performance (VIFT), with perception of in-game running ability measured. Heat acclimation was determined via change in resting plasma volume, as well as physiological and perceptual responses during HWI. HEAT elicited large PV expansion (mean ± 90% CI: d = 1.03 ± 0.73), large decreases in heart rate (d = -0.89 ± 0.70), thermal sensation (d = -2.30 ± 1.15) and tympanic temperature (d = -1.18 ± 0.77). Large improvements in VIFT were seen in HEAT (d = 1.67 ± 0.93), with HEAT showing a greater improvement in VIFT when compared to CON (d = 0.81 ± 0.88). HEAT also showed greater belief that in-game running ability improved post-intervention (d = 2.15 ± 1.09) compared to CON. A 6-week HWI intervention can elicit heat acclimation, improve perception of in-game running ability, and potentially improve VIFT in semi-professional ARF athletes."

Implementation fidelity study is important to assess on what extent preventive program is being implemented. The objective of the study measured the implementation fidelity of TBPT program Kaski district, Nepal. Methods We used a mixed-method explanatory sequential design study. Quantitative data were collected through retrospective review of records from April 2018 to May 2019 and level of adherence was established. Moderating factors influencing the implementation of TBPT were TBPT were assessed qualitatively. Sixteen in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion was conducted purposively with responsible stakeholders. The study was guided by the Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity (CFIR) developed by Carroll. Results The majority of the components of the TBPT program were found to be implemented with a moderate level of fidelity. The proportion of under five years children initiate and complete the full course of TBPT was 72.5% and 75.86% respectively. The proportion of index cases traced for household contact, contact tracing within two months and timely initiation of therapy within two months were 54.19%, 82.73% and 86.20%. Moderating factors identified in the implementation of the program were contact tracing and enrollment, partnership and ownership, training resources, medication, awareness and information dissemination. Conclusion The TBPT program is being moderately implemented in Kaski districts. Addressing the key challenges identified in contact tracing, partnership/ownership, incentives, training and knowledge of health workers results in more identification of children eligible for TBPT."
https://openalex.org/W4212850605,"Many childhood cancer survivors desire biological children but are at risk for infertility after treatment. One option for mitigating risk is the use of fertility preservation prior to gonadotoxic therapy. Adolescents and emerging adults may rely on their parents to help them decide whether to use fertility preservation. While this is often a collaborative process, it is currently unknown how parents can optimally support adolescents and emerging adults through this decision. To address this gap, we developed a family-centered, psychoeducational intervention to prompt adolescents and emerging adults to reflect on their future parenthood goals and attitudes towards fertility preservation, as well as to prompt their parents (or other caregivers) to reflect on their own and their child's perspectives on the topic. In this randomized controlled trial, families will be randomized to either the standard of care control group (fertility consult) or the intervention group. After their fertility consult, adolescents and emerging adults and parents in the intervention group will complete a fertility preservation values clarification tool and then participate in a guided conversation about their responses and the fertility preservation decision. The primary expected outcome of this study is that participation in the intervention will increase the use of fertility preservation. The secondary expected outcome is an improvement in decision quality. Chi-square analyses and t-tests will evaluate primary and secondary outcomes. The goal of this intervention is to optimize family-centered fertility preservation decision-making in the context of a new cancer diagnosis to help male adolescents and emerging adults achieve their future parenthood goals."

Questionnaires covering basic issues, surrounding demographic information, history of diseases, living habits, comorbidities, etc. were completed online in a self-reported manner Dermatological examination was performed by certified dermatologists. The disease burden of AGA, which includes health-related quality of life, symptoms of anxiety, symptoms of depression and quality of sleep, was measured by EQ-5D-3L, PHQ-2, GAD-2 and PSQI, respectively.The prevalence of AGA in college freshmen in China was 5.3/1000. Male was significantly associated with higher prevalence of AGA (7.9/1000, P<0.01) while female with lower risk of AGA (OR = 0.29, P = 0.002). There was no significant association between BMI and AGA, nor predilection of AGA in the Han nationality or the other ethnic minorities. Annual household income or parental highest educational level exerted no significant influence on the prevalence of AGA. Rosacea (OR = 3.22, P = 0.019) was significantly associated with higher prevalence of AGA while acne seemed not to be related to AGA. The scores of EQ-5D, GAD-2, PHQ-2 and PSQI were not significantly different between students with and without AGA.The onset of AGA in Chinese college freshmen differ between genders and was significantly associated with rosacea."
https://openalex.org/W4213221043,"There is a paucity of research on the issue of alcohol provocation in the medical field. While studies have been performed concerning alcohol abuse among students, no studies have concentrated on alcohol provocation among medical professionals. Therefore, it is essential to look at the underlying factors that may influence alcohol use by medical professionals. A qualitative study using focus groups was conducted to construct themes depicting medical professionals' experiences of alcohol provocation. Physicians (n = 32) and residents (n = 29) were recruited from a large teaching hospital in Taiwan. The volunteers included both subjects and instigators of alcohol provocation (individuals being pressured to drink and those who exert such pressure on others). A questionnaire on their alcohol use was used to quantitatively assess the prevalence of alcohol consumption and inebriation. The participants were then interviewed separately in groups. All interview data were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. A notable prevalence of recent alcohol consumption was observed in both the physicians (n = 18, 56%) and residents (n = 17, 59%). Three prominent themes were identified and summarized: (1) Social drinking in the Taiwanese medical profession (2) Workplace hierarchy and changes in drinking culture, and (3) Influence on the medical profession. The behaviour of alcohol provocation among these medical professionals was revealed with its underlying factors of specific cultural norms, workplace hierarchy and social expectations. An understanding of alcohol provocation helps increase the awareness of adverse consequences associated with alcohol provocation, encourage medical professionals to avoid inappropriate drinking behaviors, and reduce the risk of compromising medical professionalism."
https://openalex.org/W4212833308,"People experience the same event but do not feel the same way. Such individual differences in emotion response are believed to be far greater than those in any other mental functions. Thus, to understand what makes people individuals, it is important to identify the systematic structures of individual differences in emotion response and elucidate how such structures relate to what aspects of psychological characteristics. Reflecting this importance, many studies have attempted to relate emotions to psychological characteristics such as personality traits, psychosocial states, and pathological symptoms across individuals. However, systematic and global structures that govern the across-individual covariation between the domain of emotion responses and that of psychological characteristics have been rarely explored previously, which limits our understanding of the relationship between individual differences in emotion response and psychological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we acquired high-dimensional data sets in both emotion-response (8 measures) and psychological-characteristic (68 measures) domains from the same pool of individuals (86 undergraduate or graduate students) and carried out the canonical correlation analysis in conjunction with the principal component analysis on those data sets. For each participant, the emotion-response measures were quantified by regressing affective-rating responses to visual narrative stimuli onto the across-participant average responses to those stimuli, while the psychological-characteristic measures were acquired from 19 different psychometric questionnaires grounded in personality, psychosocial-factor, and clinical-problem taxonomies. We found a single robust mode of population covariation, particularly between the 'accuracy' and 'sensitivity' measures of arousal responses in the emotion domain and many 'psychosocial' measures in the psychological-characteristics domain. This mode of covariation suggests that individuals characterized with positive social assets tend to show polarized arousal responses to life events."
https://openalex.org/W4212924116,"Rosette morphology across Arabidopsis accessions exhibits considerable variation. Here we report a high-throughput phenotyping approach based on automatic image analysis to quantify rosette shape and dissect the underlying genetic architecture. Shape measurements of the rosettes in a core set of Recombinant Inbred Lines from an advanced mapping population (Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross or MAGIC) derived from inter-crossing 19 natural accessions. Image acquisition and analysis was scaled to extract geometric descriptors from time stamped images of growing rosettes. Shape analyses revealed heritable morphological variation at early juvenile stages and QTL mapping resulted in over 116 chromosomal regions associated with trait variation within the population. Many QTL linked to variation in shape were located near genes related to hormonal signalling and signal transduction pathways while others are involved in shade avoidance and transition to flowering. Our results suggest rosette shape arises from modular integration of sub-organ morphologies and can be considered a functional trait subjected to selective pressures of subsequent morphological traits. On an applied aspect, QTLs found will be candidates for further research on plant architecture."

However, there is a paucity of scientific knowledge about the relationship between empowerment and symptoms of STIs among married Bangladeshi women. This article aimed to examine the association between women empowerment and symptoms of STIs among currently married Bangladeshi women of reproductive age.We extracted data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), conducted from June 28, 2014, to November 9, 2014. We utilised cross-tabulation, the conceptual framework and multivariable multilevel mixed-effect logistics regression to explore the association between women's empowerment indicators and women's self-reported symptoms of genital sore and abnormal genital discharge. All of the analysis was adjusted using cluster weight.We found that among 16,858 currently married women, 5.59% and 10.84% experienced genital sores and abnormal genital discharge during the past 12 months, respectively. Women who depended on husbands to make decisions regarding their health care (AOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.67-0.84), significant household purchases (AOR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.71-0.88), and visiting family or relatives (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.64-0.80) were less likely to report signs of abnormal genital discharge. Women who could make joint healthcare decisions with their husbands were also less likely to report genital sores (AOR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.67-0.90).Genital sores and abnormal genital discharge were prevalent across all parameters of women empowerment among currently married women in Bangladesh. Our estimates show that the husband plays a significant role in decision-making about sexual and reproductive health. Efforts need to be invested in establishing culturally relevant gender policies which facilitate the involvement of women in joint decision-making."

We consecutively enrolled patients who underwent vectorcardiography between March 2017 and December 2018 in a tertiary referral medical center. These patients didn't have structural heart diseases, histories of congestive heart failure, or reduced ejection fraction, and they were classified into SCD (with aborted SCD history and cerebral performance category score of 1) and control groups (with an intervention for atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia and without SCD history). A total of 162 patients (mean age, 54.3±18.1 years; men, 75.9%), including 59 in the SCD group and 103 in the control group, underwent propensity analysis. The baseline demographic variables, underlying diseases, QRS loop descriptors (the percentage of the loop area, loop dispersion, and inter-lead QRS dispersion), and other electrocardiographic parameters were compared between the two groups. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, a smaller percentage of the loop area (odds ratio, 0.0003; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.02; p<0.001), more significant V4-5 dispersion (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.07; p = 0.002), and longer QRS duration (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.10; p = 0.04) were associated with SCD. In conclusion, the QRS loop descriptors of surface electrocardiography could be used as non-invasive markers to identify patients experiencing aborted SCD from a healthy population. A decreased percentage of loop area and elevated V4-5 QRS dispersion values assessed using vectorcardiography were associated with an increased risk of SCD in patients with structurally normal hearts."
