However, it remains unclear how ER stress activates PERK to initiate a downstream unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we found that PERK’s luminal domain can recognize and selectively interact with misfolded proteins but not with native proteins. Screening a phage-display library, we identified a peptide substrate, P16, of the PERK luminal domain and confirmed that P16 efficiently competes with misfolded proteins for binding this domain. To unravel the mechanism by which the PERK luminal domain interacts with misfolded proteins, we determined the crystal structure of the bovine PERK luminal domain complexed with P16 to 2.8-Å resolution. The structure revealed that PERK’s luminal domain binds the peptide through a conserved hydrophobic groove. Substitutions within hydrophobic regions of the PERK luminal domain abolished the binding between PERK and misfolded proteins. We also noted that peptide binding results in major conformational changes in the PERK luminal domain that may favor PERK oligomerization. The structure of the PERK luminal domain–P16 complex suggested stacking of the luminal domain that leads to PERK oligomerization and activation via autophosphorylation after ligand binding. Collectively, our structural and biochemical results strongly support a ligand-driven model in which the PERK luminal domain interacts directly with misfolded proteins to induce PERK oligomerization and activation, resulting in ER stress signaling and the UPR.

https://openalex.org/W2791779453,"There is increasing evidence that some people can experience persistent symptoms for up to a year following mild TBI. However, few longitudinal studies of mild TBI exist and the longer-term impact remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine if there are long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) four-years later. Adults (aged ≥16 years) identified as part of a TBI incidence study who experienced a mild-TBI four-years ago (N = 232) were compared to age-sex matched controls (N = 232). Sociodemographic variables, prior TBI and symptoms were assessed at the time of injury. Four years post-injury participants completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools. Analysis of covariance was used to compare differences between TBI cases four years post-injury and controls, controlling for prior TBI and depression. A multiple regression model was used to identify the predictors of increased symptoms and reduced participation. The mild-TBI sample experienced significantly increased self-reported cognitive symptoms (F = 19.90, p = <0.01) four years post-injury than controls. There were no differences between the groups for somatic (F = 0.02, p = 0.89) or emotional symptoms (F = 0.31, p = 0.58). Additionally, the mild-TBI group reported significantly poorer community participation across all three domains: productivity (F = 199.07, p = <0.00), social relations (F = 13.93, p = <0.00) and getting out and about (F = 364.69, p = <0.00) compared to controls. A regression model accounting for 41% of the variance in cognitive symptoms in TBI cases revealed a history of TBI, receiving acute medical attention and baseline cognitive symptoms, sleep quality, anxiety and depression were predictive of outcome. The results indicate that whilst somatic and emotional symptoms resolve over time, cognitive symptoms can become persistent and that mild TBI can impact longer-term community participation. Early intervention is needed to reduce the longer-term impact of cognitive symptoms and facilitate participation."
https://openalex.org/W2786981732,"Anthropogenic plastic pollution is a global problem. In the marine environment, one of its less studied effects is the transport of attached biota, which might lead to introductions of non-native species in new areas or aid in habitat expansions of invasive species. The goal of the present work was to assess if the material composition of beached anthropogenic litter is indicative of the rafting fauna in a coastal area and could thus be used as a simple and cost-efficient tool for risk assessment in the future. Beached anthropogenic litter and attached biota along the 200 km coastline of Asturias, central Bay of Biscay, Spain, were analysed. The macrobiotic community attached to fouled litter items was identified using genetic barcoding combined with visual taxonomic analysis, and compared between hard plastics, foams, other plastics and non-plastic items. On the other hand, the material composition of beached litter was analysed in a standardized area on each beach. From these two datasets, the expected frequency of several rafting taxa was calculated for the coastal area and compared to the actually observed frequencies. The results showed that plastics were the most abundant type of beached litter. Litter accumulation was likely driven by coastal sources (industry, ports) and river/sewage inputs and transported by near-shore currents. Rafting vectors were almost exclusively made up of plastics and could mainly be attributed to fishing activity and leisure/ household. We identified a variety of rafting biota, including species of goose barnacles, acorn barnacles, bivalves, gastropods, polychaetes and bryozoan, and hydrozoan colonies attached to stranded litter. Several of these species were non-native and invasive, such as the giant Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and the Australian barnacle (Austrominius modestus). The composition of attached fauna varied strongly between litter items of different materials. Plastics, except for foam, had a much more diverse attached community than non-plastic materials. The predicted frequency of several taxa attached to beached litter significantly correlated with the actually observed frequencies. Therefore we suggest that the composition of stranded litter on a beach or an area could allow for predictions about the corresponding attached biotic community, including invasive species."
https://openalex.org/W2786236873,"Although stop codon readthrough is used extensively by viruses to expand their gene expression, verified instances of mammalian readthrough have only recently been uncovered by systems biology and comparative genomics approaches. Previously, our analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons predicted stop codon readthrough of several mammalian genes, all of which have been validated experimentally. Four mRNAs display highly efficient stop codon readthrough, and these mRNAs have a UGA stop codon immediately followed by CUAG (UGA_CUAG) that is conserved throughout vertebrates. Extending on the identification of this readthrough motif, we here investigated stop codon readthrough, using tissue culture reporter assays, for all previously untested human genes containing UGA_CUAG. The readthrough efficiency of the annotated stop codon for the sequence encoding vitamin D receptor (VDR) was 6.7%. It was the highest of those tested but all showed notable levels of readthrough. The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors, and it binds its major ligand, calcitriol, via its C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Readthrough of the annotated VDR mRNA results in a 67 amino acid-long C-terminal extension that generates a VDR proteoform named VDRx. VDRx may form homodimers and heterodimers with VDR but, compared with VDR, VDRx displayed a reduced transcriptional response to calcitriol even in the presence of its partner retinoid X receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2791517235,"Rhein, an anthraquinone compound existing in many traditional herbal medicines, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective activities, but its anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity is ambiguous. In the present study, through plaque inhibition assay, time-of-addition assay, antioxidant assay, qRT-PCR, ELISA, and western blotting assays, we investigated the anti-IAV effect and mechanism of action of rhein in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that rhein could significantly inhibit IAV adsorption and replication, decrease IAV-induced oxidative stress, activations of TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-κB pathways, and production of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in vitro. Oxidant H2O2 and agonists of TLR4, Akt, p38/JNK and IKK/NF-κB could significantly antagonize the inhibitory effects of rhein on IAV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and IAV replication. Through an in vivo test in mice, we also found that rhein could significantly improve the survival rate, lung index, pulmonary cytokines, and pulmonary histopathological changes. Rhein also significantly decreased pulmonary viral load at a high dose. In conclusion, rhein can inhibit IAV adsorption and replication, and the mechanism of action to inhibit IAV replication may be due to its ability to suppress IAV-induced oxidative stress and activations of TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-κB signal pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2791593223,"To understand clinicians' beliefs about practice variation and how variation might be reduced.We surveyed board-certified physicians (N = 178), nurse practitioners (N = 60), and physician assistants (N = 12) at an academic medical center and two community clinics, representing family medicine, general internal medicine, and cardiology, from February-April 2016. The Internet-based questionnaire ascertained clinicians' beliefs regarding practice variation, clinical practice guidelines, and costs.Respondents agreed that practice variation should be reduced (mean [SD] 4.5 [1.1]; 1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree), but agreed less strongly (4.1 [1.0]) that it can realistically be reduced. They moderately agreed that variation is justified by situational differences (3.9 [1.2]). They strongly agreed (5.2 [0.8]) that clinicians should help reduce healthcare costs, but agreed less strongly (4.4 [1.1]) that reducing practice variation would reduce costs. Nearly all respondents (234/249 [94%]) currently depend on practice guidelines. Clinicians rated differences in clinician style and experience as most influencing practice variation, and inaccessibility of guidelines as least influential. Time to apply standards, and patient decision aids, were rated most likely to help standardize practice. Nurse practitioners and physicians assistants (vs physicians) and less experienced (vs senior) clinicians rated more favorably several factors that might help to standardize practice. Differences by specialty and academic vs community practice were small.Clinicians believe that practice variation should be reduced, but are less certain that this can be achieved. Accessibility of guidelines is not a significant barrier to practice standardization, whereas more time to apply standards is viewed as potentially helpful."
https://openalex.org/W2754446214,"Although most reef-building corals live near the upper threshold of their thermotolerance, some scleractinians are resilient to temperature increases. For instance, Pocillopora acuta specimens from an upwelling habitat in Southern Taiwan survived a nine-month experimental exposure to 30°C, a temperature hypothesized to induce stress. To gain a greater understanding of the molecular pathways underlying such high-temperature acclimation, the protein profiles of experimental controls incubated at 27°C were compared to those of conspecific P. acuta specimens exposed to 30°C for two, four, or eight weeks, and differentially concentrated proteins (DCPs) were removed from the gels and sequenced with mass spectrometry. Sixty unique DCPs were uncovered across both eukaryotic compartments of the P. acuta-dinoflagellate (genus Symbiodinium) mutualism, and Symbiodinium were more responsive to high temperature at the protein-level than the coral hosts in which they resided at the two-week sampling time. Furthermore, proteins involved in the stress response were more likely to be documented at different cellular concentrations across temperature treatments in Symbiodinium, whereas the temperature-sensitive host coral proteome featured numerous proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure, immunity, and metabolism. These proteome-scale data suggest that the coral host and its intracellular dinoflagellates have differing strategies for acclimating to elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2788464637,"Extremely low temperatures present various challenges to life that include ice formation and effects on metabolic capacity. Psyhcrophilic microorganisms typically have an array of mechanisms to enable survival in cold temperatures. In this study, we sequenced and analysed the genome of a psychrophilic yeast isolated in the Antarctic region, Glaciozyma antarctica. The genome annotation identified 7857 protein coding sequences. From the genome sequence analysis we were able to identify genes that encoded for proteins known to be associated with cold survival, in addition to annotating genes that are unique to G. antarctica. For genes that are known to be involved in cold adaptation such as anti-freeze proteins (AFPs), our gene expression analysis revealed that they were differentially transcribed over time and in response to different temperatures. This indicated the presence of an array of adaptation systems that can respond to a changing but persistent cold environment. We were also able to validate the activity of all the AFPs annotated where the recombinant AFPs demonstrated anti-freeze capacity. This work is an important foundation for further collective exploration into psychrophilic microbiology where among other potential, the genes unique to this species may represent a pool of novel mechanisms for cold survival."
https://openalex.org/W2785327277,"Free or subsidised mosquito net (MN) distribution has been an increasingly important tool in efforts to combat malaria in recent decades throughout the developing world, making great strides towards eradicating this hugely detrimental disease. However, there has been increasing concern in the natural resource management and healthcare communities over alternative use of MNs, particularly in artisanal fisheries where it has been suggested they pose a threat to sustainability of fish stocks. So far, little evidence has been presented as to the global prevalence and characteristics of MN fishing, limiting global management initiatives and incentives for action across disciplines. We conducted a rapid global assessment of mosquito net fishing (MNF) observations from expert witnesses living and/or working in malarial zones using an internet survey. MNF was found to be a broadly pan-tropical activity, particularly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. MNF is conducted using a variety of deployment methods and scales including seine nets, scoop/dip nets, set nets and traps. MNF was witnessed in a broad range of marine and freshwater habitats and was seen to exploit a wide range of taxa, with capture of juvenile fish reported in more than half of responses. Perceived drivers of MNF were closely related to poverty, revealing potentially complex and arguably detrimental livelihood and food security implications which we discuss in light of current literature and management paradigms. The key policies likely to influence future impacts of MNF are in health, regarding net distribution, and natural resource management regarding restrictions on use. We outline critical directions for research and highlight the need for a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to development of both localised and broad-scale policy."
https://openalex.org/W2788701188,"Using an organotypic culture system termed human Fetal Testis Assay (hFeTA) we previously showed that 0.01 μM BPA decreases basal, but not LH-stimulated, testosterone secreted by the first trimester human fetal testis. The present study was conducted to determine the potential for a long-term antiandrogenic effect of BPA using a xenograft model, and also to study the effect of BPA on germ cell development using both the hFETA and xenograft models.Using the hFeTA system, first trimester testes were cultured for 3 days with 0.01 to 10 μM BPA. For xenografts, adult castrate male nude mice were injected with hCG and grafted with first trimester testes. Host mice received 10 μM BPA (~ 500 μg/kg/day) in their drinking water for 5 weeks. Plasma levels of total and unconjugated BPA were 0.10 μM and 0.038 μM respectively. Mice grafted with second trimester testes received 0.5 and 50 μg/kg/day BPA by oral gavage for 5 weeks.With first trimester human testes, using the hFeTA model, 10 μM BPA increased germ cell apoptosis. In xenografts, germ cell density was also reduced by BPA exposure. Importantly, BPA exposure significantly decreased the percentage of germ cells expressing the pluripotency marker AP-2γ, whilst the percentage of those expressing the pre-spermatogonial marker MAGE-A4 significantly increased. BPA exposure did not affect hCG-stimulated androgen production in first and second trimester xenografts as evaluated by both plasma testosterone level and seminal vesicle weight in host mice.Exposure to BPA at environmentally relevant concentrations impairs germ cell development in first trimester human fetal testis, whilst gonadotrophin-stimulated testosterone production was unaffected in both first and second trimester testis. Studies using first trimester human fetal testis demonstrate the complementarity of the FeTA and xenograft models for determining the respective short-term and long term effects of environmental exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2793433097,"Objective Numerous studies from diverse contexts have confirmed high stress levels and stress-associated health impairment in medical students. This study aimed to explore the differential association of perceived stress with private and training-related stressors in medical students according to their stage of medical education. Methods Participants were high-school graduates who plan to study medicine and students in their first, third, sixth, or ninth semester of medical school or in practical medical training. The self-administered questionnaire included items addressing demographic information, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire, and items addressing potential private and training-related stressors. Results Results confirmed a substantial burden of perceived stress in students at different stages of their medical education. In particular, 10–28% of students in their third or ninth semesters of medical school showed the highest values for perceived stress. Training-related stressors were most strongly associated with perceived stress, although specific stressors that determined perceived stress varied across different stages of students’ medical education. High-school graduates highly interested in pursuing medical education showed specific stressors similar to those of medical students in their third, sixth, or ninth semesters of medical school, as well as stress structures with heights of general stress rates similar to those of medical students at the beginning of practical medical training. Conclusions High-school graduates offer new, interesting information about students’ fears and needs before they begin medical school. Medical students and high-school graduates need open, comprehensive information about possible stressors at the outset of and during medical education. Programmes geared toward improving resilience behaviour and teaching new, functional coping strategies are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2787341640,"Vultures constitute an important functional group in many ecosystems, providing crucial ecosystem services both in natural and humanized environments. These scavengers are facing massive declines worldwide, but in several African countries virtually nothing is known on populations’ status and threats, hampering the development of adequate conservation strategies. In Guinea-Bissau, globally important populations of Hooded Necrosyrtes monachus and African white-backed vultures Gyps africanus were recently reported. Using the country as a study area, we aim to characterize human-vulture interactions in West Africa applying a multidisciplinary approach. We assessed the status and distribution of vulture populations using data from 1711 km of roadside transects, examined predictors of their distribution, and produced a nationwide population estimate for the Hooded Vulture, using an innovative method based on the relationship between the size of human population in settlements and vulture numbers. We conducted 47 stakeholder interviews to assess perceived roles played by vultures, and to investigate potential anthropogenic threats. Hooded vultures were strongly associated with high human population densities, whereas no relation was found between African white-backed and Rüppell’s vultures and any of the tested predictors, which included cattle density, precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, among others. We estimate a national population of 43347 Hooded vultures, the largest population reported in the species range. Respondents were generally aware of the services provided by vultures, especially waste and carcass removal, including in urban areas. Hunting for witchcraft and traditional medicine was the most frequently recognised threat, while poisoning was ranked as having the highest impact. We hypothesise that poisoning-related mortality may be affecting African white-backed and Rüppell’s vultures’ distribution and explain their scarcity in apparently highly suitable habitats. Our results suggest a mutualistic rather than a commensalistic relationship between vultures and humans, with important implications for designing and implementing conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2791964789,"It is known that the macronutrient content of a meal has different impacts on the postprandial satiety and appetite hormonal responses. Whether obesity interacts with such nutrient-dependent responses is not well characterized. We examined the postprandial appetite and satiety hormonal responses after a high-protein (HP), high-carbohydrate (HC), or high-fat (HF) mixed meal. This was a randomized cross-over study of 9 lean insulin-sensitive (mean±SEM HOMA-IR 0.83±0.10) and 9 obese insulin-resistant (HOMA-IR 4.34±0.41) young (age 21-40 years), normoglycaemic Chinese men. We measured fasting and postprandial plasma concentration of glucose, insulin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), total peptide-YY (PYY), and acyl-ghrelin in response to HP, HF, or HC meals. Overall postprandial plasma insulin response was more robust in the lean compared to obese subjects. The postprandial GLP-1 response after HF or HP meal was higher than HC meal in both lean and obese subjects. In obese subjects, HF meal induced higher response in postprandial PYY compared to HC meal. HP and HF meals also suppressed ghrelin greater compared to HC meal in the obese than lean subjects. In conclusion, a high-protein or high-fat meal induces a more favorable postprandial satiety and appetite hormonal response than a high-carbohydrate meal in obese insulin-resistant subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2786318543,"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus that is part of the normal microflora commonly found in the human digestive tract and the normal mucosa or skin of healthy individuals. However, in immunocompromised individuals, it becomes a serious health concern and a threat to their lives and is ranked as the leading fungal infection in humans worldwide. As existing treatments for this infection are non-specific or under threat of developing resistance, there is a dire necessity to find new targets for designing specific drugs to defeat this fungus. Some authors reported the presence of the transglutaminase activity in Candida and Saccharomyces, but its identity remains unknown. We report here the phenotypic effects produced by the inhibition of transglutaminase enzymatic activity with cystamine, including growth inhibition of yeast cells, induction of autophagy in response to damage caused by cystamine, alteration of the normal yeast division pattern, changes in cell wall, and inhibition of the yeast-to-mycelium transition. The latter phenomenon was also observed in the C. albicans ATCC 26555 strain. Growth inhibition by cystamine was also determined in other Candida strains, demonstrating the importance of transglutaminase in these species. Finally, we identified enolase 1 as the cell wall protein responsible for TGase activity. After studying the inhibition of enzymatic activities with anti-CaEno1 antibodies and through bioinformatics studies, we suggest that the enolase and transglutaminase catalytic sites are localized in different domains of the protein.

Covalent linkages are established between most wall components to provide stability to the cell wall. Proteins of the Gas family have been described as the main cross-linkers of wall polymers (11Free S.J. Fungal cell wall organization and biosynthesis.Adv. Genet. 2013; 81 (23419716): 33-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, other proteins are involved in this function. Transglutaminases (TGases) are multifunctional enzymes involved in several post-translational modifications, including protein cross-linking, amine incorporation, and deamination. The best known TGase activity is cross-linking through a transamidation reaction between the side chains of Gln and Lys residues, resulting in the formation of N-Ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine amide bonds (15Keillor J.W. Clouthier C.M. Apperley K.Y. Akbar A. Mulani A. Acyl transfer mechanisms of tissue transglutaminase.Bioorg. Chem. 2014; 57 (25035302): 186-19710.1016/j.bioorg.2014.06.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These enzymes are usually Ca2+-dependent, although in the case of some microorganisms and rodent intestinal mucosa, TGases also act as Ca2+-independent enzymes (16Griffin M. Casadio R. Bergamini C.M.

TGases are widely distributed in animals, plants, and microorganisms and have key roles in several biological processes, including growth regulation, differentiation, cellular adhesion, and maintenance of tissue integrity. Human TGase 2 is involved in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix and modulates the fibronectin–integrin interaction (18Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. Tissue transglutaminase is an integrin-binding adhesion co-receptor for fibronectin.J.

It is involved in a number of diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Crohn’s disease, fibrosis, cancer metastasis, and other diseases (20Eckert R.L. Kaartinen M.T. Nurminskaya M. Belkin A.M. Colak G. Johnson G.V. Mehta K. Transglutaminase regulation of cell function.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94 (24692352): 383-41710.1152/physrev.00019.2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, TGase is also involved in cross-linking cell wall components in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (21Waffenschmidt S. Kusch T. Woessner J.P. A transglutaminase immunologically related to tissue transglutaminase catalyzes cross-linking of cell wall proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Physiol. 1999; 121 (10557250): 1003-101510.1104/pp.121.3.1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Given the importance of TGases in the development of serious diseases, much research has focused on exploring specific TGase inhibitors with a therapeutic purpose (22Keillor J.W. Apperley K.Y. Akbar A. Inhibitors of tissue transglutaminase.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2015; 36 (25500711): 32-4010.1016/j.tips.2014.10.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). TGase activity was previously reported in the cell walls of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. This enzyme establishes covalent cross-links between proteins, and its activity is affected by the specific inhibitor cystamine, which decreases the incorporation of several proteins into the cell wall and avoids regeneration of protoplasts, as well as the yeast-to-mycelium transition, indicating a role in the formation of covalent cross-links between wall proteins and chitin and/or glucan (23Ruiz-Herrera J. Iranzo M. Elorza M.V. Sentandreu R. Mormeneo S. Involvement of transglutaminase in the formation of covalent cross-links in the cell wall of Candida albicans.Arch.

In this work, we report the identification of enolase 1 as the cell wall protein that has TGase activity, as well as the phenotypic changes produced by inhibition of TGase. Taken together, our data indicate that TGase is a putative target for designing new drugs to control C. albicans infection. The standard protocol to determine TGase activity measures the incorporation of radioactive putrescine as a diamino acid analogue into TCA-precipitable material (23Ruiz-Herrera J. Iranzo M. Elorza M.V. Sentandreu R. Mormeneo S. Involvement of transglutaminase in the formation of covalent cross-links in the cell wall of Candida albicans.Arch.

To determine TGase activity in cell walls (CW), we used a similar protocol, except that purified cell walls were used as the source of both TGase enzyme and endogenous acceptors. Using this procedure, there were many quantitative problems due to the non-specific adsorption of putrescine, which produced high levels of radioactivity in the negative controls. To confirm the presence of radioactive putrescine cross-linked to proteins in the TCA-precipitable material, this fraction was solubilized with zymolyase and analyzed by paper chromatography (Fig. 1A). Nearly 40% of total [14C]putrescine radioactivity was found at the origin, indicating that the substrate was cross-linked to high-molecular-weight molecules. Approximately 40% of radioactivity corresponded to unincorporated [14C]putrescine, whereas the remaining radioactivity was distributed through the paper. This was likely due to non-specific adsorption, as confirmed by paper chromatography performed with radioactive putrescine alone (Fig. 1A). The use of either radioactive putrescine or lysine as substrates for TGase from guinea pig liver was evaluated (Table S1). In this assay, the incorporation of radioactive substrates was similar, as well as the inhibition of the TGase activity observed with cystamine. Therefore, we determined TGase activity using [14C]lysine and purified C. albicans cell walls. TGase activity was dependent on time up to 3–4 h (Fig. 1B). The presence of EDTA inhibited TGase activity, similar to that produced by cystamine or boiling preparations used in the assay (Fig. 1B). To study wall-endogenous acceptors of TGase, purified cell walls were incubated with [14C]lysine as described and sequentially extracted with SDS, zymolyase, and chitinase. In each case, solubilized materials were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. From the total amount of radioactivity incorporated into cell walls by the action of TGase activity, nearly 40% was solubilized by SDS, whereas zymolyase released 15% and chitinase 23%, respectively. SDS-solubilized proteins had apparent molecular masses of less than 50 kDa, whereas the material released by either zymolyase or chitinase showed molecular masses greater than 180 kDa, i.e. the chitinase-released proteins of the highest molecular mass (Fig. 1C). The mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins solubilized with 2% SDS in the radioactive region of the gel shown in Fig. 1C revealed the presence of 1046 unique proteins (Table S2). These proteins were classified with the Gene Ontology Panther Classification System (Fig. S1). The most abundant classes for molecular function corresponded to proteins with catalytic, binding, structural, and transporter activities. In the case of protein classes, the most abundant proteins were nucleic acid-binding, oxidoreductases, hydrolases, and transferases. In the case of the proteins released with zymolyase, we identified 37 proteins (Table S3). Panther classified these proteins according to molecular function in seven categories, with catalytic, binding, and structural the most frequent categories (Fig. S2). According to protein class, they were categorized in 10 groups. The classes with more proteins were nucleic acid-binding proteins, oxidoreductases, hydrolases, and transporters. Finally, the treatment with chitinase released 41 proteins (Table S4), which were classified by Panther in six molecular function categories, with catalytic, binding, structural, and transporter activities the most represented, although according to molecular class, they were grouped in nine categories. The two most represented were nucleic acid-binding and oxidoreductase proteins (Fig. S3). Remarkably, enolase 1 was found in the proteins sequentially extracted with 2% SDS, zymolyase, and chitinase. To study the role of TGases in the osmosensitivity of cells after digestion with zymolyase, C. albicans yeast cells were incubated with 100 mm cystamine or 3.5 mm MDC for 1.5, 2, and 4 h before treatment with glucanases for up to 120 min. Cell cultures treated with zymolyase alone showed a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm of 40% at 60 min that was maintained for the entire incubation time, while cells incubated with cystamine for different times achieved a loss in absorbance of ∼70% at 20 min of incubation with zymolyase, which slowly decreased up to 95% at 100 min (Fig. 1D). In the case of impaired osmotic protection by the inhibition of TGase activity by MDC, this effect was not as dramatic as that shown with cystamine. A decrease of 30% in absorbance was observed in the first 20 min, reaching a maximum of 70% at 120 min of incubation (Fig. 1E). Thus, the inhibition of TGase activity by cystamine and MDC affects the osmotic protection of the cell wall after glucan digestion with zymolyase. Growth curves of C. albicans cells grown at different cystamine concentrations showed an inhibition of growth cultures as a function of concentration of cystamine. Maximum inhibition was obtained at 200 mm at 6 h of incubation (Fig. 2A, inset). However, the optical density of cultures was almost the same as the control at 24 h, meaning that the cystamine effect reverted. To test this hypothesis, a second dose of cystamine was added to cultures at 6 h (Fig. 2B). A clear effect of cystamine on growth rate was observed and persisted until 24 h of incubation. At this time, the optical density of the culture incubated with 200 mm cystamine was only half the value of the control culture. This means that cystamine transiently inhibits growth rate. Moreover, to determine whether this effect is due to a reversible effect or instability of cystamine, two experiments were carried out previously. 4M. Iranzo and S. Mormeneo, unpublished results. When culture media from yeast cell cultures grown in cystamine with little or no growth were removed and used with fresh cells, cystamine worked properly. However, to analyze a possible instability of the product, fresh media with the different concentrations of cystamine were previously incubated under the same conditions of the experiment for 3 days, and cells were then inoculated, obtaining similar results with those described in this paper. Cells obtained from the growth curve at 6 h of incubation with different concentrations of cystamine were analyzed by SEM to evaluate possible morphological changes (Fig. 2A, inset). A population corresponding to 4.3, 3.2, and 4.3% for 50, 100, and 200 mm cystamine, respectively, showed defects in cell separation. Moreover, fibrillar material on the cell surface of cystamine-treated cells appeared on the biggest cells only. They corresponded to 1–2% of cells treated with either 50 or 100 mm cystamine, whereas the affected cells were 8.4% in 200 mm cystamine (Fig. 2C). Remarkably, protrusions of ∼100 nm in diameter on the cell surface were visualized in cells treated only with 200 mm cystamine (Fig. 2C), which can be extracellular vesicles, cell debris, or small cell wall expansions due to the osmotic shock. Next, the changes in the ultrastructure of cells were investigated using cells grown for 6 h with 0, 50, 100, and 200 mm cystamine. An accumulation of electron-dense material in vacuoles was observed, which was augmented with increasing amounts of cystamine (Fig. 3, A–D, arrows). Some vacuoles contained lipid droplets (Fig. 3, D and E, stars), and others occupied most of the cytoplasm (Fig. 3E, 200 mm cystamine). These data suggest an increase in the degradation rate of intracellular material, characteristic of the autophagy process in yeast cells (25Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Formation process of autophagosome is traced with Apg8/Aut7p in yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147 (10525546): 435-44610.1083/jcb.147.2.435Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). TEM of thin section of cells grown with no TGase inhibitor show the characteristic morphology of yeast cells. When cells were cultured in cystamine-containing medium, an alteration of the division pattern was observed; some cells have two budding sites on opposite poles (Fig. 3E, 50 mm cystamine); other cells budded, but the separation of the mother-daughter cell was not completed. Moreover, some cells began the budding process at other sites (Fig. 3E, 100 and 200 mm cystamine). An analysis at ×200,000 revealed loss of electron-dense material in inner walls when cells were treated with cystamine (Fig. 3F, 50, 100, and 200 mm cystamine), with accumulation of electron-dense material in the outer wall (Fig. 3F, stars) compared with control cells. Furthermore, an increase in the number of small vesicles near the plasma membrane was seen. These data suggest that TGase activity inhibition affects the organization of cell wall components and induces increased autophagy in response to the stress caused by cystamine. To demons"

In this work, we aim to identify the mechanisms by which metformin and simvastatin (S) could protect from liver cancer. Huh7.5 cells were infected with HCV particles and treated with M+S. Human primary hepatocytes were treated with M+S. Treatment with both drugs inhibited Huh7.5 cell growth and HCV infection. In non-infected cells S increased translational controlled tumor protein (TCTP) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) proteins while M inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and TCTP. Simvastatin and metformin co-administered down-regulated mTOR and TCTP, while PTEN was increased. In cells infected by HCV, mTOR, TCTP, p62 and light chain 3B II (LC3BII) were increased and PTEN was decreased. S+M treatment increased PTEN, p62 and LC3BII in Huh7.5 cells. In human primary hepatocytes, metformin treatment inhibited mTOR and PTEN, but up-regulated p62, LC3BII and Caspase 3. In conclusion, simvastatin and metformin inhibited cell growth and HCV infection in vitro. In human hepatocytes, metformin increased cell-death markers. These findings suggest that M+S treatment could be useful in therapeutic prevention of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2786082558,"Recent studies of honeybees and bumblebees have examined combinatory effects of different stressors, as insect pollinators are naturally exposed to multiple stressors. At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions. In contrast, we report seemingly beneficial effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to agricultural agents, which might demonstrate a surprising biological capacity for coping with stressors, possibly through hormetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2789914994,"The nodes and their connection relationships are the two main bodies for dynamic complex networks. In existing theoretical researches, the phenomena of stabilization and synchronization for complex dynamical networks are generally regarded as the dynamic characteristic behaviors of the nodes, which are mainly caused by coupling effect of connection relationships between nodes. However, the connection relationships between nodes are also one main body of a time-varying dynamic complex network, and thus they may evolve with time and maybe show certain characteristic phenomena. For example, the structural balance in the social networks and the synaptic facilitation in the biological neural networks. Therefore, it is important to investigate theoretically the reasons in dynamics for the occurrence. Especially, from the angle of large-scale systems, how the dynamic behaviors of nodes (such as the individuals, neurons) contribute to the connection relationships is one of worthy research directions. In this paper, according to the structural balance theory of triad proposed by F. Heider, we mainly focus on the connection relationships body, which is regarded as one of the two subsystems (another is the nodes body), and try to find the dynamic mechanism of the structural balance with the internal state behaviors of the nodes. By using the Riccati linear matrix differential equation as the dynamic model of connection relationships subsystem, it is proved under some mathematic conditions that the connection relationships subsystem is asymptotical structural balance via the effects of the coupling roles with the internal state of nodes. Finally, the simulation example is given to show the validity of the method in this paper."

Machine learning tools, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are then welcome to automatically generate high-performance classifiers from available data. Supported by the image datasets available at the largest online database on ant biology, the AntWeb (www.antweb.org), we propose here an ensemble of CNNs to identify ant genera directly from the head, profile and dorsal perspectives of ant images. Transfer learning is also considered to improve the individual performance of the CNN classifiers. The performance achieved by the classifiers is diverse enough to promote a reduction in the overall classification error when they are combined in an ensemble, achieving an accuracy rate of over 80% on top-1 classification and an accuracy of over 90% on top-3 classification."
https://openalex.org/W2791950871,"Arecoline, the major alkaloid of areca nut, is known to induce oral carcinogenesis, however, its mechanism is still needed to elucidate. This study investigated the effects of arecoline on cell viability and cell-cycle progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells as well as a relevant cellular gene expression. The results showed that a low concentration of arecoline (0.025 μg/ml) increased OSCC cell viability, proportion of cells in G2/M phase and cell proliferation. Simultaneously, it induced IL-6, STAT3 and c-Myc expression. Interestingly, c-myc promoter activity was also induced by arecoline. MiR-22 expression in arecoline-treated OSCC cells was suppressed and comparable to an upregulated c-Myc expression. In arecoline-treated OSCC cells, oncostatin M (OSM) expression was significantly upregulated and inversely correlated with miR-22 expression. Likewise, OSM expression and its post-transcriptional activity were significantly decreased in miR-22-transfected OSCC and 293FT cells. This result demonstrated that miR-22 directly targeted OSM. Interestingly, miR-22 played an important role as a tumor suppresser on suppressing cell proliferation, migration and cell-cycle progression of OSCC cells. This result suggested the effect of arecoline to promote cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression of OSCC cells might be involved in induction of c-Myc expression and reduction of miR-22 resulting in OSM upregulation."

Although strong relationships between TMDs and other pain and diseases exist, few studies have comprehensively assessed the association between chronic diseases, ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic disorders and TMD.Of 25,534 individuals included in the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010-2012), 17,575 aged ≥20 years who completed survey items on TMD symptoms were included for cross-sectional analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between chronic diseases, ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic disorders and examination findings, and TMD symptoms after adjusting for various confounding variables.Out of 17,575 participants, 2,059 (11.75%) reported experience of ≥1 TMD symptom(s). Compared to individuals without chronic disease, those with asthma (odds ratio (OR) 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.96), migraine (1.44; 1.26-1.65), osteoarthritis (1.51; 1.20-1.89), thyroid dysfunction (1.49; 1.13-1.96), and depressive symptoms (1.51; 1.29-1.77) had higher ORs for TMD prevalence. Participants with tinnitus (1.97; 1.70-2.27), hearing difficulties (1.55; 1.29-1.87), dizziness (1.52; 1.27-1.82), rhinitis (1.46; 1.28-1.65), and xerophthalmia (1.82; 1.57-2.12) also displayed higher ORs for TMD prevalence. Patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis upon otolaryngologic examination exhibited an OR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.11-1.87) for TMD prevalence, while that for individuals with abnormal laryngoscopic results was 0.57 (95% CI 0.36-0.90).These findings imply that TMDs, chronic diseases, and ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic disorders hold various correlations, suggesting the need for multitarget approaches to effectively address this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2791172439,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in Canada. While stroke care has improved dramatically over the last decade, outcomes following stroke among patients treated in rural hospitals have not yet been reported in Canada.To describe variation in 30-day post-stroke in-hospital mortality rates between rural and urban academic hospitals in Canada. We also examined 24/7 in-hospital access to CT scanners and selected services in rural hospitals.We included Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) data on adjusted 30-day in-hospital mortality following stroke from 2007 to 2011 for all acute care hospitals in Canada excluding Quebec and the Territories. We categorized rural hospitals as those located in rural small towns providing 24/7 emergency physician coverage with inpatient beds. Urban hospitals were academic centres designated as Level 1 or 2 trauma centres. We computed descriptive data on local access to a CT scanner and other services and compared mean 30-day adjusted post-stroke mortality rates for rural and urban hospitals to the overall Canadian rate.A total of 286 rural hospitals (3.4 million emergency department (ED) visits/year) and 24 urban hospitals (1.5 million ED visits/year) met inclusion criteria. From 2007 to 2011, 30-day in-hospital mortality rates following stroke were significantly higher in rural than in urban hospitals and higher than the Canadian average for every year except 2008 (rural average range = 18.26 to 21.04 and urban average range = 14.11 to 16.78). Only 11% of rural hospitals had a CT-scanner, 1% had MRI, 21% had in-hospital ICU, 94% had laboratory and 92% had basic x-ray facilities.Rural hospitals in Canada had higher 30-day in-hospital mortality rates following stroke than urban academic hospitals and the Canadian average. Rural hospitals also have very limited local access to CT scanners and ICUs. These rural/urban discrepancies are cause for concern in the context of Canada's universal health care system."
https://openalex.org/W2793674588,"Research on the relationship between changes in the gut microbiota and human disease, including AIDS, is a growing field. However, studies on the eukaryotic component of the intestinal microbiota have just begun and have not yet been conducted in HIV-infected patients. Moreover, eukaryotic community profiling is influenced by the use of different methodologies at each step of culture-independent techniques. Herein, initially, four DNA extraction protocols were compared to test the efficiency of each method in recovering eukaryotic DNA from fecal samples. Our results revealed that recovering eukaryotic components from fecal samples differs significantly among DNA extraction methods. Subsequently, the composition of the intestinal eukaryotic microbiota was evaluated in HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers through clone sequencing, high-throughput sequencing of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers 1 (ITS1) and 2 (ITS2) amplicons and real-time PCRs. Our results revealed that not only richness (Chao-1 index) and alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) differ between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, depending on the molecular strategy used, but also the global eukaryotic community composition, with little overlapping taxa found between techniques. Moreover, our results based on cloning libraries and ITS1/ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing showed significant differences in fungal composition between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, but without distinct clusters separating the two groups. Malassezia restricta was significantly more prevalent in fecal samples of HIV-infected patients, according to cloning libraries, whereas operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were significantly more abundant in fecal samples of HIV-infected patients compared to healthy subjects in both ITS subregions. Finally, real-time PCR showed the presence of Microsporidia, Giardia lamblia, Blastocystis and Hymenolepis diminuta in different proportions in fecal samples from HIV patients as compared to healthy individuals. Our work revealed that the use of different sequencing approaches can impact the perceived eukaryotic diversity results of the human gut. We also provide a more comprehensive view of the eukaryotic community in the gut of HIV-infected patients through the complementarity of the different molecular techniques used. Combining these various methodologies may provide a gold standard for a more complete characterization of the eukaryotic microbiome in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2793736592,"The ability of whole body vibration (WBV) to increase energy expenditure (EE) has been investigated to some extent in the past using short-term single exercises or sets of single exercises. However, the current practice in WBV training for fitness is based on the execution of multiple exercises during a WBV training session for a period of at least 20 min; nevertheless, very limited and inconsistent data are available on EE during long term WBV training session. This crossover study was designed to demonstrate, in an adequately powered sample of participants, the ability of WBV to increase the metabolic cost of exercise vs. no vibration over the time span of a typical WBV session for fitness (20 min). Twenty-two physically active young males exercised on a vibration platform (three identical sets of six different exercises) using an accelerometer-verified vibration stimulus in both the WBV and no vibration condition. Oxygen consumption was measured with indirect calorimetry and expressed as area under the curve (O2(AUC)). Results showed that, in the overall 20-min training session, WBV increased both the O2(AUC) and the estimated EE vs. no vibration by about 22% and 20%, respectively (P<0.001 for both, partial eta squared [η2] ≥0.35) as well as the metabolic equivalent of task (+5.5%, P = 0.043; η2 = 0.02) and the rate of perceived exertion (+13%, P<0.001; ŋ2 = 0.16).

Through Taqman transporter array technology we assessed the impact of nilotinib on mRNA expression of ABC transporters, with ABCC6 identified as a transporter of interest. Additionally, increased expression of ABCC6 mRNA was observed during in vitro development of nilotinib resistance in BCR-ABL1-expressing cell lines. K562 cells exposed to gradually increasing concentrations of nilotinib (to 2 μM) expressed up to 57-fold higher levels of ABCC6 mRNA when compared with control cells (p = 0.002). Analogous results were observed in nilotinib resistant K562-Dox cells (up to 33-fold higher levels of ABCC6, p = 0.002). IC50 experiments were conducted on patient mononuclear cells in the absence and presence of three ABCC6 inhibitors: indomethacin, probenecid and pantoprazole. Results demonstrated that all three inhibitors significantly reduced nilotinib IC50 (p<0.001) indicating ABCC6 is likely involved in nilotinib transport. Cell line data confirmed these findings. Similar results were obtained for dasatinib, but not imatinib. Combined, these studies suggest that nilotinib and dasatinib are likely substrates of ABCC6 and to our knowledge, this is the first report of ABCC6 involvement in TKI transport. In addition, ABCC6 overexpression may also contribute to nilotinib and dasatinib resistance in vitro. With nilotinib and dasatinib now front line therapy options in the treatment of CML, concomitant administration of ABCC6 inhibitors may present an attractive option to enhance TKI efficacy."

Methods Ocular surface disease index (OSDI), Schirmer’s test, tear film break-up time (TBUT), keratoepitheliopathy (KEP) score with fluorescein, and meibomian gland parameters were assessed in 45 eyes of 45 patients with NTG (NTG group), who received topical PGA monotherapy for more than 1 year. The results were compared to those of 40 eyes of 40 normal subjects (control group). Medication compliance was assessed by an 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with medication compliance. Results There was a significant difference in OSDI (P = 0.043), Schirmer’s test (P < 0.001), TBUT (P < 0.001), KEP score (P = 0.015) and all meibomian gland parameters (all P < 0.001) between two groups. When the NTG group was divided into compliant and non-compliant groups based on the scores of MMAS-8, 30 (75%) patients were classified into the compliant group. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the lid margin score (OR, 0.256; 95% CI, 0.072–0.908, P = 0.035), meibum score (OR, 0.144; 95% CI, 0.023–0.915, P = 0.04), and meibo score (OR, 0.344; 95% CI, 0.140–0.845, P = 0.02) were significant factors associated with compliance in patients with NTG. The meibomian gland parameters showed a negative correlation with medication compliance (all P < 0.005). Conclusions Malfunction of the meibomian glands can be an important clinical finding associated with compliance of PGA monotherapy in patients with NTG."
https://openalex.org/W2790486130,"The impact of selection bias on the results of clinical trials has been analyzed extensively for trials of two treatments, yet its impact in multi-arm trials is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate selection bias in multi-arm trials by its impact on the type I error probability. We propose two models for selection bias, so-called biasing policies, that both extend the classic guessing strategy by Blackwell and Hodges. We derive the distribution of the F-test statistic under the misspecified outcome model and provide a formula for the type I error probability under selection bias. We apply the presented approach to quantify the influence of selection bias in multi-arm trials with increasing number of treatment groups using a permuted block design for different assumptions and different biasing strategies. Our results confirm previous findings that smaller block sizes lead to a higher proportion of sequences with inflated type I error probability. Astonishingly, our results also show that the proportion of sequences with inflated type I error probability remains constant when the number of treatment groups is increased. Realizing that the impact of selection bias cannot be completely eliminated, we propose a bias adjusted statistical model and show that the power of the statistical test is only slightly deflated for larger block sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2785516360,"Audible sound is a ubiquitous environmental factor in nature that transmits oscillatory compressional pressure through the substances. To investigate the property of the sound as a mechanical stimulus for cells, an experimental system was set up using 94.0 dB sound which transmits approximately 10 mPa pressure to the cultured cells. Based on research on mechanotransduction and ultrasound effects on cells, gene responses to the audible sound stimulation were analyzed by varying several sound parameters: frequency, wave form, composition, and exposure time. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed a distinct suppressive effect for several mechanosensitive and ultrasound-sensitive genes that were triggered by sounds. The effect was clearly observed in a wave form- and pressure level-specific manner, rather than the frequency, and persisted for several hours. At least two mechanisms are likely to be involved in this sound response: transcriptional control and RNA degradation. ST2 stromal cells and C2C12 myoblasts exhibited a robust response, whereas NIH3T3 cells were partially and NB2a neuroblastoma cells were completely insensitive, suggesting a cell type-specific response to sound. These findings reveal a cell-level systematic response to audible sound and uncover novel relationships between life and sound."

The main feature of VS is irregular blisters that occur on the lips, tongue, oral mucosa, hoof crown and nipple. Humans can also be infected with vesicular stomatitis and develop meningitis. This study analyses 2014 American VS outbreaks in order to accurately predict vesicular stomatitis outbreak trends.American VS outbreaks data were collected from OIE. The data for VS keywords were obtained by inputting 24 disease-related keywords into Google Trends. After calculating the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, it was found that there was a relationship between outbreaks and keywords derived from Google Trends. Finally, the predicted model was constructed based on qualitative classification and quantitative regression.For the regression model, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the predicted outbreaks and actual outbreaks are 0.953 and 0.948, respectively. For the qualitative classification model, we constructed five classification predictive models and chose the best classification predictive model as the result. The results showed, SN (sensitivity), SP (specificity) and ACC (prediction accuracy) values of the best classification predictive model are 78.52%,72.5% and 77.14%, respectively.This study applied Google search data to construct a qualitative classification model and a quantitative regression model.

https://openalex.org/W2786169098,"Codon adaptation index (CAI) is a measure of synonymous codon usage biases given a usage reference. Through mutation, selection, and drift, viruses can optimize their replication efficiency and produce more offspring, which could increase the chance of secondary transmission. To evaluate how higher CAI towards the host has been associated with higher viral titers, we explored temporal trends of several historic and extensively sequenced zoonotic flaviviruses and relationships within the genus itself. To showcase evolutionary and epidemiological relationships associated with silent, adaptive synonymous changes of viruses, we used codon usage tables from human housekeeping and antiviral immune genes, as well as tables from arthropod vectors and vertebrate species involved in the flavivirus maintenance cycle. We argue that temporal trends of CAI changes could lead to a better understanding of zoonotic emergences, evolutionary dynamics, and host adaptation. CAI appears to help illustrate historically relevant trends of well-characterized viruses, in different viral species and genetic diversity within a single species. CAI can be a useful tool together with in vivo and in vitro kinetics, phylodynamics, and additional functional genomics studies to better understand species trafficking and viral emergence in a new host."

We report that neural patterning determination occurs at the very early stage in this differentiation. Undifferentiated hPSCs expressed basal levels of the transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) that dominantly drove hPSCs into the “default” rostral fate at the beginning of differentiation. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) through CHIR99021 application sustained transient expression of the transcription factor NANOG at early differentiation stages through Wnt signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2791963185,"Clinical studies in type 2 diabetes (T2D) primarily focused on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in protein-coding regions. Recently, the SNPs located in noncoding regions have also been recognized to play an important role in disease susceptibility. The super enhancer is a cluster of transcriptional enhancers located in noncoding regions. It plays a critical role in cell-type specific gene expression. However, the exact mechanism of the super enhancer SNPs for T2D remains unclear. In this study, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and T2D cell/tissue-specific histone modification ChIP-seq data to identify T2D-associated SNPs in super enhancer, followed by comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to further explore the functional importance of these SNPs. We identified several interesting T2D super enhancer SNPs. Interesting, most of them were clustered within the same or neighboring super enhancers. A number of SNPs are involved in chromatin interactive regulation and/or potentially influence the binding affinity of transcription factors. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed a significant enrichment in several well-known signaling pathways and regulatory process, e.g. WNT signaling pathway, which plays a key role in T2D metabolism. Our results highlighted the potential functional importance of T2D super enhancer SNPs, which may yield novel insights into the pathogenesis of T2D."

Our results suggested that Japanese harbour seals possibly consisted of more than two lineages and secondary contact of populations after a long isolation. Furthermore, one of the lineage was made only by Japanese harbour seals (Group P1). The proportion of Group P1 was the highest at the South West and gradually decreased towards the North East of Hokkaido, Japan. On the other hand, the haplotypes do not belonged to Group P1 showed close relationship to the seals in the North Pacific. Based on the fossil record of harbour seal in Japan and the range of sea ice during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Group P1 might have entered Japan before the LGM and became isolated due to the geographical boundary, and gradually extended its range from the South West towards the North East of Hokkaido after the disappearance of the sea ice, while the seals which are not in Group P1 immigrated into Japan from the North Pacific."

However, the precise interaction of C. acnes with blood cells and plasma proteins has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we have investigated the molecular interaction of C. acnes with platelets and plasma proteins. We report that the ability of C. acnes to aggregate platelets is dependent on phylotype, with a significantly lower ability amongst type IB isolates, and the interaction of specific donor-dependent plasma proteins (or concentrations thereof) with C. acnes. Pretreatment of C. acnes with plasma reduces the lag time before aggregation demonstrating that pre-deposition of plasma proteins on C. acnes is an important step in platelet aggregation. Using mass spectrometry we identified several plasma proteins deposited on C. acnes, including IgG, fibrinogen and complement factors. Inhibition of IgG, fibrinogen or complement decreased C. acnes-mediated platelet aggregation, demonstrating the importance of these plasma proteins for aggregation. The interaction of C. acnes and platelets was visualized using fluorescence microscopy, verifying the presence of IgG and fibrinogen as components of the aggregates, and co-localization of C. acnes and platelets in the aggregates. Here, we have demonstrated the ability of C. acnes to activate and aggregate platelets in a bacterium and donor-specific fashion, as well as added mechanistic insights into this interaction."

Carbon source is an important factor for surfactin production. However, the mechanism that bacteria utilize cellulose, the most abundant substance in the intestines of herbivores, to produce surfactin remains unclear. Here, we used B. subtilis HH2, isolated from the feces of a giant panda, as a model to determine changes in surfactin expression in the presence of different concentrations of cellulose by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and high-performance liquid chromatography. We further investigated the antimicrobial effects of surfactin against three common intestinal pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enterica) and its resistance to high temperature (60-121°C), pH (1-12), trypsin (100-300 μg/mL, pH 8), and pepsin (100-300 μg/mL, pH 2). The results showed that the surfactin expressed lowest in bacteria cultured in the presence of 1% glucose medium as the carbon source, whereas increased in an appropriate cellulose concentration (0.67% glucose and 0.33% cellulose). The surfactin could inhibit E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but did not affect efficiently for Salmonella enterica. The antibacterial ability of surfactin did not differ according to temperature (60-100°C), pH (2-11), trypsin (100-300 μg/mL), and pepsin (100-300 μg/mL; P > 0.05), but decreased significantly at extreme environments (121°C, pH 1 or 12; P < 0.05) compared with that in the control group (37°C, pH = 7, without any protease). In conclusion, our findings indicated that B. subtilis HH2 could increase surfactin expression in an appropriate cellulose environment and thus provide benefits to improve the intestinal health of herbivores."

High-throughput technologies are now broadly accessible but their assay development from baseline remains resource-intensive and challenging. Focusing on this assay development process, we here describe a target discovery screen using pooled shRNA libraries and next-generation sequencing (NGS) deconvolution in a cell line model of Ewing sarcoma. In a strategy designed for comparative and synthetic lethal studies, we screened for targets specific to the A673 Ewing sarcoma cell line. Methods, results and pitfalls are described for the entire multi-step screening procedure, from lentiviral shRNA delivery to bioinformatics analysis, illustrating a complete model workflow. We demonstrate that successful studies are feasible from the first assay performance and independent of specialized screening units. Furthermore, we show that a resource-saving screen depth of 100-fold average shRNA representation can suffice to generate reproducible target hits despite heterogeneity in the derived datasets. Because statistical analysis methods are debatable for such datasets, we created ProFED, an analysis package designed to facilitate descriptive data analysis and hit calling using an aim-oriented profile filtering approach. In its versatile design, this open-source online tool provides fast and easy analysis of shRNA and other count-based datasets to complement other analytical algorithms."

Methods We examined the relations of physical activity and TV viewing time before and after diagnosis with mortality among 5182 U.S. adults aged 50–71 years from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort who survived a first primary hematologic cancer between 1995–1996 and 2011. Results For the pre- and post-diagnosis analyses, we confirmed 2606 and 613 deaths respectively. In multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models, comparing high (≥4 hrs/wk) versus low (<1 hr/wk) activity levels, pre-diagnosis physical activity was associated with 18%-22% reduced risks of all-cause mortality among all hematologic cancer survivors, and survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia, respectively. Additional control for BMI had little impact on the results, expect for myeloma survivors, for whom the association was no longer significant. Post-diagnosis physical activity was related to risk reductions in mortality ranging from 36%-47%. The associations for TV viewing did not show a clear pattern. Conclusion Our study suggests that pre- and post-diagnosis physical activity is associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality among hematologic cancer survivors. Further research is required to confirm this observation."

In this paper, the frost formation on the surfaces of butterfly wings from ten different species was observed, and the contact angles were measured after 0 to 6 frosting/defrosting cycles. The results show that no obvious changes in contact angle for the butterfly wing specimens were not obvious during the frosting/defrosting process. Further, the conclusion was inferred that the topography of the butterfly wing surface forms a special space structure which has a larger space inside that can accommodate more frozen droplets; this behavior prevents destruction of the structure. The findings of this study may provide a basis and new concepts for the design of novel industrially important surfaces to inhibit frost/ice growth, such as durable anti-icing coatings, which may decrease or prevent the socio-economic loss."
https://openalex.org/W2787564798,"Dysregulated matriptase activity has been established as a key contributor to cancer progression through its activation of growth factors, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Despite its critical role and prevalence in many human cancers, limitations to developing an effective matriptase inhibitor include weak binding affinity, poor selectivity, and short circulating half-life. We applied rational and combinatorial approaches to engineer a potent inhibitor based on the hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1), a natural matriptase inhibitor. The first Kunitz domain (KD1) of HAI-1 has been well established as a minimal matriptase-binding and inhibition domain, whereas the second Kunitz domain (KD2) is inactive and involved in negative regulation. Here, we replaced the inactive KD2 domain of HAI-1 with an engineered chimeric variant of KD2/KD1 domains and fused the resulting construct to an antibody Fc domain to increase valency and circulating serum half-life. The final protein variant contains four stoichiometric binding sites that we showed were needed to effectively inhibit matriptase with a Ki of 70 ± 5 pm, an increase of 120-fold compared with the natural HAI-1 inhibitor, to our knowledge making it one of the most potent matriptase inhibitors identified to date. Furthermore, the engineered inhibitor demonstrates a protease selectivity profile similar to that of wildtype KD1 but distinct from that of HAI-1. It also inhibits activation of the natural pro-HGF substrate and matriptase expressed on cancer cells with at least an order of magnitude greater efficacy than KD1."
https://openalex.org/W2790075576,"Recent studies in mice have demonstrated a sexual dimorphism in circadian entrainment to scheduled feeding. On a time restricted diet, males tend to develop food anticipatory activity (FAA) sooner than females and with a higher amplitude of activity. The underlying cause of this sex difference remains unknown. One study suggests that sex hormones, both androgens and estrogens, modulate food anticipatory activity in mice. Here we present results suggesting that the sex difference in FAA is unrelated to gonadal sex hormones. While a sex difference between males and females in FAA on a timed, calorie restricted diet was observed there were no differences between intact and gonadectomized mice in the onset or magnitude of FAA. To test other sources of the sex difference in circadian entrainment to scheduled feeding, we used sex chromosome copy number mutants, but there was no difference in FAA when comparing XX, XY-, XY-;Sry Tg, and XX;Sry Tg mice, demonstrating that gene dosage of sex chromosomes does not mediate the sex difference in FAA. Next, we masculinized female mice by treating them with 17-beta estradiol during the neonatal period; yet again, we saw no difference in FAA between control and masculinized females. Finally, we observed that there was no longer a sex difference in FAA for older mice, suggesting that the sex difference in FAA is age-dependent. Thus, our study demonstrates that singular manipulations of gonadal hormones, sex chromosomes, or developmental patterning are not able to explain the difference in FAA between young male and female mice."

Additionally, 11 Boxers with large B-cell lymphoma and the normal IGHV repertoire of six control dogs (three Boxers and three non-Boxers) were sequenced. IGHV3-41 was preferentially used in Boxers with other forms of lymphoma and without lymphoproliferative disease. However, preferential use of unmutated IGHV genes was unique to Boxers with CLL, suggesting Boxers may be a valuable model to investigate unmutated CLL."

For this purpose we transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with cDNA coding for Kv4.2 wild-type (wt) or KChIP binding-deficient Kv4.2 mutants. All channels were equipped with an externally accessible hemagglutinin (HA)-tag and an EGFP-tag, which was attached to the C-terminal end. Combined analyses of EGFP self-fluorescence, surface HA immunostaining and patch-clamp recordings demonstrated similar dendritic trafficking and functional surface expression for Kv4.2[wt]HA,EGFP and the KChIP binding-deficient Kv4.2[A14K]HA,EGFP. Coexpression of exogenous KChIP2 augmented the surface expression of Kv4.2[wt]HA,EGFP but not Kv4.2[A14K]HA,EGFP. Notably, activity-dependent decrease in availability was more pronounced in Kv4.2[wt]HA,EGFP + KChIP2 coexpressing than in Kv4.2[A14K]HA,EGFP + KChIP2 coexpressing neurons. Our results do not support the notion that accessory KChIP binding is a prerequisite for dendritic trafficking and functional surface expression of Kv4.2 channels, however, accessory KChIP binding may play a potential role in Kv4.2 modulation during intrinsic plasticity processes."
https://openalex.org/W2794001970,"The Kuroshio Current intrudes in the bottom layer of the East China Sea continental shelf from the northeast of Taiwan via two bottom branches named the Nearshore Kuroshio Branch Current (NKBC, along the 60 m isobath) and the Offshore Kuroshio Branch Current (OKBC, along the 100 m isobath). However, knowledge on the macrofaunal responses to these bottom branches is limited. This study examined the variations in the benthic macrofaunal community in a section of the East China Sea under the influence of the NKBC. Seven sites corresponding to three regions (the west, middle and east region) were sampled using an Agassiz trawl net at a monthly rate from February to November 2015 (except in August). A total of 270 macrofaunal species were collected in this study. Cluster analysis and nMDS ordination revealed three communities: the inshore, Kuroshio and offshore communities, roughly corresponding to the west, middle and east of NKBC route. Significant differences in the species composition (one-way PERMANOVA) and diversity indices (one-way ANOVA) among the regions and communities were observed, while no statistically significant difference among the months was detected. The indicator species also varied among the communities, with Sternaspis scutata and Odontamblyopus rubicundus dominating the inshore community, Camatopsis rubida, Schizaster lacunosus and Craspidaster hesperus dominating the Kuroshio community, and Portunus argentatus, Champsodon snyderi and Coelorinchus multispinulosus dominating the offshore community. Some rare species (e.g., Neobythites sivicola) may indicate the passage of the NKBC better than the indicator species. A redundancy analysis was used to describe the relationship between the macrofaunal species and environmental variables in this study. Water depth and turbidity played important roles in the distribution of the macrofauna. S. scutata and O. rubicundus were associated with high turbidity and shallow depth, while Plesionika izumiae and P. argentatus were associated with low turbidity and deep depth. This study outlines the impact of the NKBC on the distribution patterns of the macrofaunal community of the East China Sea. More studies are needed to understand the detailed interactions between macrofauna and the NKBC in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2789559272,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) comprise a significant portion of the infectious-disease burden among rural people in the Global South. Particular characteristics of ruralness—low-density settlements and poor infrastructure—make healthcare provision difficult, and remoteness, typically a characteristic of ruralness, often compounds the difficultly. Remoteness may also accelerate STI transmission, particularly that of viral STIs, through formation of small, highly connected sexual networks through which pathogens can spread rapidly, especially when partner concurrency is broadly accepted. Herein, we explored the effect of remoteness on herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) epidemiology among semi-nomadic pastoralists in northwestern (Kaokoveld) Namibia, where, in 2009 we collected HSV-2-specific antibody status, demographic, sexual network, and travel data from 446 subjects (women = 213, men = 233) in a cross-sectional study design. HSV-2 prevalence was high overall in Kaokoveld (>35%), but was heterogeneously distributed across locally defined residential regions: some regions had significantly higher HSV-2 prevalence (39–48%) than others (21–33%). Using log-linear models, we asked the following questions: 1) Are sexual contacts among people in high HSV-2-prevalence regions more likely to be homophilous (i.e., from the same region) than those among people from low-prevalence regions? 2) Are high-prevalence regions more “functionally” remote, in that people from those regions are more likely to travel within their own region than outside, compared to people from other regions? We found that high-prevalence regions were more sexually homophilous than low-prevalence regions and that those regions also had higher rates of within-region travel than the other regions. These findings indicate that remoteness can create contact structures for accelerated STI transmission among people who are already disproportionately vulnerable to consequences of untreated STIs."
https://openalex.org/W2789638622,"Conventional techniques for the noninvasive measurement of brain activity involve critical limitations in spatial or temporal resolution. Here, we propose the method for noninvasive brain function measurement with high spatiotemporal resolution using optical signals. We verified that diffused near-infrared light penetrating through the upper jaw and into the skull, which we term as optoencephalography (OEG), leads to the detection of dynamic brain signals that vary concurrently with the electrophysiological neural activity. We measured the OEG signals following the stimulation of the median nerve in common marmosets. The OEG signal response was tightly coupled with the electrophysiological response represented by the somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP). The OEG measurement is also shown to offer rather clear discrimination of brain signals."
https://openalex.org/W2790563525,"A complete eradication of an HIV infection has never been achieved by vaccination and the search for new immunogens that can induce long-lasting protective responses is ongoing. Avipoxvirus recombinants are host-restricted for replication to avian species and they do not have the undesired side effects induced by vaccinia recombinants. In particular, Fowlpox (FP) recombinants can express transgenes over long periods and can induce protective immunity in mammals, mainly due to CD4-dependent CD8+ T cells. In this context, the class II transactivator (CIITA) has a pivotal role in triggering the adaptive immune response through induction of the expression of class-II major histocompatibility complex molecule (MHC-II), that can present antigens to CD4+ T helper cells. Here, we report on construction of novel FPgp and FPenv recombinants that express the highly immunogenic SIV Gag-pro and Env structural antigens. Several FP-based recombinants, with single or dual genes, were also developed that express CIITA, driven from H6 or SP promoters. These recombinants were used to infect CEF and Vero cells in vitro and determine transgene expression, which was evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Subcellular localisation of the different proteins was evaluated by confocal microscopy, whereas HLA-DR or MHC-II expression was measured by flow cytometry. Fowlpox recombinants were also used to infect syngeneic T/SA tumour cells, then injected into Balb/c mice to elicit MHC-II immune response and define the presentation of the SIV transgene products in the presence or absence of FPCIITA. Antibodies to Env were measured by ELISA. Our data show that the H6 promoter was more efficient than SP to drive CIITA expression and that CIITA can enhance the levels of the gag/pro and env gene products only when infection is performed by FP single recombinants. Also, CIITA expression is higher when carried by FP single recombinants than when combined with FPgp or FPenv constructs and can induce HLA-DR cell surface expression. However, in-vivo experiments did not show any significant increase in the humoral response. As CIITA already proved to elicit immunogenicity by improving antigen presentation, further in-vivo experiments should be performed to increase the immune responses. The use of prime/boost immunisation protocols and the oral administration route of the recombinants may enhance the immunogenicity of Env peptides presented by MHC-II and provide CD4+ T-cell stimulation."
