https://openalex.org/W2484230073,"The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in many aspects of human biology, including immune function and metabolism. The reduced diversity of the gut microbiota in Western populations compared to that in populations living traditional lifestyles presents the question of which factors have driven microbiota change during modernization. Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fibre have a crucial involvement in shaping this microbial ecosystem, and are notably reduced in the Western diet (high in fat and simple carbohydrates, low in fibre) compared with a more traditional diet. Here we show that changes in the microbiota of mice consuming a low-MAC diet and harbouring a human microbiota are largely reversible within a single generation. However, over several generations, a low-MAC diet results in a progressive loss of diversity, which is not recoverable after the reintroduction of dietary MACs. To restore the microbiota to its original state requires the administration of missing taxa in combination with dietary MAC consumption. Our data illustrate that taxa driven to low abundance when dietary MACs are scarce are inefficiently transferred to the next generation, and are at increased risk of becoming extinct within an isolated population. As more diseases are linked to the Western microbiota and the microbiota is targeted therapeutically, microbiota reprogramming may need to involve strategies that incorporate dietary MACs as well as taxa not currently present in the Western gut."
https://openalex.org/W2233158352,"Epithelial tuft cells secretion of IL-25 is shown to regulate type 2 epithelial responses to helminth parasite infection via an IL-13/IL-4Rα-dependent feedback loop. The 'weep-and-sweep' response to parasitic helminths and allergens, in which parasites are ejected by increased propulsive activity of the gut combined with fluid and mucus secretion, is a manifestation of type 2 (or allergic) immunity involving the activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). The epithelium in the small intestine consists of five or more distinct cellular lineages, including tuft cells, whose functions remain unclear. Two papers in this issue of Nature demonstrate a role for tuft cells in the response to parasites. Richard Locksley and colleagues show that tuft cells are the source of the interleukin 25 (IL-25) that is required for activation of ILC2s, ILC2-regulated tuft and goblet cell expansion, and control of parasite infection. Philippe Jay and colleagues show that tuft cells secrete IL-25 via an IL-13/IL-4R -dependent feedback loop. Helminth parasitic infections are a major global health and social burden1. The host defence against helminths such as Nippostrongylus brasiliensis is orchestrated by type 2 cell-mediated immunity2. Induction of type 2 cytokines, including interleukins (IL) IL-4 and IL-13, induce goblet cell hyperplasia with mucus production, ultimately resulting in worm expulsion3,4. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of type 2 responses remain incompletely understood. Here we show that tuft cells, a rare epithelial cell type in the steady-state intestinal epithelium5, are responsible for initiating type 2 responses to parasites by a cytokine-mediated cellular relay. Tuft cells have a Th2-related gene expression signature6 and we demonstrate that they undergo a rapid and extensive IL-4Rα-dependent amplification following infection with helminth parasites, owing to direct differentiation of epithelial crypt progenitor cells. We find that the Pou2f3 gene is essential for tuft cell specification. Pou2f3−/− mice lack intestinal tuft cells and have defective mucosal type 2 responses to helminth infection; goblet cell hyperplasia is abrogated and worm expulsion is compromised. Notably, IL-4Rα signalling is sufficient to induce expansion of the tuft cell lineage, and ectopic stimulation of this signalling cascade obviates the need for tuft cells in the epithelial cell remodelling of the intestine. Moreover, tuft cells secrete IL-25, thereby regulating type 2 immune responses. Our data reveal a novel function of intestinal epithelial tuft cells and demonstrate a cellular relay required for initiating mucosal type 2 immunity to helminth infection."

https://openalex.org/W2236059440,"Far-ultraviolet observations of the nearby low-mass star-forming galaxy J0925+1403 show that the galaxy is leaking ionizing radiation with an escape fraction of about 8 per cent, which is sufficient to ionize intergalactic medium material that is about 40 times as massive as the stellar mass of the galaxy. The early Universe went through a period known as the cosmic 'Dark Ages', when matter was largely transparent to radiation and transformed to neutral gas. Later, some 800 million years after the Big Bang, it was ionized again. Which sources were responsible for this re-ionization? Low-mass, star-forming galaxies are prime candidates, but are hard to observe. Here Yuri Izotov et al. present far-ultraviolet observations of a nearby low-mass star-forming galaxy that can be considered a proxy for the reionizing galaxy population. The galaxy, J0925+1403, is leaking ionizing radiation with an escape fraction of ∼8 per cent. The total number of photons emitted during the starburst phase is sufficient to ionize intergalactic medium material that is about 40 times as massive as the stellar mass of the galaxy. One of the key questions in observational cosmology is the identification of the sources responsible for ionization of the Universe after the cosmic ‘Dark Ages’, when the baryonic matter was neutral. The currently identified distant galaxies are insufficient to fully reionize the Universe by redshift z ≈ 6 (refs 1, 2, 3), but low-mass, star-forming galaxies are thought to be responsible for the bulk of the ionizing radiation4,5,6. As direct observations at high redshift are difficult for a variety of reasons, one solution is to identify local proxies of this galaxy population. Starburst galaxies at low redshifts, however, generally are opaque to Lyman continuum photons7,8,9. Small escape fractions of about 1 to 3 per cent, insufficient to ionize much surrounding gas, have been detected only in three low-redshift galaxies10,11. Here we report far-ultraviolet observations of the nearby low-mass star-forming galaxy J0925+1403. The galaxy is leaking ionizing radiation with an escape fraction of about 8 per cent. The total number of photons emitted during the starburst phase is sufficient to ionize intergalactic medium material that is about 40 times as massive as the stellar mass of the galaxy."
https://openalex.org/W2222088233,"Many important natural products are produced by multidomain non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). During synthesis, intermediates are covalently bound to integrated carrier domains and transported to neighbouring catalytic domains in an assembly line fashion. Understanding the structural basis for catalysis with non-ribosomal peptide synthetases will facilitate bioengineering to create novel products. Here we describe the structures of two different holo-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules, each revealing a distinct step in the catalytic cycle. One structure depicts the carrier domain cofactor bound to the peptide bond-forming condensation domain, whereas a second structure captures the installation of the amino acid onto the cofactor within the adenylation domain. These structures demonstrate that a conformational change within the adenylation domain guides transfer of intermediates between domains. Furthermore, one structure shows that the condensation and adenylation domains simultaneously adopt their catalytic conformations, increasing the overall efficiency in a revised structural cycle. These structures and the single-particle electron microscopy analysis demonstrate a highly dynamic domain architecture and provide the foundation for understanding the structural mechanisms that could enable engineering of novel non-ribosomal peptide synthetases."

https://openalex.org/W2234810602,"WebX-ray crystal structures are presented of each major step of the assembly-line synthesis by the initiation module of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) LgrA; the structures reveal large conformational changes, demonstrating a requirement for NRPSs to be very dynamic. Non-ribosomal peptides, such as the antibiotic vancomycin and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, are peptidic secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are a family of large enzymes that utilize multiple catalytic domains to catalyse sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway of this family of 'natural products'. Two papers in this issue of Nature present X-ray crystal structures that indicate that NRPSs are substantially more dynamic than previously believed. Andrew Gulick and colleagues studied two holo-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules, each revealing a distinct step in the catalytic cycle. Martin Schmeing and colleagues report several structures of LgrA, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic gramicidin. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are very large proteins that produce small peptide molecules with wide-ranging biological activities, including environmentally friendly chemicals and many widely used therapeutics1. NRPSs are macromolecular machines, with modular assembly-line logic, a complex catalytic cycle, moving parts and many active sites2,3. In addition to the core domains required to link the substrates, they often include specialized tailoring domains, which introduce chemical modifications and allow the product to access a large expanse of chemical space3,4. It is still unknown how the NRPS tailoring domains are structurally accommodated into megaenzymes or how they have adapted to function in nonribosomal peptide synthesis. Here we present a series of crystal structures of the initiation module of an antibiotic-producing NRPS, linear gramicidin synthetase5,6. This module includes the specialized tailoring formylation domain, and states are captured that represent every major step of the assembly-line synthesis in the initiation module. The transitions between conformations are large in scale, with both the peptidyl carrier protein domain and the adenylation subdomain undergoing huge movements to transport substrate between distal active sites. The structures highlight the great versatility of NRPSs, as small domains repurpose and recycle their limited interfaces to interact with their various binding partners. Understanding tailoring domains is important if NRPSs are to be utilized in the production of novel therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2234390935,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which differentiated epithelial cells reprogram gene expression, lose their junctions and polarity, reorganize their cytoskeleton, increase cell motility and assume a mesenchymal morphology. Despite the critical functions of the microtubule (MT) in cytoskeletal organization, how it participates in EMT induction and maintenance remains poorly understood. Here we report that acetylated α-tubulin, which plays an important role in microtubule (MT) stabilization and cell morphology, can serve as a novel regulator and marker of EMT. A high level of acetylated α-tubulin was correlated with epithelial morphology and it profoundly decreased during TGF-β-induced EMT. We found that TGF-β increased the activity of HDAC6, a major deacetylase of α-tubulin, without affecting its expression levels. Treatment with HDAC6 inhibitor tubacin or TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 restored the level of acetylated α-tubulin and consequently blocked EMT. Our results demonstrate that acetylated α-tubulin can serve as a marker of EMT and that HDAC6 represents an important regulator during EMT process."
https://openalex.org/W2236193166,"Ocean soundscapes convey important sensory information to marine life. Like many mid-to-low latitude coastal areas worldwide, the high-frequency (>1.5 kHz) soundscape of oyster reef habitat within the West Bay Marine Reserve (36°N, 76°W) is dominated by the impulsive, short-duration signals generated by snapping shrimp. Between June 2011 and July 2012, a single hydrophone deployed within West Bay was programmed to record 60 or 30 seconds of acoustic data every 15 or 30 minutes. Envelope correlation and amplitude information were then used to count shrimp snaps within these recordings. The observed snap rates vary from 1500–2000 snaps per minute during summer to <100 snaps per minute during winter. Sound pressure levels are positively correlated with snap rate (r = 0.71–0.92) and vary seasonally by ~15 decibels in the 1.5–20 kHz range. Snap rates are positively correlated with water temperatures (r = 0.81–0.93), as well as potentially influenced by climate-driven changes in water quality. Light availability modulates snap rate on diurnal time scales, with most days exhibiting a significant preference for either nighttime or daytime snapping, and many showing additional crepuscular increases. During mid-summer, the number of snaps occurring at night is 5–10% more than predicted by a random model; however, this pattern is reversed between August and April, with an excess of up to 25% more snaps recorded during the day in the mid-winter. Diurnal variability in sound pressure levels is largest in the mid-winter, when the overall rate of snapping is at its lowest, and the percentage difference between daytime and nighttime activity is at its highest. This work highlights our lack of knowledge regarding the ecology and acoustic behavior of one of the most dominant soniforous invertebrate species in coastal systems. It also underscores the necessity of long-duration, high-temporal-resolution sampling in efforts to understand the bioacoustics of animal behaviors and associated changes within the marine soundscape."
https://openalex.org/W2236150050,"Over a third of oral bacteria are as-yet-uncultivated in-vitro. Siderophores have been previously shown to enable in-vitro growth of previously uncultivated bacteria. The objective of this study was to cultivate novel oral bacteria in siderophore-supplemented culture media. Various compounds with siderophore activity, including pyoverdines-Fe-complex, desferricoprogen and salicylic acid, were found to stimulate the growth of difficult-to-culture strains Prevotella sp. HOT-376 and Fretibacterium fastidiosum. Furthermore, pyrosequencing analysis demonstrated increased proportions of the as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes Dialister sp. HOT-119 and Megasphaera sp. HOT-123 on mixed culture plates supplemented with siderophores. Therefore a culture model was developed, which incorporated 15 μg siderophore (pyoverdines-Fe-complex or desferricoprogen) or 150 μl neat subgingival-plaque suspension into a central well on agar plates that were inoculated with heavily-diluted subgingival-plaque samples from subjects with periodontitis. Colonies showing satellitism were passaged onto fresh plates in co-culture with selected helper strains. Five novel strains, representatives of three previously-uncultivated taxa (Anaerolineae bacterium HOT-439, the first oral taxon from the Chloroflexi phylum to have been cultivated; Bacteroidetes bacterium HOT-365; and Peptostreptococcaceae bacterium HOT-091) were successfully isolated. All novel isolates required helper strains for growth, implying dependence on a biofilm lifestyle. Their characterisation will further our understanding of the human oral microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2239272798,"Patients with pancreatic cancer typically develop tumor invasion and metastasis in the early stage. These malignant behaviors might be originated from cancer stem cells (CSCs), but the responsible target is less known about invisible CSCs especially for invasion and metastasis. We previously examined the proteasome activity of CSCs and constructed a real-time visualization system for human pancreatic CSCs. In the present study, we found that CSCs were highly metastatic and dominantly localized at the invading tumor margins in a liver metastasis model. Microarray and siRNA screening assays showed that doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) was predominantly expressed with histone modification in pancreatic CSCs with invasive and metastatic potential. Overexpression of DCLK1 led to amoeboid morphology, which promotes the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Knockdown of DCLK1 profoundly suppressed in vivo liver metastasis of pancreatic CSCs. Clinically, DCLK1 was overexpressed in the metastatic tumors in patients with pancreatic cancer. Our studies revealed that DCLK1 is essential for the invasive and metastatic properties of CSCs and may be a promising epigenetic and therapeutic target in human pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2233878280,"The rat is a commonly used model for immunological investigation. Yet basic research and characterisation of leukocyte populations and sub-sets lags far behind murine research, with inconsistency on reported leukocyte markers and their overlap. These shortcomings limit the opportunity for more complex and advanced rat immunology research. In this study, we developed a robust 9-colour flow-cytometric protocol to elucidate the major blood and tissue rat leukocyte populations, and validated it in a model of LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. Blood and tissues (lung, BALF, spleen, liver, bone marrow) from naïve Sprague-Dawley rats were collected and analysed by flow cytometry (FCM). Rats were exposed to aerosolised saline or LPS (1 mg/mL), at 3 and 24 hrs thereafter blood, lung and BALF were collected and analysed using FCM and ELISA. Neutrophils, two monocyte subsets, NK Cells, B Cells, CD4+, CD8+ T Cells and alveolar macrophages can be identified simultaneously across different tissues using a 9-colour panel. Neutrophils and monocytes can be distinguished based upon differential expression of CD43 and His48. Neutrophils and CD43Lo/His48Hi monocyte-macrophages are elevated in the lung at 3 and 24 hrs during LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. This validated method for leukocyte enumeration will offer a platform for greater consistency in future rat immunology and inflammation research."
https://openalex.org/W2233323602,"In 1994, South Africa approved a constitution providing freedom from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Other Southern African countries, including Botswana, Malawi, and Namibia, criminalize same-sex behavior. Men who have sex with men (MSM) have been shown to experience high levels of stigma and discrimination, increasing their vulnerability to negative health and other outcomes. This paper examines the relationship between criminalization of same-sex behavior and experiences of human rights abuses by MSM. It compares the extent to which MSM in peri-urban Cape Town experience human rights abuses with that of MSM in Gaborone, Botswana; Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi; and Windhoek, Namibia. In 2008, 737 MSM participated in a cross-sectional study using a structured survey collecting data regarding demographics, human rights, HIV status, and risk behavior. Participants accrued in each site were compared using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Encouragingly, the results indicate MSM in Cape Town were more likely to disclose their sexual orientation to family or healthcare workers and less likely to be blackmailed or feel afraid in their communities than MSM in Botswana, Malawi, or Namibia. However, South African MSM were not statistically significantly less likely experience a human rights abuse than their peers in cities in other study countries, showing that while legal protections may reduce experiences of certain abuses, legislative changes alone are insufficient for protecting MSM. A comprehensive approach with interventions at multiple levels in multiple sectors is needed to create the legal and social change necessary to address attitudes, discrimination, and violence affecting MSM."
https://openalex.org/W2234236208,"Classification of datasets with imbalanced sample distributions has always been a challenge. In general, a popular approach for enhancing classification performance is the construction of an ensemble of classifiers. However, the performance of an ensemble is dependent on the choice of constituent base classifiers. Therefore, we propose a genetic algorithm-based search method for finding the optimum combination from a pool of base classifiers to form a heterogeneous ensemble. The algorithm, called GA-EoC, utilises 10 fold-cross validation on training data for evaluating the quality of each candidate ensembles. In order to combine the base classifiers decision into ensemble’s output, we used the simple and widely used majority voting approach. The proposed algorithm, along with the random sub-sampling approach to balance the class distribution, has been used for classifying class-imbalanced datasets. Additionally, if a feature set was not available, we used the (α, β) − k Feature Set method to select a better subset of features for classification. We have tested GA-EoC with three benchmarking datasets from the UCI-Machine Learning repository, one Alzheimer’s disease dataset and a subset of the PubFig database of Columbia University. In general, the performance of the proposed method on the chosen datasets is robust and better than that of the constituent base classifiers and many other well-known ensembles. Based on our empirical study we claim that a genetic algorithm is a superior and reliable approach to heterogeneous ensemble construction and we expect that the proposed GA-EoC would perform consistently in other cases."
https://openalex.org/W2239621141,"Appropriate response to companions' emotional signals is important for all social creatures. The emotional expressions of humans and non-human animals have analogies in their form and function, suggesting shared evolutionary roots, but very little is known about how animals other than primates view and process facial expressions. In primates, threat-related facial expressions evoke exceptional viewing patterns compared with neutral or positive stimuli. Here, we explore if domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have such an attentional bias toward threatening social stimuli and whether observed emotional expressions affect dogs' gaze fixation distribution among the facial features (eyes, midface and mouth). We recorded the voluntary eye gaze of 31 domestic dogs during viewing of facial photographs of humans and dogs with three emotional expressions (threatening, pleasant and neutral). We found that dogs' gaze fixations spread systematically among facial features. The distribution of fixations was altered by the seen expression, but eyes were the most probable targets of the first fixations and gathered longer looking durations than mouth regardless of the viewed expression. The examination of the inner facial features as a whole revealed more pronounced scanning differences among expressions. This suggests that dogs do not base their perception of facial expressions on the viewing of single structures, but the interpretation of the composition formed by eyes, midface and mouth. Dogs evaluated social threat rapidly and this evaluation led to attentional bias, which was dependent on the depicted species: threatening conspecifics' faces evoked heightened attention but threatening human faces instead an avoidance response. We propose that threatening signals carrying differential biological validity are processed via distinctive neurocognitive pathways. Both of these mechanisms may have an adaptive significance for domestic dogs. The findings provide a novel perspective on understanding the processing of emotional expressions and sensitivity to social threat in non-primates."
https://openalex.org/W2233909801,"Pro-fibrotic mesenchymal cells are known to be the key effector cells of fibroproliferative disease, but the specific matrix signals and the induced cellular responses that drive the fibrogenic phenotype remain to be elucidated. The key mediators of the fibroblast fibrogenic phenotype were characterized using a novel assay system that measures fibroblast behavior in response to actual normal and fibrotic lung tissue. Using this system, we demonstrate that normal lung promotes fibroblast motility and polarization, while fibrotic lung immobilizes the fibroblast and promotes myofibroblast differentiation. These context-specific phenotypes are surprisingly both mediated by myosin II. The role of myosin II is supported by the observation of an increase in myosin phosphorylation and a change in intracellular distribution in fibroblasts on fibrotic lung, as compared with normal lung. Moreover, loss of myosin II activity has opposing effects on protrusive activity in fibroblasts on normal and fibrotic lung. Loss of myosin II also selectively inhibits myofibroblast differentiation in fibroblasts on fibrotic lung. Importantly, these findings are recapitulated by varying the matrix stiffness of polyacrylamide gels in the range of normal and fibrotic lung tissue.

It has recently been shown that fibrotic lung is “stiffer” than normal lung and this difference in rigidity can drive phenotypic changes in fibroblasts (16Liu F. Mih J.D. Shea B.S. Kho A.T.

As such, traditional cell biological assays using cells plated on plastic may not provide an accurate representation of in vivo fibroblast behavior. Recent advances allowing the seeding of fibroblasts into normal or IPF-cell-derived matrices have demonstrated that IPF-derived ECM promotes the up-regulation of “pro-fibrotic” gene transcription (22Parker M.W. Rossi D. Peterson M. Smith K. Sikström K. White E.S. Connett J.E. Henke C.A. Larsson O. Bitterman P.B. Fibrotic extracellular matrix activates a profibrotic positive feedback loop.J. Clin.

In this study, we have taken an additional step forward by utilizing a more physiologically-relevant matrix system that more closely mimics the in vivo environment of the lung fibroblast. Myosins are a family of motor proteins that are involved in many cellular processes that require force. Contractile tension generated within the cytoskeleton by non-muscle myosin II is known to play an important role in both fibroblast migration and differentiation (24Bond J.E. Ho T.Q. Selim M.A. Hunter C.L. Bowers E.V. Levinson H. Temporal spatial expression and function of non-muscle myosin II isoforms IIA and IIB in scar remodeling.Lab.

Although activation of signals upstream of myosin II has been recently implicated in pulmonary fibrogenesis in an experimental model of human IPF, the direct involvement of myosin II as an effector molecule of fibrogenesis has yet to be documented (20Zhou Y. Huang X. Hecker L. Kurundkar D. Kurundkar A. Liu H. Jin T.H. Desai L. Bernard K. Thannickal V.J. Inhibition of mechanosensitive signaling in myofibroblasts ameliorates experimental pulmonary fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 1096-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanisms whereby myosin II contributes to the activation of mesenchymal cells on physiologically relevant matrices, and in vivo, have not been described. Thus, we sought to understand the role of myosin II in mediating the behavior of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts as they interact with physiologically relevant matrices. In doing so, we have uncovered unique and context-specific roles of myosin II in fibrogenesis. Normal human lung fibroblasts (HLF, 19Lu, passages 4–9) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained/propagated as previously described (29Olman M.A. White K.E. Ware L.B. Simmons W.L.

PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kits, monoclonal anti-α-SMA, monoclonal anti-vinculin, and blebbistatin were purchased from Sigma. AF 594 Phalloidin and AF 488 goat anti-mouse antibody were purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, Ca). Antibodies to myosin IIA, myosin IIB, phospho-myosin light chain 2 (p-MLC, Thr-18/Ser-19), and myosin light chain 2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

All animal protocols were performed as approved by the Cleveland Clinic institutional animal care and use committee and using methods in the guidelines for the humane care of animals by the American Physiological Society. Lungs from C57Bl/6 mice (18–20 g, 8–12-week-old females) that had received intratracheal instillation of 4 units/kg bleomycin sulfate (Bristol Laboratories, Syracuse, NY) 2 weeks prior were inflated with OCT as described previously (9Ding Q.

Cryotome-cut, OCT-preserved lung tissue sections (10 μm) were washed in 37 °C PBS to remove the OCT, and blocked with 5% albumin. Normal and fibrotic regions were identified using light microscopy and confirmed with serial H&E-, DAPI- (Fig. 1A), and trichrome- (not shown) stained sections.

Migration tracking was analyzed using ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). Greater than 50 cells from five independent experiments were analyzed. For myofibroblast differentiation, immuno-fluorescence was performed as described below on non-labeled, attached cells ± blebbistatin after 24 h. HLFs were transfected with 100 nm siRNA (MYH9, MYH10, or non-targeting control) using Silentfect lipid and OptiMEM medium (GIBCO/Invitrogen) for 48 h, as previously published (10Grove L.M.

Viability of attached cells at 24 h was 91.34 ± 6% on normal lung and 91.25 ± 5% on fibrotic lung (Fig. 1C). Fixed and permeabilized cells were labeled for α-SMA, F-actin stress fibers, and/or p-MLC2 as previously published (31Zhu S. Gladson C.L. White K.E. Ding Q. Stewart Jr., J. J. E. Jin T.H.

Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2009; 297: L97-L108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence intensity was analyzed using ImageJ Pro software (NIH). Greater than 20 cells for each condition (normal versus fibrotic) were analyzed in triplicate. Immunoblotting was performed for the indicated proteins as previously published (10Grove L.M.

To selectively harvest cell lysates from normal and fibrotic lung, HLFs were plated inside cloning rings (6.4-mm diameter) onto lung tissue sections, followed by trypsinization to remove the attached cells. To remove any soluble lung proteins, cell suspensions were centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min). The cell pellet was re-suspended and passed through a 30-micron cell filter. Preliminary experiments demonstrated no significant detection of α-SMA or p-MLC in the absence of added cells. Custom made 12-well glass-bottom plates containing activated polyacrylamide gels of 1 kPa, 8 kPa, 25 kPa, and glass (Matrigen Life Technologies) were coated with 1 μg/ml fibronectin for 2 h (37 °C). Polyacrylamide gels with stiffnesses of 1 kPa and 25 kPa were chosen to represent the stiffness of normal and fibrotic lung, respectively, based on AFM analysis of our lung tissue sections and on previously published data (16Liu F. Mih J.D. Shea B.S. Kho A.T. Sharif A.S. Tager A.M. Tschumperlin D.J. Feedback amplification of fibrosis through matrix stiffening and Cox-2 suppression.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). For migration analyses, HLFs previously labeled with PKH dye were allowed to attach for one hour, and non-adherent cells were washed away. Blebbistatin or vehicle only (DMSO) in 1% BSA in serum-free medium was added, and time-lapse microscopy was performed over 6 h. For differentiation assays, non-labeled HLFs were allowed to attach for one hour, and non-adherent cells were washed away. The gels containing attached cells were incubated for 24 h, followed by permeabilization, fixation, and immuno-fluorescence staining. For vinculin staining, gels with attached cells were incubated in serum-free medium ± TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml, 24 h). Time-lapse microscopy was performed at 10× magnification with images captured at 10-min intervals for 6 h. Migration tracking on single cells was performed with ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics). Migration persistence was calculated by dividing the displacement by the total distance. The number of protrusions was manually counted for each cell over the 6 h time period. Polarity was determined by dividing migration persistence by the number of protrusions. Cell area was derived from manual tracings of individual cells using ImageJ Pro software. Elongation (the inverse of circularity) was calculated using the formula 1 − (4π × area/[perimeter]2). Greater than 50 cells for each condition (normal versus fibrotic) were analyzed in five independent experiments. All data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.) with unpaired/paired t test or Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test (for non-parametric data), or by ANOVA (for more than 2 groups). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine the effect of normal and fibrotic lung on fibroblast phenotype, HLFs were seeded onto murine lung tissue containing both normal and fibrotic areas. Upon attachment, HLFs on both substrates had a rounded appearance and similar area (mean area, normal lung 1162 ± 555 μm2 versus fibrotic lung 1189 ± 560 μm2, Fig. 2, A (green) and B). However, after 6 h, HLFs on fibrotic lung spread less (change in area, fibrotic lung 809 ± 1192 μm2 versus normal lung 1674 ± 1475 μm2, p = 0.007 (Fig. 2, A (red) and B) and continued to maintain a rounded appearance. In contrast, HLFs on normal lung consistently became elongated and spindle-shaped (elongation factor at 6 h, normal lung 0.745 ± 0.12 AU versus fibrotic lung 0.5 ± 0.17 AU, p < 0.001, and these differences persisted through 24 h (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that fibroblasts interacting with normal lung assume an elongated, spindle-shaped morphology, while fibroblasts interacting with fibrotic lung assume a rounded morphology. On fibrotic lung, HLFs consistently migrated over a shorter distance (fibrotic; 63 ± 36 versus normal; 102 ± 48 μm, p < 0.001) and with a slower speed (fibrotic; 10 ± 6 versus normal; 17 ± 8 μm/hr, Fig. 3, A–D) than on normal lung. Migration on fibrotic lung occurred in a significantly more random, less persistent fashion than on normal lung (migration persistence, fibrotic; 0.5 ± 0.18 versus normal; 0.8 ± 0.11 AU, p < 0.001, values closer to 1 indicate more persistent migration, Fig. 3, B and C). There were nearly 3-fold more protrusions per cell in HLFs on fibrotic lung than on normal lung (fibrotic; 13 ± 5 versus normal; 5 ± 2, p < 0.001, Fig. 3C). Overall, HLFs on fibrotic lung were less polarized than those on normal lung, as they exhibited less migration persistence with increased protrusive activity (polarity, fibrotic; 0.05 ± 0.02 versus normal; 0.2 ± 0.07 AU, p < 0.001, higher values indicate greater polarization, Fig. 3C). These differences in migratory behavior persisted over a 24-hour time period (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data show for the first time that HLFs interacting with fibrotic lung have a less motile, less polarized phenotype than those interacting with normal lung. As myofibroblast differentiation occurs at longer time points we examined the attached HLFs at 24 h. HLFs on fibrotic lung were more spread with increased dense, thicker stress fibers and increased α-SMA than those on normal lung (Fig. 4A). Fibroblasts on fibrotic lung more frequently possessed phenotypic characteristics of myofibroblasts: HLFs with prominent F-actin stress fibers were 2-fold higher and α-SMA integrated density was >1.5 fold higher on fibrotic lung (*, p < 0.05 versus normal, Fig. 4B). In attached HLFs, α-SMA expression was ∼2.5 fold greater on fibrotic lung than normal lung (*, p < 0.001, Fig. 4C). Together, these results demonstrate that fibrotic lung enhances the myofibroblastic phenotype. Key experiments performed on serial decellularized lung tissue sections (32Sun H. Calle E. Chen X. Mathur A. Zhu Y. Mendez J. Zhao L. Niklason L. Peng X. Peng H. Herzog E.L.

https://openalex.org/W2233473805,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral neuropathy and is characterized by median nerve entrapment at the wrist and the resulting median nerve dysfunction. CTS is diagnosed clinically as the gold standard and confirmed with nerve conduction studies (NCS). Complementing NCS, ultrasound imaging could provide additional anatomical information on pathological and motion changes of the median nerve. The purpose of this study was to estimate the transverse sliding patterns of the median nerve during finger movements by analyzing ultrasound dynamic images to distinguish between normal subjects and CTS patients. Transverse ultrasound images were acquired, and a speckle-tracking algorithm was used to determine the lateral displacements of the median nerve in radial-ulnar plane in B-mode images utilizing the multilevel block-sum pyramid algorithm and averaging. All of the averaged lateral displacements at separate acquisition times within a single flexion-extension cycle were accumulated to obtain the cumulative lateral displacements, which were curve-fitted with a second-order polynomial function. The fitted curve was regarded as the transverse sliding pattern of the median nerve. The R2 value, curvature, and amplitude of the fitted curves were computed to evaluate the goodness, variation and maximum value of the fit, respectively. Box plots, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm were utilized for statistical analysis. The transverse sliding of the median nerve during finger movements was greater and had a steeper fitted curve in the normal subjects than in the patients with mild or severe CTS. The temporal changes in transverse sliding of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel were found to be correlated with the presence of CTS and its severity. The representative transverse sliding patterns of the median nerve during finger movements were demonstrated to be useful for quantitatively estimating median nerve dysfunction in CTS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2235530650,"Complex systems inspired analysis suggests a hypothesis that financial meltdowns are abrupt critical transitions that occur when the system reaches a tipping point. Theoretical and empirical studies on climatic and ecological dynamical systems have shown that approach to tipping points is preceded by a generic phenomenon called critical slowing down, i.e. an increasingly slow response of the system to perturbations. Therefore, it has been suggested that critical slowing down may be used as an early warning signal of imminent critical transitions. Whether financial markets exhibit critical slowing down prior to meltdowns remains unclear. Here, our analysis reveals that three major US (Dow Jones Index, S&P 500 and NASDAQ) and two European markets (DAX and FTSE) did not exhibit critical slowing down prior to major financial crashes over the last century. However, all markets showed strong trends of rising variability, quantified by time series variance and spectral function at low frequencies, prior to crashes. These results suggest that financial crashes are not critical transitions that occur in the vicinity of a tipping point. Using a simple model, we argue that financial crashes are likely to be stochastic transitions which can occur even when the system is far away from the tipping point. Specifically, we show that a gradually increasing strength of stochastic perturbations may have caused to abrupt transitions in the financial markets. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of stochastically driven abrupt transitions in real world scenarios. Our study offers rising variability as a precursor of financial meltdowns albeit with a limitation that they may signal false alarms."
https://openalex.org/W2239064769,"Studies have demonstrated ways in which climate-related shifts in the distributions and relative abundances of marine species are expected to alter the dynamics and catch potential of global fisheries. While these studies assess impacts on large-scale commercial fisheries, few efforts have been made to quantitatively project impacts on small-scale subsistence and commercial fisheries that are economically, socially and culturally important to many coastal communities. This study uses a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to project scenarios of climate-related changes in the relative abundance, distribution and richness of 98 exploited marine fishes and invertebrates of commercial and cultural importance to First Nations in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Declines in abundance are projected for most of the sampled species under both the lower (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 2.6) and higher (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios (-15.0% to -20.8%, respectively), with poleward range shifts occurring at a median rate of 10.3 to 18.0 km decade-1 by 2050 relative to 2000. While a cumulative decline in catch potential is projected coastwide (-4.5 to -10.7%), estimates suggest a strong positive correlation between the change in relative catch potential and latitude, with First Nations’ territories along the northern and central coasts of British Columbia likely to experience less severe declines than those to the south. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is projected between latitude and the number of species exhibiting declining abundance. These trends are shown to be robust to alternative species distribution models. This study concludes by discussing corresponding management challenges that are likely to be encountered under climate change, and by highlighting the value of joint-management frameworks and traditional fisheries management approaches that could aid in offsetting impacts and developing site-specific mitigation and adaptation strategies derived from local fishers’ knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2232885759,"Leuconostoc citreum NRRL B-742 has been known for years to produce a highly α-(1→3)-branched dextran for which the synthesis had never been elucidated. In this work a gene coding for a putative α-transglucosylase of the GH70 family was identified in the reported genome of this bacteria and functionally characterized. From sucrose alone, the corresponding recombinant protein, named BRS-B, mainly catalyzed sucrose hydrolysis and leucrose synthesis. However, in the presence of sucrose and a dextran acceptor, the enzyme efficiently transferred the glucosyl residue from sucrose to linear α-(1→6) dextrans through the specific formation of α-(1→3) linkages. To date, BRS-B is the first reported α-(1→3) branching sucrase. Using a suitable sucrose/dextran ratio, a comb-like dextran with 50% of α-(1→3) branching was synthesized, suggesting that BRS-B is likely involved in the comb-like dextran produced by L. citreum NRRL B-742. In addition, data mining based on the search for specific sequence motifs allowed the identification of two genes putatively coding for branching sucrases in the genome of Leuconostoc fallax KCTC3537 and Lactobacillus kunkeei EFB6.

Numerous lactic acid bacteria from the Leuconostoc genus isolated from different habitats, such as sugar juice, fermenting vegetables, or dairy products, have long been known to produce slimes in sucrose solution (1.Hucker G.

Perderson C. Studies on the coccaceae. XVI. The genus Leuconostoc.Tech. Bull. N. Y. Agric Exp. Stn. 1930; : 167Google Scholar), was shown to produce two types of dextrans that differed by their structures and degree of solubility from sucrose. The less soluble polymer contained 75% of α-(1→6) linkages and 15% of α-(1→4) linkages, whereas the more soluble polymer displayed an uncommon comb-like structure consisting of a linear backbone of α-(1→6)-d-glucopyranosyl residues grafted with one α-(1→3)-linked glucosyl unit on every glucosyl moiety (5.Côté G.L.

Res. 1979; 74: 41-62Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Concomitantly with those findings, dextrans were shown to be synthesized by α-transglucosylases, commonly named glucansucrases, and today classified in the family 70 of glycoside hydrolases (GH70) 3The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; HPAEC-PAD, high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection; HPSEC, high performance size exclusion chromatography; contig, group of overlapping clones.

Biotechnol. 2013; 163: 250-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The GH70 family belongs to the clan GH-H, together with families GH13 and GH77. To date, 279 α-transglucosylase sequences have been reported in the CAZy database, and only 25% has been functionally characterized (11.Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M.

The A, B, and C domains are related to GH13 family enzymes, whereas domains IV and V are GH70-specific domains. The fold of these enzymes is unique, and except for domain C, all domains are formed by non-contiguous fragments of sequences that assemble around a U-turn (15.Vujicic-Zagar A. Pijning T. Kralj S.

Sci. 2010; 107: 21406-21411Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These enzymes are α-retaining enzymes. They mainly catalyze α-transglucosylation reactions through a classical double displacement mechanism. The reaction starts with the formation of a β-d-glucosyl-enzyme intermediate involving a nucleophilic aspartate, an acid-base glutamic acid, and a third aspartate that stabilizes the covalent intermediate. In a second step the intermediate can be intercepted by a water molecule (hydrolysis reaction) or by the hydroxyl group of an acceptor (transglucosylation). The synthesis of the polymer occurs via successive transfers of glucosyl units onto the non-reducing extremity of the growing α-glucan chain (Scheme 1) (16.Moulis C. Joucla G. Harrison D. Fabre E.

Among GH70 sucrose-active enzymes, four subgroups of glucansucrases can be distinguished: the dextransucrases, alternansucrases, mutansucrases, and reuteransucrases, which are all efficient polymerases (10.Leemhuis H. Pijning T. Dobruchowska J.M. van Leeuwen S.S. Kralj S. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L.

Biotechnol. 2013; 163: 250-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, one branching sucrase (GBD-CD2) was engineered from L. citreum NRRL B-1299 DSR-E dextransucrase (19.Fabre E. Bozonnet S. Arcache A. Willemot R.-M. Vignon M. Monsan P. Remaud-Simeon M. Role of the two catalytic domains of DSR-E dextransucrase and their involvement in the formation of highly α-1,2 branched dextran.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This enzyme displays no polymerase activity but catalyzes α-(1→6) dextran branching very efficiently with single α-(1→2)-linked glucosyl units (Scheme 1) (20.Brison Y. Fabre E. Moulis C. Portais J.-C. Monsan P. Remaud-Siméon M. Synthesis of dextrans with controlled amounts of α-1,2 linkages using the transglucosidase GBD-CD2.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, genome sequencing of L. citreum NRRL B-1299 allowed the identification of the first natural α-(1→2) branching sucrase, BRS-A, that shows the same specificity as GBD-CD2. This enzyme was proposed to be involved in the formation of the native dextrans of L. citreum NRRL B-1299 that contain a high percentage of α-(1→2) linkages (21.Passerini D. Vuillemin M. Ufarté L. Morel S. Loux V. Fontagné-Faucher C. Monsan P. Remaud-Siméon M. Moulis C.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 5041-5052Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The formation of the regular hyper-branched dextran of L. citreum NRRL B-742 is even more intriguing. Several attempts to isolate the GH70 enzymes of L. citreum NRRL B-742 were reported. However, although the enzyme responsible for the production of dextran with both α-(1→6) and α-(1→4) linkages was isolated, the enzyme contributing to the comb-like structure was never identified (5.Côté G.L. Robyt J.F. The formation of α-d-(1→3) branch linkages by an exocellular glucansucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-742.Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 119: 141-156Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Of note, most of the GH70 enzyme activities were found strongly attached to the cell wall, making the enzymes difficult to purify (7.Remaud M. Paul F. Monsan P. Lopez-Munguia A. Vignon M. Characterization of α-(1→3) branched oligosaccharides synthesized by acceptor reaction with the extracellular glucosyltransferases from L. mesenteroides NRRL B742.J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1992; 11: 359-378Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Crude enzyme extracts or sucrose fermentation broths were thus used to produce α-(1→3)-branched glucooligosaccharides from sucrose and maltose (7.Remaud M. Paul F. Monsan P. Lopez-Munguia A. Vignon M. Characterization of α-(1→3) branched oligosaccharides synthesized by acceptor reaction with the extracellular glucosyltransferases from L. mesenteroides NRRL B742.J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1992; 11: 359-378Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and these compounds were shown to possess interesting functional properties. In particular, they stimulated in vitro growth of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria or lactobacilli and inhibited the development of pathogens such as Salmonella sp. or Escherichia coli (23.Chung C.H.

In 2000, Kim and Robyt (25.Kim D. Robyt J.F. Production, selection, and characteristics of mutants of Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-742 constitutive for dextransucrases.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1995; 17: 689-695Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) cloned a gene from the mutant strain L. citreum NRRL B-742CB. The encoded protein, DSR-B-742, shared >95% amino acid identity with DSR-B dextransucrase from L. citreum NRRL B-1299 and synthesized a quasilinear dextran with >95% of α-(1→6) linkages (26.Kim H. Kim D. Ryu H.J. Robyt J.F. Cloning and sequencing of the α-1-> 6 dextransucrase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides B-742CB.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 10: 559-563Google Scholar). Thus far the mode of synthesis of the comb-like dextran has remained unknown. A genomic approach was undertaken to gain insight into the formation of this hyper-branched α-glucan and to have access to enzymatic tools of interest for functional glucooligosaccharide synthesis. First, the genome of L. citreum NRRL B-742 was sequenced (27.Passerini D. Vuillemin M. Laguerre S. Amari M. Loux V. Gabriel V. Robert H. Morel S. Monsan P. Gabriel B. Fontagné-Faucher C.

One putative GH70 gene showing divergence from various consensus sequences of GH70 family enzymes was cloned for recombinant expression in E. coli. The corresponding protein, named BRS-B, is an α-(1→3) branching sucrase. A shorter version of BRS-B, named BRS-B-Δ1, was rationally designed and characterized. The specificity of BRS-B and its truncated form was investigated and revealed the interest of these enzymes for the production of α-(1→3)-branched dextrans with a controlled degree of branching. In addition, comparison of these enzymes with the recently discovered α-(1→2) branching sucrase (BRS-A) allowed the identification of two enzymes in public databases that were found to catalyze dextran branching and were clustered with previously characterized branching sucrases in the GH70 phylogenetic tree. The brsB gene was identified in the L. citreum NRRL B-742 genome (27.Passerini D. Vuillemin M. Laguerre S. Amari M. Loux V. Gabriel V. Robert H. Morel S. Monsan P. Gabriel B. Fontagné-Faucher C.

The protein sequence of BRS-B is deposited under the GenBankTM accession number CDX65123.1. Protein sequence comparison was performed either using protein Blast (NCBI) against the non-redundant protein sequence database (nr) for local alignments or using Clustal Omega for global alignments with other GH70 enzymes.

The signal peptide cleavage was predicted using SignalP 4.1 server. L. citreum NRRL B-742 was grown on 1.5 ml of MRS medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at 30 °C overnight. Genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard® genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the supplier's recommendations for Gram-positive bacteria. The gene brsB and a truncated form lacking the signal peptide and the last 575 amino acids at the C terminus of the protein (brsBΔ1) were amplified by PCR from L. citreum NRRL B-742 genomic DNA template. The primers used are described in Table 1. The addition of the CACC sequence (underlined) to the 5′-forward primers allowed the correct insertion of the genes into the pENTR/D-TOPO® vector (Life Technologies). From a positive entry clone, LR recombination (Gateway® LR Clonase® II enzyme mix, Life Technologies) was performed using the destination vectors described in Table 1. Expression clones were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 of ampicillin. Plasmids were extracted with the Sigma GenElute HP Plasmid Miniprep kit, verified by restriction analyses and sequencing (GATC Biotech, Constance, Germany).TABLE 1Primers, vectors, and strains used in this study and their main features Open table in a new tab E. coli BL21-AI and E. coli BL21 star DE3 cells (detailed in Table 1) were freshly transformed by pBAD-49/brsB and pET-55/brsBΔ1, respectively. Thirty milliliters of LB medium, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1), were inoculated with 200 μl of transformation mix and incubated overnight at 37 °C under agitation (200 rpm). One liter of modified ZYM5052 medium (28.Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high-density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar) contained (i) 0% lactose, 0% glucose, 0.5% glycerol and 0.01% l-arabinose for BRS-B production or (ii) 0.1% lactose, 0% glucose and 1% glycerol for BRS-B-Δ1 production. Both were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) and were inoculated with the corresponding starter culture at an A600 nm of 0.05. Cultures were incubated at 21 °C under agitation (150 rpm). After a 26-h incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation, dispersed in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.75, at a final A600 nm 80 and disrupted by sonication. The recombinant enzymes were recovered in the soluble fraction after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) of the crude cell extract. All purification assays were performed using the ÄKTAxpress (GE Healthcare) at 12 °C. For His6 tag affinity chromatography, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm phosphate sodium buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol) at a final A600 nm of 200. After disruption by sonication, centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and filtration through a 0.22-μm cartridge (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France), lysates were applied onto a 1-ml HisTrap HP® column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with the binding buffer. The proteins were eluted by an imidazole gradient from 10 to 500 mm over 25 min. Eluate fractions of 3 ml were desalted onto a 10-DG column (Bio-Rad) with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.75 with 100 mm NaCl, 0.05 g liter−1 CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80. In order to remove small contaminants, purified eluates were washed 3 times onto Vivaspin 2 with a molecular weight cut-off of 100 (Sartorius Stedim Biotech). One unit of BRS-B, BRS-B-Δ1, BRS-C, or BRS-D is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the production of 1 μmol of fructose/min at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.75 from 292 mm sucrose. The enzyme activities were determined by measuring the amount of reducing sugars using the dinitrosalicylic acid method (29.Miller G.L. Use of dinitrosalicylic acid reagent for determination of reducing sugar.Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22220) Google Scholar). Optimal pH and temperature were determined in duplicate using 1 unit·ml−1 of enzyme in the presence of 292 mm sucrose and 119 mm dextran (68,400 g·mol−1) for both BRS-B (in sonicated extract) and the pure BRS-B-Δ1. To evaluate the optimal pH, the assays were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm citrate phosphate buffer with pH values varying from 3.5 to 7.0 in increments of 0.5 units. Optimal temperature was determined from assays carried out in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.75 at temperatures of 23, 26, 30, 33, 37, 40, or 45 °C. The effect of salts on transferase activity of BRS-B-Δ1 was determined by incubating the enzyme (1 unit·ml−1) with 1 mm EDTA to trap the possible presence of any divalent ion in the catalytic core of the enzyme or with 1 mm CaCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, or MgCl2 salts. Activity assays were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.75, 292 mm sucrose, and 119 mm of dextran (68,400 g·mol−1). For all these experiments, the enzymatic activity was determined by measuring fructose release by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Dionex system and using an Aminex® HPX-87K carbohydrate analysis column (300 × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad). Column oven temperature was set at 65 °C, and ultrapure water was used as eluent (0.6 ml min−1). Kinetic parameters with sucrose as the sole substrate were determined in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.75 supplemented with 250 μg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 23 μg ml−1 of purified BRS-B-Δ1 at 30 °C and using initial sucrose concentrations ranging from 3 to 600 mm. All initial velocities were measured by quantifying fructose release at the early stage of reaction (when <5% of the substrate is consumed and when leucrose and other oligosaccharide production can be neglected). At regular time intervals samples were withdrawn and immediately heated at 95 °C for 5 min to stop the reaction. Fructose concentration was determined by HPLC as described above. Km, Ki, and Vmax parameters were determined using SigmaPlot Kinectics software and fitted to a non-competitive substrate inhibition model. Kinetic parameters for α-(1→3) transglucosylation were determined at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.75, supplemented with 250 μg ml−1 BSA, 9.5 mg liter−1 of enzyme, 300 mm sucrose, and dextran of 68,400 g·mol−1 at final concentrations ranging from 31 to 617 mm. For the sake of clarity, dextran concentrations will be expressed as molar concentrations of anhydroglucosyl units within the dextran, as determined by dividing dextran mass concentrations by 162 g·mol−1. All initial velocities were measured when <5% of the sucrose was consumed. Initial α-(1→3) transglucosylation velocities were calculated by subtracting fructose (representing the total activity) by free glucose (representing hydrolase activity) production rates. Glucose and fructose concentrations were determined by HPLC using the same conditions as those described previously. Kmdextran and Vmax were estimated using SigmaPlot Kinetics software and fitted to a Michaelis-Menten model. Various α-(1→6)-linked dextrans of average molar masses ranging from 1500 to 2 × 106 g·mol−1 (Sigma) were incubated at different concentrations with sucrose (9–438 mm) using 1 unit·ml−1 BRS-B (or BRS-B-Δ1) at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.75 for 8–16 h. Reactions were stopped by a 5-min incubation at 95 °C. The various tested sucrose/dextran ratios are reported in supplemental Table S1. To determine production yield and assay sucrose depletion, reaction media were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD (high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection) using a CarboPacTM PA100 (4 × 250 mm) analytical column coupled with a CarboPacTM PA-100 guard (4 × 50 mm). Glucose, fructose, leucrose, and sucrose were separated using a 30-min sodium acetate gradient from 6 to 300 mm in 150 mm NaOH. The amount of each sugar was determined using standards of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg kg−1. Samples were prepared in ultra-pure water and diluted to a final concentration of 10–15 mg kg−1 of total sugars for quantitative analyses and a final concentration of 250 mg·kg−1 (total sugars) for qualitative analyses. The percentage of glucosyl units from sucrose incorporated into glucose (%Gglucose) or leucrose (%Gleucrose) was calculated as follows.%Gglucose=glucosetf-glucoset0×342sucroset0-sucrosetf×180×100(Eq. 1) %Gleucrose=leucrosetf-leucroset0sucroset0-sucrosetf×100(Eq. 2) HPSEC analyses were carried out using Shodex OH-Pak SB-802.5 and SB-805 columns in series coupled with a Shodex OH-Pak SB-G guard column and placed in an oven at 70 °C. Elution was performed using 0.45 m NaNO3 and 1% ethylene glycol (v/v) as the eluent using a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. The samples were diluted at 10 g kg−1 of total sugars and also in 0.45 m NaNO3 and 1% ethylene glycol. The percentage of glucosyl units from sucrose incorporated into α-(1→3)-branched dextran was calculated as,%Gdextran=Areadextran×342Areasucrose×162(Eq. 3) The percentage of glucosyl units from sucrose incorporated into small oligosaccharides was deduced as,%Gsmall oligosaccharides=100%-%Gdextran+%Gglucose+%Gleucrose(Eq. 4) Here %Gdextran, %Gglucose, and %Gleucrose have been determined from HPSEC and HPAEC-PAD analyses. To determine α-(1→3) linkage content, freeze-dried polymer samples were dispersed in deuterated water at a final concentration of 20 mg ml−1. NMR spectra were recorded on an Advance 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker) operating at 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz for 13C using a 5-mm z-gradient TBI probe. The data were processed using TopSpin 3 software. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra was acquired by using a zgpr pulse sequence (with water suppression). All measurements were performed at 298 K, and chemical shifts were referenced to an internal reference sodium 2,2,3,3-tetradeutero-3-trimethylsilylpropanoate (1H = 0 ppm) and acetone (13C = 31.08 ppm). The percentages of α(1→3) and α(1→6) linkages in α-glucans were calculated by integrating the corresponding anomeric proton signals (30.Irague R. Massou S. Moulis C. Saurel O. Milon A. Monsan P.

https://openalex.org/W2232733718,"Objectives To determine mechanisms involved in endothelial dysfunction (ED) during the course of arthritis and to investigate the link between cytokines, chemokines and osteoprotegerin. Approach and Results Experiments were conducted on aortic rings at day 4 (preclinical), day 11 (onset of disease), day 33 (acute disease) and day 90 (chronic disease) after adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in Lewis rats. At day 4, the unique vascular abnormality was a reduced norepinephrine-induced constriction. At day 11, endothelial function assessed by the relaxation to acetylcholine was normal despite increased cyclo-oxygenase-2 activity (COX-2) and overproduction of superoxide anions that was compensated by increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. At day 33, ED apparition coincides with the normalization of NOS activity. At day 90, ED was only observed in rats with a persisting imbalance between endothelial NOS and COX-2 pathways and higher plasma levels of IL-1β and TNFα. Plasma levels of IL-1β, TNFα and MIP-1α negatively correlated with Ach-induced relaxation throughout the course of AIA. Conclusions Our data identified increased endothelial NOS activity as an important compensatory response that opposes the ED in the early arthritis. Thereafter, a cross-talk between endothelial COX-2/NOS pathways appears as an important element for the occurrence of ED. Our results encourage determining the clinical value of IL-1β, TNFα and MIP-1α as biomarkers of ED in RA."
https://openalex.org/W2233505322,"In order to improve clinical management and prevention of viral infections in hospitalised children improved etiological insight is needed. The aim of the present study was to assess the spectrum of respiratory viral pathogens in children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infections in Cyprus. For this purpose nasopharyngeal swab samples from 424 children less than 12 years of age with acute respiratory tract infections were collected over three epidemic seasons and were analysed for the presence of the most common 15 respiratory viruses. A viral pathogen was identified in 86% of the samples, with multiple infections being observed in almost 20% of the samples. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV (30.4%) and Rhinovirus (27.4%). RSV exhibited a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year. While RSV and PIV3 incidence decreased significantly with age, the opposite was observed for influenza A and B as well as adenovirus infections. The data presented expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and will be helpful to the clinicians and researchers interested in the treatment and control of viral respiratory tract infections."
https://openalex.org/W2234632463,"Ulvan is the main polysaccharide component of the Ulvales (green seaweed) cell wall. It is composed of disaccharide building blocks comprising 3-sulfated rhamnose linked to d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA), l-iduronic acid (IdoUA), or d-xylose (Xyl). The degradation of ulvan requires ulvan lyase, which catalyzes the endolytic cleavage of the glycoside bond between 3-sulfated rhamnose and uronic acid according to a β-elimination mechanism. The first characterized ulvan lyase was identified in Nonlabens ulvanivorans, an ulvanolytic bacterial isolate. In the current study, we have identified and biochemically characterized novel ulvan lyases from three Alteromonadales isolated bacteria. Two homologous ulvan lyases (long and short) were found in each of the bacterial genomes. The protein sequences have no homology to the previously reported ulvan lyases and therefore are the first representatives of a new family of polysaccharide lyases. The enzymes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli to determine their mode of action. The heterologous expressed enzymes were secreted into the milieu subsequent to their signal sequence cleavage. An endolytic mode of action was observed and studied using gel permeation chromatography and 1H NMR. In contrast to N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase, cleavage occurred specifically at the GlcUA residues. In light of the genomic context and modular structure of the ulvan lyase families identified to date, we propose that two ulvan degradation pathways evolved independently.

Ulvales are green algae that proliferate in eutrophicated coastal waters. Members of this family are commonly grown and collected for food or feed, although currently most of the biomass is put to limited use (1Lahaye M. Brunel M. Bonnin E. Fine chemical structure analysis of oligosaccharides produced by an ulvan-lyase degradation of the water-soluble cell-wall polysaccharides from Ulva sp, (Ulvales, Chlorophyta).Carbohydr.

Structure and functional properties of ulvan, a polysaccharide from green seaweeds.Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Among the polymers synthesized by these algae, ulvan is the most abundant polysaccharide in the architecture of the cell wall (2Lahaye M. Robic A. Structure and functional properties of ulvan, a polysaccharide from green seaweeds.Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This complex water-soluble anionic polysaccharide represents up to 29% of the algae dry weight (3Robic A. Gaillard C. Sassi J.-F. Lerat Y. Lahaye M. Ultrastructure of ulvan: a polysaccharide from green seaweeds.Biopolymers. 2009; 91: 652-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although the constituent ratio might vary according to algae growth conditions, it is mainly composed of 3-sulfated rhamnose (R3S), 3The abbreviations used are: R3S, 3-sulfated rhamnose; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; IdoUA, l-iduronic acid; Xyl, d-xylose; CM, conditioned medium; GH, glycoside hydrolase. d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA), l-iduronic acid (IdoUA), and d-xylose (Xyl) (2Lahaye M. Robic A. Structure and functional properties of ulvan, a polysaccharide from green seaweeds.Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Ulvan building blocks appear frequently as repeating disaccharides comprising either GlcUA or IdoUA linked to R3S, termed ulvanobiuronic acid A or B, respectively (2Lahaye M. Robic A. Structure and functional properties of ulvan, a polysaccharide from green seaweeds.Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In addition, disaccharide moieties made of R3S linked to Xyl occur in lower amounts. Ulvan's unique chemical and physicochemical properties make it an attractive candidate for several applications in the food/feed, agriculture, pharmaceutical, and biomaterials industries (2Lahaye M. Robic A. Structure and functional properties of ulvan, a polysaccharide from green seaweeds.Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In contrast to polysaccharides extracted from brown and red algae (e.g. alginate and agar, respectively), which are widely used in industry for their gelling and thickening properties, polysaccharides of green algae are less exploited. Expanding our understanding of ulvan structure and its enzymatic degradation would enable more extensive biomass utilization. Thus far, only a few ulvan-degrading enzymes have been isolated from both marine and terrestrial microorganisms. Some of them, like the glucuronan lyases isolated from Sinorhizobium meliloti (4Da Costa A. Michaud P. Petit E. Heyraud A. Colin-Morel P. Courtois B. Courtois J.

(1Lahaye M. Brunel M. Bonnin E. Fine chemical structure analysis of oligosaccharides produced by an ulvan-lyase degradation of the water-soluble cell-wall polysaccharides from Ulva sp, (Ulvales, Chlorophyta).Carbohydr.

More recently, several bacterial strains capable of metabolizing ulvan were isolated from the feces of a sea slug, Aplysia punctate, fed with Ulva. In this way, the Gram-negative Nonlabens ulvanivorans PLR was identified (6Barbeyron T. Lerat Y. Sassi J.-F. Le Panse S. Helbert W. Collén P.N.

Draft genome sequence of Nonlabens ulvanivorans, an ulvan-degrading bacterium.Genome Announc. 2014; 2: e00793PubMed Google Scholar). A novel ulvan lyase was purified from N. ulvanivorans batch culture, sequenced, and heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme's ability to depolymerize ulvan biochemically characterized (9Nyvall Collén P. Sassi J.-F. Rogniaux H. Marfaing H. Helbert W. Ulvan lyases isolated from the Flavobacteria Persicivirga ulvanivorans are the first members of a new polysaccharide lyase family.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42063-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase was reported to cleave ulvan at the β(1→4) glyosidic bond between R3S and GlcUA or IdoUA via the β-elimination mechanism. The proton at the C5 position is abstracted, regardless of its configuration (syn for IdoUA or anti for GlcUA) with the hydroxyl group at C4 (Fig. 1). The β-eliminative cleavage results in the formation of a reducing end on one fragment and an unsaturated ring (Δ, 4-deoxy-l-threo-hex-4-enopyranosiduronic acid) on the non-reducing end of the second fragment (10Garron M.-L. Cygler M. Structural and mechanistic classification of uronic acid-containing polysaccharide lyases.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1547-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because the protein sequence of N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase had no characterized homolog in the databases, it was considered the first representative of a new family of polysaccharide lyases. Sequence encoding an unsaturated β-glucuronyl hydrolase belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family GH105 (based on the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database) was found in the vicinity of the ulvan lyase in the N. ulvanivorans genome. This enzyme was shown to cleave specifically the unsaturated non-reducing end of the end products of the ulvan lyase (11Collén P.N. Jeudy A. Sassi J.-F. Groisillier A. Czjzek M. Coutinho P.M. Helbert W. A novel unsaturated β-glucuronyl hydrolase involved in ulvan degradation unveils the versatility of stereochemistry requirements in family GH105.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 6199-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The spatial proximity within the genome of these two ulvan-degrading enzymes pointed to occurrence of polysaccharide utilization loci. With this premise in mind, we sequenced the genome of N. ulvanivorans and three additional ulvanolytic Alteromonadales isolates: Alteromonas sp. LOR, Alteromonas sp. LTR, and Pseudoalteromonas sp. PLSV (12Kopel M. Helbert W. Henrissat B. Doniger T. Banin E.

Helbert W. Henrissat B. Doniger T. Banin E. Draft genome sequence of Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain PLSV, an ulvan-degrading bacterium.Genome Announc. 2014; 2: e01257PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the genomes did not reveal genes encoding proteins homologous to N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase. This led us to hypothesize that additional ulvan lyases that do not share sequence similarity with the known ulvan lyase may be encoded in the genomes of the three other ulvanolytic strains. Here, we report identification and biochemical characterization of four novel ulvan lyases, which belong to a new polysaccharide lyase family now being established 4B. Henrissat, personal communication. and are unrelated to N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase. The bacterial strains and primers used in this study are listed in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, respectively. Native ulvan-degrading isolates were grown in Marine Broth (Difco) at 25 °C, whereas E. coli strains were grown in Luria Bertani (LB medium, Difco) at 37 °C. When appropriate, cultures were supplemented with antibiotics as indicated in Table 1. Primers were designed for amplifying genes of interest from the corresponding genomic DNA, with (e.g. LOR_107) and without their native signal peptide (e.g. LOR_107d) (Table 2). Both the insert and the expression vector were digested using the relevant restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated to form a C terminus His-tagged protein. Recombinant plasmids were used to transform T7-expressing-competent E. coli (New England Biolabs) (Table 1).TABLE 2Primers used in this studyNumberNameSequenceMK1634LOR_61_NcoI_FGAGAGTCCATGGATATGAAATGTCTAAAAACATTGTTAGTMK1635LOR_61_BamHI_RGAGAGGGATCCATTAGAACTACAGCGTGAATAAGTACMK1644LOR_107_NcoI_FGAGAGTCCATGGTCATGAAAATAAATCTAAGCATGCGMK1645LOR_107_XhoI_RAGATCTCTCGAGCTCAGTAACACCCAAGTCGMK1791PSLV_3875_NcoI_FAGAGAGCCATGGATATGAAATTAAATCTAAAAGCGAGTGMK1792PSLV_3875_XhoI_RGAGAGTCTCGAGCCTAGAAACACCCAAATCAATAACMK1793PSLV_3925_NcoI_FAGAGAGCCATGGATATGAACGGTTTAAAAATGTTGMK1794PSLV_3925_XhoI_RGAGAGTCTCGAGATTAGAGGTGCAGCGCMK1156PLR_UL_NcoI_FGAGAGTCCATGGTGTTTTTTAAAGATTTATTCATCTTTMK1157PLR_UL_NotI_RAGAGAGGCGGCCGCATTTACAATGAGCTTGGTTTGATAMK1577PLR_48_EcoRI_FGAGAGTGAATTCAATGAGAAAATTAAAATATAATACTACTAGAGMK1578PLR_48_NotI_RAGAGAGGCGGCCGCTTTACCTCATCTTTTGTATAGCTAGMK1684LOR_107d_NcoI_FGAGAGTCCATGGCAAATGATAGCGTGTCG Open table in a new tab TABLE 1Strains used in this studyStrainRelevant featuresReferenceUlvanolytic strainsN. ulvanivorans PLRUlvan-degrading strain, genome as a template6Barbeyron T.

Batch culture was inoculated 1:50 (v/v) with transformed cells grown overnight and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C to reach optical density (600 nm) of 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced with 0.01 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 18 h at 16 °C. The induced culture was fractionated by centrifugation to obtain the culture supernatant containing secreted enzymes (herein termed conditioned medium, i.e. CM) and cell pellet as two separated fractions. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl at pH 7.5. Cells were lysed using a French press followed by centrifugation to remove bacterial debris. The resulting supernatant was applied to a nickel-Sepharose column charged with 100 mm NiSO4 (GE Healthcare). After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole ranging from 5 to 500 mm. The active fractions were pooled, and protein purification was verified using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with instant blue (Expedeon). Recombinant protein yields measured by NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific) were 2.03 mg/ml and 60 μg/ml purified from pET28a and pET22b constructs, respectively. Expression levels of His tagged proteins in CM and cell lysate fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using His·Tag monoclonal antibodies (Novagen) followed with ECL detection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ulvan was provided by CEVA (Pleubian, France) and the polysaccharide was extracted from Ulva rotundata and was obtained as described by Nyvall Collén et al. (9Nyvall Collén P. Sassi J.-F. Rogniaux H. Marfaing H. Helbert W. Ulvan lyases isolated from the Flavobacteria Persicivirga ulvanivorans are the first members of a new polysaccharide lyase family.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42063-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Screening for ulvan lyases by monitoring the formation of reducing ends was carried out using the ferricyanide method described by Lane and Lawen (14Lane D.J.R. Lawen A. A highly sensitive colorimetric microplate ferrocyanide assay applied to ascorbate-stimulated transplasma membrane ferricyanide reduction and mitochondrial succinate oxidation.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 g liter−1 ulvan in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl at pH 7.5 was incubated in 1:1 (v/v) ratio with overexpressed cell lysate at 30 °C and sampled at various time points. Samples were mixed at 1:10 ratio (v/v) with ferricyanide solution composed of 300 mg liter−1 K3Fe(CN)6 (Sigma-Aldrich), 28 g liter−1 Na2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 ml liter−1 5 m NaOH dissolved in purified water (Milli-Q). The mixture was boiled and cooled, and the amount of reducing ends was monitored by measuring absorbance at 415 nm. Characterization of the ulvan lyases was also performed by measuring the formation of double bonds in the assay at 235 nm as described previously (15Maruyama Y. Nakamichi Y. Itoh T. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18059-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The spectrophotometer (SynergyTM 4 Hybrid Microplate Reader, BioTek) was set to read at intervals at the appropriate temperature. The assay solution was composed of 1 g liter−1 ulvan in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl at pH 7.5 in 180 μl unless otherwise specified. 5 μl of purified enzyme (300 ng/ml) was added directly to the assay. The increase in absorbance at 235 nm was followed for up to 120 min. Degradation kinetics of ulvan was measured by gel permeation chromatography after various incubation periods with 6 μg/ml purified LOR_107d. Ulvan solution was incubated with 60 μg/ml purified enzymes to obtain complete degradation into oligo-ulvan end products for 1H NMR analysis. The assay solutions were composed of 100 g liter−1 ulvan in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl at pH 7.5. Ulvan degradation kinetics were monitored by analytical gel permeation chromatography. Samples were injected on a Superdex 200 (10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) and a peptide HR (10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) column coupled in series. Elution was conducted with an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Dionex) operating at 0.5 ml min−1 with 50 mm (NH4)2CO3 (pH 8) as the eluent. Detection of products was achieved with a Rapid Separation LC (RSLC) UV detector (Thermo Scientific, Dionex) operating at 235 nm, along with an IOTA 2 refractive index detector (Precision Instruments). Oligo-ulvan end products were purified using filtered digested ulvan (0.22-μm nylon Clarinert syringe filters, Agela Technologies). Samples were injected on three Superdex 30 columns (GE Healthcare, 2.6 × 60 cm) mounted in a series. Elution was conducted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min−1. Oligosaccharides were collected with a Foxy R1 collector (Teledyne ISCO) controlled by AZUR software (Datalys). 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a 400-MHz Avance DRX400 spectrometer (Bruker) in deuterated water as solvent and calibrated against the residual signal of the solvent. Prior to analysis, samples were exchanged twice in D2O and re-dissolved in D2O (99.97 atom % D). Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm in reference to an external standard (trimethylsilyl propionic acid). The HOD signal was not suppressed. The genomes of the following four ulvan-degrading bacteria were sequenced and assembled: N. ulvanivorans PLR, Alteromonas sp. LOR, Alteromonas sp. LTR, and Pseudoalteromonas sp. PLSV, (8Kopel M. Helbert W. Henrissat B. Doniger T. Banin E. Draft genome sequence of Nonlabens ulvanivorans, an ulvan-degrading bacterium.Genome Announc. 2014; 2: e00793PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kopel M. Helbert W.

Helbert W. Henrissat B. Doniger T. Banin E. Draft genome sequence of Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain PLSV, an ulvan-degrading bacterium.Genome Announc. 2014; 2: e01257PubMed Google Scholar). Genome annotation was manually confirmed by CAZy4 and revealed that these strains encoded many polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. For example, the genome of Alteromonas sp. LOR contained more than 60 glycoside hydrolases (GH) and polysaccharide lyases. Unexpectedly, genes coding for proteins with sequence homologous to the known ulvan lyase (9Nyvall Collén P. Sassi J.-F. Rogniaux H. Marfaing H. Helbert W. Ulvan lyases isolated from the Flavobacteria Persicivirga ulvanivorans are the first members of a new polysaccharide lyase family.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42063-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were not detected. This suggested that degradation of ulvan in Alteromonas sp. LOR might be performed by a novel set of enzymes. Inspection of the Alteromonas sp. LOR genome revealed that genes involved in the same metabolic pathway were grouped in clusters. Specifically, several GH- and sulfatase-encoding genes were co-located, making these clusters candidate sulfated polysaccharide utilization loci. Ten genes (WP_032096141.1, WP_032096210.1, WP_032096154.1, WP_032096198.1, WP_032096199.1, WP_052010186.1, WP_032096200.1, WP_032096220.1, KU168251, and WP_032096201.1) that code for hypothetical proteins located within these gene clusters or polysaccharide utilization loci were cloned, and the translated proteins were overexpressed using pET22b in E. coli cells (BL21). The soluble expressed proteins were incubated with ulvan, and degradation was monitored by detecting the formation of reducing ends (i.e. ferricyanide method (14Lane D.J.R. Lawen A. A highly sensitive colorimetric microplate ferrocyanide assay applied to ascorbate-stimulated transplasma membrane ferricyanide reduction and mitochondrial succinate oxidation.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) and by measuring unsaturation at the non-reducing end (using UV at 235 nm). Strong degradation of ulvan was only observed for LOR_107 using both detection methods. Taken together, these observations suggested that LOR_107 is a lyase that cleaves the glycosidic bond to form an unsaturation, likely caused by the β-elimination reaction (data not shown). Sequence analysis of LOR_107 indicated the presence of a 31-amino acid signal peptide, with a cleavage site between a threonine at position 31 and an alanine at position 32 (when combining analysis of the SignalP and PrediSi software (16Petersen T.N.

Grote A. Scheer M. Münch R. Jahn D. PrediSi: prediction of signal peptides and their cleavage positions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W375-W379Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar)). Heterologous expression was conducted using pET28a as the expression vector and the full LOR_107 (LOR_107) or truncated LOR_107 (LOR_107d), the latter with the signal peptide deleted. The optimal temperature for overexpression induction and yield of soluble protein was found to be 16 °C (as compared with 37 and 25 °C). Protein expression was induced for 18 h, and the culture was fractionated by centrifugation to obtain the CM and cell pellet. The cell pellet was resuspended and disrupted, and then the cell lysate was collected. The two fractions, CM and cell lysate, were incubated with ulvan to determine ulvan lyase activity. No ulvan lyase activity was detected in the culture supernatant of LOR_107d. Most of the enzyme activity was measured in the cell lysate, which accorded with the absence of signal peptide. Conversely, the LOR_107 supernatant exhibited strong ulvan lyase activity (Fig. 2, A and B). We used Western blotting analysis to detect the His-tagged proteins in fractions that showed ulvan lyase activity (Fig. 2C). The cell lysate of the LOR_107 contains two bands ∼5 kDa apart, suggesting cleavage of the signal peptide. Furthermore, the apparent molecular mass of the secreted LOR_107 protein found in the CM is similar to the construct without the signal peptide (i.e. LOR_107d) found in the cell lysate, reinforcing our hypothesis that the enzyme is secreted. 1H NMR of ulvan is presented in Fig. 3. The anomeric protons corresponding to iduronic acid (IdoUA-H1, 5.08 ppm), glucuronic acid (GlcUA, 4.58 ppm), and sulfated rhamnose (R3S, 4.90 and 4.82 ppm) were ascribed according to Lahaye and Robic (2Lahaye M. Robic A. Structure and functional properties of ulvan, a polysaccharide from green seaweeds.Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Following enzyme degradation, two intense signals appeared at 5.98 ppm (Δ-H1) and 5.46 ppm (Δ-H4) attributed to the unsaturated bond located at the non-reducing end of the end product of lyases. The peaks corresponding to the anomeric protons of the sulfated rhamnose residues linked to glucuronic acid residue (GlcUA-R3S-H1 4.82 and 4.9 ppm) decreased strongly. Similarly, the anomeric proton of the glucuronic acid residue (GlcUA-H1, 4.58 ppm) almost completely disappeared in contrast to the anomeric proton of the iduronic acid residue (IdoUA-H1), suggesting that the enzyme preferentially cleaves glucuronic acid residues. Degradation kinetics of the ulvan lyase were followed at 235 nm to determine the optimal condition for activity. Initial velocity increased with temperature up to 40 °C; above this temperature, the enzyme began losing activity. The curve representing initial velocity as a function of pH showed a typical bell shape centered around pH 8. Variation of one pH unit led to a decrease of 8% in enzyme activity (data not shown). Ulvan depolymerization catalyzed by LOR-107d ulvan lyase was monitored using gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 4). After the addition of enzyme, the molecular mass of ulvan, which eluted between 14 and 20 min of elution time, decreased rapidly, and intermediate oligo-ulvans appeared between 40 and 66 min of elution time (Fig. 4). After 24 h of incubation, the majority of the ulvan polysaccharides were converted into small-sized oligo-ulvans. The ulvan lyase end products were purified and characterized by 1H NMR according to Lahaye et al. (1Lahaye M. Brunel M. Bonnin E. Fine chemical structure analysis of oligosaccharides produced by an ulvan-lyase degradation of the water-soluble cell-wall polysaccharides from Ulva sp, (Ulvales, Chlorophyta).Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 304: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The most abundant end products eluting at 63 min were disaccharides attributed to the 4-deoxy-l-threo-hex-4-enopyranosiduronic acid linked to sulfated rhamnose (Δ-R3Sα/β, Fig. 5A). The second most abundant end product was a tetrasaccharide eluting at about 56 min, the structure of which was determined as Δ-R3S-IdoUA-R3Sα/β (Fig. 5B). A second minor tetrasaccharide was also purified, with the 1H NMR characteristic of Δ-R3S-Xyl-R3Sα/β. Based on identification of LOR_107, inspection of the genome of Alteromonas LOR revealed a second ulvan lyase, LOR_61. The molecular mass of the protein encoded by LOR_61 was estimated as 110.9 kDa, and the structure was predicted to comprise two modules when aligned with the short ulvan lyase (Fig. 6). The first module of 55.2 kDa was observed to share 68% sequence identity with LOR_107. The second module of 54.7 kDa at the C terminus was noted to resemble a conserved type II dockerin repeat domain (18Smith S.P. Bayer E.A. Insights into cellulosome assembly and dynamics: from dissection to reconstruction of the supramolecular enzyme complex.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) along with three repeating motifs of unclear function (p value < 0.0001) (19Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. Combining evidence using p-values: application to sequence homology searches.Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The full protein was cloned and overexpressed successfully and, as expected, demonstrated ulvan lyase activity (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7.Biochemical characterization of ulvan degradation by purified heterologous overexpressed ulvan lyases.

Alteromonas LTR ulvan lyase sequences (LTR_2195, LTR_2241) are 100% identical to Alteromonas LOR ulvan lyases (LOR_61, LOR_107, respectively). The long protein similarly comprised an ulvan lyase catalytic module and a conserved type II dockerin. The proteins were overexpressed, and ulvanolytic activity was confirmed using gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 7). The end products were similar to those generated by LOR_107, suggesting common modalities of ulvan degradation.TABLE 3Molecular mass and GenBank accession numbers of the short and long ulvan lyases found in the genomes of Alteromonas sp. strains LOR and LTR, Pseudoalteromonas sp.

The optimal temperature and pH for the three ulvan lyases were comparable, with only small variations observed. For example, temperature and pH optimum for PLSV_3875 was found to be 50 °C at pH 8, which differed only slightly from that observed for LOR_107. Notably, PLSV_3875 exhibited higher stability at elevated temperatures as compared with LOR_107, remaining 100% active after 24 h at 30 °C, whereas LOR_107 lost 90% of its activity in similar conditions. The new ulvan lyase catalytic module sequence (Glu22–Leu495 in LOR_61) was utilized to screen for other homologous sequences in the database. Similarity searches were performed using BLASTp (20Johnson M. Zaretskaya I. Raytselis Y. Merezhuk Y. McGinnis S. Madden T.L. NCBI BLAST: a better web interface.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W5-W9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar) against all non-redundant (nr) protein databases. Sequence-based similarity results showed 128 sequences with significant identity (E-value < 1 × 10−4). Homologous ulvan lyases were found in several bacterial strains, with the highest sequence similarities (up to 88% identity found in Pseudoalteromonas sp. PLSV, E-value = 0.0) and in certain marine strains. The majority of the marine strains belong to Gammaproteobacteria, although surprisingly Flavobacteriaceae were found to possess putative proteins with 57% identity (E-value = 0.0). A few strains have multiple homologous proteins in their genome. Specifically, Catenovulum agarivorans DS-2 is highly exceptional in that six homologous proteins were identified in the genome: four proteins with sequence identity greater than 62% and two others with greater than 44%. Putative protein-coding genes located in a gene cluster likely involved in carbohydrate metabolism were cloned and overexpressed, and the resulting proteins were screened for ulvanolytic activity. This targeted screening strategy enabled identification of a new ulvan lyase, LOR_107, with a protein sequence unrelated to the previously characterized N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase (9Nyvall Collén P. Sassi J.-F. Rogniaux H. Marfaing H. Helbert W. Ulvan lyases isolated from the Flavobacteria Persicivirga ulvanivorans are the first members of a new polysaccharide lyase family.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42063-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 1H NMR analysis of the degradation end products, composed essentially of Δ-R3S and Δ-R3S-IdoUA-R3S, indicated that LOR_107 ulvan lyase cleaves specifically the β(1→4) glycoside bond between GlcUA and R3S residues according to a β-elimination mechanism. This substrate specificity is a unique feature, as the previously identified ulvan lyase in N. ulvanivorans cleaves both GlcUA and IdoUA residues by abstraction of the proton on the C5 position in both configurations, syn or anti, with regard to the hydroxyl group on C4 (9Nyvall Collén P. Sassi J.-F. Rogniaux H. Marfaing H. Helbert W. Ulvan lyases isolated from the Flavobacteria Persicivirga ulvanivorans are the first members of a new polysaccharide lyase family.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42063-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein sequences homologous to LOR_107 were found in Alteromonas sp. LOR (LOR_61) and in two recently sequenced genomes: Alteromonas sp. LTR and Pseudoalteromonas sp. PLSV. Each of these proteins was shown to be an endo-ulvan lyase, producing end products similar to LOR_107. Taken together, these proteins represent the first members of a new family of biochemically characterized polysaccharide lyases. A bioinformatic search using the newly identified protein sequence indicated that many other putative proteins could be members of this novel lyase family. Further, based on the BLASTp results, it seems that this new family is much more abundant in bacterial genomes than the first ulvan lyase family identified in N. ulvanivorans (128 as compared with 20 sequences, respectively, E-value < 1 × 10−4). A key difference between the two ulvan lyase families is the distinctive recognition modalities allowing the LOR ulvan lyase to cleave specifically the glycoside bond between GlcUA and R3S, as opposed to the N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase that cleaves both GlcUA and IdoUA attached to R3S. Furthermore, the ulvan lyase end products are degraded by β-glucuronyl hydrolase belonging to the GH105 family in N. ulvanivorans (11Collén P.N. Jeudy A. Sassi J.-F. Groisillier A. Czjzek M. Coutinho P.M. Helbert W. A novel unsaturated β-glucuronyl hydrolase involved in ulvan degradation unveils the versatility of stereochemistry requirements in family GH105.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 6199-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, β-glucuronyl hydrolase belonging to the GH88 family appears proximal to the long ulvan lyase of Alteromonas LOR, LTR and Pseudoalteromonas PLSV. This proximity suggests that different enzymes are involved in the degradation of oligo-ulvans. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that at least two different pathways of ulvan degradation have evolved independently to perform saccharification of ulvan. In Alteromonas LOR, Alteromonas LTR, and Pseudoalteromonas PLSV, we found two homologous ulvan lyases: one “short” (59 kDa) and one “long” (110 kDa). The “short” ulvan lyase comprised the catalytic module preceded by a signal peptide, suggesting that it is exported outside the bacterial cell. Interestingly, we were able to show that E. coli can identify the Alteromonas signal peptide and cleave it while secreting a mature and active enzyme to the milieu. The “long” ulvan lyase in addition to the ulvan lyase catalytic module (i.e. the “short” segment) had a conserved type II dockerin repeat domain of about 6.7 kDa at the C-terminal of the protein. Dockerin domains are involved in anchorage of proteins at the cell surface by binding to cohesin (21Jindou S. Kajino T. Inagaki M. Karita S. Beguin P. Kimura T. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. Interaction between a type-II dockerin domain and a type-II cohesin domain from Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 924-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A module of about 48 kDa of unknown function was inserted between the catalytic and dockerin module. In this regard, it is notable that two ulvan lyases were also documented in N. ulvanivorans. The short version is composed of a catalytic module with signal peptide, whereas the long ulvan lyase also comprises a Por secretion system (recently renamed type IX secretion system) C-terminal sorting domain sequence. The C-terminal sorting domain mediates protein secretion by the type IX secretion system, a system that is unique to the Bacteroidetes phylum (22Shrivastava A. Johnston J.J. van Baaren J.M.

Flavobacterium johnsoniae, which also belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum, utilizes the type IX secretion system both for gliding motility and for extracellular chitinase secretion (26Sato K.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). As genes corresponding to the type IX secretion system apparatus were also found in the N. ulvanivorans genome, the C-terminal sorting domain sequence in the “long” N. ulvanivorans ulvan lyase likely serves to ensure secretion to the medium. Full enzymatic conversion of ulvan to monosaccharides requires several more enzymes in addition to ulvan lyase and β-glucuronyl hydrolase, e.g. sulfatase, rhamnosidase, and xylosidase. Employment of a similar polysaccharide utilization locus screening strategy to that reported here may enable discovery of these enzymes. Further mining of the putative proteins may lead to the discovery of novel enzymatic activities and new GH families. M. K., W. H., A. H., and E. B. designed and analyzed data. M. K, Y. B., and V.

https://openalex.org/W2236056553,"Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health burden in western societies. The progressive form of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterized by hepatosteatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and hepatic damage that can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis; risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. Given the scope of NASH, validating treatment protocols (i.e., low fat diets and weight loss) is imperative. Methods We evaluated the efficacy of two diets, a non-purified chow (NP) and purified (low-fat low-cholesterol, LFLC) diet to reverse western diet (WD)-induced NASH and fibrosis in Ldlr-/- mice. Results Mice fed WD for 22–24 weeks developed robust hepatosteatosis with mild fibrosis, while mice maintained on the WD an additional 7–8 weeks developed NASH with moderate fibrosis. Returning WD-fed mice to the NP or LFLC diets significantly reduced body weight and plasma markers of metabolic syndrome (dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia) and hepatic gene expression markers of inflammation (Mcp1), oxidative stress (Nox2), fibrosis (Col1A, LoxL2, Timp1) and collagen crosslinking (hydroxyproline). Time course analyses established that plasma triglycerides and hepatic Col1A1 mRNA were rapidly reduced following the switch from the WD to the LFLC diet. However, hepatic triglyceride content and fibrosis did not return to normal levels 8 weeks after the change to the LFLC diet. Time course studies further revealed a strong association (r2 ≥ 0.52) between plasma markers of inflammation (TLR2 activators) and hepatic fibrosis markers (Col1A, Timp1, LoxL2). Inflammation and fibrosis markers were inversely associated (r2 ≥ 0.32) with diet-induced changes in hepatic ω3 and ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content. Conclusion These studies establish a temporal link between plasma markers of inflammation and hepatic PUFA and fibrosis. Low-fat low-cholesterol diets promote reversal of many, but not all, features associated with WD-induced NASH and fibrosis in Ldlr-/- mice."

Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the impressive therapeutic potential of adoptive therapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected T cells to target hematological cancers, and emerging studies suggest a similar impact may be achieved for solid cancers. We sought determine whether genetically-modified T cells targeting the CE7-epitope of L1-CAM, a cell adhesion molecule aberrantly expressed in several cancers, have promise as an immunotherapy for ovarian cancer, first demonstrating that L1-CAM was highly over-expressed on a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, primary ovarian tumor tissue specimens, and ascites-derived primary cancer cells. Human central memory derived T cells (TCM) were then genetically modified to express an anti-L1-CAM CAR (CE7R), which directed effector function upon tumor antigen stimulation as assessed by in vitro cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity assays. We also found that CE7R+ T cells were able to target primary ovarian cancer cells. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of CE7R+ TCM induced a significant regression of i.p. established SK-OV-3 xenograft tumors in mice, inhibited ascites formation, and conferred a significant survival advantage compared with control-treated animals. Taken together, these studies indicate that adoptive transfer of L1-CAM-specific CE7R+ T cells may offer a novel and effective immunotherapy strategy for advanced ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2235320379,"Females of many species adaptively program their offspring to predictable environmental conditions, a process that is often mediated by hormones. Laboratory studies have shown, for instance, that social density affects levels of maternal cortisol and testosterone, leading to fitness-relevant changes in offspring physiology and behaviour. However, the effects of social density remain poorly understood in natural populations due to the difficulty of disentangling confounding influences such as climatic variation and food availability. Colonially breeding marine mammals offer a unique opportunity to study maternal effects in response to variable colony densities under similar ecological conditions. We therefore quantified maternal and offspring hormone levels in 84 Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) from two closely neighbouring colonies of contrasting density. Hair samples were used as they integrate hormone levels over several weeks or months and therefore represent in utero conditions during foetal development. We found significantly higher levels of cortisol and testosterone (both P < 0.001) in mothers from the high density colony, reflecting a more stressful and competitive environment. In addition, offspring testosterone showed a significant positive correlation with maternal cortisol (P < 0.05). Although further work is needed to elucidate the potential consequences for offspring fitness, these findings raise the intriguing possibility that adaptive foetal programming might occur in fur seals in response to the maternal social environment. They also lend support to the idea that hormonally mediated maternal effects may depend more strongly on the maternal regulation of androgen rather than cortisol levels."

Uncoated urea and PCU were compared for their effects on gaseous (N2O and NH3) and aqueous (NO3(-)) N environmental losses in cool season turfgrass over the entire PCU N-release period. Field studies were conducted on established turfgrass sites with mixtures of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in sand and loam soils. Each study compared 0 kg N ha(-1) (control) to 200 kg N ha(-1) applied as either urea or PCU (Duration 45CR®). Application of urea resulted in 127-476% more evolution of measured N2O into the atmosphere, whereas PCU was similar to background emission levels from the control. Compared to urea, PCU reduced NH3 emissions by 41-49% and N2O emissions by 45-73%, while improving growth and verdure compared to the control. Differences in leachate NO3(-) among urea, PCU and control were inconclusive. This improvement in N management to ameliorate atmospheric losses of N using PCU will contribute to conserving natural resources and mitigating environmental impacts of N fertilization in turfgrass."

The pre-processing stage improves tissue image appearance and the vessel wall area is delimited. In the feature extraction stage, the vessel wall components are segmented by grouping pixels with a similar color. The area of each component is calculated by normalizing the number of pixels of each group by the vessel wall area. Statistical analyses are implemented by permutation tests, based on resampling without replacement from the set of the observed data to obtain a sampling distribution of an estimator. The implementation can be parallelized on a multicore machine to reduce execution time.The methods have been tested on 48 vessel wall samples of the internal saphenous vein stained with Masson's trichrome. The results show that the segmented areas are consistent with the perception of a team of doctors and demonstrate good correlation between the expert judgments and the measured parameters for evaluating vessel wall changes.The proposed methodology offers a powerful tool to quantify some components of the vessel wall. It is more objective, sensitive and accurate than the biochemical and qualitative methods traditionally used. The permutation tests are suitable statistical techniques to analyze the numerical measurements obtained when the underlying assumptions of the other statistical techniques are not met."
https://openalex.org/W2239646654,"A flexible linker (Lnk2) composed of 26 amino acids connects kringle-1 to kringle-2 in the coagulation factor prothrombin. Recent studies point to Lnk2 as a key determinant of the structure and function of this zymogen. Using a combination of mutagenesis, structural biology, and single molecule spectroscopy, we show how Lnk2 influences activation and conformational plasticity of prothrombin. Scrambling the sequence of Lnk2 is inconsequential on activation, and so is extension by as many as 22 residues. On the other hand, below a critical length of 15 residues, the rate of prothrombin activation increases (10-fold) in the absence of cofactor Va and decreases (3-fold) in the presence of cofactor. Furthermore, activation by prothrombinase takes place without preference along the prethrombin-2 (cleavage at Arg(271) first) or meizothrombin (cleavage at Arg(320) first) pathways. Notably, these transitions in the rate and pathway of activation require the presence of phospholipids, pointing to an important physiological role for Lnk2 when prothrombin is anchored to the membrane. Two new crystal structures of prothrombin lacking 22 (ProTΔ146-167) or 14 (ProTΔ154-167) residues of Lnk2 document striking conformational rearrangements of domains located across this linker. FRET measurements of freely diffusing single molecules prove that these structural transitions are genuine properties of the zymogen in solution. These findings support a molecular model of prothrombin activation where Lnk2 presents the sites of cleavage at Arg(271) and Arg(320) to factor Xa in different orientations by pivoting the C-terminal kringle-2/protease domain pair on the N-terminal Gla domain/kringle-1 pair anchored to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2234103163,"Background Research suggests that interaction between humans and digital environments characterizes a form of companionship in addition to technical convenience. To this effect, humans have attempted to design computer systems able to demonstrably empathize with the human affective experience. Facial electromyography (EMG) is one such technique enabling machines to access to human affective states. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of valence emotions on facial EMG activity captured over the corrugator supercilii (frowning muscle) and zygomaticus major (smiling muscle). The arousal emotion, specifically, has not received much research attention, however. In the present study, we sought to identify intensive valence and arousal affective states via facial EMG activity. Methods Ten blocks of affective pictures were separated into five categories: neutral valence/low arousal (0VLA), positive valence/high arousal (PVHA), negative valence/high arousal (NVHA), positive valence/low arousal (PVLA), and negative valence/low arousal (NVLA), and the ability of each to elicit corresponding valence and arousal affective states was investigated at length. One hundred and thirteen participants were subjected to these stimuli and provided facial EMG. A set of 16 features based on the amplitude, frequency, predictability, and variability of signals was defined and classified using a support vector machine (SVM). Results We observed highly accurate classification rates based on the combined corrugator and zygomaticus EMG, ranging from 75.69% to 100.00% for the baseline and five affective states (0VLA, PVHA, PVLA, NVHA, and NVLA) in all individuals. There were significant differences in classification rate accuracy between senior and young adults, but there was no significant difference between female and male participants. Conclusion Our research provides robust evidences for recognition of intensive valence and arousal affective states in young and senior adults. These findings contribute to the successful future application of facial EMG for identifying user affective states in human machine interaction (HMI) or companion robotic systems (CRS)."
https://openalex.org/W2236720274,"We studied the effect of climate change on the distribution of two insectivorous passerines (the meadow pipit Anthus pratensis and the chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita) in wintering grounds of the Western Mediterranean basin. In this region, precipitation and temperature can affect the distribution of these birds through direct (thermoregulation costs) or indirect effects (primary productivity). Thus, it can be postulated that projected climate changes in the region will affect the extent and suitability of their wintering grounds. We studied pipit and chiffchaff abundance in several hundred localities along a belt crossing Spain and Morocco and assessed the effects of climate and other geographical and habitat predictors on bird distribution. Multivariate analyses reported a positive effect of temperature on the present distribution of the two species, with an additional effect of precipitation on the meadow pipit. These climate variables were used with Maxent to model the occurrence probabilities of species using ring recoveries as presence data. Abundance and occupancy of the two species in the study localities adjusted to the distribution models, with more birds in sectors of high climate suitability. After validation, these models were used to forecast the distribution of climate suitability according to climate projections for 2050–2070 (temperature increase and precipitation reduction). Results show an expansion of climatically suitable sectors into the highlands by the effect of warming on the two species, and a retreat of the meadow pipit from southern sectors related to rain reduction. The predicted patterns show a mean increase in climate suitability for the two species due to the warming of the large highland expanses typical of the western Mediterranean."

We found that DHA treatment of cortical neurons resulted in enhanced axon outgrowth that was due to increased axon elongation rates. DHA-mediated axon outgrowth was accompanied by the translational up-regulation of Tau and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), two important axon-related proteins, and the activation of Akt and p70 S6 kinase. Consistent with these findings, rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), prevented DHA-mediated axon outgrowth and up-regulation of Tau and CRMP2. In addition, DHA-dependent activation of the Akt-mTOR-S6K pathway enhanced 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract-dependent translation of Tau and CRMP2.

Arsenic oxidation occurred in the Zhenxhuquan pool, with distinctly high ratios of arsenate to total dissolved arsenic (0.73-0.86). Coupled with iron and sulfur oxidation along the outflow channel, arsenic accumulated in downstream sediments with concentrations up to 16.44 g/kg and appeared to significantly constrain their microbial community diversity. These oxidations might be correlated with the appearance of some putative functional microbial populations, such as Aquificae and Pseudomonas (arsenic oxidation), Sulfolobus (sulfur and iron oxidation), Metallosphaera and Acidicaldus (iron oxidation). Temperature, total organic carbon and dissolved oxygen significantly shaped the microbial community structure of upstream and downstream samples. In the upstream outflow channel region, most microbial populations were microaerophilic/anaerobic thermophiles and hyperthermophiles, such as Sulfolobus, Nocardia, Fervidicoccus, Delftia, and Ralstonia. In the downstream region, aerobic heterotrophic mesophiles and thermophiles were identified, including Ktedonobacteria, Acidicaldus, Chthonomonas and Sphingobacteria. A total of 72.41-95.91% unassigned-genus sequences were derived from the downstream high arsenic sediments 16S rRNA clone libraries. This study could enable us to achieve an integrated understanding on arsenic biogeochemistry in acid hot springs."
https://openalex.org/W2237488129,"Background Sandblasting particles which remain on the surfaces of dental restorations are removed prior to cementation. It is probable that adhesive strength between luting material and sandblasting particle remnants might exceed that with restorative material. If that being the case, blasting particles adhere to sandblasted material surface could be instrumental to increasing adhesive strength like underlying bonding mechanism between luting material and silanized particles of tribochemical silica coating-treated surface. We hypothesize that ultrasonic cleaning of bonding surfaces, which were pretreated with sandblasting, may affect adhesive strength of a resin luting material to dental restorative materials. Methods We therefore observed adhesive strength of resin luting material to aluminum oxide was greater than those to zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy beforehand. To measure the shear bond strengths of resin luting material to zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy, forty specimens of each restorative material were prepared. Bonding surfaces were polished with silicon abrasive paper and then treated with sandblasting. For each restorative material, 40 sandblasted specimens were equally divided into two groups: ultrasonic cleaning (USC) group and non-ultrasonic cleaning (NUSC) group. After resin luting material was polymerized on bonding surface, shear test was performed to evaluate effect of ultrasonic cleaning of bonding surfaces pretreated with sandblasting on bond strength. Results For both zirconia ceramic and cobalt-chromium alloy, NUSC group showed significantly higher shear bond strength than USC group. Conclusions Ultrasonic cleaning of dental restorations after sandblasting should be avoided to retain improved bonding between these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2238284338,"Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal and the ability of the neurotoxin methylmercury to biomagnify in the food chain is a serious concern for both public and environmental health globally. Because thousands of tons of mercury are released into the environment each year, remediation strategies are urgently needed and prompted this study. To facilitate remediation of both organic and inorganic forms of mercury, Escherichia coli was engineered to harbor a subset of genes (merRTPAB) from the mercury resistance operon. Protein products of the mer operon enable transport of mercury into the cell, cleavage of organic C-Hg bonds, and subsequent reduction of ionic mercury to the less toxic elemental form, Hg(0). E. coli containing merRTPAB was then encapsulated in silica beads resulting in a biological-based filtration material. Performing encapsulation in aerated mineral oil yielded silica beads that were smooth, spherical, and similar in diameter. Following encapsulation, E. coli containing merRTPAB retained the ability to degrade methylmercury and performed similarly to non-encapsulated cells. Due to the versatility of both the engineered mercury resistant strain and silica bead technology, this study provides a strong foundation for use of the resulting biological-based filtration material for methylmercury remediation."
https://openalex.org/W2249181252,"Antibiotics are often administered to terminally ill patients until death, and antibiotic use contributes to the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). We investigated antibiotic use and the isolation of MDROs among patients who died in general medical wards.All adult patients who died in the general internal medicine wards at four acute care hospitals between January and June 2013 were enrolled. For comparison with these deceased patients, the same number of surviving, discharged patients was selected from the same divisions of internal medicine subspecialties during the same period.During the study period, 303 deceased patients were enrolled; among them, 265 (87.5%) had do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders in their medical records. Antibiotic use was more common in patients who died than in those who survived (87.5% vs. 65.7%, P<0.001). Among deceased patients with DNR orders, antibiotic use was continued in 59.6% of patients after obtaining their DNR orders. Deceased patients received more antibiotic therapy courses (two [interquartile range (IQR) 1-3] vs. one [IQR 0-2], P<0.001). Antibiotics were used for longer durations in deceased patients than in surviving patients (13 [IQR 5-23] vs. seven days [IQR 0-18], P<0.001). MDROs were also more common in deceased patients than in surviving patients (25.7% vs. 10.6%, P<0.001).Patients who died in the general medical wards of acute care hospitals were exposed to more antibiotics than patients who survived. In particular, antibiotic prescription was common even after obtaining DNR orders in patients who died. The isolation of MDROs during the hospital stay was more common in these patients who died. Strategies for judicious antibiotic use and appropriate infection control should be applied to these patient populations."

This survey was conducted in 2010–2013 among 762 HIV-1-positive adults from Gabon who were predominantly treated with 3TC-based antiretroviral treatment. HBV patterns were identified using immunoassays detecting total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), IgM HBcAb, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), antibody to HBsAg (HBsAb) and an in-house real-time PCR test for HBV DNA quantification. Occult hepatitis B (OBI) was defined by the presence of isolated anti-HBc with detectable serum HBV DNA. HBV genotypes and HBV mutations were analyzed by PCR-direct sequencing method. Seventy-one (9.3%) patients tested positive for HBsAg, including one with acute hepatitis B (0.1%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.2%), nine with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.6%–2.2%), 16 with HBeAg-negative CHB (2.1%; 95% CI, 1.2%–3.3%) and 45 inactive HBV carriers (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.4%–7.8%). Sixty-one (8.0%; 95% CI, 6.2%–10.1%) patients showed OBI. Treated patients showed similar HBV DNA levels to those obtained in untreated patients, regardless of HBV patterns. Around 15.0% of OBI patients showed high (>1,000 UI/mL) viremia. The mutation M204V/I conferring resistance to 3TC was more common in HBV/A (47.4%) than in HBV/E isolates (0%) (P = .04). Our findings encouraged clinicians to promote HBV vaccination in patients with no exposure to HBV and to switch 3TC to universal TDF in those with CHB."
https://openalex.org/W2239800435,"Rebuilding depleted fish populations is a priority of modern fisheries management. In the U.S., strong statutory mandates extend to both the goals and process by which stocks are to be rebuilt. However, the National Standard Guidelines that govern the implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act may change to increase flexibility in rebuilding requirements. In this study we evaluate performance of the status quo approach to fish stock rebuilding in the United States against 3 alternatives that have been proposed to improve rebuilding outcomes. These alternatives either simplify the analytical requirements of rebuilding analyses or apply ‘best practices’ in fisheries management, thereby avoiding the need for rebuilding analyses altogether. We use a Management Strategy Evaluation framework to evaluate rebuilding options across 6 fish life history types and 5 possible real-world fishery scenarios that include options for stock assessment quality, multiple fleets, and the degree to which the stocks are overfished at the start of the analysis. We show that the status quo rebuilding plan and a harvest control rule that reduces harvest rates at low stock size generally achieve the best rebuilding outcomes across all life-history types and fishery scenarios. Both approaches constrain fishing in the short term, but achieve high catches in the medium and long term as stocks rebuild to productive levels. These results support a growing body of literature that indicates that efforts to end overfishing early pay off in the medium- to long-term with higher cumulative catches than the alternative."

https://openalex.org/W2234876640,"Based on material from the uppermost Tithonian La Caja Formation at Puerto Piñones, northeastern Mexico, the complete ontogenetic development (protoconch to adult) of the ammonite Salinites grossicostatum is outlined by a detailed morphometrical shell analysis. The embryonic stage, consisting of a small ellipsoid protoconch and ammonitella, ends at about 0.6 mm. Four major morphological changes are differentiated throughout ontogeny based on internal features such as reduced septal spacing and siphuncle position. Sexual dimorphism is reflected by shell size, siphuncular diameter, differences in the morphology of the apophysis, and by two distinct general trends in septal spacing. In addition, macroconchs are characterized by septal crowding at different stages, followed by the return to normal septum distances. Our analysis indicates a change in the mode of life after the neanic stage. A change in habitat preference is inferred for adult individuals. While microconchs persisted at Puerto Piñones, large mature macroconchs temporarily migrated to other areas, possibly for egg deposition. Salinites grossicostatum is endemic to the ancient Gulf of Mexico and is there restricted to outer continental shelf environments."
https://openalex.org/W2235944722,"Diagnostic tests for veterinary surveillance programs should be efficient, easy to use and, possibly, economical. In this context, classic Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) remains the most common analytical platform employed for serological analyses. The analysis of pooled samples instead of individual ones is a common procedure that permits to certify, with one single test, entire herds as “disease-free”. However, diagnostic tests for pooled samples need to be particularly sensitive, especially when the levels of disease markers are low, as in the case of anti-BoHV1 antibodies in milk as markers of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) disease. The avidin-nucleic-acid-nanoassembly (ANANAS) is a novel kind of signal amplification platform for immunodiagnostics based on colloidal poly-avidin nanoparticles that, using model analytes, was shown to strongly increase ELISA test performance as compared to monomeric avidin. Here, for the first time, we applied the ANANAS reagent integration in a real diagnostic context. The monoclonal 1G10 anti-bovine IgG1 antibody was biotinylated and integrated with the ANANAS reagents for indirect IBR diagnosis from pooled milk mimicking tank samples from herds with IBR prevalence between 1 to 8%. The sensitivity and specificity of the ANANAS integrated method was compared to that of a classic test based on the same 1G10 antibody directly linked to horseradish peroxidase, and a commercial IDEXX kit recently introduced in the market. ANANAS integration increased by 5-fold the sensitivity of the 1G10 mAb-based conventional ELISA without loosing specificity. When compared to the commercial kit, the 1G10-ANANAS integrated method was capable to detect the presence of anti-BHV1 antibodies from bulk milk of gE antibody positive animals with 2-fold higher sensitivity and similar specificity. The results demonstrate the potentials of this new amplification technology, which permits improving current classic ELISA sensitivity limits without the need for new hardware investments."
https://openalex.org/W2237622344,"Cardiac ion channels and their respective accessory subunits are critical in maintaining proper electrical activity of the heart. Studies have indicated that the K+ channel interacting protein 2 (KChIP2), originally identified as an auxiliary subunit for the channel Kv4, a component of the transient outward K+ channel (Ito), is a Ca2+ binding protein whose regulatory function does not appear restricted to Kv4 modulation. Indeed, the guinea pig myocardium does not express Kv4, yet we show that it still maintains expression of KChIP2, suggesting roles for KChIP2 beyond this canonical auxiliary interaction with Kv4 to modulate Ito. In this study, we capitalize on the guinea pig as a system for investigating how KChIP2 influences the cardiac action potential, independent of effects otherwise attributed to Ito, given the endogenous absence of the current in this species. By performing whole cell patch clamp recordings on isolated adult guinea pig myocytes, we observe that knock down of KChIP2 significantly prolongs the cardiac action potential. This prolongation was not attributed to compromised repolarizing currents, as IKr and IKs were unchanged, but was the result of enhanced L-type Ca2+ current due to an increase in Cav1.2 protein. In addition, cells with reduced KChIP2 also displayed lowered INa from reduced Nav1.5 protein. Historically, rodent models have been used to investigate the role of KChIP2, where dramatic changes to the primary repolarizing current Ito may mask more subtle effects of KChIP2. Evaluation in the guinea pig where Ito is absent, has unveiled additional functions for KChIP2 beyond its canonical regulation of Ito, which defines KChIP2 as a master regulator of cardiac repolarization and depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2236742033,"Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a powerful imaging technique that has led to improvements in the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral lesions and neurosurgical guidance for tumor resection. Traditional tensor modeling, however, has difficulties in differentiating tumor-infiltrated regions and peritumoral edema. Here, we describe the supertoroidal model, which incorporates an increase in surface genus and a continuum of toroidal shapes to improve upon the characterization of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).DTI brain datasets of 18 individuals with GBM and 18 normal subjects were acquired using a 3T scanner. A supertoroidal model of the diffusion tensor and two new diffusion tensor invariants, one to evaluate diffusivity, the toroidal volume (TV), and one to evaluate anisotropy, the toroidal curvature (TC), were applied and evaluated in the characterization of GBM brain tumors. TV and TC were compared with the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) indices inside the tumor, surrounding edema, as well as contralateral to the lesions, in the white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM).The supertoroidal model enhanced the borders between tumors and surrounding structures, refined the boundaries between WM and GM, and revealed the heterogeneity inherent to tumor-infiltrated tissue. Both MD and TV demonstrated high intensities in the tumor, with lower values in the surrounding edema, which in turn were higher than those of unaffected brain parenchyma. Both TC and FA were effective in revealing the structural degradation of WM tracts.Our findings indicate that the supertoroidal model enables effective tensor visualization as well as quantitative scalar maps that improve the understanding of the underlying tissue structure properties. Hence, this approach has the potential to enhance diagnosis, preoperative planning, and intraoperative image guidance during surgical management of brain lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2232762337,"I used sharp intracellular electrodes to record from parasol cells in the semi-isolated crayfish brain to investigate pacemaker currents. Evidence for the presence of the hyperpolarization-activated inward rectifier potassium current was obtained in about half of the parasol cells examined, where strong, prolonged hyperpolarizing currents generated a slowly-rising voltage sag, and a post-hyperpolarization rebound. The amplitudes of both the sag voltage and the depolarizing rebound were dependent upon the strength of the hyperpolarizing current. The voltage sag showed a definite threshold and was non-inactivating. The voltage sag and rebound depolarization evoked by hyperpolarization were blocked by the presence of 5–10 mM Cs2+ ions, 10 mM tetraethyl ammonium chloride, and 10 mM cobalt chloride in the bathing medium, but not by the drug ZD 7288. Cs+ ions in normal saline in some cells caused a slight increase in mean resting potential and a reduction in spontaneous burst frequency. Many of the neurons expressing the hyperpolarization-activated inward potassium current also provided evidence for the presence of the transient potassium current IA, which was inferred from experimental observations of an increased latency of post-hyperpolarization response to a depolarizing step, compared to the response latency to the depolarization alone. The latency increase was reduced in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a specific blocker of IA. The presence of 4-AP in normal saline also induced spontaneous bursting in parasol cells. It is conjectured that, under normal physiological conditions, these two potassium currents help to regulate burst generation in parasol cells, respectively, by helping to maintain the resting membrane potential near a threshold level for burst generation, and by regulating the rate of rise of membrane depolarizing events leading to burst generation. The presence of post-burst hyperpolarization may depend upon IA channels in parasol cells."
https://openalex.org/W2236102963,"Techniques to expand human hematopoietic stem cells ex-vivo could be beneficial to the fields of clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy targeted at hematopoietic stem cells. NUP98-HOXA10HD is a relatively newly discovered fusion gene that in mouse transplant experiments has been shown to increase numbers of hematopoietic stem cells. We evaluated whether this fusion gene could be used to expand engrafting human primitive CD34+ cells in an immunodeficient mouse model. Gene transfer was achieved using a lentiviral based vector. The engraftment of mobilized peripheral blood human CD34+ cells grown in culture for one week after gene transfer was evaluated 3–4 months after transplant and found to be 2–3 fold higher in the NUP98-HOXA10HD groups as compared to controls. These data suggest an expansive effect at least at the short term human repopulating cell level. Further evaluation in long term repopulating models and investment in a NUP98-HOXA10HD protein seems worthy of consideration. Additionally, the results here provide strong impetus to utilize NUP98-HOXA10HD as a tool to search for underlying genes and pathways involved in hematopoietic stem cell expansion that can be enhanced and have an even more potent expansive effect."
https://openalex.org/W2239035090,"For the site-directed conjugation of chemicals and radioisotopes to the chicken-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv), we investigated amino acid residues replaceable with cysteine. By replacing each amino acid of the 157 chicken variable region framework residues (FR, 82 residues on VH and 75 on VL) with cysteine, 157 artificial cysteine mutants were generated and characterized. At least 27 residues on VL and 37 on VH could be replaced with cysteine while retaining the binding activity of the original scFv. We prepared three VL (L5, L6 and L7) and two VH (H13 and H16) mutants as scFv-Ckappa fusion proteins and showed that PEG-conjugation to the sulfhydryl group of the artificial cysteine was achievable in all five mutants. Because the charge around the cysteine residue affects the in vivo stability of thiol-maleimide conjugation, we prepared 16 charge-variant artificial cysteine mutants by replacing the flanking residues of H13 with charged amino acids and determined that the binding activity was not affected in any of the mutants except one. We prepared four charge-variant H13 artificial cysteine mutants (RCK, DCE, ECD and ECE) as scFv-Ckappa fusion proteins and confirmed that the reactivity of the sulfhydryl group on cysteine is active and their binding activity is retained after the conjugation process."
https://openalex.org/W2234636050,"We explore the possibility of tracing routes of dense waters toward and within the ocean abyss by the use of an extended set of observed physical and biochemical parameters. To this purpose, we employ mercury, isotopic oxygen, biopolymeric carbon and its constituents, together with indicators of microbial activity and bacterial diversity found in bottom waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. In this basin, which has been considered as a miniature global ocean, two competing sources of bottom water (one in the Adriatic and one in the Aegean seas) contribute to the ventilation of the local abyss. However, due to a recent substantial reduction of the differences in the physical characteristics of these two water masses it has become increasingly complex a water classification using the traditional approach with temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen alone. Here, we show that an extended set of observed physical and biochemical parameters allows recognizing the existence of two different abyssal routes from the Adriatic source and one abyssal route from the Aegean source despite temperature and salinity of such two competing sources of abyssal water being virtually indistinguishable. Moreover, as the near-bottom development of exogenous bacterial communities transported by convectively-generated water masses in the abyss can provide a persistent trace of episodic events, intermittent flows like those generating abyssal waters in the Eastern Mediterranean basin may become detectable beyond the availability of concomitant measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2235524883,"Aim of the study High-salt consumption has been widely described as a risk factor for cardiovascular, renal and bone functions. In the present study, the extent to which high-salt diet could influence Ti6Al4V implant surface characteristic, its adhesion to rat tibial crest, and could modify muscle cell viability of two surrounding muscles, was investigated in vivo. These parameters have also been assessed following a NMES (neuro-myoelectrostimulation) program similar to that currently used in human care following arthroplasty. Results After a three-week diet, a harmful effect on titanium implant surface and muscle cell viability was noted. This is probably due to salt corrosive effect on metal and then release of toxic substance around biologic tissue. Moreover, if the use of NMES with high-salt diet induced muscles damages, the latter were higher when implant was added. Unexpectedly, higher implant-to-bone adhesion was found for implanted animals receiving salt supplementation. Conclusion Our in vivo study highlights the potential dangerous effect of high-salt diet in arthroplasty based on titanium prosthesis. This effect appears to be more important when high-salt diet is combined with NMES."
