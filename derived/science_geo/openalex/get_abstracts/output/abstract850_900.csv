https://openalex.org/W1582646265,"The observed equilibrium constants (Kobs) of the creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2), myokinase (EC 2.7.4.3), glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) reactions have been determined at 38 degrees C, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.25, and varying free magnesium concentrations. The equilibrium constant (KCK) for the creatine kinase reaction defined as: KCK = [sigma ATP] [sigma creatine] divided by ([sigma ADP] [sigma creatine-P] [H+]) was measured at 0.25 ionic strength and 38 degrees C and was shown to vary with free [Mg2+]. The value was found to be 3.78 x 10(8) M-1 at free [Mg2+] = 0 and 1.66 x 10(9) M-1 at free [Mg2+] = 10(-3) M. Therefore, at pH 7.0, the value of Kobs, defined as Kobs = KCK[H+] = [sigma ATP] [sigma creatine] divided by ([sigma ADP] [sigma creatine-P] was 37.8 at free [Mg2+] = 0 and 166 at free [Mg2+] = 10(-3) M. The Kobs value for the myokinase reaction, 2 sigma ADP equilibrium sigma AMP + sigma ATP, was found to vary with free [Mg2+], being 0.391 at free [Mg2+] = 0 and 1.05 at free [Mg2+] = 10(-3) M. Taking the standard state of water to have activity equal to 1, the Kobs of glucose-6-P hydrolysis, sigma glucose-6-P + H2O equilibrium sigma glucose + sigma Pi, was found not to vary with free [Mg2+], being 110 M at both free [Mg2+] = 0 and free [Mg2+] = 10(-3) M. The Kobs of fructose-1,6-P2 hydrolysis, sigma fructose-1,6-P2 equilibrium sigma fructose-6-P + sigma Pi, was found to vary with free [Mg2+], being 272 M at free [Mg2+] = 0 and 174 M at free [Mg2+] = 0.89 x 10(-3) M."
https://openalex.org/W1548078249,"NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation occurs in two distinct sequential radical steps. The first step, initiation, is the ADP-perferryl ion-catalyzed formation of low levels of lipid hydroperoxides. The second step, propagation, is the iron-catalyzed breakdown of lipid hydroperoxides formed during initiation generating reactive intermediates and products characteristic of lipid peroxidation. Propagation results in the rapid formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive material and lipid hydroperoxides. Propagation can be catalyzed by ethylenediamine tetraacetate-chelated ferrous ion, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-chelated ferrous ion, or by ferric cytochrome P-450. However, cytochrome P-450 is destroyed during propagation."
https://openalex.org/W202004645,"13N-labeled ammonia was used to study the cerebral uptake and metabolism of ammonia in conscious rats. After infusion of physiological concentrations of [13N]ammonia for 10 min via one internal carotid artery, the relative specific activities of glutamate, glutamine (alpha-amino), and glutamine (amide) in brain were approximately 1:5:400, respectively. The data are consistent with the concept that ammonia, entering the brain from the blood, is metabolized in a small pool of glutamate that is both rapidly turning over and distinct from a larger tissue glutamate pool (Berl, S., Takagaki, G., Clarke, D.D., and Waelsch, H. (1962) J. Biol. Chem. 237, 2562-2569). Analysis of 13N-metabolites, after infusion of [13N]ammonia into one lateral cerebral ventricle, indicated that ammonia entering the brain from the cerebrospinal fluid is also metabolized in a small glutamate pool. Pretreatment of rats with methionine sulfoximine led to a decrease in the label present in brain glutamine (amide) following carotid artery infusion of [13N]ammonia. On the other hand, 13N activity in brain glutamate was greater than that in the alpha-amino group of glutamine, i.e. following methionine sulfoximine treatment the expected precursor-product relationship was observed, indicating that the two pools of glutamate in the brain were no longer metabolically distinct. The amount of label recovered in the right cerebral hemisphere, 5 s after a rapid bolus injection of [13N]ammonia via the right common carotid artery, was found to be independent of ammonia concentration within the bolus over a 1000-fold range. This finding indicates that ammonia enters the brain from the blood largely by diffusion. In normal rats that were killed by a freeze-blowing technique 5 s after injection of an [13N]ammonia bolus, approximately 60% of the label recovered in brain had already been incorporated into glutamine, indicating that the t1/2 for conversion of ammonia to glutamine in the small pool is in the range of 1 to 3 s or less. The data emphasize the importance of the small pool glutamine synthetase as a metabolic trap for the detoxification of blood-borne and endogenously produced brain ammonia. The possibility that the astrocytes represent the anatomical site of the small pool is considered."

Conversely, destruction of noradrenergic neurons by administration of 6-hydroxydopamine to neonatal rats caused a 64% increase in the density of beta1-adrenergic receptors in adult cerebral cortex with no change in the density of beta2-adrenergic receptors. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptors in rat cortex involved in neuronal function are primarily of the beta1 subtype."
https://openalex.org/W1528937233,"A FAD-containing monooxygenase isolated from pig liver microsomes migrates as a single band upon electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. The minimum molecular weight based on mass of amino acids per mole of flavin is 64,000. However, the catalytically active enzyme exists as aggregating units of the monomer. Neither oxygen nor organic substrates perturbed the spectrum of the oxidized flavoprotein and their binding to this form of the enzyme could not be detected. Anaerobically NADPH bleaches the flavoprotein, and in the presence of both NADPH and oxygen a remarkably stable intermediate form of the enzyme, with an absorption band at 375 nm, is observed. The spectrum of the intermediate resembles that of a peroxyflavin. The monooxygenase catalyzes NADPH- and oxygen-dependent oxygenations of nucleophilic nitrogen- or sulfur-containing compounds. Kinetic studies carried out with a model organic nitrogen substrate (trimethylamine) and a sulfur substrate (methimazole) gave similar patterns. The kinetic data are consistent with an ordered Ter-Bi mechanism with an irreversible step between the second and third substrate where NADPH is added first, followed by oxygen, and the oxidizable organic substrate is added last. If NADPH is the first substrate added, then NADP+ must be the last product released since NADP+ is competitive with NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1572997259,"Simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and transmembrane transport of Ca2+, H+, and phosphate show that the efflux of Ca2+ from respiring tightly coupled rat liver mitochondria takes place by an electroneutral Ca2+/2H+ antiport process that is ruthenium red-insensitive and that is regulated by the oxidation-reduction state of the mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides. When mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides are kept in a reduced steady state, the efflux of Ca2+ is inhibited; when they are in an oxidized state, Ca2+ efflux is activated. These processes were demonstrated by allowing phosphate-depleted mitochondria respiring on succinate in the presence of rotenone to take up Ca2+ from the medium. Upon subsequent addition of ruthenium red to block Ca2+ transport via the electrophoretic influx pathway, and acetoacetate, to bring mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides into the oxidized state, Ca2+ efflux and H+ influx ensued. The observed H+ influx/Ca2+ efflux ratio was close to the value 2.0 predicted for the operation of an electrically neutral Ca2+/2H+ antiport process."
https://openalex.org/W2162153886,"SUMMARY Extracts from rat liver contain a sulfhydryl-dependent endoprotease which degrades [methyZ-‘4C]globin or ‘%hemoglobin to acid-soluble peptides. This enzyme was isolated from the 100,000 x g supernatant of the homogenate. It showed a pH optimum between 7.5 and 9.5 and very little activity below pH 7.0. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 550,000 as determined on Sepharose 6B column chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. ATP, at physiological concentrations, as well as pyrophosphate, stimulated the protease activity in these partially purified preparations up to 3-fold. Nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 increased proteolytic activity and the stimulation by ATP. Other nucleotide triphosphates and ADP also increased proteolysis but less effectively than ATP. Sodium phosphate, creatine phosphate, and EDTA had no stimulatory effect."

This response can be matched by other drugs that stimulate the beta receptors, but the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine is without effect; beta-adrenergic blockade abolishes the response while alpha-adrenergic blockade produces no change. The data support the contention that cerebral capillary function is subject to adrenergic neural control."

Fluorescein spread from an injected islet cell directly into neighboring islet cells, and, in the presence of 16.7 millimolar glucose, significantly more islet cells communicated with the injected cell than in glucose-free medium. Islet cells were also microinjected with glycolytic substrates and activators that produced transient changes in cellular levels of reduced pyridine nucleotides-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H]. Changes in NAD(P)H fluorescence were observed in islet cells incubated first for 18 hours in very low glucose concentrations and then in a glucose-free medium and injected with glycolytic substrates and activators; however, little change of fluorescence occurred in adjacent islet cells. In contrast, after adding 16.7 millimolar glucose to the medium, injection of glycolytic substrates and activators produced transient changes in NAD(P)H fluorescence in the injected cell and in neighboring cells."

The consequence is that a discrete inhibitory synaptic potential is evoked in an identified postsynaptic motoneuron. These local interactions between interneurons and motoneurons are of behavioral significance in that they ensure the correct operation of a resistance reflex.

https://openalex.org/W1484197352,"The transport of Na(+) via an H(+)/Na(+) antiporter and of aspartate and serine via Na(+)/amino acid symport systems was studied in Halobacterium halobium cell envelope vesicles. Gradients for H(+) were produced by illuminating the bacteriorhodopsin-containing vesicles at different light intensities, and the rate and extent of Na(+) transport were followed as functions of the electrochemical potential difference for protons. The coupling of Na(+) and H(+) gradients suggested a translocation stoichiometry of 2H(+)/Na(+) for the antiporter. The rate of Na(+) transport increases steeply above a critical transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient, and since the electrical and the chemical potentials of H(+) at this threshold point vary with the experimental conditions, while the sum of these potentials is constant, it was concluded that the gating of the Na(+) transport is caused by the total electrochemical gradient."

https://openalex.org/W2004545016,"In the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia, a burst of action potentials in peptide-secreting neuroendocrine cells, the bag cells, produces slow inhibition of two identified bursting pacemaker neurons. The inhibition is due to slow hyperpolarizing potential that reduces bursting pacemaker activity for 3 hours or more. The slow inhibitory potential results from a large and prolonged increase in membrane conductance to potassium ions as well as a slower ionic process that is relatively independent of membrane conductance."
https://openalex.org/W1536296409,"In the reaction between equimolar amounts of horseradish peroxidase and chlorite, the native enzyme is oxidized directly to Compound II (Hewson, W.D., and Hager, L.P. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3175-3181). At acidic pH but not at alkaline values, this initial reaction is followed by oxidation of Compound II to Compound I. The highly pH-dependent chemistry of Compound II can be readily demonstrated by the reduction of Compound I, with ferrocyanide at acidic, neutral, and alkaline pH values. Titration at low pH yields very little Compound II, whereas at high pH, the yield is quantitative. Similarly, the reaction of horseradish peroxidase and chlorite at low pH yields Compound I while only Compound II is formed at high pH. At intermediate pH values both the ferrocyanide reduction and the chlorite reaction produce intermediate yields of Compound II. This behavior is explained in terms of acidic and basic forms of Compound II. The acidic form is reactive and unstable relative to the basic form. Compound II can be readily oxidized to Compound I by either chloride or chlorine dioxide in acidic solution. The oxidation does not occur in alkaline solution, nor will hydrogen peroxide cause the oxidation of Compound II, even at low pH."

https://openalex.org/W104252031,"Long chain fatty alcohols are known to be rapidly oxidized to the corresponding fatty acids in normal mammalian tissues in vivo. However, the enzyme system responsible for the reaction has not been well documented. We have demonstrated the conversion of (1-/sup 14/C)hexadecanol to (1-/sup 14/C)hexadecanoic acid using a cell-free system from rat liver. The subcellular distribution of this enzyme system parallels that of microsomal marker enzymes. The enzyme showed an absolute requirement for NAD/sup +/ and had a pH optimum of 8.4. Neither NADP/sup +/, NADH, nor NADPH can substitute for NAD/sup +/ as a cofactor. The reaction does not require oxygen. Albumin increases the rate of the reaction. The enzymic activity is not affected by including pyrazole, sodium azide, or AMP, ATP, and quinacrine in the incubation mixture. The apparent K/sub m/ for hexadecanol is 0.67 ..mu..M and the V/sub max/ is 5.98 nmol/min/mg of protein. The reaction product was identified as the fatty acid by both thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography. Fatty aldehyde was also isolated and identified from the reaction mixture. Addition of semicarbazide to the incubation system increased the amount of fatty aldehyde produced with concomitant decrease in the formation of fatty acid.

https://openalex.org/W65932742,"Calmodulin that was selectively nitrated at tyrosyl residue 99 or 138 was used as a regional spectral probe of the structural changes associated with Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding to the protein. Perturbations of the spectral properties of the nitrotyrosyl residues correlated well with those of the tyrosyl residues in unmodified calmodulin. The spectral properties of tyrosyl residue 99 were sensitive to ionic strength, but not to Ca2+ binding to the protein. The spectrum of tyrosyl residue 138, in contrast, was markedly affected both by ionic strength and Ca2+ binding. Although Mg2+ caused spectral changes, they were clearly different from those produced by Ca2+ and resembled instead the less specific changes elicited by Na+. Conformational changes associated with Ca2+ but not Mg2+ binding to calmodulin seem to affect selectively the microenvironment around tyrosyl residue 138."

https://openalex.org/W1549159570,"A purification procedure, based on that previously used for rat kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, was used for the purification of glutathione oxidase (which converts glutathione to gluthathione disulfide). The two activities co-purified, the ratio of the activities remaining constant through all steps of the isolation procedure. The purified enzyme was separable into 12 isozymic species by isoelectric focusing. All 12 isozymes exhibited a constant ratio of transpeptidase to glutathione oxidase activities, strongly supporting the conclusion that conversion of glutathione to glutathione disulfide is a catalytic function of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Modulation of oxidase activity by inhibitors and acceptor substrates of transpeptidase is discussed in relation to the possible glutathione binding sites involved in gamma-glutamyl transfer and oxidase activities of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1588115816,"Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate was purified from the livers of chloroquine-treated rats and labeled with tritium by a nonreductive catalytic exchange procedure. The mechanism of its degradation by rat liver lysosomes has been examined. A substantial amount of bis(monoacylglycero)P is degraded to monoglyceride and lysophosphatidic acid by a lysosomal phosphodiesterase having an acid pH optimum. Some bis(monoacylglycero)P is degraded to lysophosphatidylglycerol by lysosomal phospholipase A. In contrast, other phosphoglycerides have been reported to be degraded by sequential deacylation in lysosomes. The initial rate of breakdown of bis(monoacylglycero)P is only 10% of the rate observed for dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. [3H]Lysophosphatidylglycerol conversion to [3H]bis(monoacylglycero)P is stimulated by unlabeled bis(monoacylglycero)P, resulting in a futile cycle which allows the resynthesis of bis(monoacylglycero)P from its breakdown product, lysophosphatidylglycerol. This futile cycle and the unusual sn-1-glycerophospho-sn-1'-glycerol stereoconfiguration of the water-soluble backbone (Joutti, A., Brotherus, J., Renkonen, O., Laine, R., and Fischer, W. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 450, 206-209) may be important factors in the marked resistance of bis(monoacylglycero)P to degradation by lysosomal acid hydrolases."
https://openalex.org/W1525654343,"gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase, which is composed of two unequal subunits, exhibits proteinase activity when treated with agents such as urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The heavy subunit is preferentially and rapidly degraded. The enzyme also degraded bovine serum albumin in the presence of urea; however, several other proteins and model proteinase substrates were not cleaved. Treatment of the enzyme with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, a gamma-glutamyl analog, results in parallel loss of transpeptidase and proteinase activities indicating that the site at which gamma-glutamylation of the enzyme occurs (presumably a hydroxyl group on the light subunit) is also involved in proteinase activity. The purified light subunit, but not the heavy subunit, exhibits proteinase activity even in the absence of urea. Results suggest that dissociation of the enzyme unmasks the proteinase activity of the light subunit involving the site at which gamma-glutamylation of the enzyme occurs, and that the heavy subunit may impose transpeptidase reaction specificity by contributing the binding domains for gamma-glutamyl substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1523256808,"Limited proteolysis of glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli has been studied under nondenaturing conditions (pH 7.6, 20 degrees C). Trypsin cleaves the polypeptide chain of glutamine synthetase into two principal fragments, Mr = about 32,000 and 18,000. The covalently bound AMP group is attached to the larger fragment and its presence does not affect cleavage. Although the cleaved polypeptide chain does not dissociate under nondenaturing conditions, catalytic activity is lost. Chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus protease produce similar cleavages in glutamine synthetase. The substrate L-glutamate retards tryptic as well as chymotryptic digestion. Tryptic digestion is also retarded by some of the feedback inhibitors of glutamine synthetase including CTP, L-alanine, L-serine, L-histidine, and glucosamine 6-phosphate. An implication of these findings is that there is a region of the glutamine synthetase polypeptide chain that is particularly susceptible to proteolysis. Either the glutamate and inhibitor sites are formed partly by this suceptible peptide or the binding of glutamate and some inhibitors induces conformational changes within the E. coli glutamine synthetase molecule in the region of the susceptible peptide."

These can be removed by treatment with EDTA causing the virus to swell by 7% in radius at alkaline pH values. The swollen virions are susceptible to protease and nuclease digestion. They are likely to be an intermediate during assembly and disassembly. Crystals of the metal-free virus have been grown and were found to be approximately isomorphous with the orthorhombic type III southern bean mosaic virus crystals (Akimoto, T., Wagner, M.A., Johnson, J.E., and Rossmann, M.G.

Native rhombohedral type II crystals disintegrate on changing the pH or increasing the ionic strength of the mother liquor. Damage can be prevented by addition of ethylene glycol. At alkaline pH values, these crystals also show a 2% increase in their cell dimensions as well as a significant alteration in their diffraction patterns. In the type II and III crystals, the viruses pack with only their 5-fold axes in contact. Thus, the difference of the apparent swelling in solution and in the crystals may be one of differential swelling over the virus surface."

https://openalex.org/W1506282672,"Initial rate measurements of the stoichiometric relationships between H+ ejection, K+ and Ca2+ uptake, and electron transport were carried out on mitochondria from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells grown in mice. With succinate as substrate and N-ethylmaleimide to prevent interfering H+ reuptake via the phosphate carrier, close to 8 H+ were ejected per oxygen atom reduced (H+/O ejection ratio = 8.0); with the NAD-linked substrates pyruvate or pyruvate + malate, the H+/O ejection ratio was close to 12. The average H+/site ratio (H+ ejected/2e-/energy-conserving site) was thus close to 4. The simultaneous uptake of charge-compensating cations, either K+ (in the presence of valinomycin) or Ca2+, was also measured, yielding average K+/site uptake ratios of very close to 4 and Ca2+/site ratios close to 2. It was also demonstrated that each calcium ion enters the respiring tumor mitochondria carrying two positive electric charges. These stoichiometric data observed in mitochondria from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells thus are in complete agreement with similar data on normal rat liver and rat heart mitochondria and suggest that the H+/site ratio of mitochondrial electron transport may be 4 generally. It was also observed that the rate of deltaH+ back-decay in anaerobic tumor mitochondria following oxygen pulses is some 6- to 8-fold greater than in rat liver mitochondria tested at equal amounts of mitochondrial protein."
https://openalex.org/W1515319192,"Pig kidney aldehyde reductase is inactivated by 2,3-butanedione, phenylglyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 1,2-cyclohexanedione. 2,3-Butanedione caused the most rapid loss in enzyme activity, the rate of loss being proportional to the concentration of 2,3-butanedione. Neither D-glyceraldehyde nor pyridine 3-aldehyde, both substrates for this broadly specific enzyme, protected the enzyme from inactivation but 1 mM NADPH or NADP completely prevented the loss of activity by 2,3-butanedione suggesting the involvement of arginine in the binding of cofactor. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (reduced form) offered no protection to inactivation whereas ADP-ribose phosphate gave complete protection indicating that it is the latter portion of NADPH which interacts with the essential arginine. Both NMN and ADP-ribose phosphate are competitive inhibitors of aldehyde reductase with respect to NADPH. Butanedione-modified aldehyde reductase could still bind to a blue dextran-Sepharose 4B column suggesting that the modified arginine did not bind NADPH. This was confirmed by fluorescence spectra which showed that chemically modified aldehyde reductase caused the same blue shift of NADPH fluorescence as did native aldehyde reductase. Of additional interest was the quenching of NADPH fluorescence by aldehyde reductase which, with one exception, is in contrast to the fluorescence behavior of all other oxidoreductases."

The addition of 6-azauridine resulted in the accumulation of orotidine, OA, DHO, and carbamyl aspartate (CAA). The use of the observed ratios of [CCA]/[OA] and [DHO]/[OA] and other known constants allowed us to calculate that the increased cellular OA concentration caused primarily an inhibition of DHO dehydrogenase rather than an inhibition of dihydroorotase. A constant ratio of [CAA]/[DHO] was observed which probably indicates that the interconversion of these two intermediates catalyzed by dihydroorotase is near equilibrium in these cells as has been observed in vitro (Christopherson, R.I., Matsuura, T., and Jones, M.E.

https://openalex.org/W1549260979,"Highly purified preparations of cholesterol oxidase from Schizophyllum commune contain a covalently bound flavin component. A flavin peptide has been obtained by digestion with trypsin-chymotrypsin and purification on a column of phosphocellulose. Digestion with nucleotide pyrophosphatase results in increased fluorescence at pH 3.4 and release of 5'-adenylate, showing that the flavin is in the dinucleotide form. The absorption spectrum of the flavin peptide shows the hypsochromic shift of the second absorption band characteristic of 8 alpha-substituted flavins. The fluorescence at pH 7 is extensively quenched even in the mononucleotide form, with a pKa at pH 5.8 in the flavin peptide and at 5.05 following acid hydrolysis to the aminoacyl flavin level. This suggests that histidine is the amino acid substituted at the 8 alpha position of the flavin and that N(1) of the imidazole ring is the site of attachment. These data, the reduction of the flavin by borohydride, and comparison of the mobilities in high voltage electrophoresis at two pH values with N(1)- and N(3)-histidyl riboflavin and their 2',5'-anhydro forms shows that the prosthetic group of cholesterol oxidase is 8 alpha-[N(1)-histidyl]-FAD."

https://openalex.org/W1508917021,"Guanylate cyclase activity (GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2.), measured in purified rat liver plasma membranes, was markedly increased by treatment with various purified proteases. The effect was maximal with trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, papain, and thermolysin (6- to 8-fold increase with 5 to 20 microgram of protease/ml) and lower with subtilisin and elastase (3- to 4-fold increase). The activation was due to an increase in the maximal velocity of the cyclizing reaction. No modification was observed either in the apparent affinity for the substrate MnGTP or in the cooperative behavior of the enzyme kinetics which displayed Hill coefficients of 1.6 for both basal and activated states. The Triton X-100-dispersed guanylate cyclase remained sensitive to papain, which suggests that the action of proteases was not restricted to an indirect action upon the membranous environment of the guanylate cyclase. In contrast, the cytosolic soluble guanylate cyclase, assayed in the presence or absence of sodium azide, was absolutely insensitive to papain. Thus, proteolysis represents a previously undescribed mechanism for activating membranous guanylate cyclase systems, which might be of importance in the physiological regulation of this enzyme."

Chem. 254, 3236-3243), it was demonstrated that the fluorescence enhancement is mainly caused by the hydrolysis of ATP in the initial Pi burst rather than by the conformational change induced by the irreversible binding of ATP. In the present study, the cause of the H+ release and the protein absorbance change were investigated. The results show that like the rate of the fluorescence enhancement the rates of the H+ release and the protein absorbance change level off at high ATP concentration at a much lower rate than the rate of irreversible ATP binding. Furthermore, under all conditions tested, the rates of the H+ release and the protein absorbance change are equal to the rate of the initial Pi burst. Therefore, like the fluorescence enhancement, most of the H+ release and the protein absorbance change are associated with the initial Pi burst rather than the binding of ATP."

The rate of formation of the enzyme-thiol complex is enhanced by diiodotyrosine. Binding of diiodotyrosine to lactoperoxidase does not cause a shift of the Soret band which indicates binding to the protein of the enzyme. At neutral pH and low ionic strength, lactoperoxidase is adsorbed on insolubilized diiodotyrosine (diiodotyrosine-agarose). It can be eluted at slightly increased ionic strength which shows that the binding is weak. In the presence of 5 X 10(-4) M glutathione, however, the binding of the enzyme to diiodotyrosine-agarose becomes much stronger so that a high salt concentration is required for elution. Lactoperoxidase is also adsorbed on insolubilized thiols (thiol-agarose). The presence of diiodotyrosine is not required for strong binding. A simple method for the preparation of lactoperoxidase from milk by affinity chromatography is based on the interactions of the enzyme with the two ligands, thiols and diiodotyrosine."

The uv spectra suggest that the tyrosines do not become deprotonated unless the phage becomes disrupted. One possible explanation of the Raman spectra is that the tyrosine OH groups are the recipients of hydrogen-bonded protons arising from fairly acidic donors, yet these acidic donors do not become titrated over the pH 7 to 12 range."
https://openalex.org/W1558082124,"From earlier studies it is known that bovine serum albumin has one high affinity binding site and several lower affinity sites for the sulfa drug N1-(5-ethyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)sulfanilamide (sulfaethidole) (Kostenbauder, H.B., Jawad, M.J., Perrin, J.H., and Averhart, V. (1971) J. Pharm. Sci. 60, 1658-1660). This binding has been further studied using equilibrium dialysis, microcalorimetry, and pH titration technique. Results of these studies show that the binding of sulfaethidole to the first (high affinity) site may be accompanied by an uptake of protons. Proton uptake is found to be zero at pH 7.4 and approximately 0.6 at pH 8.5 for each sulfaethidole molecule bound. The other binding sites for sulfaethidole are not proton linked. The first, and probably the other binding sites, are also Cl- ion linked; for example, the binding of sulfaethidole to the first binding site is accompanied by the displacement of (on average) one Cl- ion at pH 7.4 in 0.1 M NaCl. This explains the observation that the heat of binding of sulfaethidole to the high affinity site is -33.0 kJ.mol-1 in the absence of chloride ions, but only -22.8 kJ.mol-1 in the presence of 0.1 M Cl- (at pH 7.4)."

https://openalex.org/W61437824,"The pulse radiolysis of solutions of adult human methemogolbin was used in order to reduce a single heme iron within the protein tetramers. The valence hybrids thus formed were reacted with oxygen. Kinetics of the reactions were studied. The effects of pH and inositol hexaphosphate were examined. The kinetics of the ligation of oxygen to stripped valence hybrids showed a single phase behavior at the pH range 6.5 to 9. As the pH was lowered below 6.5, a second, slower phase became apparent. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, above pH 8, the kinetics of oxygen binding was of a single phase. As the pH was lowered, a transition to a second, slower phase was noticed. Below pH 7, the slower phase was the only detectable one. The analysis of the relative contribution of the faster phase to the total reaction as a function of the pH showed a typical transition curve characterized by a pK = 7.5 and a Hill parameter n = 2.9. On this basis, it is concluded that human adult stripped methemoglobin resides in an R quarternary structure, while the presence of IHP stabilizes the T structure at pH below 7.5. This transition between the quaternary structures of methemoglobin cannot be accounted for by the switch between the high spin and the low spin states of the ferric iron. This switch of spin state takes place at pH greater than 8.2."
https://openalex.org/W1534150982,"An apparently homogeneous preparation of the phenylalanine-sensitive 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase isoenzyme from Escherichia coli was used as the antigen for antibody production in New Zealand white rabbits. The antibodies were monospecific as judged by immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis. Antigen . antibody complexes maintained full enzyme activity and were inhibited by phenylalanine, indicating that neither the active site nor the feedback-inhibitor binding site is mechanistically connected to amino acid sequences which are antigenic determinants. While phenylalanine-sensitive 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase could be quantitatively removed from solution by immunoprecipitation with soluble or immobilized antibodies, neither the tyrosine-sensitive nor the tryptophan-sensitive 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, the other two isoenzymes catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, formed any detectable complexes with the antibodies. This indicated less structural similarity than would be expected for isoenzymes. Also, the antibodies did not cross-react with 5-dehydroquinate synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the second step of the common aromatic biosynthetic pathway."
