Clinical potencies of butyrophenones, phenothiazines, and related drugs correlate closely with their ability to inhibit tritiated haloperidol binding. These binding methods provide a simple in vitro means for evaluating new drugs as potential antischizophrenic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1547052620,"1. A detailed study of cytochrome c oxidase activity with Keilin-Hartree particles and purified beef heart enzyme, at low ionic strength and low cytochrome c concentrations, showed biphasic kinetics with apparent Km1 = 5 x 10(-8) M, and apparent Km2 = 0.35 to 1.0 x 10(-6) M. Direct binding studies with purified oxidase, phospholipid-containing as well as phospholiptaining aid-depleted, demonstrated two sites of interaction of cytochrome c with the enzyme, with KD1 less than or equal to 10(-7) M, and KD2 = 10(-6) M. 2. The maximal velocities as low ionic strength increased with pH and were highest above ph 7.5. 3. The presence and properties of the low apparent Km phase of the kinetics were strongly dependent on the nature and concentration of the anions in the medium. The multivalent anions, phosphate, ADP, and ATP, greatly decreased the proportion of this phase and similarly decreased the amount of high affinity cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex formed. The order of effectiveness was ATP greater than ADP greater than P1 and since phosphate binds to cytochrome c more strongly than the nucleotides, it is concluded that the inhibition resulted from anion interaction with the oxidase. 4mat low concentrations bakers' yeast iso-1, bakers' yeast iso-1, horse, and Euglena cytochromes c at high concentrations all attained the same maximal velocity. The different proportions of low apparent Km phase in the kinetic patterns of these cytochromes c correlated with the amounts of high affinity complex formed with purified cytochrome c oxidase. 5. The apparent Km for cytochrome c activity in the succinate-cytochrome c reductase system of Keilin-Hartree particles was identical with that obtained with the oxidase (5 x 10(-8) M), suggesting the same site serves both reactions. 6. It is concluded that the observed kinetics result from two catalytically active sites on the cytochrome c oxidase protein of different affinities for cytochrome c. The high affinity binding of cytochrome c to the mitochondrial membrane is provided by the oxidase and at this site cytochrome c can be reduced by cytochrome c1. Physiological concentrations of ATP decrease the affinity of this binding to the point that interaction of cytochrome c with numerous mitochondrial pholpholipid sites can competitively remove cytochrome c from the oxidase. It is suggested that this effect of ATP represents a possible mechanism for the control of electron flow to the oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1489763399,"31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra recorded from intact muophosphate, and the sugar phosphates. Quantitation of these metabolites by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance was in good agreement with values obtained by chemical analyses. The spectra obtained from various muscles showed considerable variation in their phosphorus profile. Thus, differences could be detected between (a) normal and diseased muscle; (b) vertebrates and invertebrates; (c) different species of the same animal. The time course of change in phosphate metabolites in frog muscle showed that ATP level remains unchanged until phosphocreatine is nearly depleted. Comparative studies revealed that under anaerobic conditions the Northern frog maintains its ATP content for 7 hours, while other types of amphibian, bird, and mammalian muscles begin to show an appreciable decay in ATP after 2 hours. Several lines of evidence indicated that ATP forms a complex with magnesium in the muscle water: (a) the phosphate resonances of ATP in the muscle were shifted downfield as compared to those in the alkaline earth metal-free perchloric acid extract of the muscle; (b) the coupling constants of ATP measured in various live muscles closely corresponded to those for MgATP in a solution resembling the composition of the muscle water; (c) in the muscle the gamma-phosphate group of ATP exhibited no shift change over a period of 10 hours under conditions where resonances of other phosphate compounds could be titrated. This behavior is similar to that of MgATP in model solutions in the physiological pH range, and it is different from that of CaATP. The chemical shifts of the phosphate metabolites were determined in several relevant solutions as a function of pH. Under all conditions only inorganic orthophosphate showed an invariant titration curve. From the chemical shift of inorganic phosphate observed during aging of intact muscle the intracellular pH of frog muscle was estimated to be 7.2."

https://openalex.org/W1579947842,"These experiments indicate that absorbance changes observed at the 425 nm isosbestic point of the Hb and HbCO following laser photolysis of HbCO provide a direct measure of the rates of quaternary conformational changes between rapidly reacting Hb (the immediate product of full photolysis) and slowly reacting normal deoxyhemoglobin. Hb, first observed by Gibson (Gibson, Q.H. (1959) Biochem. J. 71, 293-303), Has been interpreted as deoxyhemoglobin remaining in the liganded quaternary conformation following rapid removal of ligand by a light pulse. In borate buffers between pH 8.4 and 9.6 particularly simple pH-independent results were obtained which allowed the use of a Monod. Wyman, and Changeux model (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118) to fit the data. In this case Hb is taken to be R state deoxyhemoglobin. Partial photolysis experiments at 425 nm show that the rate of the R - T conformational change at 20 degrees decreases by about a factor of 2 for each additional bound ligand. The rate of the ligand-free conformational change is found to be 920 +/- 60s(-1), 6400 +/- 600s(-1), and 15,700 +/- 700(-1) respectively at 3 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees. The previously uninterpreted effects of flash length and partial photolysis on the CO recombination kinetics can be explained in terms of the present model. Kinetic results obtained below pH 8 are found to be inconsistent with a two-state model. It appears that binding of inositol hexaphosphate produces a new rapidly reacting quaternary conformation of HbCO."

https://openalex.org/W1565067179,"Oxy-ferrous substrate-bound cytochrome P-450cam (mrsO2) autooxidizes in the absence of its specific effector protein, putidaredoxin, without hydroxylating the substrate, camphor. The autooxidation is first order with an activation energy of 17 kcal mol-1 at 25 degrees, pH 7.0. Substrate removal and low pH accelerate the reaction. The product, 5-exo-OH camphor, and a nonhydroxylated pseudosubstrate, norcamphor, stabilize the complex in a manner similar to camphor. Increased oxidation rate of mrsO2 and substrate hydroxylation are induced by putidaredoxin, rebredoxin, cytochrome b5, and the apoproteins of the latter two. Dihydrolipoic acid and other dithiols also replace putidaredoxin as effector molecules, but 1000-fold higher concentrations are required. Effector molecules do not increase the autooxidation rate of mrsO2 unless camphor, norcamphor, or another pseudosubstrate is present. Kinetic evidence is presented showing that an active complex between mrsO2 and effector is a required intermediate in mixed function oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1556012018,"Specific beta-adrenergic receptors present in membrane preparations of frog erythrocytes were identified by binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, a potent competitive beta-adrenergic antagonist. The (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites could be solubilized by treatment of a purified erythrocyte membrane fraction with the plant glycoside digitonin but not by treatment with a wide variety of other detergents. The binding sites appeared to be soluble by several independent experimental criteria including (a) failure to sediment of 105,000 X g for 2 hours; (b) passage through 0.22-mu Millipore filters; (c) chromatography on Sepharose 6B gels; and (d) electron microscopy. The soluble receptor sites retained all of the essential characteristics of the membrane-bound sites, namely rapid and reversible binding of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists; strict stereospecificity toward both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists; appropriate structure-activity relationships; saturability of the sites at low concentrations of ligand; no affinity for alpha-adrenergic drugs, nonphysiologically active catechol compounds, and catecholamine metabolites. Based on gel chromatography in the presence of detergent, the molecular weight of the soluble receptor is estimated to be no greater than 130,000 to 150,000. Equilibrium binding studies indicated a KD for the soluble receptor of 2 nM. Hill coefficients (nH) of 0.77 and curved Scatchard plots suggested the presence of negatively cooperative interactions among the solubilized receptors in agreement with previous findings with the membrane-bound sites. Kinetic studies indicated an association rate constant K1 = 3.8 X 10(6) M-1 min-1 and a reverse rate constant k2 = 2.3 X 10(-3) min-1 at 4 degrees. The kinetically derived KD (k2/k1) of 0.6 nM is in reasonable agreement with that determined by equilibrium studies. The soluble receptors were labile at temperature greater than 4 degrees but could be stabilized with high concentrations of EDTA. Guanidine hydrochloride and urea produced concentration-dependent losses of binding activity which were partially reversible upon dialysis. Trypsin and phospholipase A both degraded the soluble receptors but a variety of other proteases and phospholipases as well as DNase and RNase were without effect. Experiments with group-specific reagents indicated that free lysine, tryptophan, serine, and sulfhydryl groups may be important for receptor binding. These studies suggest that the receptor is probably a protein which requires lipids for functional integrity. Data obtained with the solubilized binding sites are consistent with the contention that these sites represent the physiologically relevant beta-adrenergic receptors which have been extracted from the membranes with full retention of their properties."

Many of these pools reflect the low pH of precipitation in the northeastern United States. Egg mortality is low (less than 1 percent) in pools near neutrality, but high (greater than 60 percent) in pools more acid than pH 6. Developmental anomalies and the embryonic stage at which death occurs are the same in field situations as at corresponding pH's in laboratory experiments."
https://openalex.org/W60857663,"1. Further evidence that the uptake of [14C]hexylamine, determined by centrifugal filtration of spinach chloroplast thylakoids through silicone fluid layers, gives precise estimations of light-induced H+ concentration gradients (deltapH) is presented. DeltapH was independent of the amount of thylakoids used or of the concentration of hexylamine. Moreover, hexylamine uptake was sensitive to the osmolarity of the suspending medium. 2. Internal H+ concentration ([H+]in) is proportional to the rate of electron flow when light intensity was used to vary these parameters. Proportionality was still observed in the presence of 0.1 and 1.0 muM gramicidin D. When, however, [H+]in and electron flow were varied by increasing the concentration of gramicidin D, at constant light intensity the rate of electron flow was approximately proportional to 1/[H]in. 3. The phosphorylation efficiency (P/e2 ratio) falls with decreasing light intensity or increasing concentrations of the phosphorylation inhibitor, 4'-deoxyphlorizin. The proportionality between the rate of electron flow and [H+]in allows the calculation of the rate of nonphosphorylating (basal) electron flow if [H+]in under phosphorylating conditions is known. The contribution of basal electron flow, a consequence of passive efflux of H+ from the thylakoids, to the overall rate of electron flow increases as the rate of phosphorylation decreases. P/e2 ratios calculated using rates of electron flow from which the basal component has been subtracted are constant. A calculated P/e2 ratio of about 1.3 is obtained. 4. It is shown that the reciprocal of the phosphorylation efficiency should be proportional to 1/[H+]in2 when these parameters are varied using light intensity. This relationship was verified and provided an estimate of the P/e2 at infinite [H+]in. This value was 1.3. These results provide further evidence that a H+ electrochemical gradient serves to couple photophosphorylation to electron flow and that the rate of phosphorylation is proportional to [H+]in3. That is, three H+ are translocated out of thylakoids for each adenosine triphosphate formed."
https://openalex.org/W1521370281,"The rapid and sensitive assay of 1beta,2beta-3H-androgen aromatization by measurement of 3H2O release (Thompson, E.A., Jr., and Siiteri, P.K. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5364-5372) has been analyzed to determine its applicability to initial rate studies. It was found that aromatization is the sole reaction catalyzed by lyophilized placental microsomes that causes a loss of tritium from position 1 or 2 of androstenedione and testosterone. Tritium is, however, removed from position 2 of the estrogen products, presumably in 2-hydroxylation, but this does not invalidate use of the assay for initial rate measurements; it was therefore used to characterize the catalytic properties of aromatase. Aromatization by the freeze-dried preparation was stimulated by K+, EDTA, and dithiothreitol, and was maximally active at pH 7.5 TO 8.0. With incubation conditions optimized for these factors, the apparent Km for NADPH is approximately 1 muM. The maximum velocity of androstenedione aromatization exceeds that of testosterone, and the affinity of the substrate binding site is higher for the former substrate, the apparent Km values being 0.1 muM and 0.4 muM, respectively. Mutual competition experiments with the androgen substrates showed that each gives simple competitive inhibition of the other's aromatization; furthermore, the apparent Ki values for each are in close agreement with their respective Km values. Androst-1,4,6-triene-3,17-dione competitively inhibits the aromatization of both androstenedione and testosterone, the apparent Ki, in both cases being 0.2 muM. It is concluded that the two androgen substrates are aromatized at a single, identical site."
https://openalex.org/W1533175851,"The formation of methemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin in a solution containing photoreduced riboflavin and oxygen was inhibited by superoxide dismutase. The rate of the reaction was pH-dependent in the range of 6.8 to 7.8, increasing as the pH was reduced. Inhibition by superoxide dismutase was enhanced as the EDTA concentration increased and was dependent on enzymatic activity. Under conditions in which superoxide dismutase inhibition was incomplete, catalase inhibited the reaction but mannitol had no effect. The data support the mediation of methemoglobin formation by superoxide. The hypothesis is offered that superoxide anion reduced the heme-bound oxygen in oxygemoglobin by one electron, permitting the subsequent dissociation of ferrihemoglobin and peroxide. The ability of superoxide dismutase to inhibit the formation of methemoglobin may represent one of its functions in the mature erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1491039829,"Homogeneous rabbit liver phosphorylase phosphatase (Brandt, H., Capulong, Z. L., and Lee, E. Y. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8038-8044) also dephosphorylates glycogen synthase b. During purification, phosphorylase phosphatase and glycogen synthase phosphatase co-purified with a constant ratio of activities. The two activities co-migrated on disc gel electrophoresis. Both substrates competed with each other for the phosphatase, and both phosphatase activities were inhibited by lysine ethyl ester. It is concluded that liver phosphorylase phosphatase and glycogen synthase phosphatase have a common identity and that coordinate regulation of the phosphatase-catalyzed activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of phosphorylase occurs in vivo. This provides a parallel and opposing mechanism to that mediated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, which coordinately inactivates glycogen synthase and, via phosphorylase kinase, activates phosphorylase. Maximal glycogen synthase phosphatase activity was observed near neutrality. Mg2+ and glucose-6-P activated the glycogen synthase phosphatase reaction and this activation was pH-dependent. The Km for glycogen synthase b was 0.12 muM."
https://openalex.org/W1480633910,"We have investigated the energy-dependent uptake of Ca2+ by rat liver mitochondria with succinate as respiratory substrate with rotenone added to block NAD-linked electron transport. In the presence of 3-hydroxybutyric or other permeant monocarboxylic acids Ca2+ was taken up to extents approaching those seen in the presence of phosphate. The quantitative relationship between cation and anion uptake was determined from the slope of a plot of 3-hydroxybutyrate uptake against Ca2+ uptake, a method which allowed determination of the stoichiometry without requiring ambiguous corrections for early nonenergized or nonstoichiometric binding events. This procedure showed that 2 molecules of 3-hydroxtbutyrate were accumulated with each Ca2+ ion. Under these conditions close to 2 Ca2+ ions and 4 molecules of 3-hydroxybutyrate were accumulated per pair of electrons per energy-conserving site of the respiratory chain. Since 3-hydroxybutyrate must be protonated to pass the membrane as the undissociated free acid, it is concluded that 4 protons were ejected (and subsequently reabsorbed) per pair of electrons per energy-conserving site, in contrast to the value 2.0 postulated by the chemiosmotic hypothesis."

One equivalent of P1i, bound to Zn(II) alkaline phosphatase, pH 8, gives rise to a single 31P resonance 2 ppm downfield from that for Pi, and assignable to the noncovalent complex, E-P. Inorganic phosphate in excess of 1 eq per enzyme dimer gives rise to a resonance at the position expected for free Pi. At pH 5.1, a second resonance appears 8.5 ppm downfield from that for free Pi, and is assignable to the covalent complex, E-P. The large downfield shift suggests that the enzyme phosphoryl group is highly strained with an O-P-O bond angle of under 100 degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1542820449,"gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase, present in various mammalian tissues, transfers the gamma-glutamyl moiety of glutathione to a variety of acceptor amino acids and peptides. This enzyme has been purified from human kidney cortex about 740-fold to a specific activity of 200 units/mg of protein. The purification steps involved incubation of the homogenate at 37 degrees followed by centrifugation and extraction of the sediment with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% sodium deoxycholate; batchwise absorption on DEAE-cellulose; DEAE-cellulose (DE52) column chromatography; Sephadex G-200 gel filtration; and affinity chromatography using concanavalin A insolubilized on beaded Agarose. Detergents were used throughout the purification of the enzyme. The purified enzyme separated into three protein bands, all of which had enzyme activity, on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis in the presence of Triton X-100. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of about 90,000 as shown by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, and appears to be a tetramer with subunits of molecular weights of about 21,000. The Km for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase using the artificial substrate, gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, with glycylglycine as the acceptor amino acid was found to be about 0.8 mM. The optimum pH for the enzyme activity is 8.2 and the isoelectric point is 4.5. Both GSH and GSSG competitively inhibited the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase when gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide was used as the substrate. Treatment of the purified enzyme with papain has no effect on the enzyme activity or mobility on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. The purified gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase had no phosphate-independent glutaminase activity. The ratio of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to phosphate-independent glutaminase changed significantly through the initial steps of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase purification. These studies indicate that the transpeptidase and phosphate-independent glutaminase activities are not exhibited by the same protein in human kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2146116826,"Direct evidence showing that a soluble form of elastin is the precursor of cross-linked elastin was obtained from pulse-chase experiments using chick embryo aortas and by demonstrating the conversion of soluble elastin into cross-linked elastin in a cell-free system. Acetic acid extracts of embryonic chick aorta pulse-labeled with [14C]lysine contain two radioactive proteins of molecular weights 74,000 and 138,000 which have been identified previously as soluble elastin and the pro-alpha chain of collagen, respectively. In pulse-chase experiments, the radioactivity incorporated in the soluble elastin during the pulse with [14C]lysine disappeared during a 24-hour chase with [12C]lysine and 89% of that which disappeared was accounted for in the desmosines of alkali-insoluble elastin. The disappearance of the radioactivity from the soluble fraction and its appearance in the desmosines of elastin were inhibited by beta-aminopropionitrile, a specific inhibitor of the cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase. In addition in vitro experiments, it was shown that the radioactivity in the desmosines of elastin can arise from that present in an acid-soluble precursor protein. This precursor protein is soluble elastin, as demonstrated by the formation of desmosines when a homogeneous preparation of soluble elastin was incubated with purified lysyl oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1498344390,"1. Adenine nucleotide exchange-transport was reconstituted in vesicles prepared from phospholipids and protein fractions derived from bovine heart submitochondrial particles. The transport, which was specific for ATP and ADP was measured either as ADP/ADP, ATP/ATP, or ADP/ATP exchange. The highest specific activity (370 nanomoles of ADP/ADP exchange/min/mg of protein at room temperature) was obtained with a protein fraction prepared by cholate extraction of partly resolved submitochondrial particles followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation. 2. At 200 muM external nucleotide, the exchange reactions were inhibited by low concentrations of bongkrekate, atractyloside, and palmitoyl-CoA, with Ki values of 1.8, 3.0, and 7.5 muM, respectively. The ADP/ADP nucleotide exchange was stimulated about 5-fold by 500 muM MgCl2 or MnCl2(km of 40 muM) and about 3-fold by 500 muM CaCl2(Km of 90 muM). It was optimal between pH 6.0 and 7.0 and decreased rapidly above pH 7.5. Arrhenius plots between 0 degrees and 40 degrees showed a break point at 15 degrees with soybean phospholipids and an activation energy of 29.5 kcal/mole from 0 degrees-15 degrees and 9.0 kcal/mole from 15 degrees-40 degrees. With mitochondrial phospholipids the break point was at 9 degrees and activation energies were 42.4 kcal/mole from 0 degrees-9 degrees and 7.6 kcal/mole from 9 degrees-40 degrees. 3. The phospholipid requirements for adenine nucleotide exchange were similar to those of oxidative phosphorylation. Optimal rates were observed with a phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine ratio of 4:1. Cardiolipin had a slight stimulatory effect. 4. The uptake of ADP into vesicles containing ATP was stimulated by KCl or by KPi as well as by hexafluoracetonylacetone, and uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. The uptake of ATP into vesicles containing ADP was inhibited by KCl or by KPi, but was also stimulated by hexafluoracetonylacetone. In both cases valinomycin reversed the effects of KCl, while mersalyl or N-ethylmaleimide prevented the effects of KPi. In contrast, none of these salts nor hexafluoracetonylactone affected the ADP/ADP or ATP/ATP exchange. These findings suggest that in the reconstituted system the ADP/ATP exchange is electrogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1525768055,"To investigate the role of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in cultured cells we have measured guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activities and cyclic GMP levels in normal and transformed fibroblastic cells. Guanylate cyclase activity is found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction of normal rat kidney (NRK) and BALB 3T3 cells. Enzyme activity is stimulated 3- to 10-fold by treatment with the detergent Lubrol PX. However, enhancement of guanylate cyclase by fibroblast growth factor could not be demonstrated under a variety of assay conditions. In both NRK and BALB 3T3 cells guanylate cyclase activity is low during logarithmic growth and increases as the cells crowd together and growth slows. Guanylate cyclase activity is undetectable in homogenates of NRK cells transformed by the Kirsten sarcoma virus (KNRK cells) either in the presence or absence of Lubrol PX. Guanylate cyclase activity is also greatly decreased in NRK cells transformed by Moloney, Schmidt-Ruppin, or Harvey viruses. BALB 3T3 cells transformed by RNA viruses (Kirsten, Harvey, or Moloney), by a DNA virus (SV40), by methylcholanthrene, or spontaneously, all have diminished but readily detectable guanylate cyclase activity. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is found predominately in the soluble fraction of NRK cells. This activity increases slightly as NRK cells enter the stationary growth phase. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is undetectable in two clones of KNRK cells under a variety of assay conditions, and is decreased relative to the level present in NRK cells in a third KNRK clone. However, both Moloney- and Schmidt-Ruppin-transformed NRK cells have a phosphodiesterase activity similar to that found in NRK cells. Boiled supernatant from both NRK and KNRK cells is observed to appreciably enhance the activity of activator-deficient phosphodiesterase from bovine heart. This result indicates that the absence of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity in KNRK cells is not due to a loss of the phosphodiesterase activator. The intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP is found to be very low in transformed NRK cells when compared to levels measured in confluent NRK cells. The low levels of cyclic GMP in transformed NRK cells reflect the greatly decreased guanylate cyclase activity observed in these cells. These results do not appear to support the suggestion that cyclic GMP promotes the growth of fibroblastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521905131,"Abstract The steady state kinetics of pig liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is consistent with an ordered, sequential mechanism in which NADP is bound first and NADPH released last. Kia is 9.0 muM, Ka is 4.8 muM, and Kb is 36 muM. Glucosamine 6-phosphate, a substrate analogue and competitive inhibitor, is used to help rule out a possible random mechanism. ADP is seen to form a complex with the free form of the enzyme whereas ATP forms a complex with both the free and E-NADP forms of the enzyme. The KI for the E-ADP complex is 1.9 mM, while the Ki values for the E-ATP and E-NADP-ATP complexes are 7.2 and 4.5 mM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1523357342,"Calcium transport into inverted vesicles of Escherichia coli was observed to occur without an exogenous energy source when an artificial proton gradient was used. The orientation of the proton gradient was acid inside and alkaline outside. Either phosphate or oxalate was necessary for transport, as was found for respiratory-driven or ATP-driven uptake (Tsuchiya, T., and Rosen, B.P. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7687-7692). Phosphate accumulation was found to occur in conjunction with calcium accumulation. Calcium transport driven by an artificial proton gradient was stimulated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the Mg2+ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3). Valinomycin, which catalyzes electrogenic potassium movement, stimulated calcium accumulation, while nigericin, which catalyzes electroneutral exchange of potassium and protons, inhibited both artificial proton gradient-driven transport and respiratory-driven transport. Other properties of the proton gradient-driven system and the previously reported energy-linked calcium transport system are similar, indicating that calcium is transported by the same carrier whether energy is supplied through an artificial proton gradient or an energized membrane state. These results suggest the existence of a calcium/proton antiport."

The enzyme acts upon chondroitin sulfate C producing tetrasaccharide plus an unsaturated 6-sulfated disaccharide (delta Di-6S), and upon hyaluronic acid producing unsaturated nonsulfated disaccharide (delta Di-OS). Chondroitin sulfate A is also degraded producing oligosaccharides and delta Di-6S but not delta Di-4S. The chondroitinase C is also distinguished from the chondroitinases B and AC by several properties, such as effect of ions, temperature for optimal activity, and susceptibility to increasing salt concentrations. The substrate specificity of the chondroitinase C is different from that of any other chondroitinase or hyaluronidase described so far."
https://openalex.org/W1919934406,"Albumin from human, bovine, or rabbit serum supported the growth of concanavalin A-stimulated human thymus-derived lymphocytes equally well. This activity was completely abolished by pepsin digestion. It was shown for bovine serum albumin that the albumin molecule itself, and neither an impurity nor a factor bound to albumin was essential for the growth of lymphocytes. This conclusion was based on observations that the growth-promoting activity could not be removed from albumin, and that the specific activity of albumin remained unaltered after the following procedures: molecular sieving at pH 7.5 at pH 3.0, and in 8 M urea at pH 6.6; ion exchange chromatography at pH 4.3 and in 8 M urea at pH 7.2; isoelectric focusing; charcoal treatment; acetone precipitation; and reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 8 M urea. Dimeric albumin was found to support growth of lymphocytes as well as monomeric albumin, and mercaptalbumin and non-mercaptalbumin were shown to have equal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1557564644,"A label for the bilirubin binding sites of human serum albumin was synthesized by reacting 2 mol of Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3'-sulfonate) with 1 mol of bilirubin. This yielded a water-soluble derivative in which both carboxyl groups of bilirubin were converted to reactive enol esters. Covalent labeling was achieved by reacting the label with human serum albumin under nitrogen at pH 9.4 and 20 degrees. Under the same conditions, no covalent binding to the monomers of several proteins could be demonstrated. The number of binding sites for bilirubin and the label were found to be the same, and competition experiments with bilirubin showed inhibition of covalent labeling. The absorption, fluorescence and CD spectra of the label in a complex with human serum albumin were similar to those of the bilirubin human serum albumin complex. However, following covalent attachment to the spectral properties were changed, indicating loss of conformational freedom of the chromophore. Labeling ratios were selected to result in the incorporation of less than 1 mol of label/mol of human serum albumin. Under these conditions, labeling is thought to occur primarily at the high affinity binding site."

Electrophoretic analysis of the diaphorase activity in sperm of different individuals reveals three phenotypic patterns. This polymorphism can be explained in terms of two alleles segregating at an autosomal locus; the allele frequencies have been determined to be 0.71 and 0.29. This appears to be the first reported example of a sperm-specific genetic polymorphism in man; its existence raises a number of genetic and biochemical questions.

https://openalex.org/W1607161437,"A DNA kinase has been partially purified from rat liver nuclei by a procedure which also yields DNA ligase. The kinase uses ATP to phosphorylate specifically the 5'-hydroxyl termini of oligodeoxynucleotides and of single- or double-stranded DNA, yielding 5'-phosphate termini and ADP. The kinase is inactive on RNA, or on oligodeoxynucleotides of chain length less than approximately 10 to 12 residues. The kinase requires a divalent cation (Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, or Ca2+) for activity and has an acidic pH optimum. It is inhibited by a variety of nucleotides as well as by very low levels of inorganic and organic sulfate compounds and sulfate analogues. The molecular weight of the kinase is estimated to be 8 times 10(4) from gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W1497380454,"The effects of pH and ionic strength on the midpoint reduction potential (Emp) of Clostridium acidi-urici ferredoxin were determined using hydrogen gas and hydrogenase. The Emp of native ferredoxin at 24-25 degrees in 0.1 M Tris-chloride buffer, pH 7.0, is--0.434 V. In the pH range examined, the Emp becomes approximately 13 mv more negative per each pH unit increase. A plot of the log of ionic strength versus the apparent Emp of ferredoxin in 0.1 M Tris-chloride buffer, pH 7.5, Was linear over the range of 1.0 to 0.01 ionic strength with Emp values of--0.414 and--0.475 V, respectively, at these extremes. This effect is the same with sodium chloride, sodium bromide, or ammonium sulfate. Potassium phosphate buffer caused a similar change, but the absolute values of Emp differed from those obtained in the presence of the other salts. This effect of pH and ionic strength on Emp may be general for clostridial-type (Fe4S4)2-ferredoxins, since the apparent Emp of Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin is affected in a similar manner by these two variables. The Emp of this ferredoxin in 0.1 M Tris-chloride buffer pH 7.0, is--0.405 V. Since the NH2-terminal amino acid residue, Ala1, and Tyr2 of C. acidi urici ferredoxin are near an (Fe4S4)2-cluster in the protein, the apparent Emp of derivatives that contained amino acid replacements in these two positions were determined. Under similar conditions, the Emp of most of the 13 derivatives examined, including those of [Leu2]- and[3-NH2-Tyr30]ferredoxin, is approximately the same as that of native ferredoxin. However, the Emp of [His2]ferredoxin is approximately 15 mv more positive, whereas that of [Trp2]ferredoxin is 22 mv more negative than that of native C. acidi-urici ferredoxin. Variations in sodium chloride concentration and pH also affected the apparent Emp of the derivatives. It is suggested that the changes observed in the Emp of C. acidi-urici ferredoxin are caused by protein conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1583096249,"In a continuing study of the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory mechanisms governing indole-3-acetic acid (auxin) formation, we report the isolation and initial characterization of three distinct indole-3-acetaldehyde reductases from cucumber seedlings. These enzymes catalyze the reduction of indole-3-acetaldehyde to indole-3-ethanol with the concomitant oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+. Two of the reductases are specific for NADPH as second substrate, while the third is specific for NADH. The enzymes show a strong specificity for indoleacetaldehyde, with apparent Km values of 73mum, 130mum, and 400mum being calculated for the two NADPH-specific reductases and the NADH-specific reductase, respectively. Under no conditions of substrate concentration, incubation time, or assay method could the reverse reaction be observed. Chromatography on a calibrated Sephadex gel column led to estimated molecualr weights of 52,000 and 17,000 for the NADPH-specific reductases, while a value of 33,000 was obtained for the NADH-specific reductase. Both NADPH-specific reductases showed a pH optimum of 5.2 with a secondary optimum at 7.0, and both enzymes were activated by increasing ionic strength. The NADH-specific reductase showed a pH optimum of 7.0 with a secondary optimum at 6.1 and was slightly inhibited by increasing ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1565296698,"A protein capable of binding atropine and (3H)propylbenzilylcholine mustard was solubilized and purified (200-fold) from rat brain. Pronase and trypsin, but not phospholipases, diminished the binding capacity of the solubilized receptor. The molecular weight of the salt-solubilized receptor as determined by gel filtration in the absence of detergents is 30,000. The purified protein showed specificity of binding toward muscarinic ligands. the high and low affinity dissociation constants of the receptor.atropine complex are 0.3 nM and 0.15 muM. Binding of atropine is pH-dependent with an optimum at 7.1. Ca2+ influences the binding of atropine and maximal binding occurs at 0.5 mM Ca2+. The subcellular distribution of the receptor was also examined."
https://openalex.org/W1573025578,"Active transport of pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine occurs in resting cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 and can lead to intracellular concentrations of free vitamin much higher than those supplied externally. The initial Km for pyridoxine uptake is 3.6 x 10(-7) M at 30 degrees and pH 4.5, which are optimum for growth. Transport is inhibited by many unphosphorylated vitamin analogs, the most effective being 5'-deoxypyridoxine, 5'-deoxypridoxal, toxopyrimidine, 4'-deoxypyridoxine, and 3-amino-3-deoxypyridoxine. Two distinct uptake systems that differ in structural specificity and ionic requirements are present. One, with optimum pH of 3.5, transports pyridoxal effectively, but not pyridoxamine; the other (optimum pH 6.0) transports pyridoxamine effectively, but not pyridoxal. Both systems transport pyridoxine, while neither transports pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Other properties of these systems are similar, indicating that they share certain elements in common. An initial temperature optimum of 30 degrees is observed for pyrodoxine transport and, at this temperature, an in intracellular vitamin levels, with subsequent decrease to a constant level, occurs with time. It appears that intracellular vitamin, or a derivative, activates the exit mechanism for the vitamin. Exit rates also depend on the resuspension buffer and are increased in the presence of glucose and decreased by azide. Above 30 degrees net uptake of pyridoxine drops initially, then rapidly increases to a second optimum at 50 degrees; the uptake system is inactivated at about 55 degrees. The optimum at 50 degrees apparently results from activation of inflow as exit is rapid and is accelerated by azide. No overshoot was detected at 50 degrees, so it appears that the exit system is not regulated by intracellular vitamin at this temperature. A phase transition in membrane lipids occurs at 30 degrees and may be responsible for the change in properties of the inflow and exit mechanisms above this temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1485535335,"The kinetics of the reaction of Golfingia gouldii hemerythrin with O2 have been studied by stopped flow spectrophotometry. For the second order oxygenation process, k1 = 7.4 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, deltaH1++ = 8.2 kcal-mol-1 and deltaS1++ = +1 e.u. at 25 degrees, pH 8.2, and I = 0.015 M. The rate constant is unchanged when protein concentration is varied from 3 to 25 muM, the ionic strength is increased to 0.07 M, and the pH moved to 6.8. The deoxygenation of oxyhemerythrin is studied with stopped flow by scavenging liberated O2 with S2O4(2-). For the first order dissociation, k-1 = 51 s-1, deltaH-1++ = 20.6 kcal-mol-1 and deltaS-1++ = +19 e.u. at 25 degrees, pH 8.2, and I = 0.015 M. The value of k-1 is independent of [protein] = 50 to 200 muM, [S2O4(2-)] = 5 to 100 mM I = 0.015 to 0.30 M and pH 6.8 to 9.0. Using myoglobin instead of S2O4(2-) as scavenger gives similar results. Combination of activation parameters for the oxygenation and deoxygenation processes gives K1 = 1.5 X 10(5) M-1, deltaH = -12.4 kcal-mol-1, and deltaS = -18 e.u., values in good agreement with independent thermodynamic data. Perchlorate ion (0.05 M) enhances k-1 about 3-fold and hardly effects k1. There is no sign of other than a single reaction in either direction, and octameric hemerythrin apparently behaves kinetically as eight single units."
https://openalex.org/W1522705662,"Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from a subline of L929 mouse fibroblasts grown on defined medium in the absence of serum. These vesicles were not significantly contaminated by mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum. The isolation procedure, a modification of that originally developed by McKeel and Jarett (McKeel, D.W., and Jarett, L. (1970) J. Cell Biol. 44, 417-432) employs mechanical homogenization in isotonic medium followed by differential centrifugation. The resultant plasma membrane vesicles take up radioactivity when exposed to uniformly labeled nucleosides. Two subfractions of the plasma membrane were isolated, distinguished by their differing activity of 5'-nucleotidase and (Na+,K+)-stimulated ATPase, two well known plasma membrane enzyme markers. Uptake of nucleoside radioactivity was extensively studied in one subfraction; it was linear with time and membrane concentration over ranges used for the studies. Apparent Km values for uptake of radioactivity from adenosine, inosine, and uridine were 7.1 +/- 26 muM, respectively. Uptake of radioactivity from all three nucleosides exhibits a broad pH optimum from pH 7 to pH 9, but falls off rapidly at lower pH. N-Ethylmaleimide was an effective inhibitor of uptake of radioactivity from all three nucleosides; uptake of radioactivity from uridine is more sensitive than uptake of radioactivity from the purine nucleosides. Adenosine inhibited uptake of radioactivity from inosine more than from uridine. Inosine inhibited the uptake of radioactivity from adenosine, but uridine did not. Caffeine and 6-methylaminopurine riboside (6-N-methyladenosine differentially inhibit uptake of radioactivity from adenosine and inosine, and thus the vesicles apparently possess seperate transport systems for uptake of radioactivity from purine nucleosides and from uridine."

After 1 min of uptake intracellular radioactivity is found as phosphorylated vitamin B6. The process is sensitive to temperature and is maximally active at pH 8.1, but under the conditions tested it is insensitive to monovalent cations or metabolic inhibitors, and does not require an exogenous energy source. The Km values for uptake of pyridoxine and pyridoxal are 2.0 x 10(-7) M and 1.2 x 10(-7) M, respectively; [3H]pyridoxamine is not transported. Evidence is presented for an uptake mechanism involving facilitated diffusion followed by trapping by pyridoxal kinase. S. typhimurium also appears to lack a periplasmic binding protein for vitamin B6."
https://openalex.org/W1551298255,"The noncovalent phosphate (E-P) and covalent phosphory (E-P) complexes of Zn(II), Cd(II), and apoalkaline phosphatases of Escherichia coli have been studied by stopped flow kinetic methods and 32P-labeling techniques. With 2,4-dinitrophenylphosphate as substrate, preincubation of the Zn(II) enzyme with Pi at pH 8 slows the pre-steady state burst rate, but does not affect the burst magnitude of 1 mol of ROH per enzyme dimer. Preincubation of the enzyme with Pi at pH 5.5 reduces the burst magnitude by one-half, as well as reducing the burst rate. Reduction of the burst magnitude as a function of the pH of the preincubation with Pi follows the same function as that previously established for the formation of E-P. Hence, ROP phosphorylates the enzyme by displacing phosphate from E-P during a pre-steady state reaction, while E-P turns over at the steady state velocity."

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is highly specific for NADP+ and glucose 6-phosphate. Apparent Km values of 3.6 muM and 5.4 muM were obtained for glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+. This enzyme is located almost entirely within the soluble portion of the cellular cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1567825649,"We have examined the ability of nonionic detergents to solubilize thyroid peroxidase from a porcine thyroid particulate fraction, as measured by the release of peroxidase activity into the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 105,000 X g for 1 hour and the retardation of the supernatant peroxidase of Sepharose 6B. The parameters of peroxidase solubilization by Triton X-100 have been investigated in detail. Under optimum conditions, 60 to 95% of the thryoid peroxidase and about 50% of the total protein is released into the 105,000 X g, 1-hour supernatant. Under the optimum conditions established with Triton X-100, a series of Brij detergents of different chemical structure were equally effective in releasing peroxidase and protein. The protein patterns of the supernatants obtained with these detergents were similar on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, suggesting that the detergents studied release similar membrane proteins. The Triton X-100 and Brij 58 supernatants were chromatographed separately on Sepharose 6B equilibrated with 0.1% Triton X-100 or Brij 58, respectively. In both cases, 75 to 80% of the peroxidase activity was retarded, thereby indicating that the nonionic detergents effect solubilization of the peroxidase rather than dispersal of nonsedimentable membrane fragments. These studies report the first successful solubilization of thyroid peroxidase by nonionic detergents. Together with previous evidence from our laboratory, these experiments indicate that thyroid peroxidase is an integral membrane protein."

https://openalex.org/W1579912399,"The chemical modification of two new double-headed-protease inhibitors from black-eyed peas, a trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) and a trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI) with dansyl chloride was investigated under various conditions. The NH2-terminal serine of both BEPCI and BEPTI, the 4 lysyl residues of BEPCI, and 4 of the 5 lysyl residues of BEPTI, could not be dansylated in the absence of urea. The single tyrosine per subunit of BEPCI and BEPTI was unreactive even in the presence of urea but could be labeled with half-site reactivity by the Celite method. Lysine, NH2-terminal serine, and tyrosine were reactive in fully reduced, carbamidomethylated BEPCI and BEPTI. Gel filtration was used to study the subunit interactions of BEPCI and BEPTI. At pH 8 or pH 3.0 there is a complex set of multiple equilibria with widely differing rates of attainment. We have found evidence for a rapid dimer-tetramer equilibrium, a distinct moderate rate dimer-tetramer equilibrium, a very slow monomer-dimer equilibrium, and postulate slow isomerization of the two forms of dimer and the two forms of tetramer. The monomer-dimer equilibrium is quite unusual in that the dimer is stabilized by chaotropic ions and even slightly by guanidine HC1. In contrast to the complex pattern seen in native BEPCI, the half-site, dansylated BEPCI exists at similar concentration exclusively as a tetramer at neutral pH."
https://openalex.org/W1532263638,"Oxygen and carbon monoxide kinetics of Glycera dibranchiata monomeric hemoglobin have been studied using laser photolysis, air flash, and stopped flow techniques. The reactions of this hemoglobin with both ligands were found to be more rapid than the corresponding reactions involving myoglobin and were also biphasic in nature, the rate constants being approximately an order of magnitude different for the fast and slow phases in each case. No pH or hemoglobin concentration dependence of the pseudo-first order rate constants was apparent between pH 6 and 9 and in the concentration range of 1.25 to 40 muM heme. Both fast and slow pseudo-first order oxygen combination rate constants varied linearly with oxygen concentration between 16 and 1300 muM. A first order slow relaxation was also noted which was linearly dependent on heme concentration and inversely dependent on oxygen concentration. This reaction has been shown to be due to a replacement of oxygen by carbon monoxide. The presence of this reaction is a result of the high affinity of Glycera monomer for carbon monoxide as shown by the partition coefficient Mr = approximately 20,000 ana an equilibrium dissociation constant of the order L = 1.1 X 10(-9) M."
https://openalex.org/W1640744618,"Carbon 13 NMR spectra have been obtained for aqueous solutions of DL-2-(alpha-hydroxyethyl)thiamin, DL-2-(alpha-hydroxybenzyl)thiamin, DL-2-(alpha-hydroxybenzyl)oxythiamin, and related N-3 methyl and N-3 benzyl analogs. The unusually large downfield shift of the 13C resonance of C-2 of hydroxyethylthiamin suggests that this carbon bears a partial positive charge. This result stands in contrast to results of x-ray crystallographic studies of hydroxyethylthiamin, which place a partial negative charge on C-2 (Pletcher, J., and Sax, M. (1974) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 96, 155-165). A partial positive charge on C-2 helps to explain the facility of carbanion formation at the alpha carbon both enzymatically and in model systems. The rates of proton-deuteron exchange of (C-alpha)-H with solvent deuterium, and of release of aldehyde to regenerate thiamin have been measured for hydroxyethylthiamin and analogs. The differences in kinetic acidity of (C-alpha)-H and of rates of aldehyde release are rationalized in terms of differing electron-withdrawing abilities of the substituents attached to N-3, and appear not to be related to intramolecular basic catalysis of these processes by the C-4' amino group."
https://openalex.org/W1557536338,"Approximate Hammett reaction constants rho calculated from k2/K8 values of several phenyl esters of N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, hippuric acid, and beta-phenylpropionic acid are 0.0, 0.4, and 1.0 respectively. To determine whether the lack of substituent effect of k2/K8 with the N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine esters is a result of substituent-insensitive k2 or rate-limiting association of enzyme and substrate, pH-k2/K8 deependences and solvent deuterium isotope effects were determined for certain of the substrates and compared with those found with the corresponding hippurates and beta-phenylpropionates. In the pH range 5 to 8, k2/K8 of the phenyl and 4-nitrophenyl esters of each series is dependent upon the unprotonated form of an enzymatic base of apparent pKa approximately 7.4, identical with the pKa found for the free enzyme. With the phenyl esters of each substrate class, k2/K8 decreased by 2 to 3 times in deuterium oxide compared with water. The results suggest that a step involving a general base-catalyzed proton transfer, almost certainly k2, is rate-limiting with the N-acetyl-L-phenylalaninates, as well as the hippurates and beta-phenylpropionates. Attack by the protein on the latter substrates is prediminantly nucleophilic, judged by the similarity of rho in the enzymatic and reference hydroxide ion-catalyzed hydrolyses. The power rho values for the N-acetyl-L-phenylalaninates and hippurates could result from an electrophilic component in their hydrolytic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1598912670,"The glutamate analog, alpha-aminomethylglutaric acid, was synthetized by Michael addition of ammonia to 2-methylene glutaronitrile followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate alpha-aminomethylglutaryl nitrile; the analog cyclizes readily on heating to 2-piperidone-5-carboxylic acid. Sheep brain glutamine synthetase utilizes one isomer of DL-alpha-aminomethylglutarate at about 10% of the rate with L-glutamate. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase uses both isomers of DL-alpha-aminomethylglutarate, preferentially acting on the same isomer used by glutamine synthetase. gamma-(alpha-Aminomethyl)glutaryl-alpha-aminobutyrate, prepared enzymatically with gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, was found to be a substrate and an inhibitor of glutathione synthetase. alpha-Aminomethylglutarate does not inhibit gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase appreciably. When alpha-aminomethylglutarate was administered to mice, there were substantial decreases in the levels of glutamine, glutathione, glutamate, and glycine in the kidney, and of glutamine and glutamate in the liver, indicating that this glutamate analog is effective as an inhibitor of glutamine and glutathione synthesis in vivo, and suggesting that it may also inhibit other enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1598469648,"The 15 exposed carboxyl groups of alpha-chymotrypsin were modified with glycine ethyl ester at low pH using barbodiimide reagent. The specificity of the modified enzyme (Chy-15) was studied over the pH range of 4 to 9 with both N-acylated and non-N-acylated amino acid esters. The modified enzyme had lower reactivity toward N-acylated esters than non-N-acylated esters compared to the native enzyme. Typical substances such as acetyl- and benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl esters retained 4 and 9% activity, whereas phenylalanine ethyl ester was slightly more reactive with the modified than with the native enzyme. The pH-rate profiles of acetyl-L-phenylalanine ethyl ester and tryptophan ethyl and benzyl esters were investigated in detail. Analysis of these profiles revealed three pKa values of approximately 5, 7, and 9 related to a functional carboxyl, imidazoyl, and an amino group, respectively. Since similar pKa values occur for the native enzyme, modification did not block the carboxyl corresponding to pKa 5. A mechanism is proposed for catalysis which includes both the protonated and unprotonated form of the imidazoyl (His-57) and utilizes water rather than a carboxyl (Asp-102) as the proton sink."
https://openalex.org/W1499336066,Abstract Stopped flow ultraviolet spectroscopy has been used to measure the rate of hydrogen exchange with solvent at the amide group of reduced nicotinamide nucleotide coenzymes. Several mechanisms for the exchange reaction are considered in the light of the kinetic data. Complex formation between the coenzyme and any of four dehydrogenases markedly slows the rate of hydrogen exchange. Hydrogen bond formation and/or hydrophobic interactions within these complexes are thought to be the reasons for the decreased rate of exchange.
