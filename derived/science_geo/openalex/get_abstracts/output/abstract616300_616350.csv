https://openalex.org/W2885789584,"We present the R package bigleaf (version 0.6.5), an open source toolset for the derivation of meteorological, aerodynamic, and physiological ecosystem properties from eddy covariance (EC) flux observations and concurrent meteorological measurements. A ‘big-leaf’ framework, in which vegetation is represented as a single, uniform layer, is employed to infer bulk ecosystem characteristics top-down from the measured fluxes. Central to the package is the calculation of a bulk surface/canopy conductance (Gs/Gc) and a bulk aerodynamic conductance (Ga), with the latter including formulations for the turbulent and canopy boundary layer components. The derivation of physical land surface characteristics such as surface roughness parameters, wind profile, aerodynamic and radiometric surface temperature, surface vapor pressure deficit (VPD), potential evapotranspiration (ET), imposed and equilibrium ET, as well as vegetation-atmosphere decoupling coefficients, is described. The package further provides calculation routines for physiological ecosytem properties (stomatal slope parameters, stomatal sensitivity to VPD, bulk intercellular CO2 concentration, canopy photosynthetic capacity), energy balance characteristics (closure, biochemical energy), ancillary meteorological variables (psychrometric constant, saturation vapor pressure, air density, etc.), customary unit interconversions and data filtering. The target variables can be calculated with a different degree of complexity, depending on the amount of available site-specific information. The utilities of the package are demonstrated for three single-level (above-canopy) eddy covariance sites representing a temperate grassland, a temperate needle-leaf forest, and a Mediterranean evergreen broadleaf forest. The routines are further tested for a two-level EC site (tree and grass layer) located in a Mediterranean oak savanna. The limitations and the ecophysiological interpretation of the derived ecosystem properties are discussed and practical guidelines are given. The package provides the basis for a consistent, physically sound, and reproducible characterization of biometeorological conditions and ecosystem physiology, and is applicable to EC sites across vegetation types and climatic conditions with minimal ancillary data requirements."

One of the key features required for the exceptional properties of this durable biopolymer is the extensive covalent cross-linking between domains of its monomer molecule tropoelastin. To date, elastin's exact molecular assembly and mechanical properties are poorly understood. Here, using bovine elastin, we investigated the different types of cross-links in mature elastin to gain insight into its structure. We purified and proteolytically cleaved elastin from a single tissue sample into soluble cross-linked and noncross-linked peptides that we studied by high-resolution MS. This analysis enabled the elucidation of cross-links and other elastin modifications. We found that the lysine residues within the tropoelastin sequence were simultaneously unmodified and involved in various types of cross-links with different other domains. The Lys–Pro domains were almost exclusively linked via lysinonorleucine, whereas Lys–Ala domains were found to be cross-linked via lysinonorleucine, allysine aldol, and desmosine. Unexpectedly, we identified a high number of intramolecular cross-links between lysine residues in close proximity. In summary, we show on the molecular level that elastin formation involves random cross-linking of tropoelastin monomers resulting in an unordered network, an unexpected finding compared with previous assumptions of an overall beaded structure.

https://openalex.org/W2885474054,"Invasive Gram-negative bacteria often express multiple virulence-associated metal ion chelators to combat host-mediated metal deficiencies. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Yersinia pestis isolates encoding the Yersinia high pathogenicity island (HPI) secrete yersiniabactin (Ybt), a metallophore originally shown to chelate iron ions during infection. However, our recent demonstration that Ybt also scavenges copper ions during infection led us to question whether it might be capable of retrieving other metals as well. Here, we find that uropathogenic E. coli also use Ybt to bind extracellular nickel ions. Using quantitative MS, we show that the canonical metal-Ybt import pathway internalizes the resulting Ni-Ybt complexes, extracts the nickel, and releases metal-free Ybt back to the extracellular space. We find that E. coli and Klebsiella direct the nickel liberated from this pathway to intracellular nickel enzymes. Thus, Ybt may provide access to nickel that is inaccessible to the conserved NikABCDE permease system. Nickel should be considered alongside iron and copper as a plausible substrate for Ybt-mediated metal import by enterobacteria during human infections."
https://openalex.org/W2885896582,"Endothelial cells have an important role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Age-related disorders (including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) or aging per se induce endothelial dysfunction that predisposes to the development of atherosclerosis. Polyphenols have been reported to suppress age-related endothelial cell disorders, but their role in vascular function is yet to be determined. We investigated the influence of boysenberry polyphenol on vascular health under metabolic stress in a murine model of dietary obesity. We found that administration of boysenberry polyphenol suppressed production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in the aorta. It has been reported that p53 induces cellular senescence and has a crucial role in age-related disorders, including heart failure and diabetes. Administration of boysenberry polyphenol significantly reduced the endothelial p53 level in the aorta and ameliorated endothelial cell dysfunction in iliac arteries under metabolic stress. Boysenberry polyphenol also reduced ROS and p53 levels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), while increasing NO production. Uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS monomer) is known to promote ROS production. We found that boysenberry polyphenol reduced eNOS monomer levels both in vivo and in vitro, along with an increase of eNOS dimerization. To investigate the components of boysenberry polyphenol mediating these favorable biological effects, we extracted the anthocyanin fractions. We found that anthocyanins contributed to suppression of ROS and p53, in association with increased NO production and eNOS dimerization. In an ex vivo study, anthocyanins promoted relaxation of iliac arteries from mice with dietary obesity. These findings indicate that boysenberry polyphenol and anthocyanins, a major component of this polyphenol, inhibit endothelial dysfunction and contribute to maintenance of vascular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2885831674,"Hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice) is caused by raised levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. When severe, susceptible brain regions including the cerebellum and auditory brainstem are damaged causing neurological sequelae such as ataxia, hearing loss and kernicterus. The mechanism(s) by which bilirubin exerts its toxic effect have not been completely understood to date. In this study we investigated the acute mechanisms by which bilirubin causes the neurotoxicity that contributes to hearing loss. We developed a novel mouse model that exhibits the neurological features seen in human Bilirubin-Induced Neurological Dysfunction (BIND) syndrome that we assessed with a behavioural score and auditory brainstem responses (ABR). Guided by initial experiments applying bilirubin to cultured cells in vitro, we performed whole genome gene expression measurements on mouse brain tissue (cerebellum and auditory brainstem) following bilirubin exposure to gain mechanistic insights into biochemical processes affected, and investigated further using immunoblotting. We then compared the gene changes induced by bilirubin to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well characterized inducer of neuroinflammation, to assess the degree of similarity between them. Finally, we examined the extent to which genetic perturbation of inflammation and both known and novel anti-inflammatory drugs could protect hearing from bilirubin-induced toxicity. The in vitro results indicated that bilirubin induces changes in gene expression consistent with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). These gene changes were similar to the gene expression signature of thapsigargin–a known ER stress inducer. It also induced gene expression changes associated with inflammation and NF-κB activation. The in vivo model showed behavioural impairment and a raised auditory threshold. Whole genome gene expression analysis confirmed inflammation as a key mechanism of bilirubin neurotoxicity in the auditory pathway and shared gene expression hallmarks induced by exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a well-characterized inducer of neuroinflammation. Interestingly, bilirubin caused more severe damage to the auditory system than LPS in this model, but consistent with our hypothesis of neuroinflammation being a primary part of bilirubin toxicity, the hearing loss was protected by perturbing the inflammatory response. This was carried out genetically using lipocalin-2 (LCN2)-null mice, which is an inflammatory cytokine highly upregulated in response to bilirubin. Finally, we tested known and novel anti-inflammatory compounds (interfering with NF-κB and TNFα signalling), and also demonstrated protection of the auditory system from bilirubin toxicity. We have developed a novel, reversible, model for jaundice that shows movement impairment and auditory loss consistent with human symptoms. We used this model to establish ER-stress and inflammation as major contributors to bilirubin toxicity. Because of the rapid and reversible onset of toxicity in this novel model it represents a system to screen therapeutic compounds. We have demonstrated this by targeting inflammation genetically and with anti-inflammatory small molecules that offered protection against bilirubin toxicity. This also suggests that anti-inflammatory drugs could be of therapeutic use in hyperbilirubinemia."
https://openalex.org/W2886463254,"In a global environment of increasing species extinctions and decreasing availability of funds with which to combat the causes of biodiversity loss, maximising the efficiency of conservation efforts is crucial. The only way to ensure maximum return on conservation investment is to incorporate the cost, benefit and likelihood of success of conservation actions into decision-making in a systematic and objective way. Here we report on the application of a Project Prioritization Protocol (PPP), first implemented by the New Zealand Government, to target and prioritize investment in threatened species in New South Wales, Australia, under the state’s new Saving our Species program. Detailed management prescriptions for 368 threatened species were developed via an expert elicitation process, and were then prioritized using quantitative data on benefit, likelihood of success and implementation cost, and a simple cost-efficiency equation. We discuss the outcomes that have been realized even in the early stages of the program; including the efficient development of planning resources made available to all potential threatened species investors and the demonstration of a transparent and objective approach to threatened species management that will significantly increase the probability of meeting an objective to secure the greatest number of threatened species from extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2887661832,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with agricultural soils representing its largest anthropogenic source. However, the mechanisms involved in the N2O emission and factors affecting N2O emission fluxes in response to various nitrogenous fertilizer applications remain uncertain. We conducted a four-year (2012–2015) field experiment to assess how fertilization scheme impacts N2O emissions from a rice-wheat cropping system in eastern China. The fertilizer treatments included Control (CK), Conventional fertilizer (CF), CF with shallow-irrigation (CF+SI), CF with deep-irrigation system (CF+DI), Optimized fertilizer (OF), OF with Urease inhibitor (OF+UI), OF with conservation tillage (OF+CT) and Slow-release fertilizer (SRF). N2O emissions were measured by a closed static chamber method. N2O emission fluxes ranged from 0.61 μg m-2 h-1 to 1707 μg m-2 h-1, indicating a significant impact of nitrogen fertilizer and cropping type on N2O emissions. The highest crop yields for wheat (3515–3667 kg ha-1) and rice (8633–8990 kg ha-1) were observed under the SRF and OF+UI treatments with significant reduction in N2O emissions by 16.94–21.20% and 5.55–7.93%, respectively. Our findings suggest that the SRF and OF+UI treatments can be effective in achieving maximum crop yield and lowering N2O emissions for the rice-wheat cropping system in eastern China."
https://openalex.org/W2886446399,"Ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), using aqueous ethanol as the solvent, was firstly applied to extract phenolic compounds from Terminalia chebula Retz. fruits (T. chebula fruits). In this study, ethanol concentration (%), ultrasonic intensity (W/cm2), particle diameter (mm), extraction temperature (°C), ultrasonic time (min), liquid-solid ratio (mL/g) and extraction cycle were investigated by single-factor experiment and then optimized using a Box-Behnken design. The optimized result for UAE was 68% ethanol concentration, ultrasonic intensity of 3.6 W/cm2, solid-liquid ratio of 23 mg/mL, particle size of 0.18 mm and ultrasonic time of 20 min for 2 times at 70 °C. The yield of total phenolic was 448.7 ± 2.15 mg GAE/g DW under the above optimum conditions, which agreed with the predicted value (447.8 mg GAE/g DW). Compared to conventional solvent extraction (CSE), UAE extracts showed excellent DPPH radical, DPPH, ABTS scavenging activities and reducing power in a dose-dependent manner, and better than that of CSE extracts. Additionally, the extract of the T. chebula fruits was analyzed by HPLC-ESI/MS. In summary, UAE could effectively extract phenolic compounds from T. chebula fruits. In addition, the extract could be used as a potential source of natural antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2886683778,"This study examines the impact of ethical attitude on the willingness to pay for farm animal welfare improvement in Germany. Little is known about the pluralism of moral attitudes that may exist behind farm animal welfare issues and its relationship to customers' willingness to pay for it. Via a large survey (n = 1334) we are able to identify different moral dimensions by employing validated scales. We find utilitarian alongside deontological attitudes as well as a mixture of both. Thus, presupposing a standard moral attitude is too simple. This has implications for decision-making on markets, since the implicit normative assumptions of a utilitarian position in economics has to be critically assessed. Furthermore, we asked for the willingness to pay for various aspects of farm animal welfare improvement. We find significant positive correlations between willingness to pay and environmental concern, altruism and less apathy. Measured in Euro, a higher environmental concern has the strongest effect on WTP for all five moral scales. Outliers with higher bids are willing to pay almost five times for any aspect of farm animal welfare than the rest of the sample. A more detailed analysis of outliers demonstrates that market-based approaches have restrictions in capturing certain moral values. Moreover, the motivations behind zero bids reveal that moral concerns outweigh indifference towards animal welfare by far. This has implications how policy can be designed to serve people’s demand for higher animal welfare standards. Two other findings are of interest. First, we find a very high number of people assigning an intrinsic value to animals (90%). Second, zero bids and outlier treatment in WTP-studies deserves more careful consideration, since WTP-estimates are easily skewed by excluding these groups."
https://openalex.org/W2885808213,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is one of the smallest, nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses. The PCV2 capsid protein (Cap) is the sole viral structural protein and main antigenic determinant. Previous sequence analysis has revealed that the N terminus of the PCV2 Cap contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) enriched in positively charged residues. Here, we report that PCV2's NLS can function as a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). We observed that this NLS can carry macromolecules, e.g. enhanced GFP (EGFP), into cells when they are fused to the NLS, indicating that it can function as a CPP, similar to the classical CPP derived from HIV type 1 transactivator of transcription protein (HIV TAT). We also found that the first 17 residues of the NLS (NLS-A) have a key role in cellular uptake. In addition to entering cells via multiple endocytic processes, NLS-A was also rapidly internalized via direct translocation enabled by increased membrane permeability and was evenly distributed throughout cells when its concentration in cell cultures was ≥10 μm. Of note, cellular NLS-A uptake was ∼10 times more efficient than that of HIV TAT. We inferred that the externalized NLS of the PCV2 Cap may accumulate to a high concentration (≥10 μm) at a local membrane area, increasing membrane permeability to facilitate viral entry into the cell to release its genome into a viral DNA reproduction center. We conclude that NLS-A has potential as a versatile vehicle for shuttling foreign molecules into cells, including pharmaceuticals for therapeutic interventions.

There are three genotypes of which PCV type 2 (PCV2) has been associated with various diseases, collectively termed porcine circovirus 2–associated diseases (2Segalés J. Kekarainen T. Cortey M.

In addition, PCV type 3 (PCV3), a newly emerging circovirus, was reported in 2016, and its pathogenicity has yet to be determined (4Palinski R. Piñeyro P. Shang P. Yuan F. Guo R. Fang Y. Byers E.

Currently, PCV2 is regarded as one of the world's most important swine pathogens, causing huge economic losses. The PCV2 genome contains two main open reading frames (ORFs). Of those, ORF1 encodes two replication-related proteins (Rep and Rep′), both of which are indispensable to virus replication, whereas ORF2 encodes capsid protein (Cap), the sole structural protein of this virus, capable of self-assembly into virus-like particles in vivo or in vitro. The NH2 terminus of the Cap, consisting of 41 residues, is the nuclear localization signal (NLS), based on subcellular localizations of various PCV2 Cap mutants, including truncated Cap (without the NLS) that was not detected in the nucleus (6Liu Q. Tikoo S.K. Babiuk L.A. Nuclear localization of the ORF2 protein encoded by porcine circovirus type 2.Virology. 2001; 285 (11414809): 91-9910.1006/viro.2001.0922Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The NLS is enriched with positively charged residues, often present in other NLS-containing proteins. A unique signature of the NLS of the PCV Cap is an arginine-rich stretch. Interestingly, the NLS of Caps derived from other circovirus species (e.g. those affecting ducks or dogs) also contains substantial arginine residues. However, functions of these arginine residues in the NLS have not yet been confirmed. The NLS may be proximal to the icosahedral 5-fold axis of the PCV2 capsid and be involved in viral DNA packaging (7Khayat R. Brunn N. Speir J.A. Hardham J.M. Ankenbauer R.G. Schneemann A. Johnson J.E. The 2.3-angstrom structure of porcine circovirus 2.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (21632760): 7856-786210.1128/JVI.00737-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the NLS might not be exposed on the capsid surface in a mature virion, although it might externalize in the metastable capsid, induced by various cellular or environmental factors during virus entry into host cells. However, roles of the NLS in PCV2 entry into host cells are unknown. The NLS of adenovirus E1A can deliver macromolecules into a nucleus by interacting with the nuclear pore complex in nondividing cells, which can further be recognized by nuclear import transporters (8Wagstaff K.M. Jans D.A. Nucleocytoplasmic transport of DNA: enhancing non-viral gene transfer.Biochem. J. 2007; 406 (17680778): 185-20210.1042/BJ20070505Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Douglas J.L.

Furthermore, NLS peptides derived from simian virus 40 (KKKRKV) and nucleoplasmin (KRPAAIKKAGQAKKKK) may function as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), delivering foreign proteins into cells, although both peptides have poor efficiencies for cellular uptake with their functional motifs rich in lysine residues (10Futaki S.

Over the past 20 years, >100 peptides, ranging from 5 to 40 residues, have been reported to penetrate various cell membranes and carry biologically active molecules, cargoes, and compounds into cells (14Jones A.T.

Among these CPPs, the HIV TAT–based delivery system has been extensively studied in cultured cells and organs (15Rapoport M. Lorberboum-Galski H.

For example, by bioconjugation with imaging agents, HIV TAT can be used for intracellular imaging (16Chen B. Liu Q. Zhang Y. Xu L. Fang X.

Although CPPs are efficient intracellular delivery systems, they have limitations in practical applications. First, HIV TAT was reported to move out of cells, thereby reducing intracellular concentrations of HIV TAT–attached compounds (17Ruan G. Agrawal A. Marcus A.I. Nie S.

Second, HIV TAT and some CPPs might be trapped in endosomes and degraded during endosome maturation (19Cleal K. He L. Watson P.D. Jones A.T.

Elucidating mechanisms of CPP cellular uptake should facilitate development of novel delivery vectors.

In addition, energy-dependent macropinocytosis is considered a primary endocytosis pathway responsible for CPP-mediated intracellular delivery of various proteins (25Nakase I. Hirose H. Tanaka G.

In that regard, dimeric HIV TAT had a crucial role in the subsequent endosomal escape of these foreign proteins into the cytoplasm (27Erazo-Oliveras A. Najjar K. Dayani L. Wang T.Y. Johnson G.A. Pellois J.P. Protein delivery into live cells by incubation with an endosomolytic agent.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 (24930129): 861-86710.1038/nmeth.2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless, precise mechanisms regarding cellular uptake of various CPPs remain to be determined. In this study, NLS derived from the PCV2 Cap carried foreign protein into various cell lines. Furthermore, roles of two positively charged segments (NLS-A and -B) among the NLS were investigated: NLS-A, but not -B, may function as a novel CPP capable of entering cells. In addition, mechanisms of NLS-A cellular uptake at different concentrations were also studied by live-imaging microscopy because fixation reagents might lead to artificial redistribution due to the positively charged nature of the CPP (29Melikov K. Chernomordik L.V. Arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides: from endosomal uptake to nuclear delivery.Cell. Mol.

Finally, we raised a possible model in which the NLS of the PCV Cap may have essential roles in interactions of virus–host cells and release of a viral genome into a replication site via increased membrane permeability. The NLS was strictly conserved and enriched with arginine residues within Caps of both genotypes of PCV1 and PCV2 except for 2 extra residues (33AF34) in the NLS of the PCV1 Caps (Fig. 1A). Based on secondary structure analysis, the NLS of the PCV2 Cap was composed of two stretches (NLS-A and -B) separated by an α-helix (30Wang N. Zhan Y. Wang A. Zhang L. Khayat R. Yang Y. In silico Analysis of surface structure variation of PCV2 capsid resulted from loops mutation of its capsid protein (Cap).J. Gen. Virol. 2016; 97 (27902320): 3331-334410.1099/jgv.0.000634Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), although this helix was absent in the PCV3 Cap (Fig. 1A). In PCV2, NLS-A contained 9 arginine residues, whereas NLS-B had 8 arginines and 1 lysine residue (Fig. 1, A and C). Furthermore, NLS derived from various circovirus species all had a signature motif rich in arginine residues (Fig. 1B). In addition, there was a well known and conserved motif of the cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) in PCV2 Caps (Fig. 1C). The CRAC motif, comprising -(L/V)X1–5YX1–5(R/K)- where X1–5 represents 1–5 residues of any amino acid at the position(s) (31Levitan I. Singh D.K. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Cholesterol binding to ion channels.Front. Physiol. 2014; 5 (24616704): 6510.3389/fphys.2014.00065Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was only in NLS-B of PCV2 Caps, but not in PCV1, due to insertion of 2 residues in NLS-B (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the arginine-rich NLS of the PCV2 Cap can carry foreign protein across cell membranes and enter cells in vitro, porcine kidney epithelial (PK15) (Fig. 2, A–C) or Sf9 cells (Fig. 2, D–F) were incubated with purified NLS-fused EGFP (NLS–EGFP) or EGFP (Fig. S1), respectively. The NLS–EGFP entered both cell lines (Fig. 2, A and D, left panels). In contrast, the fluorescence in EGFP-treated cells was significantly low (Fig. 2, A and D, middle panels). Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that both PK15 cells and Sf9 cells incubated with NLS–EGFP had a significantly increased number of cells with intracellular fluorescence (Fig. 2, B and E) and higher mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2, C and F) compared with PK15 cells or Sf9 cells incubated with EGFP or the controls. Both NLS-A and -B are rich in positively charged residues and form two independent stretches divided by an α-helix (30Wang N. Zhan Y. Wang A. Zhang L. Khayat R. Yang Y. In silico Analysis of surface structure variation of PCV2 capsid resulted from loops mutation of its capsid protein (Cap).J. Gen.

Numbers of positively charged residues within each were comparable with two known CPPs (HIV TAT and polyarginine Arg8) (Fig. 1C). We hypothesized that both NLS-A and -B may function as CPPs. To test this hypothesis, both peptides were synthesized, conjugated with FITC, and incubated with PK15 cells. NLS-A (Fig. 3A, upper row) entered PK15 cells, whereas NLS-B failed to enter cells (Fig. 3A, middle row). Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that PK15 cells incubated with NLS-A had a significantly higher percentage of cells with intracellular fluorescence (Fig. 3B) and higher mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3C) than PK15 cells incubated with NLS-B or the control. In addition, besides PK15, both NLS-A and HIV TAT also entered HeLa and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 4B) was consistent with the above confocal imaging result.Figure 4.Cellular uptake of FITC-conjugated NLS-A and FITC-conjugated HIV-TAT. A, PK15, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated NLS-A (upper row) or FITC-conjugated HIV-TAT (middle row) for 30 min and washed three times with PBS before imaging with a dual-channel confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon TiE).

All scale bars represent 10 μm. a.u., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There was a punctate distribution pattern of NLS-A in cells after peptide internalization irrespective of peptide concentration in culture (Fig. 5A). Therefore, NLS-A may enter cells via endocytosis and localize within vesicles. However, an even distribution of the NLS-A throughout the cell cytoplasm, along with the punctate pattern, was also observed when peptide concentration in culture was ≥10 μm (Fig. 5A), implying a possible alternative concentration-dependent entry mechanism of NLS-A. In addition, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that cellular uptake of NLS-A increased with elevated concentrations of this peptide in cell culture (Fig. 5, B and C). To exclude extracellular fluorescence (e.g. membrane surface–associated NLS-A), PK15 cells incubated with peptides or proteins were always treated with trypsin at 37 °C for 2 min (see “Materials and methods”) before flow cytometry analysis (because NLS-A was sensitive to trypsinization; Fig. S2). In previous reports, CPPs had variable cytotoxicity at high concentration (12Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B.

Cells were treated with high concentration of NLS-A (40 μm) for 30 min followed by propidium iodide (PI) staining. As shown in Fig. 5D and Fig. S3, >90% of the cells were viable with incubation of NLS-A, even at a high concentration of 40 μm. Furthermore, we compared the cytotoxicity of NLS-A and HIV TAT upon PK15 cells at various concentrations. More than 95% of PK15 cells were viable under incubation of both CPPs that were lower than 20 μm (Fig. S3). As suggested above in Fig. 5, the entry mechanism of NLS-A might be concentration-dependent. To further dissect the scenario, we monitored the NLS-A entry process by time-lapse confocal microscopy at high concentrations (40 μm). The increasing intracellular fluorescence signal was recorded every 5 s after the addition of peptide to cell culture (Fig. 6A), and the quantified intracellular mean fluorescence intensity was plotted against time (Fig. 6B). The rapid cellular uptake and even distribution of NLS-A suggested that the peptide may enter cells either through a receptor-independent pathway or by directly penetrating the cell membranes at high concentrations. To test whether NLS-A induced membrane permeability, we mixed NLS-A with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with encapsulated fluorescent dye (atto565) and monitored the GUVs with confocal microscopy. Fluorescence (red) within the GUVs turned green after NLS-A was mixed with the GUVs (Fig. 6, C and D), demonstrating the entry of NLS-A into the GUVs; in addition, the dye (red) in the GUVs also leaked out from the vesicles into the buffer. This result strongly indicated that NLS-A increased the permeability of the membrane and led to the equilibration of NLS-A and the atto565 dye across membranes (Fig. 6D). However, in the presence of FITC alone (Fig. 6E) or in the absence of NLS-A (Fig. 6C), the atto565 dye within the GUVs was quite stable. Statistical analysis also demonstrated that the ratio of GUVs containing green dye in the presence of NLS-A was significantly higher than that in the presence of FITC alone (Fig. 6F; p < 0.001). Therefore, a high concentration of NLS-A permeabilized the GUV membrane and caused a bidirectional flux of the dye across the membrane. It appears that HIV TAT and other CPPs enter cells via endocytosis with distinct pathways (22Duchardt F. Fotin-Mleczek M. Schwarz H. Fischer R. Brock R. A comprehensive model for the cellular uptake of cationic cell-penetrating peptides.Traffic. 2007; 8 (17587406): 848-86610.1111/j.1600-0854.2007.00572.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The punctate distribution of the NLS-A at low concentrations indicated that the peptide was translocated into cells via endocytosis. Dynamic tracking of NLS-A in live cells indicated that the NLS-A colocalized with Rab7–RFP in PK15 cells (Fig. 7A). Therefore, NLS-A was present in a late endosome after internalization. Next, we applied endocytosis inhibitors to cell cultures to further study the NLS-A entry mechanism. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (chlorpromazine) and macropinocytosis (N-(ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride) and disruption of caveolae/lipid rafts (methyl-β-cyclodextrin) all dramatically decreased efficiency of NLS-A entry into cells (Fig. 7, B and C). Therefore, the three major endocytosis pathways were all involved in internalization of NLS-A at low concentration (6 μm). In addition, effects of F-actin on NLS-A internalization were also tested. Inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D dramatically decreased efficiency of NLS-A (6 μm) entry into PK15 cells (Fig. S4), which implicated F-actin to have a critical role in NLS-A internalization. Finally, we compared the entry efficiency of NLS-A and HIV TAT. PK15 cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated NLS-A or HIV TAT at various concentrations, and cellular uptake efficiencies of the peptides were evaluated by flow cytometry. Mean fluorescence intensities were compared between NLS-A and HIV TAT at various concentrations, and NLS-A entry into PK15 cells was 10-fold more efficient than entry of HIV TAT in PK15 cells (Fig. 8). Similar results were also observed in HeLa cells (Fig. S5). In a mature PCV2 virion, viral genomic DNA is packaged by a capsid, assembled by 60 Cap subunits. The NLS of the PCV2 Cap is considered a critical element responsible for viral DNA packaging as the NLS, which is rich in positively charged residues, may interact with phosphate groups of viral DNA. Mutation of the NLS significantly decreases virus titers in cell culture (32Shuai J. Fu L. Zhang X. Zhu B. Li X. He Y. Fang W.

https://openalex.org/W2886137308,"Background Sexual dimorphism in cardiac sympathetic outflow has recently gained attention in the context of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Previous studies suggest that there are sex- and age-dependent differences in peripheral autonomic control, however, data on cardiac-specific sympathetic activation in aged women and men are lacking. Methods and results Regional quantitative analysis of cardiac fluorine-18 (18F)- Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) uptake was retrospectively performed in 133 patients (69 females, mean age 52.4±17.7 years) referred for assessment of neuroendocrine tumours (NET) by Positron-Emission-Tomography. Cardiac 18F-DOPA uptake was significantly higher in women as compared to men (1.33±0.21 vs. 1.18±0.24, p<0.001). This sex-difference was most pronounced in the apical region of the left ventricle (LV, 1.30±0.24 in women vs. 1.13±0.25 in men, p<0.001) and in individuals >55 years of age (1.39±0.25 in women vs. 1.09±0.24 in men, p<0.001). Women showed a prominent increase in myocardial 18F-DOPA uptake with age with the strongest increase seen in the LV apical region (r = 0.34, p = 0.004). Accordingly, sex and age were selected as significant predictors of LV apical 18F-DOPA uptake in a stepwise linear regression model. No age-dependent changes of cardiac 18F-DOPA uptake were observed in men or in the right ventricular region. Conclusion Our study suggests that aging is related to sex-specific changes in regional cardiac sympathetic activity. Future studies will have to assess whether the increase in LV apical 18F-DOPA uptake with age in women is of pathogenic relevance for the higher susceptibility of postmenopausal women to conditions associated with increased sympathetic activity."

Formation of kidney stones involves a series of events during which they undergo morphological and mineralogical changes. We investigated the mineralization of biogenic struvite (in vitro) and examined the transformation of distinct interior and exterior structure of struvite. In vitro crystallization of struvite was performed in the presence of two bacteria that were originally isolated from the kidney stone patients. Morphological evaluation was carried out using SR-μCT as well as FESEM, XRD and FT-IR. Characteristic internal 3-D morphology and porosity of the stones were studied. For comparison, patient derived struvite stones were used. From the results obtained, we report that the presence of bacteria enhances the crystallization process of struvite in vitro. A series of time-resolved experiments revealed that struvite crystals experienced a significant morphologic evolution from pin pointed structure to X-shaped and tabular morphologies. These X-shaped and unusual tabular habits of struvite resembled biogenic morphologies of struvite. SR-μCT showed similarities between the patient derived and the in vitro derived struvite crystals. In conclusion, these experiments revealed that the bacteria play a major role in the specific morphogenesis of struvite and can able to control the nucleation, modulate crystalline phases, and shape of the growing crystal."

Objectives This study was performed to investigate the association between depressive symptoms and subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Methods Among the 7,550 subjects who participated in the 2014 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1,763 participants without overt thyroid disease were included in this study. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), serum free thyroxine (fT4), and depressive symptoms were analyzed based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Results The percentages of subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism were 3.3% and 2.6%, respectively. The percentages of subjects with moderate (10–14 points), moderately severe (15–19 points), and severe (≥20 points) depression according to the distribution of PHQ-9 scores were 4.7%, 1.1%, and 0.3%, respectively. TSH, fT4, and the percentage of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were not significantly associated with PHQ-9 score. However, the percentage of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism increased significantly with PHQ9 score (P = 0.002). Subjects with subclinical hyperthyroidism had higher PHQ-9 scores than those with normal thyroid function (mean ± standard error [SE], 4.2 ± 0.5 vs. 2.7 ± 0.1 points, P = 0.010). More subjects with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a PHQ9 score ≥ 10 than did those with normal thyroid function (mean ± SE, 17.1 ± 3.5 vs. 5.8 ± 0.6%, P = 0.005). We performed logistic regression analyses for the presence of depressive symptoms, using age, sex, education, household income, alcohol drinking, smoking, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease history, subclinical hypothyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as variables. Subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with the presence of clinically relevant depression (PHQ9 score ≥ 10), (odds ratio [OR], 4.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75–9.31; P = 0.001), and clinically significant depression (PHQ9 score ≥ 15), (OR, 7.05; 95% CI, 1.67–29.67; P = 0.008), respectively. However, subclinical hypothyroidism was not associated with the presence of clinically relevant depression (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.39–3.38; P = 0.800), or clinically significant depression (OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 0.71–15.79; P = 0.127).

Non-invasive scores correlate with the degree of liver fibrosis in these patients. Aims and methods To investigate the accuracy of noninvasive scoring systems in predicting long-term outcomes and cancer incidence of patients with NAFLD, we performed a single-center retrospective study of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD. Mean follow up period was 100 months. Outcomes included liver-related complications, hospitalizations, overall mortality and the development of any malignancies. Results 32 patients had advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) per biopsy at baseline and 121 patients had mild to moderate fibrosis (F0-F2). Both advanced histologic fibrosis stage as well as higher non-invasive scores predicted repeated hospitalizations and longer hospitalization stays. In a multivariate analysis, liver fibrosis (p = 0.002), FIB-4 score (p<0.001), NFS (p<0.001) but not APRI score (p = 0.07) were predictors of overall mortality, and the occurrence of malignancies was associated with higher APRI (p<0.001), FIB-4 (p<0.001) and NFS (p = 0.008) scores, but not with advanced fibrosis, as determined by liver biopsy (p = 0.105). Conclusions In NAFLD patients, noninvasive scoring systems are good predictors of morbidity and mortality and may have an additive value in predicting the development of hepatic and extra-hepatic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2886368683,"Metabarcoding allows the genetic analysis of pooled samples of various sources. It is becoming popular in the study of animal diet, especially because it allows the analysis of the composition of feces without the need of handling animals. In this work, we studied the diet of the Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus), a small semi-aquatic mammal endemic to the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees, by sequencing COI minibarcodes from feces using next-generation sequencing techniques. For the identification of assembled sequences, we employed a tree-based identification method that used a reference tree of sequences of freshwater organisms. The comparison of freshly collected fecal samples and older samples showed that fresh samples produced significantly more sequencing reads. They also rendered more operational taxonomical units (OTUs), but not significantly. Our analyses of 41 samples identified 224 OTUs corresponding to species of the reference tree. Ephemeroptera, Diptera excl. Chironomidae, and Chironomidae were the most highly represented groups in terms of reads as well as samples. Other groups of freshwater organisms detected were Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Neuropteroida, Coleoptera, Crustacea, and Annelida. Our results are largely in line with previous morphological and genetic studies on the diet of the Pyrenean desman, but allowed the identification of a higher diversity of OTUs in each sample. Additionally, the bioinformatic pipeline we developed for deep sequencing of fecal samples will enable the quantitative analysis of the diet of this and other species, which can be highly useful to determine their ecological requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2886713357,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone secreted by the liver in response to metabolic stress. In addition to its well-characterized effects on energy homeostasis, FGF21 has been shown to increase water intake in animals. In this study, we sought to further explore the effects of FGF21 on fluid homeostasis in rats. A single dose of a long-acting FGF21 analog, PF-05231023, significantly increased water consumption, which was accompanied by an elevation in urine output that appeared prior to a significant change in water intake. We observed that FGF21 rapidly and significantly increased heart rate and blood pressure in telemeter-implanted rats, before changes in urine output and water intake were observed. Our data suggest that sympathetic activation may contribute to the pathogenesis by which FGF21 increases blood pressure as the baroreceptor unloading induced reflex tachycardia was significantly elevated in FGF21-treated animals. However, FGF21 was still capable of causing hypertension in animals in which approximately 40% of the sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons were ablated. Our data suggest that FGF21-induced water intake is in fact secondary to diuresis, which we propose to be a compensatory mechanism engaged to alleviate the acute hypertension caused by FGF21."
https://openalex.org/W2885931933,"Many insects show strong behavioral responses to short wavelength light. Drosophila melanogaster exhibit Cryptochrome- and Hyperkinetic-dependent blue and ultraviolet (UV) light avoidance responses that vary by time-of-day, suggesting that these key sensory behaviors are circadian regulated. Here we show mutant flies lacking core clock genes exhibit defects in both time-of-day responses and valence of UV light avoidance/attraction behavior. Non-genetic environmental disruption of the circadian clock by constant UV light exposure leads to complete loss of rhythmic UV light avoidance/attraction behavior. Flies with ablated or electrically silenced circadian lateral ventral neurons have attenuated avoidance response to UV light. We conclude that circadian clock proteins and the circadian lateral ventral neurons regulate both the timing and the valence of UV light avoidance/attraction. These results provide mechanistic support for Pittendrigh's ""escape from light"" hypothesis regarding the co-evolution of phototransduction and circadian systems."

Moreover, ECM stiffness also appears to sensitize cells to exogenously activated TGFβ through unknown mechanisms. Here, using human fibroblasts, we explored the effect of ECM stiffness on a putative inner nuclear membrane protein, LEM domain–containing protein 3 (LEMD3), which is physically connected to the cell's actin cytoskeleton and inhibits TGFβ signaling. We showed that LEMD3–SMAD2/3 interactions are inversely correlated with ECM stiffness and TGFβ-driven luciferase activity and that LEMD3 expression is correlated with the mechanical response of the TGFβ-driven luciferase reporter. We found that actin polymerization but not cellular stress or LEMD3–nuclear-cytoplasmic couplings were necessary for LEMD3–SMAD2/3 interactions. Intriguingly, LEMD3 and SMAD2/3 frequently interacted in the cytosol, and we discovered LEMD3 was proteolytically cleaved into protein fragments. We confirmed that a consensus C-terminal LEMD3 fragment binds SMAD2/3 in a stiffness-dependent manner throughout the cell and is sufficient for antagonizing SMAD2/3 signaling. Using human lung biopsies, we observed that these nuclear and cytosolic interactions are also present in tissue and found that fibrotic tissues exhibit locally diminished and cytoplasmically shifted LEMD3–SMAD2/3 interactions, as noted in vitro. Our work reveals novel LEMD3 biology and stiffness-dependent regulation of TGFβ by LEMD3, providing a novel target to antagonize pathological TGFβ signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2887427442,"The MET proto-oncogene–encoded receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) are independently operating receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are functionally associated with aggressive and invasive cancer cell growth. However, how MET and AXL regulate the migratory properties of cancer cells remains largely unclear. We report here that the addition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the natural ligand of MET, to serum-starved human glioblastoma cells induces the rapid activation of both MET and AXL and formation of highly polarized MET–AXL clusters on the plasma membrane. HGF also promoted the formation of the MET and AXL protein complexes and phosphorylation of AXL, independent of AXL's ligand, growth arrest–specific 6 (GAS6). The HGF-induced MET–AXL complex stimulated rapid and dynamic cytoskeleton reorganization by activating the small GTPase RAC1, a process requiring both MET and AXL kinase activities. We further found that HGF also promotes the recruitment of ELMO2 and DOCK180, a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAC1, to the MET–AXL complex and thereby stimulates the RAC1-dependent cytoskeleton reorganization. We also demonstrated that the MET–AXL–ELMO2–DOCK180 complex is critical for HGF-induced cell migration and invasion in glioblastoma or other cancer cells. Our findings uncover a critical HGF-dependent signaling pathway that involves the assembly of a large protein complex consisting of MET, AXL, ELMO2, and DOCK180 on the plasma membrane, leading to RAC1-dependent cell migration and invasion in various cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2887583519,"Dicyandiamide (DCD) and thiosulfates are two type of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) that have been widely used in agriculture to improve nitrogen (N) fertilizer use efficiency and mitigate negative effect of N on environment. Little information is available concerning the comparison of the efficacy of DCD and thiosulfate on N transformations in soil. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of DCD and thiosulfate (K2S2O3) on changes of NH4+-N, nitrification inhibition and N recovery in a latosolic red soil. An incubation experiment was conducted with four treatments of control (CK), N, N+DCD, and N+K2S2O3. Soil samples were collected periodically over 50 d to determine concentrations of mineral N, and the amoA gene abundance of ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was estimated by qPCR after 10 d incubation. In the N treatment, 67.8% of the applied N as NH4+-N disappeared from the mineral N pool and only 2.7% and 30.8% of the applied N was accumulated as NO2--N and NO3--N, respectively. Addition of DCD and thiosulfate to the soil prevented NH4+-N disappearance by 63.0% and 13.6%, respectively. DCD suppressed the production of NO2--N by 97.41%, whereas thiosulfate increased accumulation of NO2--N by 14.6%. Application of N along with DCD and thiosulfate inhibited nitrification, respectively, by 72.6% and 33.1%, resulting in the delay of the nitrification process for 30 days and 10 days, respectively. Apparent N recovery in N treatment was 66.2%, which increased by 55.2% and 4.8% by DCD and thiosulfate, respectively. Numbers of AOB amoA gene copy was significantly inhibited by both DCD and thiosulfate, and the stronger inhibition induced by DCD than thiosulfate was recorded. Results indicated that both DCD and thiosulfate were effective inhibitors for NH4+-N oxidation, NO3--N production, mineral N losses and AOB growth. DCD showed a more pronounced effect on nitrification inhibition than thiosulfate."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impacts of dexmedetomidine supplemented intravenous analgesia on morphine consumption and subjective sleep quality in elderly patients after open abdominal surgery.This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. 58 elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years) who underwent open abdominal surgery were randomized to receive either dexmedetomidine supplemented morphine analgesia (0.5 mg/ml morphine plus 2 μg/ml dexmedetomidine in 100 ml normal saline, DEX group) or morphine analgesia (0.5 mg/ml morphine in 100 ml normal saline, CTRL group) for 72 hours after surgery. Patient-controlled analgesia pump was programmed to deliver a 2ml bolus with a lockout interval of 8 minutes and a background infusion at a rate of 1 ml/h. The primary endpoint was 72-hour morphine consumption. Secondary endpoints included pain intensity, subjective sleep quality, and 30-day complications and mortality after surgery.The 72-hour morphine consumption was lower in the DEX group than in the CTRL group (median 39.0 mg [interquartile range 37.3, 41.0] in the DEX group vs. 49.0 mg [45.5, 50.0] in the CTRL group; median difference -9.0 mg [95% CI -10.0, -6.0], P < 0.001). The intensity of pain within 48 hours was lower (P<0.001 at 4, 12 and 48 hours, P = 0.007 at 24 hours) whereas the subjective quality of sleep was higher (P = 0.031 during the night of surgery and P<0.001 during the 1st night after surgery, respectively) in the DEX group than in the CTRL group. The incidence of 30-day complications did not differ significantly between groups, but it was slightly lower in the DEX group (P = 0.060). There were no significant differences between groups regarding 30-day mortality and the incidences of adverse events.For elderly patients after open abdominal surgery, dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia decreases morphine consumption, improves analgesic effects and subjective sleep quality without increasing adverse events.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-IPR-14005620."

Little is known about post-hospital outcomes after an index hospitalization for older children. We determined 12-month post-hospital mortality rate and identified factors associated with higher mortality.In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled children 2-12 years of age admitted to the pediatric wards of two public hospitals in northwestern Tanzania. Participants or proxies were contacted at 3, 6 and 12 months post-hospitalization. The primary outcome measured was mortality. Factors associated with mortality were determined using Cox regression analysis.A total of 506 participants were enrolled. In-hospital mortality rate was 7.7% (39/506). Of the 467 participants discharged, the post-hospital mortality rate was 10.1% (47/467). Sickle cell disease (Hazard Ratio (HR) 3.32, 95% CI 1.44-7.68), severe malnutrition (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.18-8.57), neurologic diseases (HR 3.51, 95% CI 1.35-9.11), heart disease (HR 7.11, 95% CI, 2.89-17.51), cancer (HR 11.79, 95% CI 4.95-28.03), and septic shock (HR 4.64, 95% CI 1.42-15.08) had higher association with mortality compared to other diagnoses. The risk factors significantly associated with mortality included older age (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.08), lower hemoglobin level (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.90), lower Glasgow Coma Scale (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59-0.74), history of decreased urine output (HR 2.87, 95% CI 1.49-5.53), higher respiratory rate (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.03), estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2 (binary) (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.10), and lower oxygen saturation (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99).Post-hospital mortality is disturbingly high among children 2-12 years of age in Tanzania.

We painted the classic black soccer shoes in six areas corresponding to six regions of the foot with which it is possible to interact with the ball. Thirty-four 7-years-old soccer players were randomized to two groups (Coloured n = 17 and Black, n = 17) to perform four basic football manoeuvres/tasks: reception (RECP), passing (PASS), ball management (MAGT), and shooting (SHOT). We found highly significant differences (P<0.001) in all four performance tests: mean(sd) RECP: 0.82(0.07) vs. 0.45(0.12); PASS: 0.85(0.07) vs. 0.47(0.09); MAGT: 0.91(0.09); SHOT: 1.00(1.00) vs. 0.44(0.16). Colored shoes appear to draw children's attention away from body centered cues without explicit verbal communications. We propose that this cognitive adaptation enhanced the technical gesture by preventing the negative processes associated with action constraining when adopting an internal focus attention (perhaps by allowing the foot to adapt to surfaces and movements more naturally than conditions that promote a focus on the body movement). Consequently, this type of coloured footwear could be used during childhood to allow children to enhance the performance of basic football exercises through preventing action constraining and promoting intuitive (non-body centered) action knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2886772596,"This study investigates the preferences of small forest landowners regarding forest carbon credit programs while documenting characteristics of potentially successful frameworks. We designed hypothetical carbon credit programs with aggregated carbon offset projects and requirements of existing voluntary and compliance protocols in mind. We administered a mail survey to 992 forest landowners in Vermont’s Current Use Program utilizing best-worst choice, a novel preference elicitation technique, to elicit their preferences about these programs. We found that small forest landowners see revenue as the most important factor in a carbon credit program and the duration of the program as the least important factor. Landowners reported that shorter program duration, higher revenue, and lower withdrawal penalties positively impact their willingness to accept forest carbon credit programs. Notably, our study includes carbon credit program implementer as a key program attribute, allowing us to quantify landowners’ tradeoffs between non-profit, for-profit, and government organizations. Overall, we found that landowners significantly prefer working with a non-profit organization. Based on monetary estimates of willingness-to-accept compensation, our results suggest that aggregated forest carbon offset projects incorporating small forest landowners could be piloted successfully in Vermont by non-profit organizations while maintaining relatively strict guidelines of existing carbon offset protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2886665195,"Birch buds (Gemmae Betulae) are widely used in Russian and Chinese traditional medicine mainly as a diuretic and diaphoretic agent but also as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Despite the long history of therapeutic use of birch buds in folk medicine, the existing information on their chemical composition and pharmacological effects is insufficient. This circumstance warrants further study of the chemistry and pharmacology of birch buds. The present study was designed to investigate (a) the chemical composition of buds from two species of white birch and (b) the in vitro cytotoxic effect of extracts from these sources on selected tumour cells. Extracts from Betula pubescens Ehrh. and Betula pendula Roth. buds were obtained using three different methods: carbon dioxide supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), washing of exudate covering whole buds, and extraction of milled buds with diethyl ether. The chemical composition of extracts was investigated by GC-MS. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay, and cell proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine uptake in cancer cells and normal skin fibroblasts. The GC-MS investigation identified a total of 150 substances of different classes. The chemical composition of B. pubescens and B. pendula buds differed, with bud extracts from the former containing a relatively high quantity of sesquiterpenoids and flavonoids, while the main components of extracts from the latter were triterpenoids. The results of the biological assay indicated that birch bud extracts demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent and differential cytotoxicity. The highest cytotoxic activity demonstrated bud exudates and SFE extracts obtained from both Betula species. The rich chemical composition of birch buds suggests the possibility of a wider spectrum of biological activity than previously thought. Birch bud extracts could be a promising source of compounds with cytotoxic activity against various cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2887917115,"Background Recent evidence indicates that continuity models of maternity care result in improved clinical and psychosocial outcomes, but their causal mechanisms are poorly understood. The recent Lancet Series on Midwifery’s Quality Maternal and Newborn Care Framework describes five components of quality care and their associated characteristics. As an initial step in developing this Framework into an evaluation toolkit, we transformed its components and characteristics into a topic guide to assess stakeholder perceptions and experiences of care provided and received. The main purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of this process. Methods We conducted twelve focus groups in two Scottish health board areas with 13 pregnant women, 18 new mothers, 26 midwives and 12 obstetricians who had experience of a range of different models of maternity care. Transcripts were analysed using a six-phase approach of thematic analysis. We mapped the identified themes and sub-themes back to the Framework. Results The emerging themes and sub-themes demonstrated the feasibility of using the QMNC framework as a data collection tool, and as a lens for analysing the data. Of the four emerging themes, only Organisation Culture / Work Structure’ mapped directly to a single Framework component. The others—‘Relationships’; ‘Information and support’; and ‘Uncertainty’–mapped to between two and five components, illustrating the interconnectedness of the Framework’s components. Some negative sub-themes mirrored positive Framework characteristics of care. Some re-phrasing and re-ordering of the topic guides in later focus groups ensured we could cover all aspects of the Framework adequately. Conclusion Adapting the Quality Maternal and Newborn Care Framework enabled us to focus on aspects of care which worked well and which didn’t work well for these key stakeholders. Identifying ‘what works for whom and why’ in different models of care is a necessary step in reinforcing and replicating the most effective models of care."
https://openalex.org/W2886860215,"Recent literature has demonstrated that emergent administration of antibiotics is perhaps more critical than even emergent debridement. Most recent studies recommend patients receive antibiotics no later than 1 hour after injury to prevent infection. The objective of this study is to evaluate the time to antibiotic administration after patients with open fractures arrive to a trauma center depending on triaging team.A retrospective study at a level 1 Trauma center from January 2013 to March 2015 where 117 patients with open fractures were evaluated. Patients who presented with open fractures of the extremities or pelvis were considered. Subjects were identified using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Patients aged 18 and older were analyzed for Gustilo type, antibiotics administered in the emergency room (ER), presence of an antibiotic allergy, post-operative antibiotic regimen and number of debridements, among others. Additionally, whether a patient was triaged by ER doctors or trauma surgeons (and made a trauma activation) was evaluated. Outcome measurements included time to intravenous (IV) antibiotic administration and time to surgical debridement.Patients received IV cefazolin a median of 17 minutes after arrival. Eighty-five patients who were made trauma activations received cefazolin 14 minutes after arrival while 24 non-trauma patients received cefazolin 53 minutes after arrival (p = <0.0001). The median time to gentamicin administration for all patients was 180 minutes. Patients not upgraded to a trauma received gentamicin 263 minutes after arrival, while patients upgraded received gentamicin 176 minutes after arrival. There was no statistically significant difference between the timing to cefazolin or gentamicin based on Gustilo type.Overall, patients that arrive at our institution with open fractures receive IV cefazolin significantly faster when trauma surgeons evaluate the patient. Additionally, delays in gentamicin administration are demonstrated in both triaging groups. This is due to the fact that cefazolin is stocked in the hospital ER, while gentamicin is commonly not due to weight-based dosing requirements precluding a standard dose. Improvements can be made to antibiotic administration of non-trauma patients and those requiring gentamicin via improved education and awareness of open fractures."
https://openalex.org/W3037657163,"Purpose Advanced pancreatic cancer is a highly refractory disease almost always associated with survival of little more than a year. New interventions based on novel targets are needed. We aim to identify new genetic determinants of overall survival (OS) in patients after treatment with gemcitabine using genome-wide screens of germline DNA. We aim also to support these findings with in vitro functional analysis. Patients and methods Genome-wide screens of germline DNA in two independent cohorts of pancreatic cancer patients (from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 80303 and the Mayo Clinic) were used to select new genes associated with OS. The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) was selected, and the interactions of genetic variation in VDR with circulating vitamin D levels and gemcitabine treatment were evaluated. Functional effects of common VDR variants were also evaluated in experimental assays in human cell lines. Results The rs2853564 variant in VDR was associated with OS in patients from both the Mayo Clinic (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94, p = 0.0059) and CALGB 80303 (HR 0.74, 0.63–0.87, p = 0.0002). rs2853564 interacted with high pre-treatment levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D, a measure of endogenous vitamin D) (p = 0.0079 for interaction) and with gemcitabine treatment (p = 0.024 for interaction) to confer increased OS. rs2853564 increased transcriptional activity in luciferase assays and reduced the binding of the IRF4 transcription factor. Conclusion Our findings propose VDR as a novel determinant of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Common functional variation in this gene might interact with endogenous vitamin D and gemcitabine treatment to determine improved patient survival. These results support evidence for a modulatory role of the vitamin D pathway for the survival of advanced pancreatic cancer patients."

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of physical activity (PA), fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), body mass index (BMI), calcium, or combination of vitamin D supplement intake, smoking and alcohol drinking status on bone health assessed by calcaneus quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in a healthy adolescent population. The participants comprised of 920 male and female secondary school adolescents aged 15–17 years old. Quantitative ultrasound measurements of the left heel were performed using Lunar Achilles EX II, which included results of broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS), and a calculated stiffness index (SI). Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that—PA was positively associated with all three QUS indices in both genders; BMI was positively associated with SI and SOS in females; LM was positively associated with BUA in both genders; and FM was negatively associated with SI in females. These variables accounted for 32.1%, 21.2% and 29.4% of females’ SOS, BUA and SI variances (p<0.001), respectively and 23.6%, 15.4% and 17.2% of males’ SOS, BUA and SI variances (p<0.001), respectively. Promoting health benefits from physical activity could influence bone status and consequently improve PBM, which is a potent protective determinant against osteoporosis in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2886623048,"Background Hospitalisation for atherothrombotic disease (ATD) is expected to rise in coming decades. However, increasingly, associated comorbidities impose challenges in managing patients and deciding appropriate secondary prevention. We investigated the prevalence and pattern of multimorbidity (presence of two or more chronic conditions) in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Western Australian residents with ATDs. Methods and findings We used population-based de-identified linked administrative health data from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2014 to identify a cohort of patients aged 25–59 years admitted to Western Australian hospitals with a discharge diagnosis of ATD. The prevalence of common chronic diseases in these patients was estimated and the patterns of comorbidities and multimorbidities empirically explored using two different approaches: identification of the most commonly occurring pairs and triplets of comorbid diseases, and through latent class analysis (LCA). Half of the cohort had multimorbidity, although this was much higher in Aboriginal people (Aboriginal: 79.2% vs. non-Aboriginal: 39.3%). Only a quarter were without any documented comorbidities. Hypertension, diabetes, alcohol abuse disorders and acid peptic diseases were the leading comorbidities in the major comorbid combinations across both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cohorts. The LCA identified four and six distinct clinically meaningful classes of multimorbidity for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients, respectively. Out of the six groups in non-Aboriginal patients, four were similar to the groups identified in Aboriginal patients. The largest proportion of patients (33% in Aboriginal and 66% in non-Aboriginal) was assigned to the “minimally diseased” (or relatively healthy) group, with most patients having less than two conditions. Other groups showed variability in degree and pattern of multimorbidity. Conclusion Multimorbidity is common in ATD patients and the comorbidities tend to interact and cluster together. Physicians need to consider these in their clinical practice. Different treatment and secondary prevention strategies are likely to be useful for management in these cluster groups."

https://openalex.org/W2885971060,"Although microorganisms will preferentially allocate resources to synthesis of nitrogen (N)-acquiring enzymes when soil N availability is low according to the resource allocation model for extracellular enzyme synthesis, a robust link between microbial N-acquiring enzyme activity and soil N concentration has not been reported. To verify this link, we measured several indices of soil N availability and enzyme activity of four N-acquiring enzymes [N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAG), protease (PR), urease (UR), and L-asparaginase (LA)] and a carbon (C)-acquiring enzyme [β-D-glucosidase (BG)] in arable and forest soils. Although the ratios of NAG/BG and PR/BG were not significantly related with indices of soil N availability, ratios of LA/BG and UR/BG were strongly and negatively related with potentially mineralizable N estimated by aerobic incubation but not with pools of labile inorganic N and organic N. These results suggest that microorganisms might allocate their resources to LA and UR synthesis in response to N supply rate rather than the size of the easily available N pools. It was also suggested that the underlying mechanism for synthesis was different between these N-acquiring enzymes in soil microorganisms: microbial LA and UR were primarily synthesized to acquire N, whereas NAG and PR syntheses were regulated not only by N availability but also by other factors."
https://openalex.org/W2886729739,"Iron acquisition by bacteria is well studied, but iron export from bacteria is less understood. Herein, we identified dr1440 with a P-type ATPase motif as a potential exporter of iron from Deinococcus radiodurans, a bacterium known for its extreme resistance to radiation and oxidants. The DR1440 was located in cell membrane as demonstrated by fluorescence labelling analysis. Mutation of dr1440 resulted in cellular accumulation of iron ions, and expression level of dr1440 was up-regulated significantly under iron ion or hydrogen peroxide stress in the wild-type strain, implicating DR1440 as a potential iron efflux protein. The dr1440 mutant displayed higher sensitivity to iron ions and oxidative stresses including hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, and gamma-ray irradiation compared with the wild-type strain. The high amount of iron in the mutant strain resulted in severe protein carbonylation, suggesting that DR1440 might contribute to intracellular protein protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from ferrous ion-mediated Fenton-reaction. Mutations of S297A and C299A led to intracellular accumulation of iron, indicating that S297 and C299 might be important functional residues of DR1440. Thus, DR1440 is a potential iron efflux protein involved in iron homeostasis and oxidative stress-resistance of D. radiodurans."
https://openalex.org/W2887938355,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate patients’ attitudes towards hypertension treatment according to the chronic care model and to assess the implementation of hypertension clinical guidelines in family medicine. The cross-sectional study was carried out in two randomly selected primary health care centers (Bijeljina and Prijedor), respectively in Bosnia and Herzegovina, covering the period between March and April 2016. This study sample consists of 791 respondents with hypertension purposing to measure specific actions and quality of care for hypertensive patients. The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) was used. Treatment for the indicators of hypertension was assessed by analyzing patients' medical charts according to the recommendations of clinical guidelines. More than half of the evaluated indicators of treatment for hypertension were documented in medical charts of 84.07% patients. The average overall PACIC score was 4.18 (SD 0.59), being an average of the separate scores of 4.19 (SD 0.57) in men and 4.17 (SD 0.60) in women. Subscale means of PACIC were as follows: patient activation 4.33, delivery system design 4.36; goal setting 4.03; problem solving 4.51; follow-up and co-ordination 3.67. No statistically significant correlations in the overall score and subscale scores were found by demographic characteristics. Non-smokers had a significantly higher overall score compared to smokers (p = 0.001). As implementation of the guidelines became stronger, the reported PACIC scores rose. Continuing the education of patients in order to achieve better health care outcomes is imperative."
https://openalex.org/W2885243664,"Purpose To determine the effects of astigmatism on contrast sensitivity (CS). Methods Eighteen normal volunteers (30.5 ± 6.0 [mean ± SD] years) were recruited. After correcting each refractive error by spectacles, against-the-rule (ATR) or with-the-rule (WTR) astigmatism of +1.00, +2.00 and +3.00 D was intentionally produced in both eyes, and then binocular CS was measured. The cylindrical addition of different powers (+1.00–+3.00 D) was compensated with spherical lenses so that the spherical equivalent refraction became zero in each eye. Subsequently, the above cylindrical addition was monocularly induced, and binocular CS was measured again. The relation between CS and astigmatic power, axis, and monocular or binocular astigmatism was investigated. Results With binocular ATR and WTR astigmatism, increases in astigmatic power significantly correlated with decreases in the area under the log contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF). With monocular astigmatic defocus, astigmatic power addition did not affect AULCSF. With binocular astigmatic defocus of high-power (+2.00 and +3.00 D), ATR astigmatism deteriorated AULCSF more than WTR astigmatism. In a comparison between binocular and monocular astigmatic defocus, CS was significantly worse with binocular astigmatic defocus than with monocular astigmatic defocus at higher spatial frequencies regardless of astigmatic power. Conclusions Binocular astigmatic defocus deteriorates CS depending on the amount of astigmatic power. ATR astigmatism reduces CS more than WTR astigmatism dose. In addition, binocular astigmatic defocus affects CS more severely than monocular astigmatic defocus especially at high spatial frequencies."

This lymphoma comprises polymorphous lymphoma and large cell lymphomas subtypes, with the latter subtype showing a significantly poorer prognosis. It is unknown whether the genetic background differs between age groups and histopathological subtypes. To investigate the genetic basis, heterogeneity, and recurrently mutated genes in EBV+ DLBCL, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from 11 tissue samples of this lymphoma. Sequencing revealed that the most common substitution was the transition C>T/G>A. Genetic features—including the numbers of mutated genes in exonic region, single-nucleotide variants (SNV), and indels—did not significantly differ between age groups or histological subtypes. Matching with the COSMIC database revealed that the main mutational signature was signature 3, which is associated with failure of DNA double-strand break-repair by homologous recombination. Mutant-Allele Tumor Heterogeneity (MATH) scores showed that EBV+ DLBCL exhibited broad intratumor heterogeneity, and were positively correlated with Ann Arbor Stage and ≥2 extranodal lesion sites. We identified 57 selected recurrently mutated genes. The most commonly mutated five genes—LNP1 (11/11), PRSS3 (10/11), MUC3A (9/11), FADS6 (9/11), and TRAK1 (8/11)—were validated by Sanger sequencing. These mutated genes have not previously been identified. Overall, our present results demonstrate the tremendous genetic heterogeneity underlying EBV+ DLBCLs, and highlight the need for personalized therapeutic approaches to treating these patients."

In the current study, we tested whether PEG3 controls the expression of the oxytocin receptor gene. According to the results, PEG3 directly binds to a genomic region within the 3rd exon of Oxtr, which contains a DNA-binding motif for PEG3. In nursing female mice, removal of PEG3 resulted in the increased expression of Oxtr in mammary epithelial cells and also in the hypothalamus. This suggests a repressor role of PEG3 in the expression of Oxtr in these tissues. Overall, this study suggests that Peg3 may function as a direct transcriptional regulator for Oxtr expression that acts to moderate the milk letdown process."

In this work, we demonstrate the potential of roasted jackfruit seeds to substitute for cocoa powder in cappuccino formulations. Two different flours were produced from a hard variety jackfruit by drying or fermenting the seeds prior to roasting. Next, formulations were prepared with 50%, 75%, and 100% substitution of cocoa powder with jackfruit seed flours, totalizing seven with control formulation. The acceptance of cappuccinos by consumers (n = 126) and quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA®) were used to describe the preparations. Physicochemical properties were also evaluated. When 50% and 75% cocoa powder was replaced with dry jackfruit seed flour, there was no change in sensory acceptability or technological properties; however, it is possible to identify advantages tousing dry jackfruit seed flour, including moisture reduction and high wettability, solubility and sensory acceptation of the chocolate aroma. The principal component analysis of QDA explained90% variances; cluster analysis enabled the definition of four groups for six cappuccino preparations. In fact, dry jackfruit seed flour is an innovative cocoa powder substitute; it could be used in food preparations, consequently utilizing this tropical fruit waste by incorporating it as an ingredient in a common product of the human diet."
https://openalex.org/W2885078229,"Kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation is a central mechanism for regulation of cellular responses and phenotypes. While considerable information is available regarding the evolutionary relationships within the kinase family, as well as the evolutionary conservation of phosphorylation sites, each aspect of this partnership is typically considered in isolation, despite their clear functional relationship. Here, to offer a more holistic perspective on the evolution of protein phosphorylation, the conservation of protein phosphorylation sites is considered in the context of the conservation of the corresponding modifying kinases. Specifically, conservation of defined kinase-phosphorylation site pairings (KPSPs), as well as of each of the component parts (the kinase and the phosphorylation site), were examined across a range of species. As expected, greater evolutionary distance between species was generally associated with lower probability of KPSP conservation, and only a small fraction of KPSPs were maintained across all species, with the vast majority of KPSP losses due to the absence of the phosphorylation site. This supports a model in which a relatively stable kinome promotes the emergence of functional substrates from an evolutionarily malleable phosphoproteome."
https://openalex.org/W2885589359,"Introduction Electronic health care data offers the opportunity to study rare events, although detecting these events in large datasets remains difficult. We aimed to develop a model to identify leukemia patients with major hemorrhages within routinely recorded health records. Methods The model was developed using routinely recorded health records of a cohort of leukemia patients admitted to an academic hospital in the Netherlands between June 2011 and December 2015. Major hemorrhage was assessed by chart review. The model comprised CT-brain, hemoglobin drop, and transfusion need within 24 hours for which the best discriminating cut off values were taken. External validation was performed within a cohort of two other academic hospitals. Results The derivation cohort consisted of 255 patients, 10,638 hospitalization days, of which chart review was performed for 353 days. The incidence of major hemorrhage was 0.22 per 100 days in hospital. The model consisted of CT-brain (yes/no), hemoglobin drop of ≥0.8 g/dl and transfusion of ≥6 units. The C-statistic was 0.988 (CI 0.981–0.995). In the external validation cohort of 436 patients (19,188 days), the incidence of major hemorrhage was 0.46 per 100 hospitalization days and the C-statistic was 0.975 (CI 0.970–0.980). Presence of at least one indicator had a sensitivity of 100% (CI 95.8–100) and a specificity of 90.7% (CI 90.2–91.1). The number of days to screen to find one case decreased from 217.4 to 23.6. Interpretation A model based on information on CT-brain, hemoglobin drop and need of transfusions can accurately identify cases of major hemorrhage within routinely recorded health records."
https://openalex.org/W2886507079,"Raf1/c-Raf is a well-characterized serine/threonine-protein kinase that links Ras family members with the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. We have identified a novel splice isoform of human Raf1 that causes protein truncation and loss of the C-terminal kinase domain (Raf1-tr). We found that Raf1-tr has increased nuclear localization compared with full-length Raf1, and this finding was secondary to reduced binding of Raf1-tr to the cytoplasmic chaperone FK506 binding protein 5. We show that Raf1-tr has increased binding to DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which inhibits DNA-PK function and causes amplification of irradiation- and bleomycin-induced DNA damage. We found that the human colorectal cancer cell line, HCT-116, displayed reduced expression of Raf1-tr, and reintroduction of Raf1-tr sensitized the cells to bleomycin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified differential Raf1-tr expression in breast cancer cell lines and showed that breast cancer cells with increased Raf1-tr expression become sensitized to bleomycin-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel Raf1 isoform in humans that has a unique noncanonical role in regulating the double-stranded DNA damage response pathway through modulation of DNA-PK function.-Nixon, B. R., Sebag, S. C., Glennon, M. S., Hall, E. J., Kounlavong, E. S., Freeman, M. L., Becker, J. R.

https://openalex.org/W2886411990,"Succinate dehydrogenase subunit B and D (SDHB and SDHD) mutations represent the most frequent cause of hereditary pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). Although truncation of the succinate dehydrogenase complex is thought to be the disease causing mechanism in both disorders, SDHB and SDHD patients exihibit different phenotypes. These phenotypic differences are currently unexplained by molecular genetics. The aim of this study is to compare disease dynamics in these two conditions via a Markov chain model based on 4 clinically-defined steady states. Our model corroborates at the population level phenotypic observations in SDHB and SDHD carriers and suggests potential explanations associated with the probabilities of disease maintenance and regression. In SDHB-related syndrome, PPGL maintenance seems to be reduced compared to SDHD (p = 0.04 vs 0.95) due to higher probability of tumor cell regression in SDHB vs SDHD (p = 0.87 vs 0.00). However, when SDHB-tumors give rise to metastases, metastatic cells are able to thrive with decreased probability of regression compared with SDHD counterparts (p = 0.17 vs 0.89). By constrast, almost all SDHD patients develop PGL (mainly head and neck) that persist throughout their lifetime. However, compared to SDHB, maintenance of metastatic lesions seems to be less effective for SDHD (p = 0.83 vs 0.11). These findings align with data suggesting that SDHD-related PPGL require less genetic events for tumor initiation and maintenance compared to those related to SDHB, but fail to initiate biology that promotes metastatic spread and metastatic cell survival in host tissues. By contrast, the higher number of genetic abnormalities required for tumor initiation and maintenance in SDHB PPGL result in a lower penetrance of PGL, but when cells give rise to metastases they are assumed to be better adapted to sustain survival. These proposed differences in disease progression dynamics between SDHB and SDHD diseases provide new cues for future exploration of SDHx PPGL behavior, offering considerations for future specific therapeutic and prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2887217413,"An intravenous port, which differs from a central venous catheter, has an injection chamber at the end of the catheter. This structural difference causes the irrigation flow pattern to be quite different from that of the central venous catheter. Furthermore, the intraluminal volume differs due to the size of the injection chamber and implanted catheter length. Hence, the ideal recommended irrigation volume varies because of differences in intraluminal volume, however, the recommended irrigation volume is 10 ml and may be a cause for reported port malfunctions. This study investigates the best irrigation volume for an intravenous port by simulating the clinical scenario ex-vivo to access its usefulness.This study was composed of two tests. The irrigation volume test attempted to quantify the irrigation volume of an implanted port while the irrigation rate test attempted to simulate daily nursing practice in order to clarify the effect of irrigation flow. The human blood needed for the simulation was donated by volunteers and the total volume was 10 ml per test. The irrigation volume test was done by syringe pump with varying pre-set irrigation volume after the port and connected catheter were filled with volunteer blood. After irrigation with pre-set volume, the retained intraluminal solution was collected and quantified by Bradford assay in order to titrate the best irrigation volume. The irrigation rate test tried to simulate daily maintenance practice in different settings with the quantified irrigation volume as identified by the irrigation volume test. The retained intraluminal solution was collected and quantified by Bradford assay in order to confirm the efficacy of the quantified irrigation volume.In both SVC and IVC ports, we identified the twenty times the intravascular volume as sufficient for a complete wash out of the blood component in the irrigation volume test. The minimal irrigation volume for SVC and IVC port were 10 ml and 15.6 ml respectively. In irrigation rate test, the irrigation for SVC and IVC port was 10 and 20 ml, respectively, for the sake of preparation convenience. We not only identified the importance of preparation, i.e. irrigation of the extension line but also confirmed the efficacy of the recommended irrigation volume.The irrigation volume should be varied according to the intraluminal volume. Maintenance should be performed after the extension line has been irrigated. The recommended port irrigation volume for SVC and IVC route were 10 and 20 ml, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2887306174,"Magnitudes or quantities of the different dimensions that define a stimulus (e.g., space, speed or numerosity) influence the perceived duration of that stimulus, a phenomenon known as (temporal) interference effects. This complicates studying the neurobiological foundation of the perception of time, as any signatures of temporal processing are tainted by interfering dimensions. In earlier work, in which judgements on either time or numerosity were made while EEG was recorded, we used Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate, for each participant separately, the influence of temporal and numerical information on making duration or numerosity judgements. We found large individual differences in the estimated magnitudes, but ML-estimates allowed us to partial out interference effects. However, for such analyses, it is essential that estimates are meaningful and stable. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the reliability of the MLE procedure by comparing the interference magnitudes estimated in two sessions, spread a week apart. In addition to the standard paradigm, we also presented task variants in which the interfering dimension was manipulated, to assess which aspects of the numerosity dimension exert the largest influence on temporal processing. The results indicate that individual interference magnitudes are stable, both between sessions and over tasks. Further, the ML-estimates of the time-numerosity judgement tasks were predictive of performance in a standard temporal judgement task. Thus, how much temporal information participants use in time estimations tasks seems to be a stable trait that can be captured with the MLE procedure. ML-estimates are, however, not predictive of performance in other interference-tasks, here operationalized by a numerical Stroop task. Taken together, the MLE procedure is a reliable tool to quantify individual differences in magnitude interference effects and can therefore reliably inform the analysis of neuroimaging data when contrasts are needed between the accumulation of a temporal and an interfering dimension."
https://openalex.org/W2885718533,"Phototype has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, and it is yet unknown if it is related to other hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast cancer or whether this association could be considered causal.We examined the association between the phototype and breast and prostate cancers using a Mendelian randomization analysis. We studied 1,738 incident cases of breast cancer and another 817 cases of prostate cancer. To perform a Mendelian randomization analysis on the phototype-cancer relationship, a genetic pigmentation score was required that met the following criteria: (1) the genetic pigmentation score was associated with phototype in controls; (2) the genetic pigmentation score was not associated with confounders in the relationship between phototype and cancer, and (3) the genetic pigmentation score was associated with cancer only through its association with phototype. Once this genetic score is available, the association between genetic pigmentation score and cancer can be identified as the association between phototype and cancer.The association between the genetic pigmentation score and phototype in controls showed that a higher genetic pigmentation score was associated with fair skin, blond hair, blue eyes and the presence of freckles. Applying the Mendelian randomization analysis, we verified that there was no association between the genetic pigmentation score and cancers of the breast and prostate.Phototype is not associated with breast or prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2978200478,"This paper considers the DCSK system under jamming environment. We consider both fast and slow switching pulse jamming (PJ). We derive approximations of the system bit error rates (BERs) in analytic expressions containing only well-known special functions, from which we show that for both jamming cases increasing the spreading factor can enhance the BER. In addition, we reveal that under the fast switching PJ, the BER does not depend on the jamming duty cycle ρ when ρ ≤ 0.5, however when ρ > 0.5, increasing its value degrades the BER. Moreover, we find out that under the slow switching PJ, increasing ρ may either enhance or degrade the BER."
https://openalex.org/W2885925913,"The human face cues a wealth of social information, but the neural mechanisms that underpin social attributions from faces are not well known. In the current fMRI experiment, we used repetition suppression to test the hypothesis that populations of neurons in face perception and theory-of-mind neural networks would show sensitivity to faces that cue distinct trait judgments. Although faces were accurately discriminated based on associated traits, our results showed no evidence that face or theory-of-mind networks showed repetition suppression for face traits. Thus, we do not provide evidence for population coding models of face perception that include sensitivity to high and low trait features. Due to aspects of the experimental design, which bolstered statistical power and sensitivity, we have reasonable confidence that we could detect effects of a moderate size, should they exist. The null findings reported here, therefore, add value to models of neural organisation in social perception by showing instances where effects are absent or small. To test the generalisability of our findings, future work should test different types of trait judgment and different types of facial stimuli, in order to further probe the neurobiological bases of impression formation based on facial appearance."
