https://openalex.org/W2058167342,"A novel 1,3-β-glucanosyltransferase isolated from the cell wall of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> was recently characterized. This enzyme splits internally a 1,3-β-glucan molecule and transfers the newly generated reducing end to the non-reducing end of another 1,3-β-glucan molecule forming a 1,3-β linkage, resulting in the elongation of 1,3-β-glucan chains. The <i>GEL1</i> gene encoding this enzyme was cloned and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of Gel1p was homologous to several yeast protein families encoded by <i>GAS</i> of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>,<i>PHR</i> of <i>Candida albicans</i>, and <i>EPD</i> of<i>Candida maltosa</i>. Although the expression of these genes is required for correct morphogenesis in yeast, the biochemical function of the encoded proteins was unknown. The biochemical assays performed on purified recombinant Gas1p, Phr1p, and Phr2p showed that these proteins have a 1,3-β-glucanosyltransferase activity similar to that of Gel1p. Biochemical data and sequence analysis have shown that Gel1p is attached to the membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol in a similar manner as the yeast homologous proteins. The activity has been also detected in membrane preparations, showing that this 1,3-β-glucanosyltransferase is indeed active <i>in vivo</i>. Our results show that transglycosidases anchored to the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositols can play an active role in fungal cell wall synthesis."

MIAs enhanced prostaglandin E2 synthesis and increased levels of COX-2 protein and mRNA. Nuclear run-off assays revealed increased rates of COX-2 transcription after treatment with MIAs. Calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocked the induction of COX-2 by MIAs. The stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity by MIAs was inhibited by overexpressing dominant negative forms of Rho and Raf-1. MIAs stimulated ERK, JNK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK); pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK kinase and p38 MAPK blocked the induction of COX-2 by MIAs. Overexpressing dominant negative forms of ERK1 or p38 MAPK inhibited MIA-mediated activation of the COX-2 promoter. MIAs stimulated the binding of the activator protein-1 transcription factor complex to the cyclic AMP response element in the COX-2promoter. A dominant negative form of c-Jun inhibited the activation of the COX-2 promoter by MIAs. Additionally, cytochalasin D, an agent that inhibits actin polymerization, stimulatedCOX-2 transcription by the same signaling pathway as MIAs. Thus, microtubule- or actin-interfering agents stimulated MAPK signaling and activator protein-1 activity. This led, in turn, to induction of COX-2 gene expression via the cyclic AMP response element site in the COX-2 promoter.

With this in mind, it is reasonable to postulate that compounds that induce COX-2 could predispose to cancer or inflammation. Microtubule-interfering agents (MIAs) are widely used for the treatment of cancer. The anti-cancer properties of MIAs have been attributed in part to interference with microtubule assembly, impairment of mitosis, and changes in cytoskeleton (26.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence, however, that MIAs have multiple cellular effects. For example, MIAs stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and gene expression (27.Schmid-Alliana A. Menou L. Manie S. Schmid-Antomarchi H. Millet M-A. Giuriato S. Ferrua B. Rossi B. J.

Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31.Moos P.J. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Colchicine and vinblastine, two other MIAs, stimulate PGE2 production (32.Gemsa D. Kramer W. Brenner M. Till G. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 376-380PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Yeh C-K. Rodan G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that COX-2 is a downstream target of MIAs and possibly other compounds that affect the cytoskeleton. In this study, we show that MIAs stimulate the expression of theCOX-2 gene in human mammary epithelial cells. These effects were mediated via extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPKs. Possibly, MIA-mediated induction of COX-2 will decrease the efficacy of these compounds as anti-cancer agents or explain, in part, the toxicity of these drugs.

The 184B5/HER cell line has been described previously (34.Zhai Y-F. Beittenmiller H. Wang B. Gould M.N. Oakley C. Esselman W.J. Welsch C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2272-2278PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium-KBM mixed in a ratio of 1:1 (basal medium) containing epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), transferrin (10 μg/ml), gentamicin (5 μg/ml), and insulin (10 μg/ml) (growth medium). Cells were grown to 60% confluence, trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin-2 mm EDTA, and plated for experimental use. In all experiments, 184B5/HER cells were grown in basal medium for 24 h before treatment. Treatments with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or MIAs were always carried out in basal medium. 5 × 104cells/well were plated in 6-well dishes and grown to 60% confluence in growth medium. Levels of PGE2 released by the cells were measured by enzyme immunoassay (8.Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. DeVito B. Weksler B.B. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). Production of PGE2 was normalized to protein concentrations. Cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mmTris (pH 8.0), 1% Tween 20, 50 mm diethyldithiocarbamate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were sonicated for 20 s on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to sediment the particulate material. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (35.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets as detailed by Towbinet al. (37.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated with primary antisera. Secondary antibody to IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used. The blots were probed with the ECL Western blot detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell monolayers using an RNA isolation kit from Qiagen Inc. 10 μg of total cellular RNA per lane were electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to nylon-supported membranes. After baking, membranes were prehybridized overnight in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer (SSPE), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA and then hybridized for 12 h at 42 °C with radiolabeled cDNA probes for human COX-2cDNA and 18 S rRNA. After hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 20 min at room temperature in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, twice for 20 min in the same solution at 55 °C, and twice for 20 min in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Washed membranes were then subjected to autoradiography. COX-2 and 18 S rRNA probes were labeled with [32P]CTP by random priming. 2.5 × 105 cells were plated in four T150 dishes for each condition. Cells were grown in growth medium until approximately 60% confluent. Nuclei were isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen. For the transcription assay, nuclei (1.0 × 107) were thawed and incubated in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8), 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.3 m KCl) containing 100 μCi of uridine 5′-[32P]triphosphate and 1 mmunlabeled nucleotides. After 30 min, labeled nascent RNA transcripts were isolated. The human COX-2 and 18 S rRNA cDNAs were immobilized onto nitrocellulose and prehybridized overnight in hybridization buffer. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24 h using equal cpm/ml labeled nascent RNA transcripts for each treatment group. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC (buffer for 1 h at 55 °C and then treated with 10 mg/ml RNase A in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min, dried, and autoradiographed.

A c-Jun DN expression vector was a gift of Dr. Tom Curran (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). pSV-βgal was obtained from Promega Corp. CRE-decoy and control oligonucleotides were phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Their sequences were as follows: 24-mer CRE palindrome, 5′-TGACGTCATGACGTCATGACGTCA-3′; 24-mer CRE mismatch control, 5′-TGTGGTCATGTGGTCATGTGGTCA-3′; and 24-mer mutant-sequence palindrome, 5′-CTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG-3′. In addition, the following oligonucleotides containing the CRE of theCOX-2 promoter were synthesized: 5′-AAACAGTCATTTCGTCACATGGGCTTG-3′ (sense), 5′-CAAGCCCATGTGACGAAATGACTGTTT-3′ (antisense). These oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). 184B5/HER cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well dishes and grown to 50–60% confluence. For each well, 2 μg of plasmid DNA were introduced into cells using 8 μg of LipofectAMINE as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 7 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with basal medium. The activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured in cellular extract as described previously (38.Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1081-1085PubMed Google Scholar). Comparisons between groups were made by the Student's t test. A difference between groups ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. The possibility that MIAs could stimulate PG synthesis was investigated in 184B5/HER human mammary epithelial cells. This HER-2/neu-overexpressing mammary epithelial cell line was used because MIAs such as taxol are used to treat women with HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer. The data in Fig.1 show that taxol, vinblastine, and colchicine caused dose-dependent increases in PGE2 production. Nocodazole, vincristine, and 2-methoxyestradiol also stimulated PG synthesis (data not shown). To determine whether these changes in PGE2 synthesis were related to differences in amounts of COX-2, Western blotting of cell lysate protein was carried out. Fig. 2shows that multiple MIAs including taxol, colchicine, and vincristine induced COX-2 protein. In contrast, COX-2 was not induced by 10-deacetylbaccatin III and β-lumicolchicine, structural analogues of taxol and colchicine that do not interfere with microtubules (data not shown). Because of evidence (39.Aizu-Yokata E. Ichinoseki K. Sato Y. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1875-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that estrogen and its derivatives interfere with microtubules, the effects of 17β-estradiol and 2-methoxyestradiol were determined. Treatment with 17β-estradiol or 2-methoxyestradiol induced COX-2 protein (Figs. 2, D andE). COX-2 was up-regulated at concentrations as low as 25 nm 2-methoxyestradiol (Fig. 2 E). The extent of MIA-mediated induction of COX-2 was comparable with that observed following treatment with PMA (data not shown).Figure 2COX-2 protein is induced by MIAs or cytochalasin D. Cells were treated with MIAs or cytochalasin D for 4.5 h. Cellular lysate protein (25 μg/lane) was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with antibody specific for COX-2. A, lysate protein was from cells treated with vehicle (lane 1) or taxol (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10 μm; lanes 2–6). B, lysate protein was from cells treated with vehicle (lane 1) or colchicine (1, 5, 10 μm; lanes 2–4).C, lysate protein was from cells treated with vehicle (lane 1) or vincristine (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 μm;lanes 2–5). D, lysate protein was from cells treated with vehicle (lane 1) or 17-β-estradiol (0.5, 1, 5, 10 μm; lanes 2–5). E, lysate protein was from cells treated with vehicle (lane 1) or 2-methoxyestradiol (0.025, 0.050, 0.1, 1, 5 μm;lanes 2–6). F, lysate protein was from cells treated with vehicle (lane 1) or cytochalasin D (1, 5, 10 μm; lanes 2–4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further elucidate the mechanism responsible for MIA-mediated induction of COX-2, we determined steady-state levels of COX-2 mRNA by Northern blotting (Fig. 3). Treatment with MIAs markedly increased amounts of COX-2 mRNA. Nuclear run-offs were performed to determine if MIAs stimulatedCOX-2 transcription. As shown in Fig.4, higher rates of synthesis of nascent COX-2 mRNA were detected after treatment with MIAs (taxol, colchicine).Figure 4COX-2 transcription is stimulated by MIAs and cytochalasin D. Cells were treated with vehicle (lane 1) or 10 μm taxol (lane 2), cytochalasin D (lane 3), or colchicine (lane 4) for 2 h. Nuclear run-offs were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The COX-2 and 18 S rRNA cDNAs were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized with labeled nascent RNA transcripts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rho is important for regulating both the cytoskeleton and COX-2. Hence, we determined whether a dominant negative form of Rho blocked MIA-mediated stimulation ofCOX-2 promoter activity. Taxol-mediated induction ofCOX-2 promoter activity was blocked by DN Rho (Fig.5). Similar effects were observed with other MIAs (data not shown). By contrast, DN Ras did not inhibit MIA-mediated stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity (data not shown). Rho can activate protein kinase C, a known regulator of COX-2 transcription (40.Chang J.H. Pratt J.C. Sawasdikosol S. Kapeller R. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4986-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, could block MIA-mediated induction of COX-2. Calphostin C inhibited the induction of COX-2 protein by taxol (Fig. 6 A) and colchicine (Fig. 6 B).Figure 6Induction of COX-2 by MIAs is mediated by protein kinase C and Raf-1. A, cells were treated with vehicle (lane 1), 10 μm taxol (lane 2), 10 μm taxol plus 1 μm calphostin C (lane 3), or 10 μm taxol plus 2 μm calphostin C (lane 4) for 4.5 h.B, cells were treated with vehicle (lane 1), 10 μm colchicine (lane 2), 10 μmcolchicine plus 1 μm calphostin C (lane 3), or 10 μm colchicine plus 2 μm calphostin C (lane 4). In panels A and B, cellular lysate protein (25 μg/lane) was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with antibody specific for COX-2. C, cells were transfected with 0.9 μg of a humanCOX-2 promoter construct ligated to luciferase (−327/+59) and 0.2 μg of pSVβgal.

To determine the role of Raf-1 in mediating the effects of MIAs on COX-2, transient transfections were performed. As shown in Fig. 6 C, MIA-mediated stimulation ofCOX-2 promoter activity was blocked by kinase-deficient Raf-1. Additionally, MIAs have been reported to induce MAPK activity. Treatment with MIAs activated ERK1/2, p38, and JNK MAPKs (Fig.7). Subsequently, experiments were done to demonstrate that MIA-mediated increases in MAPK activity were linked to the induction of COX-2. In the first experiment, we utilized PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase activity that prevents activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (42.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.T. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). PD 98059 inhibited the induction of COX-2 by MIAs (Fig. 8). Similarly, SB 202190, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK activity (43.Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), blocked MIA-mediated induction of COX-2 protein (Fig. 8). To further investigate the importance of MAPKs in mediating the effects of MIAs, a series of transient transfections was performed (Fig. 8 C). The induction of COX-2 promoter activity by taxol was blocked by transiently overexpressing dominant negatives for ERK1 or p38 MAPK. Similar results were obtained with colchicine (data not shown).Figure 8ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs are important for MIA-mediated induction of COX-2.

B, lysate protein was from cells treated with vehicle (lanes 1 and6), colchicine (1 μm, lanes 2 and7), colchicine (1 μm) with PD 98059 (10, 20, 30 μm, lanes 3–5), or colchicine (1 μm) with SB 202190 (1, 2.5, 5, 10 μm,lanes 8–11) for 4.5 h. Lane 12 represents an ovine Cox-2 standard. Cellular lysate protein (25 μg/lane) was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with an antibody specific for COX-2.C, cells were transfected with 0.9 μg of a humanCOX-2 promoter construct ligated to luciferase (−327/+59) and 0.2 μg of pSVβgal.

Treatment with MIAs (10 μm) led to about a 3-fold increase inCOX-2 promoter (−1432/+59) activity. We next attempted to define the region of the COX-2 promoter that responded to MIAs. This was accomplished using a series of COX-2 promoter deletion constructs. As shown in Fig. 9 B, basalCOX-2 promoter activity was highest when the −1432/+59 promoter construct was used. As the COX-2 promoter was shortened, lower basal activities were detected. Thus, the −52/+59COX-2 promoter construct was about 30% as active as the full-length −1432/+59 COX-2 promoter construct. Treatment with MIAs markedly induced COX-2 promoter activity with all promoter-deletion constructs except the −52/+59 promoter construct. A CRE is present between nucleotides −59 and −53, suggesting that this element was responsible for mediating the effects of MIAs. To test this idea, transient transfections were performed using COX-2promoter constructs in which specific enhancer elements including the CRE were mutagenized. As shown in Fig. 9 C, mutagenizing the CRE site had multiple effects including a decrease in basal promoter activity and a loss of responsiveness to MIAs. By contrast, mutagenizing the NFκB and NF-IL-6 sites had little effect onCOX-2 promoter activity. To confirm the importance of the CRE for mediating the induction of COX-2 by MIAs, a separate series of transient transfections were performed. We examined the effects of a CRE-decoy oligonucleotide on MIA-mediated stimulation ofCOX-2 promoter activity. The CRE-decoy oligonucleotide effectively inhibited taxol-mediated activation of the COX-2promoter (Fig. 10 A)."
https://openalex.org/W2149511417,"Exposure of endothelial and many other cell types to tumor necrosis factor α generates both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals. The anti-apoptotic pathway leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB that regulates the expression of genes such as <i>A20</i> or members of the <i>IAP</i> gene family that protect cells from tumor necrosis factor α-mediated apoptosis. In turn, some anti-apoptotic genes have been shown to modulate NF-κB activity. Here we demonstrate that XIAP, a NF-κB-dependent member of the <i>IAP</i> gene family, is a strong stimulator of NF-κB. Expression of XIAP leads to increased nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB via a novel signaling pathway that involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase TAK1. We show that TAK1 physically interacts with NIK and with IKK2, and both XIAP or active TAK1 can stimulate IKK2 kinase activity. Thus, XIAP may be part of a system of regulatory loops that balance a cell's response to environmental stimuli."

This adhesion pathway is utilized in the extravasation of activated T cells from the blood into sites of inflammation and therefore influences patterns of lymphocyte homing and inflammation. Hyaluronan is a glycosaminoglycan found in the extracellular matrix and is involved in a number of biological processes. We have shown that the expression of hyaluronan on the surface of endothelial cells is inducible by proinflammatory cytokines. However, the manner through which hyaluronan is anchored to the endothelial cell surface so that it can resist shear forces and the mechanism of the regulation of the level of hyaluronan on the cell surface has not been investigated. In order to characterize potential hyaluronan receptors on endothelial cells, we performed analyses of cell surface staining by flow cytometry on intact endothelial cells and ligand blotting assays using membrane fractions. Hyaluronan binding activity was detected as a major species corresponding to the size of CD44, and this was confirmed to be the same by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Moreover, alterations in the surface level of hyaluronan after tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation is regulated primarily by changes in the cell surface levels of the hyaluronan-binding form of CD44. In laminar flow assays, lymphoid cells specifically roll on hyaluronan anchored by purified CD44 coated on glass tubes, indicating that the avidity of the endothelial CD44/hyaluronan interaction is sufficient to support rolling adhesions under conditions mimicking physiologic shear forces. Together these studies show that CD44 serves to anchor hyaluronan on endothelial cell surfaces, that activation of CD44 is a major regulator of endothelial surface hyaluronan expression, and that the non-covalent interaction between CD44 and hyaluronan is sufficient to provide resistance to shear under physiologic conditions and thereby support the initial steps of lymphocyte extravasation.

As a prominent ubiquitously expressed extracellular matrix component, HA can be produced by a wide variety of cell types and tissues and is most prevalent in soft connective tissues. HA has been suggested to play a key role in several biological processes including embryonic development (1.Toole B.P. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), extracellular matrix organization and turnover (2.Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.

It is generally thought to exert many of these functions by establishing a provisional matrix for supporting cellular migration and adherence (9.Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. CIBA Found. Symp. 1986; 124: 9-29PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, studies have demonstrated that HA may function as a cellular signaling molecule under certain circumstances (10.Bourguignon L.Y. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Hall C.L. Wang C. Lange L.A. Turley E.A. J.

Although a member of the family of glycosaminoglycans, HA is distinct from other members in that it is not found covalently linked to a peptide core (2.Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). This is also in marked contrast to other carbohydrate ligands participating in extravasation, such as selectin ligands, which are generally glycoproteins anchored by transmembrane domains (15.Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In further contradistinction to other glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans, HA is unique in its mode of synthesis. Rather than being confined to the Golgi apparatus or post-Golgi compartment, the assembly of HA by HA synthase is located at the plasma membrane where HA is synthesized and polymers are directly extruded into the extracellular space (16.Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 17.Prehm P. Biochem.

Although its extracellular organization and disposition in a number of solid tissue microenvironments has been examined, HA on endothelium at the interface with the bloodstream has not been extensively studied. The recognition of endothelial cells by leukocytes and their subsequent extravasation through the blood vessel wall are based on a multistep pathway of sequential receptor engagement, in which a variety of molecular ligands participate (19.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 20.Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar, 21.Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). We have described a novel primary (rolling) interaction between T cells and endothelial cells that is similar under laminar flow conditions to that mediated by selectins and also has as its basis a distinct protein-carbohydrate ligand interaction, namely that between the cartilage link protein family member CD44, a broadly distributed complex multifunctional family of cell surface glycoproteins (22.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), and its principal ligand HA (23.DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Picker L.J. Siegelman M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). One well known consequence of antigen stimulation on T cells is increased surface levels of CD44 (22.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 24.McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Davis M.M.

However, elevated levels of CD44 do not necessarily correlate with increased HA binding, and thus the ability of CD44 to bind HA is not constitutive; rather, CD44 requires some form of structural alteration to engage this ligand (22.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar,26.Katoh S. Zheng Z. Oritani K. Shimozato T. Kincade P.W. J. Exp.

Med. 1995; 182: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which CD44 is altered to bind HA remains to be completely elucidated, evidence has accumulated that T cell stimulation of normal lymphocytes in vitro or in vivo via signaling through the T cell receptor induces the activated form of CD44 and attendant rolling interactions on HA substrate (22.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 25.DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. J.

These observations have established the HA-binding form of CD44 as an early activation marker on T cells after T cell receptor stimulation and support a role for this interaction during the course of an immune response. In particular, CD44/HA interactions have been shown to be required for extravasation of superantigen-stimulated T cells into an inflamed site in a mouse model (28.DeGrendele H.D. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. Science. 1997; 278: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). CD44 has been prominently associated with human arthritis and with a model of collagen-induced murine arthritis (29.Haynes B.F. Hale L.P. Patton K.L. Martin M.E. McCallum R.M. Arthritis & Rheum. 1991; 34: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30.Estess P. DeGrendele H.C. Pascual V. Siegelman M.H. J. Clin.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). CD44 interactions with HA are also thought to be important in allogeneic graft rejection (34.Knoflach A. Azuma H. Magee C. Denton M. Murphy B. Iyengar A. Buelow R. Sayegh M.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Knoflach A. Magee C. Denton M.D. Kim K.S. Buelow R. Hancock W.W. Sayegh M.H. Transplantation. 1999; 67: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on our observations, we have postulated that CD44 on lymphocytes interacts with HA on endothelium and participates in the well known preferential homing of activated lymphocytes to tertiary sites of inflammation. In support of this model, circulating lymphocytes bearing activated CD44 have been shown to be elevated during autoimmune exacerbations in both arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in humans (30.Estess P. DeGrendele H.C. Pascual V. Siegelman M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A clear implication of this model is that regulation of HA on vascular endothelium in response to local pathophysiologic conditions should create a receptive site for leukocyte recruitment and therefore represents an important control point for extravasation. It has been reported that hyaluronan is found both in vitro and in vivo on endothelial cells (23.DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Picker L.J. Siegelman M.H. J. Exp.

Res. 1994; 286: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addressing the potential regulation of HA on endothelial cells, we previously demonstrated that its expression on cultured endothelial cell lines and primary endothelial cultures is inducible by the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, interleukin-1β, interleukin-15, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (42.Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 43.Estess P.E. Nandi A. Siegelman M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, this inducibility appeared strikingly restricted to endothelial cells derived from microvascular but not large vessel sources, consistent with a role in the vessels where the majority of leukocyte trafficking occurs. The elevated HA levels induced by cytokines further resulted in increased adhesive interactions in both non-static shear and laminar flow adhesion assays. However, the changes in surface HA levels did not appear dependent either on described HA synthetic or degradative enzymes, suggesting other mechanisms for such regulation. These data added to the selectin and immunoglobulin gene families a new inducible endothelial adhesive molecule, hyaluronan, and helped to further our understanding of the potential physiologic roles of the CD44/HA interaction. However, the manner by which HA is anchored to the endothelial surface and the requirements for cell surface retention under conditions of physiologic shear forces has remained unclear. A number of proteins have been characterized that can bind HA and anchor it in the tissues and on cell surfaces. The proteoglycans aggrecan and link protein are major binders of HA in cartilage and soft tissues (44.Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). A specialized receptor for HA internalization is found on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (45.Eriksson S. Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Pertoft H. Smedsrod B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 144: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 46.Raja R.H. McGary C.T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16661-16668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other cell surface HA receptors include the widely distributed CD44 molecule (22.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), and an unrelated protein, receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) (47.Hall C.L. Turley E.A. J. Neurooncol. 1995; 26: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In these studies we show that CD44 is the predominant cell surface molecule on endothelial surfaces responsible for HA binding and that it is the regulation of the activated form of CD44 that largely determines the level of surface HA expression. Furthermore, using isolated CD44 bound to HA, we establish that this interaction is sufficient to resist hemodynamic drag forces and support rolling adhesions of lymphocytes under physiologic laminar flow conditions.

Phycoerythrin and biotin-conjugated IM7, a rat anti-mouse CD44 that cross-reacts with human and that does not displace bound HA (IgG2b, κ) (55.Trowbridge I.S. Lesley J. Schulte R. Hyman R. Trotter J. Immunogenetics. 1982; 15: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-fluorescein antibody was obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin was obtained from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). BW5147 murine T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 100 mm sodium pyruvate, 200 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. The murine lymph node endothelial cell line SVEC4-10 (56.O'Connell K.A. Edidin M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 521-525PubMed Google Scholar) was grown and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 200 mm l-glutamine. For TNFα stimulation, cell monolayers were grown to 60–80% confluence, washed with DMEM, and stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 4 h or as indicated in time course analyses. Single cell suspensions were made by incubation of monolayers in Versene (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 10 min for staining or immunoprecipitation. For Fl-HA binding experiments, the cells were additionally treated with 20 units/ml hyaluronidase for 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, trypsin was used at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for the indicated times at 37 °C. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cultures of human dermal microvascular endothelium (HDMEC) were obtained from the Skin Center at Emory University (S. W. Caughman, Atlanta, GA) and maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 20% human serum, 2.5 μg/ml cAMP, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 5 ng/ml hydrocortisone. After reaching initial confluence, cells were passaged and used directly or after one additional passage to fresh plates. Cells were stimulated with human TNFα at 10 ng/ml for 4 h. 5 × 105 cells were stained with Fl-HA, anti-CD44-PE (IM7), anti-H-2, or bPG-biotin in 100 μl of PBS, 5% FCS for 30 min on ice and then washed with 1 ml of PBS containing 5% FCS. Cells were incubated with Fl-HA for 10 min prior to addition of IM7-PE. Fluorochrome-labeled streptavidin or secondary antibody was added for 20 min as indicated, and cells were again washed before analysis. For blocking of Fl-HA staining, unlabeled blocking anti-CD44 antibody (KM81 or 515) was incubated with cells for 10 min prior to staining with Fl-HA. Data were collected using FACScanTM analytical instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using CellQuestTM software. SVEC4-10 cells were grown in 80-mm tissue culture dishes to 60–80% confluence in DMEM containing 10% FCS. The monolayer was washed with DMEM and stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 4 h. The monolayer was again washed with DMEM, treated with 20 units/ml hyaluronidase for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with chilled PBS, and cells scraped off the dish in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). BW5147 cells were grown in suspension, washed twice with chilled PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer. The cell lysates were sonicated briefly, and membranes were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g (57.Visweswariah S.S. Ramachandran V. Ramamohan S. Das G. Ramachandran J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Pellets were resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, after which proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ligand blotting was performed based on described methods (58.Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Ritchie D. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with Fl-HA/anti-fluorescein-biotin or IM-7-biotin. Fl-HA was used 1:100 diluted in a 50% Blocking solution (ECL kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and was incubated 4 h at ambient temperature. Blots were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl for 1 h three times. Biotinylated anti-fluorescein or anti-CD44 antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed as above. Blots were developed with a chemiluminescence kit using streptavidin-POD according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). SVEC4-10 membrane lysates were prepared as described above for Western blots. The pellet was resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Fl-HA/anti-fluorescein-biotin or IM7-biotin was added to the above mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on a rocking platform. Complexes were precipitated using streptavidin-Sepharose (Sigma). Bound material was eluted by lowering the pH to 3.0 with 100 mm glycine HCl, neutralized with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, precipitated material was probed with IM7-biotin and developed with chemiluminescence using streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase. SVEC4-10 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 4 h. Total RNA was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reverse transcriptase reaction and PCR amplification were performed as described (59.Saiki R.K. Bugawan T.L. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Nature. 1986; 324: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). CD44 forward primer sequence was 5′-GCACACCTACCTTCCTAC-3′ and reverse primer sequence was 5′-CTGGAATCTGAGGTCTCCTC-3′. β-Actin primers were used as control. PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Glass capillary tubes (1.41 mm inner diameter; Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) were coated with 1% BSA, soluble recombinant human CD44-Ig (350 μg/ml), control human IgG (350 μg/ml), soluble HA (1 mg/ml), or protein followed by sHA. To coat tubes with two substrates, tubes were first incubated with BSA, sCD44-Ig, or human IgG for 16 h at 4 °C and then further incubated with 1 mg/ml HA solution for 3 h at room temperature. sHA binding to sCD44-Ig-coated tubes was blocked by preincubation with HA-blocking anti-CD44 antibody prior to the addition of sHA to the tubes. All tubes were additionally blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. BW5147 murine T cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium at a concentration of 2 × 106/ml. The medium and the flow chamber were equilibrated to 37 °C. Medium containing BW5147 cells was continuously pulled through the capillary tube by means of a Harvard syringe pump at flow rates of between 0.5 and 5 ml/min, corresponding to shear stresses of 0.3–3.0 dynes/cm2 (60.Berg E.L. Robinson M.K. Warnock R.A. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Interaction of the BW5147 cells with the wall of the capillary tubes (rolling) was monitored by the use of a Nikon Diaphot-TMD inverted phase contrast microscope connected to a video camera and recorder. Rolling numbers were determined by counting the number of cells/min crossing a fixed position perpendicular to the flow of cells on the video screen. Cell surface HA is often found non-covalently associated with membrane proteins, of which CD44 would be a prime candidate (22.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). To characterize the nature of the association of HA with the endothelial surface, the peripheral lymph node-derived microvascular EC line SVEC4-10 was used after TNFα activation to induce high HA expression as described (42.Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cells were then stained with the HA-binding proteoglycan bPG to assess HA surface levels. To measure other surface markers, cells were stained simultaneously with anti-CD44 or anti-H-2 and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis before and after various intervals of treatment with trypsin. The ability of bPG to bind to this cell line was completely trypsin-sensitive (Fig.1). Diminution of staining was evident within 5 min of trypsin treatment, and staining was 50% reduced by 10 min and completely ablated by 30 min. Staining with anti-CD44 IM7-PE diminished in parallel with bPG staining, correlating the trypsin sensitivity of HA expression with that of CD44, suggestive that this may be the HA-anchoring protein. In contrast, staining with anti-H-2 antibody was unaffected by trypsin treatment, consistent with the trypsin insensitivity of the extracellular portion of mouse class I MHC molecules (61.Bernard O. Scheid M.P. Ripoche M.A. Bennett D. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, HA is attached to endothelial surfaces through a trypsin-sensitive moiety that correlates with the cell surface levels of CD44. To establish further the nature of the EC surface HA-binding protein, we used a strategy of removing surface HA by digestion wi"

Here we have investigated the structural requirements for the interaction of the FYVE finger of the early endosome antigen EEA1 with PtdIns(3)P and early endosomes. The binding of the FYVE finger to PtdIns(3)P is Zn2+-dependent, and Zn2+could not be replaced by any other bivalent cations tested. By surface plasmon resonance, the wild-type FYVE finger was found to bind to PtdIns(3)P with an apparent KD of about 50 nm and a 1:1 stoichiometry. Mutagenesis of cysteines involved in Zn2+ coordination, basic residues thought to be directly involved in ligand binding and other conserved residues, resulted in a 6- to >100-fold decreased affinity for PtdIns(3)P. A mutation in the putative PtdIns(3)P-binding pocket, R1375A, may prove particularly informative, because it led to a strongly decreased affinity for PtdIns(3)P without affecting the FYVE three-dimensional structure, as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Whereas the C terminus of EEA1 localizes to early endosomes when expressed in mammalian cells, all the FYVE mutants with reduced affinity for PtdIns(3)P were found to be largely cytosolic. Furthermore, whereas expression of the wild-type EEA1 C terminus interferes with early endosome morphology, the point mutants were without detectable effect. These results support recently proposed models for the ligand binding of the FYVE domain and indicate that PtdIns(3)P binding is crucial for the localization and function of EEA1.

The determination of the crystal structure of the ligand-free FYVE domain of the yeast vacuolar sorting protein Vps27p at high resolution has enabled the modeling of the FYVE-PtdIns (3Leevers S.J.

According to this model, the basic residues present in the β1 strand (Fig. 1) together with a basic residue in the β4 strand form a basic pocket that may bind the 3-phosphate group, whereas the 1-phosphate may form a salt bridge with a positive side chain preceding the β1 strand. An alternative model has been proposed upon the solution of the x-ray structure of the FYVE domain of Hrs (the putative mammalian homologue of Vps27p) complexed to citrate (17Mao Y. Nickitenko A.

Even though the structure of Hrs is highly similar to that of Vps27p, the proposed model for PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin.

Twenty of the residues of EEA1 FYVE display large chemical shift changes in the presence of a soluble PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin.

Six basic residues (Lys1348, Arg1370, Arg1371, His1373, Arg1375, and Arg1400) are particularly sensitive and have been proposed to interact directly with the phosphates of PtdIns (3Leevers S.J.

Although the crystal structures of the FYVE domains of Vps27p and Hrs and the NMR analysis of EEA1 FYVE have yielded invaluable structural information, the role of individual residues has not been studied in direct lipid binding assays or in intact mammalian cells. In this study we have mutated conserved residues of EEA1 FYVE to serine or alanine and studied the effects of the mutations with respect to PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B.

The sequences of the various mutants were confirmed by sequencing. All numbering of mutant constructs refers to the published sequence of EEA1 (18Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H.

For expression as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) inEscherichia coli, BL-21 (DE3) were transformed with the respective pGEX plasmids, and protein expression and purification on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was done according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Finally, the fusion proteins were dialyzed overnight in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 60 mmNaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2. The fluorescence measurements (20Frech M. Andjelkovic M. Ingley E. Reddy K.K.

The proteins were dissolved at 0.2 μm in 20 mmTris, 60 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, at room temperature in a volume of 1 ml. The solubilized proteins were excited at 290 nm, and the fluorescence was recorded from 300 to 400 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm at both excitation and emission. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine were from Sigma. [3H]Phosphatidylcholine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, whereas dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, dibutanoyl phosphoinositides, and inositol (1,3)bisphosphate were from Echelon (Salt Lake City, UT). The binding assays of liposomes (0.35 mg ml−1) containing 63% phosphatidyl choline, 20% phosphatidyl serine, 15% phosphatidyl ethanolamine, 2% PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B.

In some cases, the beads were treated with 500 μm EDTA for 30 min at room temperature and then washed, and various bivalent cations (at 1 mm in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol) were added. The beads were then washed before the addition of the liposomes. The kinetics of association and dissociation of the wild type and point mutant EEA1 FYVE domains with PtdIns (3Leevers S.J.

A L1 sensorchip (Biacore) was coated with lipid by three subsequent injections of 80-μl liposomes at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Injections of the proteins (20 μl) were carried out at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in a buffer containing 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 60 mm NaCl. The protein concentrations tested were 0.27–1.35 μm for the wild-type GST·EEA11306–1411, 0.06–5 μm for the wild-type maltose-binding protein·EEA11257–1411, and 0.4–27 μm for the point mutants depending on their purification yield and PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P binding. No binding with GST alone was detected for concentrations up to 64 μm. The lipid monolayer was regenerated after each injection with 10 mmNaOH. The sensorgrams were analyzed using the BiaEvaluation 3.0 software supplied with the instrument. All sensorgrams gave a reasonably good fit with a simple bimolecular interaction (Langmuir) model (χ2 lower than 2 units and random scatter of residuals). All KD estimations were based on at least three independent experiments. The lipid layer could be removed by washing the surface with 10 μl of 20 mm CHAPS, and a fresh liposome preparation could subsequently be coated onto the same L1 sensorchip. The EEA1 constructs containing FYVE mutations were cloned behind a Myc epitope under the T7 promoter of the plasmid pGEM-Myc3 (21Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and were expressed in BHK-21 cells using the modified Ankara T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus system and lipofection with N-[1-(2, 3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N, N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as described (22Stenmark H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,23Sutter G. Ohlmann M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed 6 h after transfection. BHK cells grown on coverslips were transiently transfected, fixed, and stained for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (21Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged EEA1 wild type and mutants were visualized with 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibodies (24Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), and Rab5Q79L (25Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) was detected using affinity purified rabbit anti-Rab5a antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by rhodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse or rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PE). Coverslips were examined with a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope equipped with a Kr/Ar laser and a 100x/1.3 PL Neofluar oil objective. We have previously measured that the FYVE finger binds two zinc ions (4Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and this has been confirmed by the determination of the crystal structure (16Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To test if zinc removal causes an irreversible effect on EEA1 FYVE function, we treated a fusion protein between GST and EEA11307–1411 with EDTA in order to remove bound Zn2+. This caused a significant but not complete loss of PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P binding (5Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), as measured as the ability of the immobilized protein to bind 3H-labeled liposomes containing PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P (Fig. 2). When the excess EDTA was removed and Zn2+ was added back, the ability of the protein to bind PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P was partially recovered, in agreement with results obtained with NMR (19Kutateladze T.G. Ogburn K.D. Watson W.T. de Beer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Other bivalent cations could not replace Zn2+ in this respect, demonstrating that Zn2+is the preferred metal ligand for the FYVE domain (Fig. 2). To study the roles of individual residues we expressed GST- or Myc epitope-tagged EEA11307–1411 containing mutations (to alanine or serine) of 14 of the most conserved residues (Fig. 1). Whereas all the GST fusion proteins were expressed at a high level in E. coli(not shown), two of the mutants (R1370A and H1372A) were apparently partially degraded, because they showed an increased mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.3, upper panel). Except for these two proteins, all the other mutant GST fusion proteins could be purified in sufficient amounts to allow further studies. Interestingly, all cysteine mutants migrated as a single band on acrylamide gel, whereas the other point mutants as well as the wild type protein migrated as a doublet, with the faint upper band at the same position as that of the cysteine mutants. Expression of the Myc epitope-tagged proteins in mammalian cells also demonstrated the different migration of the cysteine mutants as compared with the wild-type and other mutants. In this case, all proteins migrated as single bands (Fig. 3,lower panel). Because the C1358S and C1405S mutants contain only one bound Zn2+ ion (4Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), this suggests that the presence of two zinc ions keeps the wild-type FYVE domain tightly folded, even under the conditions of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This also suggests that the other mutants contained two Zn2+ ions. To obtain information about the effects of mutations on the three-dimensional stucture of the FYVE finger, we analyzed wild-type and mutant EEA11307–1411 by fluorescence spectroscopy. The presence of the conserved Trp1349 in the EEA1 FYVE domain allowed us to record the fluorescence spectrum emitted by the protein upon excitation at 290 nm (Fig.4 A). The emission spectrum was typical for tryptophan, with a maximum fluorescence at 345 nm. Tryptophan residues present in the GST tag contributed little to the GST-FYVE fluorescence, because GST alone generated only a weak emission. The same weak emission was obtained with the W1349A mutant (used as a control), as well as the F1365A, H1373A, and G1378A mutants. Whereas the R1371A and R1375A mutants exhibited the same fluorescence as the wild type, all the cysteine mutants as well as the R1400A mutant showed a 40–50% reduction in fluorescence intensity. The addition of EDTA significantly quenched the fluorescence of the wild-type FYVE domain, yielding a fluorescence emission comparable to that of the cysteine mutants (Fig. 4 B). These results show that the environment of Trp1349 is sensitive to mutations not only of residues in direct contact with Trp1349 (such as His1373), but also of distal conserved residues. The two mutations that are the least likely ones to affect the three-dimensional structure of the FYVE finger are thus R1371A and R1375A. Even though it is known that the FYVE finger binds to PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P, aKD value for this interaction has not been determined. To measure the association and dissociation kinetics of the EEA1 FYVE finger with PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P, we employed surface plasmon resonance, which has been used successfully for measuring the binding of GST- and green fluorescent protein-tagged pleckstrin homology domains to phosphoinositides (26Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P was immobilized onto a sensor surface, and sensorgrams were recorded upon the injection of EEA1 FYVE at different concentrations (Fig. 5 A). The association and dissociation kinetics followed a profile typical of a 1:1 interaction model (Langmuir). From the association and dissociation curves, we calculated a KD value of 45 nm for the interaction of GST-FYVE with PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P (kaof 6.9 × 104 s−1 andkd of 3.1 × 10−3m·s−1). Similarly, we calculated the corresponding KD value for EEA1 fused to maltose-binding protein to be 50 nm (data not shown), indicating that the GST tag does not significantly affect the binding of the FYVE domain to PtdIns (3Leevers S.J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P could be competed by the soluble headgroup, Ins(1,3)P2 (Fig. 5 B), and we estimated a KD value of the FYVE domain for Ins(1,3)P2 of about 65 μm. In contrast, dibutanoyl PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P did not compete (not shown), possibly because this molecule may partially associate with the lipid membrane. These results indicate that the FYVE domain interacts with membrane-associated PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P with an intermediate affinity and that the headgroup of PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P is necessary but not sufficient for the stable FYVE-membrane interaction. The latter is consistent with the view that hydrophobic residues preceding the β1 strand of the FYVE domain may contribute to membrane binding by interacting with bilayer acyl chains (16Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Kutateladze T.G. Ogburn K.D. Watson W.T. de Beer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol.

Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P, we recorded sensorgrams at different concentrations of the various point mutants and calculated their KDvalues for PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P (Fig. 5 C and TableI). Interestingly, all mutations affected PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P binding. Smallest effects were observed with the F1365A and R1400A mutations, which led to a ∼6-fold reduction in affinity. Other mutations resulted in stronger effects. For instance, all mutations of cysteines caused a >20-fold loss of affinity for PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P. Among the conserved histidine and arginine residues, all mutations, except R1400A, had profound effects on PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P binding. The potentially most interesting mutant for further functional studies is R1375A, because this mutant could be obtained in good yields and showed a fluorescence emission similar to that of the wild-type EEA1 FYVE, and yet it had a >100-fold higher KD for PtdIns (3Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)P (Fig. 5 C and Table I). Altogether, the surface plasmon resonance analyses indicate that the FYVE finger of EEA1 is highly sensitive to mutations and that all the conserved residues play an important role,"
https://openalex.org/W1981768567,"We have recently cloned MMP-19, a novelmatrix metalloproteinase, which, due to unique structural features, was proposed to represent the first member of a new MMP subfamily (Pendás, A. M., Knäuper, V., Puente, X. S., Llano, E., Mattei, M. G., Apte, S., Murphy, G., and López-Otin, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 4281–4286). A recombinant COOH-terminal deletion mutant of MMP-19 (proΔ260–508MMP-19), comprising the propeptide and the catalytic domain, was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified. Interestingly, we found that proΔ260–508MMP-19 has the tendency to autoactivate, whereby the Lys97-Tyr98 peptide bond is hydrolyzed, resulting in free catalytic domain. Mutation of two residues (Glu88 → Pro and Pro90 → Val) within the propeptide latency motif did not prevent autoactivation but the autolysis rate was somewhat reduced. Analysis of the substrate specificity revealed that the catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the general MMP substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 and, with higher efficiency, the stromelysin substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2. Kinetic analysis of the interactions of the catalytic domain of MMP-19 with the natural MMP inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), showed strong inhibition using TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4, while TIMP-1 was less efficient. We also demonstrated that synthetic hydroxamic acid-based compounds efficiently inhibited the enzyme. The catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the basement membrane components type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen, as well as the large tenascin-C isoform, fibronectin, and type I gelatin in vitro, suggesting that MMP-19 is a potent proteinase capable of hydrolyzing a broad range of extracellular matrix components. Neither the catalytic domain nor the full-length MMP-19 was able to degrade triple-helical collagen. Finally, and in contrast to studies with other MMPs, MMP-19 catalytic domain was not able to activate any of the latent MMPs testedin vitro.

They have been implicated in the remodeling of connective tissues during such diverse processes as normal mammalian development and growth, wound healing, cartilage degradation during arthritis, and cancer metastasis (1.Nagase H.

At present 18 members of the human MMP family have been cloned, and they have been classified into different subfamilies according to their substrate specificity and cellular location. This classification comprises the collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs). We have recently cloned a new member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, MMP-19, which showed the typical domain organization of soluble members of the MMP family, namely a signal sequence, a propeptide domain with the cysteine residue essential for maintaining latency, a catalytic domain with the typical zinc binding motif, a linker region, and a COOH-terminal fragment with sequence similarity to hemopexin (4.Pendás A.M.

However, the enzyme lacks various structural features distinctive of the diverse MMP subfamilies,e.g. the fibronectin-like repeats of gelatinases or the Asp, Tyr, and Gly residues near the active site of collagenases, but possesses a unique insertion of five Glu residues within the linker region, an unusual latency motif in the propeptide domain ( … PRCGLEDP … ) and an additional Cys residue in the catalytic domain, when compared with other MMPs. In addition, the MMP-19 gene is the first MMP gene found to be located on chomosome locus 12q14 and initial data on its genomic organization has revealed a unique intron/exon distribution. MMP-19 may therefore represent the first member of a new subfamily of MMPs (4.Pendás A.M. Knäuper V. Puente X.S. Llano E. Mattei M.G. Apte S. Murphy G. López-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4281-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whose role in vivoremains to be investigated. However, recently, MMP-19 mRNA was found to be constitutively expressed in arthritic (RA) and traumatic synovial membranes, which may imply the involvement of MMP-19 in this tissue during normal ECM remodeling processes (5.Konttinen Y.T. Ainola M. Valleala H. Ma J. Ida H. Mandelin J. Kinne R.W. Santavirta S. Sorsa T. López-Otin C. Takagi M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1999; 58: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNA from various normal human tissues revealed strong expression of MMP-19 in placenta, ovary, lung, pancreas, spleen, and intestine, whereas expression in brain and leukocytes was undetectable (4.Pendás A.M. Knäuper V. Puente X.S. Llano E. Mattei M.G. Apte S. Murphy G. López-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4281-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Since adult cells under non-pathological conditions do not frequently produce MMPs, it is possible that MMP-19 participates in normal ECM turnover or in activation of secreted and membrane-bound proteins such as growth factors and proteinases (4.Pendás A.M. Knäuper V. Puente X.S. Llano E. Mattei M.G. Apte S. Murphy G. López-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4281-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). More recently, Sedlacek and co-workers (6.Sedlacek R. Mauch S. Kolb B. Schätzlein C. Eibel H. Peter H.H. Schmitt J. Krawinkel U. Immunobiology. 1998; 198: 408-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that enhanced anti-MMP-19 autoantibody titers appear to be frequent among patients suffering from RA, and that MMP-19 was detected using an anti-peptide antibody on the surface of lymphatic cells such as activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, TH1 lymphocytes, and Jurkat T lymphoma cells. Furthermore, a distinct expression of MMP-19 was observed, associated with the smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of synovial blood vessels of an RA patient, as well as in normal skin and uterine ligaments (7.Kolb C. Mauch S. Peter H.H. Krawinkel U. Sedlacek R. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 57: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, in capillaries of acutely inflamed RA synovium strong MMP-19 expression was also detected in the endothelial layer (8.Kolb C. Mauch S. Krawinkel U. Sedlacek R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The same authors report an elevated MMP-19 mRNA expression of smooth muscle cells in vitro after stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, epidermal growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor, whereby proliferating smooth muscle cells exhibited higher levels of MMP-19 mRNA than resting cells. MMP-19 protein and mRNA was detected in vitro in endothelial cells from various tissues, e.g.umbilical artery, skin, and fat tissue. These data support the hypothesis that MMP-19 participates in angiogenic processes and lymphocyte extravasation during arthritic diseases and therefore may be involved in the invasion of the inflamed synovial pannus into the joint space and thus in the destruction of joint tissues. Here we describe the expression, refolding, and enzymatic characterization of the catalytic domain of MMP-19. An expression vector for proΔ260–508MMP-19 was generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGCGCCTGCAGACTACCTGTCACAATATGGGTACCTACAGAAGCC-3′ (A) and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAACTCTTCTTGCCATAGAGAGCCTGGATCCCTGC-3′ (B) using the full-length MMP-19 cDNA in pSP64 as a template, thereby introducing a PstI site at the 5′ end and a stop codon following Ser259 flanked by a unique EcoRI site at the 3′ end of the PCR product. The 800-bp PCR product was cleaved with the restriction endonucleases PstI and EcoRI and ligated in frame into the pRSET B expression vector (Invitrogen), thereby adding an NH2-terminal His6 tag to the protein. The correct sequence of the proΔ260–508MMP-19 cDNA was confirmed by double-strand dideoxy sequencing. The expression of proΔ260–508MMP-19 as inclusion bodies in competent BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells was carried out as described previously (4.Pendás A.M. Knäuper V. Puente X.S. Llano E. Mattei M.G. Apte S. Murphy G. López-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4281-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 20 mm Tris/H2SO4, pH 8.0, 6m urea, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NaN3 at 37 °C for 30 min. Refolding was achieved by dilution (1:250) into 20 mmTris/H2SO4, pH 7.6, 100 mmNa2SO4, 5 mm CaSO4, 5 μm ZnSO4, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Brij 35 (w/v), 0.01% NaN3 at 4 °C. The refolding mixture was filtered and applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated in above buffer. Under these conditions, the protein bound via the NH2-terminal His6 tag to the column and was washed with above buffer containing 5 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with buffer supplemented with 100 mmimidazole. After SDS-PAGE analysis, fractions containing proΔ260–508MMP-19 were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% Brij 35 (w/v), 0.01% NaN3, followed by centrifugation to remove precipitated protein and concentration in an Amicon concentrator with aM r 10,000 cut-off cartridge. All buffers used for refolding and purification contain an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture at concentrations recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To alter two sequence motifs within proΔ260–508MMP-19 site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the method of Ho et al. (9.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The mutations were located in the propeptide (E88P/P90V) and in the catalytic domain (C166S). The mutants E88P/P90V and C166S were generated by PCR using the following primer pairs: 5′-CTACCGGATGTCTTCAACCAGAAGACCCTTAAA-3′ (C) with 5′-GAAGACATCCGGTAGGCCACAACGAGGCTGCCT-3′ (D), and 5′-CGTACTCGTCCAATACTTTTGATGGGCCTG-3′ (E) with 5′-TTGGACGAGTACGAGCTTTGGCGGCCATGG-3′ (F), respectively, in combination with primers A and B from above. Subcloning, expression, refolding, and purification were performed as described for the wild type proΔ260–508MMP-19. A protein containing alterations in both, propeptide and catalytic domain, was produced, thereby altering E88P/P90V and C166S by ligating the PstI and NcoI fragment from proΔ260–508MMP-19(E88P/P90V) into the pRSET B vector containing the mutation for C166S in the catalytic domain, previously cleaved with the same restriction enzymes. Expression and refolding were performed as described above. All expression vectors were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method and confirmed the correct sequence for each construct. Human MMP-19 was purified from culture medium conditioned by NS0 mouse myeloma cells that had been transfected with MMP-19 cDNA, essentially as described previously (10.Crabbe T. Willenbrock F.

TIMP-4 was expressed and purified from bacterial inclusion bodies, essentially as reported for TIMP-2 (14.Wingfield P.T. Sax J.K. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Chung V. Corcoran M.L. Kleiner D.E.

Generation of wild type Δ128–194TIMP-2 and the Δ128–194TIMP-2 mutants S2E, Y36G, and A70K was performed as described previously (15.Butler G.S. Hutton M. Wattam B.A. Williamson R.A. Knäuper V. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20391-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was determined after activation of wild type or mutated proΔ260–508MMP-19 with 1 mm APMA for 30 min at 37 °C (16.Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Routine assays were performed at 37 °C using 1 mm enzyme and the synthetic quenched fluorescent peptide (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-[3-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-Ala-Arg-NH2(λex 328 nm, λem 393 nm) as substrate at a concentration of 1 μm in assay buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Brij 35, 0.01% NaN3). The concentration of active enzyme was evaluated using the fluorescent assay by titration against a standard TIMP-2 solution of known concentration (12.Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M.

Determination of the substrate specificity of the catalytic domain of MMP-19 was carried out using the same assay with different quenched fluorescent synthetic peptide substrates at concentrations of 1 μm, which fulfilled the requirements of [S] ≪ K m. All peptide substrates were kindly provided by Dr. Graham Knight (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) for the formation of the EI complex of 1 nmactive wild type Δ260–508 MMP-19 with TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4, and the Δ128–194TIMP-2 mutants S2E, Y36G, and A70K were determined by analysis of the progress curves of McaPLANvaDpaARNH2 hydrolysis (12.Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The dependence ofk on TIMP concentration was evaluated using various amounts of TIMP (5–20 nm). In addition, the apparent Kiapp values for TIMP inhibition were determined using 1 nm enzyme incubated with a range of inhibitor concentrations for 24 h at 37 °C to reach equilibrium before assayed as described above. The apparent K i values for the inhibition of active wild type Δ260–508MMP-19 with the synthetic hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors CT-1746, Ro31-9790, and BB-94 were determined by incubation of 1 nm enzyme with a range of inhibitor concentrations for 24 h at 37 °C before assayed. The pH dependence of the activity of Δ260–508MMP-19 was determined at 37 °C, after complete activation with 1 mm APMA for 30 min, using 1 nm enzyme and 1 μm synthetic fluorescent substrate McaPLANvaDpaARNH2 in a buffer of 20 mm MES, 20 mm Tris, 20 mm CAPS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Brij 35. The pH was adjusted with HCl in steps of 0.5 before every measurement, covering a range from pH 5 to pH 11. A wide variety of extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen type I, gelatin type I, collagen type IV, laminin, nidogen, fibronectin, tenascin-C (small and large isoforms), fibrin, and fibrinogen were incubated in time-course experiments at 37 °C (if not stated otherwise) with active Δ260–508MMP-19 prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Type I collagen was prepared from rat skin, as described previously (17.Cawston T.E. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Tenascin-C small and large isoforms were obtained from baby hamster kidney cells transfected with tenascin-C cDNA constructs (18.Siri A. Knäuper V. Veirana N. Caocci F. Murphy G. Zardi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8650-8654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mouse laminin, human fibronectin and human fibrinogen were purchased from Sigma. Collagen type IV and nidogen were generous gifts from Klaus Kühn and Rupert Timpl, respectively. Fibrin was generated from fibrinogen by clotting with thrombin prior to incubation with active Δ260–508MMP-19 (19.Bini A. Itoh Y. Kudryk B.J. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13056-13063Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to fibronectin domains were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Human recombinant stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and gelatinase A (MMP-2), which were used as a comparison, were prepared as described previously and activated by trypsin and APMA, respectively (20.Koklitis P.A. Murphy G. Sutton C. Angal S. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21.Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Ward R.V. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The enzyme/substrate ratio (w/w) used in these experiments was 1/10. Furthermore, 14C-labeled gelatin and casein were used in an assay described by Cawston and Barrett (17.Cawston T.E. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) to quantify the specific catalytic activity of wild type Δ260–508MMP-19 hydrolyzing these molecules. Gelatin and casein zymography was performed as described previously (22.Quesada A.R. Barbacid M.M. Mira E. Fernández-Resa P. Márquez G. Aracil M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1997; 15: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proenzymes of human collagenase-1 (MMP-1), gelatinase A (MMP-2), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), gelatinase B (MMP-9), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), and MT1-MMP (MMP-14) were incubated for 24 h with active Δ260–508MMP-19 at a 1:1 (w/w) ratio of enzyme versus substrate at 37 °C in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Brij 35. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at the time intervals indicated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The processing of pro-gelatinase B by active Δ260–508MMP-19 was further assessed in time-course experiments at 37 °C with 1:10 ratio (w/w) of Δ260–508MMP-19 and proMMP-9 in the above buffer. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at the time intervals indicated, diluted to a final enzyme concentration of 25 pm, and assayed for activity in the fluorimeter using the synthetic quenched fluorescent peptide substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[3-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-Ala-Arg-NH2(λex 328 nm, λem 393 nm) at a concentration of 1 μm. Molecular mass changes were monitored by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Proteins were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18-column followed by automated Edman degradation using a PE Biosystems 492 Procise protein sequencer operated according to manufacturer's instructions. Human MMP-19 is a novel member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, cloned recently from a human liver cDNA library (4.Pendás A.M. Knäuper V. Puente X.S. Llano E. Mattei M.G. Apte S. Murphy G. López-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4281-4286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Consequently, biochemical analysis of the activation mechanism, substrate specificity, and inhibition profile of MMP-19 is of vital importance in order to understand its possible function in vivo and to design specific inhibitors as potential new therapeutic agents. Since purification of full-length MMP-19 expressed in mammalian and bacterial expression systems resulted in low yields, autoproteolytic activation, and partial fragmentation, we decided to use the COOH-terminal truncated form of MMP-19, proΔ260–508MMP-19 (numbering starts at Met1, GenBank™/EBI accession number X92521), for this study and analyzed its enzymatic properties. In order to further characterize the catalytic activity of MMP-19, we expressed and refolded the COOH-terminal truncated form of MMP-19, proΔ260–508MMP-19, comprising the pro and catalytic domains, and analyzed the protein biochemically in detail. After solubilization and refolding, proΔ260–508MMP-19 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and the eluted proenzyme displayed the expected mass of 30 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, following dialysis to remove the imidazole, all the enzyme autoactivated, resulting in the generation of active enzyme with a mass of 20 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B). NH2-terminal amino acid sequence determination of the active catalytic domain confirmed that the Lys97-Tyr98 peptide bond was hydrolyzed during autoproteolytic activation (Fig. 2).Figure 2NH2-terminal sequence determination of proΔ260–508MMP-19 in pRSET B and active Δ260–508MMP-19. The NH2 terminus of active Δ260–508 MMP-19 is indicated with an arrow. The numbering of the amino acid sequence starts with Met1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar autoactivation was observed when we attempted to purify full-length MMP-19 from the culture medium of stable transfected NS0 cells (data not shown). In order to define the residues in the proenzyme that make proMMP-19 prone to autoactivation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis experiments by targeting the latency motif PRCGLE 88DP 90 of proMMP-19 and the residue Cys166 in the catalytic domain, which are structural elements different from other MMPs. The mutants proΔ260–508MMP-19(C166S), proΔ260–508MMP-19(E88P/P90V), and proΔ260–508MMP-19(C166S/E88P/P90V) were expressed, solubilized, refolded, and purified in the same way as described for the wild type proΔ260–508MMP-19. All mutants are of the same size as wild type when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and activate spontaneously during refolding and purification (Fig. 1 and data not shown). However, the tendency to undergo activation is slowed down by approximately 50% for the two mutants proΔ260–508MMP-19(E88P/P90V) and proΔ260–508MMP-19(C166S/E88P/P90V), confirming previously published data, where the effects of single mutations within the latency motif of transin (rat stromelysin) upon activation were reported (23.Park A.J. Matrisian L.M. Kells A.F. Pearson R. Yuan Z. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1584-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both of these proΔ260–508MMP-19 mutants, the alterations reestablish the sequence PRCGVPDV, conserved within the propeptide of MMPs. Thus, our results suggest that the tendency of proΔ260–508MMP-19 and full-length MMP-19 to undergo autoactivation can be ascribed partially to its unique latency motif. Cys166 within the catalytic domain seems not to influence activation and its function remains unclear. However, we observed low amounts of dimers of active recombinant wild type Δ260–508MMP-19 by casein zymography and SDS-PAGE, whereas the mutants containing C166S did not form any dimers under the same conditions (data not shown). There is no in vivoevidence, however, that the residue Cys166 facilitates dimerization or linkage to other proteins. If not stated otherwise, we used the active wild type catalytic domain of MMP-19 (active Δ260–508MMP-19) for further biochemical characterization. In order to assess the substrate specificity of active Δ260–508MMP-19 further, seven synthetic quenched fluorescent peptide substrates were employed (TableI). Only the general MMP substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 and the stromelysin substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 were hydrolyzed efficiently, while other substrates were resistant to hydrolysis, thus confirming our preliminary data (4.Pendás A.M.

Thek cat /K m values obtained for these two substrates are in agreement with our earlier results. Therefore, the catalytic domain of MMP-19 has a substrate specificity similar to that for the stromelysin subfamily of MMPs since it preferably hydrolyzed Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2, which was designed as a substrate to study stromelysin activity. However, stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) hydrolyzes both substrates, Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 and Mca-Pro- Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2, more efficiently than active Δ260–508MMP-19 (20.Koklitis P.A.

Iron's physiologic importance derives from its ability to exist in multiple valence states and therefore participate in reactions requiring single electron transfers. Pathophysiologically, electron transfer by iron can generate toxic free radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical (1.Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2.McCord J.M. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar). Various mechanisms regulate cellular iron to ensure adequate supplies for cellular physiology while avoiding toxic iron excess.Many of the molecular details for iron accumulation and storage in cells are known. Iron circulates in the blood in the ferric form (Fe3+) bound tightly to transferrin (3.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 4.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). In most physiologic situations, iron enters cells upon the binding of diferric transferrin to the transferrin receptor followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Acidification of the lumen of the endocytic vesicle by the H+-ATPase releases iron from transferrin, whereupon iron is transported into the cytoplasm by the divalent cation transporter (5.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Excess cellular iron can be stored by ferritin (4.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). Transferrin receptor and ferritin levels are reciprocally controlled by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)1that bind to specific sequences known as iron regulatory elements (IREs) in the mRNAs of these proteins (3.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 4.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin.

Exs. 1996; 77: 183-197PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast, molecular details of a cellular iron efflux pathway are lacking, even though physiologic evidence indicates that bodily stores of iron are conserved and re-utilized. Thus, the human daily dietary requirement for iron is only 1 mg, despite evidence that tissues mobilize 20–30 times that amount to support red blood cell synthesis by the bone marrow (8.Conrad M.E. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). Iron is released from hemoglobin and other heme proteins by heme oxygenase-1 (HO1), an inducible enzyme associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, which cleaves the heme ring giving rise to biliverdin, which is rapidly reduced to bilirubin, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron (9.Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). In mice with targeted genomic deletion of HO1, tissue stores of iron are elevated, while serum iron levels are low (10.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 11.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that expression of HO1 is linked to cellular iron efflux, demonstrating a role for HO1 in cellular iron mobilization (12.Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Barañano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).Since HO1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of cytosolic heme but is not a transport protein, the mechanism by which HO1 activity is linked to cellular iron mobilization remains obscure. We reasoned that a membrane-associated transporter, like the calcium ATPase, might be the molecular link between cytosolic heme catabolism by HO1 and cellular iron release. We now report the identification and characterization of an Fe-ATPase associated with microsomal membranes that is co-distributed in tissues with HO1. Iron induces ATP-dependent iron transport in a macrophage cell line and in HO1 −/− mice, and glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis induces ATP-dependent iron transport in the kidney.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we report the identification and characterization an Fe-ATPase in mammalian tissues. The iron transport we observe appears to be mediated by an Fe-ATPase, since it is dependent upon hydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphates, magnesium, time, and temperature. Inhibition by orthovanadate suggests that the Fe-ATPase may be a P-type ATPase, mediating transmembrane transport through a mechanism that involves transient phosphorylation of an aspartate residue (26.MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 27.Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg.

The Fe-ATPase we describe appears to be a novel entity, as its activity is not affected by specific inhibitors of the other known ATPases. Conceivably, the ATP-dependent iron transport may reflect transport mediated by a copper ATPase encoded by the Wilson's or Menkes' disease genes (29.Schaefer M. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G311-G314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither of these genes are significantly expressed in the spleen (30.Paynter J.A. Grimes A. Lockhart P. Mercer J.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13616-13620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have described nuclear transport of iron in the liver that differs from the Fe-ATPase described here. The transporter they identified utilizes the ferric form of iron (32.Gurgueira S.A. Meneghini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13616-13620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which does not support the ATP-dependent iron transport described in this report. Moreover, under our experimental conditions, we do not detect any iron transport in nuclear fractions. Thus, the Fe-ATPase described herein represents a new mammalian transport mechanism.The total transport activity of the Fe-ATPase is less than that of other P-type ATPases. We measured about 10 pmol/min/mg protein in the spleen, whereas the Ca-ATPase is substantially more active with activities of 115 protein and 234 nmol/min/mg protein in platelet and cerebellar membranes respectively (33.Engelender S. Wolosker H. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21050-21055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The copper ATPases are the only other metal transporting P-type ATPases described in mammals and direct biochemical measurements of their activity are lacking. While ATP-dependent iron transport is low, this may reflect the low levels of free iron compared with other ions in cells.Our findings suggest that the ATP-dependent iron transport we have described physiologically regulates cellular iron homeostasis. RAW 264.7 cells manifest significantly augmented ATP-dependent iron transport when treated with iron. InHO1 −/− mice, wherein iron accumulates in the liver and kidney, ATP-dependent iron transport is strikingly augmented. In the spleen of these mice there is a dramatic reduction in ATP-dependent iron transport, possibly as a result of anemia in these mice (11.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) leading to a decrease in total erythrocyte turnover. Glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis, which leads to increased heme levels, HO1 induction, and iron liberation in the kidney, concurrently induces ATP-dependent iron transport. Thus, in cultured cells and animal models, cellular iron accumulation is associated with elevations in ATP-dependent iron transport, implying that, physiologically, the Fe-ATPase responds to iron.Our findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms determining expression and induction of ATP-dependent iron transport may be complex. We observe a biphasic induction of ATP-dependent iron transport in RAW 264.7 cells that may reflect different underlying mechanisms. Rapid induction (1–2 h following treatment with iron) may reflect post-translational modifications as the initial induction is not blocked by CHX or AD. A more pronounced induction 16–20 h after iron treatment is blocked by incubation with CHX and AD. Even when added to the cells 16 h after the iron, CHX blocks the delayed induction. Other genes related to cellular iron homeostasis, such as transferrin receptor and ferritin, are regulated by IRPs (4.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 34.Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Thus, with iron deficiency, IRPs prevent the translation of ferritin mRNA and stabilize transferrin receptor mRNA. IRPs also regulate the heme-synthesizing enzyme Δ-aminolevulinate synthase as well as the divalent cation transporter-1(5, 35, 36). Our results suggest that a rapid, perhaps post-translational, regulatory mechanism mediates the 2-fold induction of ATP-dependent iron transport seen in the first 1–2 h, and a second, translational (e.g. IRE-mediated) or transcriptional regulatory mechanism underlies the delayed induction of ATP-dependent iron transport after 18 h of iron exposure. Since both CHX and AD block iron-mediated induction of ATP-dependent iron transport, we cannot exclude an IRE-mediated mechanism.A variety of evidence suggests that HO1 is functionally coupled to the Fe-ATPase and iron mobilization (11.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 12.Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Barañano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). HO1 transfection stimulates iron egress from cells, which is markedly diminished in cells fromHO1 −/− mice (12.Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Barañano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The ATP-dependent iron transport is more than 20-fold enriched in spleen compared with other tissues, closely resembling the distribution of HO1. Increases in cellular iron, both in vitro and in vivo, induce HO1 and the Fe-ATPase in parallel. HO1 and the Fe-ATPase are similarly enriched in microsomal fractions, where they may co-localize on endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Accordingly, we suggest that HO1 and the Fe-ATPase act in concert (Fig. 7). As heme is degraded by HO1, the freed iron is transported by the Fe-ATPase to the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum for subsequent exocytosis (Fig. 7). Iron may bind transferrin in the lumen of the ER if the pH is neutral or following exocytosis. Transferrin is important for physiologic iron uptake, although alternate pathways enable cells to acquire iron. Interestingly, transferrin may be required for cellular iron release. Thus, in a perfused organ model, transferrin was required for59Fe release from the liver (37.Baker E. Morton A.G. Tavill A.S. Br. J. Haematol. 1980; 45: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In our own studies, monitoring 55Fe release from HEK-293 cells, we find that cells take up 55Fe in the absence of transferrin, although55Fe is released only in the presence of transferrin. 2C. D. Ferris and S. H. Snyder, unpublished observations. Together these findings suggest that a portion of the endoplasmic reticulum may be devoted to the regulation of iron uptake, heme turnover, and iron efflux with specific roles for transferrin receptor, HO1, and the Fe-ATPase in close association. Living cells require iron for many critical biological functions, including cellular respiration and DNA synthesis. Iron's physiologic importance derives from its ability to exist in multiple valence states and therefore participate in reactions requiring single electron transfers. Pathophysiologically, electron transfer by iron can generate toxic free radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical (1.Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2.McCord J.M. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 5-12PubMed Google Scholar). Various mechanisms regulate cellular iron to ensure adequate supplies for cellular physiology while avoiding toxic iron excess. Many of the molecular details for iron accumulation and storage in cells are known. Iron circulates in the blood in the ferric form (Fe3+) bound tightly to transferrin (3.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 4.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). In most physiologic situations, iron enters cells upon the binding of diferric transferrin to the transferrin receptor followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Acidification of the lumen of the endocytic vesicle by the H+-ATPase releases iron from transferrin, whereupon iron is transported into the cytoplasm by the divalent cation transporter (5.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Excess cellular iron can be stored by ferritin (4.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). Transferrin receptor and ferritin levels are reciprocally controlled by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)1that bind to specific sequences known as iron regulatory elements (IREs) in the mRNAs of these proteins (3.Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 4.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 7.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Exs. 1996; 77: 183-197PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, molecular details of a cellular iron efflux pathway are lacking, even though physiologic evidence indicates that bodily stores of iron are conserved and re-utilized. Thus, the human daily dietary requirement for iron is only 1 mg, despite evidence that tissues mobilize 20–30 times that amount to support red blood cell synthesis by the bone marrow (8.Conrad M.E. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). Iron is released from hemoglobin and other heme proteins by heme oxygenase-1 (HO1), an inducible enzyme associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, which cleaves the heme ring giving rise to biliverdin, which is rapidly reduced to bilirubin, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron (9.Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). In mice with targeted genomic deletion of HO1, tissue stores of iron are elevated, while serum iron levels are low (10.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 11.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that expression of HO1 is linked to cellular iron efflux, demonstrating a role for HO1 in cellular iron mobilization (12.Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Barañano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Since HO1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of cytosolic heme but is not a transport protein, the mechanism by which HO1 activity is linked to cellular iron mobilization remains obscure. We reasoned that a membrane-associated transporter, like the calcium ATPase, might be the molecular link between cytosolic heme catabolism by HO1 and cellular iron release. We now report the identification and characterization of an Fe-ATPase associated with microsomal membranes that is co-distributed in tissues with HO1. Iron induces ATP-dependent iron transport in a macrophage cell line and in HO1 −/− mice, and glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis induces ATP-dependent iron transport in the kidney. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we report the identification and characterization an Fe-ATPase in mammalian tissues. The iron transport we observe appears to be mediated by an Fe-ATPase, since it is dependent upon hydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphates, magnesium, time, and temperature. Inhibition by orthovanadate suggests that the Fe-ATPase may be a P-type ATPase, mediating transmembrane transport through a mechanism that involves transient phosphorylation of an aspartate residue (26.MacLennan D.H.

Together these findings suggest that a portion of the endoplasmic reticulum may be devoted to the regulation of iron uptake, heme turnover, and iron efflux with specific roles for transferrin receptor, HO1, and the Fe-ATPase in close association."
https://openalex.org/W1542620420,"Laminins are a large family of heterotrimeric extracellular matrix glycoproteins that, in addition to having structural roles, take part in the regulation of processes such as cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation. The laminin α4 chain is widely distributed both in adults and during development in tissues such as cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle fibers, vascular endothelia, lungs, and in peripheral nerves. It can associate with laminin β1/γ1 chains to form laminin-8 and with the β2/γ1 chains to form laminin-9. Functional studies on these laminins have been hampered by poor availability of the protein in pure and soluble forms. To facilitate studies on laminin-8, recombinant laminin-8 was produced in a mammalian expression system, purified and shown to form native Y-shaped molecules in rotary shadowing electron microscopy. Integrins mediating cell adhesion to laminin-8 were identified using function-blocking mAbs. The integrin specificities were found to differ somewhat from that of laminin-1. Integrin α6β1 was found to be a major mediator of adhesion of HT-1080 and cultured capillary endothelial cells to laminin-8. Considering the expression patterns of laminin-8 and integrin α6β1 it is likely that the former is a ligand for the latter in vivo as well.

LNs are heterotrimers composed of three different types of polypeptide chains termed α, β, and γ, encoded by distinct genes with varying spatial expression (1.Tryggvason K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2.Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Certain LN isoforms can polymerize into a network that contributes to the structural framework of basement membranes (BMs). Some isoforms have also been found in non-BM locations. Thus, LN-8 is present in platelets (3.Geberhiwot T. Ingerpuu S. Pedraza C. Neira M. Lehto U. Virtanen I. Kortesmaa J. Tryggvason K. Engvall E. Patarroyo M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and LN γ3 chain containing isoforms have been found on the apical surface of certain epithelia (4.Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A.

In mammals, five different α chains, three β chains, and three γ chains have been reported to date, and 12 different heterotrimeric combinations have been characterized (4.Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A.

Since LN-1 isolated from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor (α1β1γ1) is the only LN readily available in significant quantities, this isoform has been used in most biochemical studies on LNs published thus far. Still, LN-1 is uncommon in vivo, at least in the adult, where it is mainly restricted to a subset of epithelia (10.Vuolteenaho R. Nissinen M. Sainio K. Byers M. Eddy R. Hirvonen H. Shows T.B.

However, the different phenotypes caused by mutations in different LNs chains have demonstrated that some LN isoforms have unique and important biological functions. Thus, severe congenital muscular dystrophy is caused by the lack of or defects in the LN α2 chain (12.Helbling-Leclerc A. Zhang X. Topaloglu H. Cruaud C. Tesson F. Weissenbach J. Tome F.M.

Therefore, functions reported for LN-1 in vitro may not be relevant for the other LN isoforms. The LN α4 chain has been shown to associate with the β1 and γ1 chains to form LN-8 and with β2/γ1 to form LN-9 (9.Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The LN α4 chain is widely distributed both during development and in the adult. In the adult, it is found in the BM surrounding cardiac and smooth muscle fibers, and in lung alveolar septa. Furthermore, it is found in the endothelial BM both in capillaries and larger vessels, and in the perineurial BM of peripheral nerves. During development its expression is high in skeletal muscle but is down-regulated in adults (7.Iivanainen A. Sainio K. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Iivanainen A. Kortesmaa J. Sahlberg C. Morita T. Bergmann U. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The actual role and significance the LN α4 chain and the LN-8 isoform are unknown. To facilitate studies on LN-8 we have produced native recombinant laminin-8 (rLN-8) and studied its properties with respect to cell adhesion and integrin receptor binding. For expression of the human LN α4 chain containing a C-terminal FLAG epitope, the full-length cDNA was constructed and modified as follows. Complementary DNA λ clones subcloned into pBluescript or pCRscript (Stratagene) plasmid vectors from an earlier study (7.Iivanainen A. Sainio K. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were used as cDNA source, except for clone FL136. The EcoRI insert from FL136 λ DNA was cloned into the pBluescript EcoRI site to make FL136E. The 0.78-kilobase SacI-BamHI fragment from clone FL76 was ligated intoSacI-BamHI digested pSL1180 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to make FL76SB. A sequence corresponding nucleotides 2378–4274 of human LN α4 cDNA was PCR amplified using cDNA library as template, digested with SacI, and cloned into FL76SB SacI site and its orientation confirmed to make HL4-SB. The FL64 BamHI-SalI fragment was cloned into HL4-SB BamHI-SalI to make HL4–3′. The Eco72I-XhoI fragment from FL117 was ligated into Eco72I-XhoI sites of FL136E to make HL4–5′. Both mouse and human LN α4 cDNAs have poorly conserved Kozak sequences at the translation initiation site and several extra 5′-untranslated region ATG sequences. To ensure efficient and correct translation initiation, the Kozak sequence was edited to match the consensus and rest of the 5′-untranslated region was deleted. To accomplish this, PCR with primer K95M (containing EcoRI site and modified Kozak sequence: 5′-ggatgaattcgccaccatggctttgagctcagc-3′) and K96L (5′-tgaaagaatccagcattgc-3′) was performed, the product wasEcoRI-EagI digested and cloned toEcoRI-EagI digested HL4-5′ to make HL4Mut-5′. TheSpeI-XhoI fragment from HL4Mut-5′ was cloned into HL4-3′ to make clone HL4-Full with full-length cDNA. TheEcoRI insert from HL4-Full was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) expression vector (Invitrogen) to make HL4-Full.pcDNA. The sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (N-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys(C)) was inserted as follows. The FL64 BamHI-HindIII fragment was cloned into pUC19 to make FL64BH. PCR was performed using primers K97 (5′-gaagattagaagccaggag-3′) and K116M (containing FLAG sequence andHindIII site: 5′-cccaagcttacttgtcatcgtcgtccttgtagtcggctgctggacag-3′) using HL4–3′ as template. The product was digested with XbaI andHindIII and cloned into XbaI-HindIII digested FL64BH to make HL4FLAG-3′. This also resulted in deletion of the original 3′-untranslated region. TheBamHI-HindIII fragment from HL4FLAG-3′ was cloned into BamHI-HindIII-digested HL4-Full.pcDNA vector replacing the original BamHI-HindIII fragment to make HL4FLAG-B, which was lacking theBamHI-BamHI fragment. The final expression construct named HL4FLAG-Full was made by inserting the missingBamHI fragment in correct orientation. All PCR-derived parts of the cDNA were sequenced (AmpliTaq FS on an ABI 310 sequencer, Perkin-Elmer) to ensure that no mutations had occurred during amplification. The construct used for expression of mouse LN β1 has been described previously (19.Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y. Colognato H. Mathus T. Harrison D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To make the construct named HG1 for expression of the human LN γ1 chain, full-length cDNA coding for human LN γ1 chain was released withBamHI from a baculovirus expression vector pVL941 2T. Kallunki, unpublished data. and cloned into theBamHI site of pcDNA3.1/Hygro(−) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Affinity purified polyclonal anti-LN α4 antibody (Ab) S8 was prepared as described previously (17.Iivanainen A. Kortesmaa J. Sahlberg C. Morita T. Bergmann U. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Polyclonal anti-EHS-laminin Ab, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), purified control mouse IgG, RGDS-peptide, and heparin (grade I-A) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-LN γ1 (clone 22) mAb was from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse function blocking mAbs against integrin α1 (clone FB12), integrin α2 (clone P1E6), and integrin α3 (clone P1B5) were obtained from Chemicon.

Recombinant LN-8 was produced in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293, ATCC CRL-1573) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pyruvate, 10% fetal calf serum in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Wild-type cells were stably transfected with the LN β1 expression construct as described previously (19.Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y. Colognato H. Mathus T. Harrison D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and selected using 500 μg/ml G418. All further cell culture and clonal expansion was carried out in continuous presence of relevant selection antibiotics. A highly expressing clone was then transfected using the standard calcium-phosphate method with HL4FLAG-Full construct and stable colonies were selected using 300 μg/ml Zeocin. Clones were isolated using cloning rings, expanded, and analyzed for LN α4 secretion by Western blotting of medium using the anti-LN α4 Ab S8. The clone with the highest expression was transfected with the HG1 construct and stable clones were selected using 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Clones were screened with Western blotting using a mAb against LN γ1, and clones showing the highest secretion were expanded further. For production of rLN-8, cells were grown in the culture medium for up to 4 days, after which the medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris. After collection, Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, was added to 50 mm and EDTA was added to a concentration of 10 mm. If not used immediately, the medium was stored at −70 °C. For protein production into serum-free medium, confluent cultures were washed twice with PBS and the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with pyruvate, insulin-transferrin-selen supplement (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). rLN-8 was affinity purified using anti-FLAG M2 matrix (Sigma). Before use, the matrix was washed with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, and TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brij-20 (Fluka) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v), and the medium was incubated in batch mode with the matrix (25 μl of matrix/ml) overnight at +4 °C with agitation. The matrix was collected by passing the medium through a sintered column, and washed extensively in the column first with TBS, 1 mm EDTA and then PBS, 1 mm EDTA. Bound rLN-8 was competitively eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in PBS, 1 mm EDTA at room temperature. The matrix was then regenerated as recommended by the manufacturer. The eluate was diluted 1:1 with 20 mmNaPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and injected to a UNO-Q ion-exchange column (Bio-Rad). At this salt concentration the FLAG peptide passes through but rLN-8 is bound. The column was washed with 20 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA and the LN was eluted with 20 mm NaPO4, 1.5 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The eluate was diluted 1:10 with 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA to a final salt concentration of 150 mm and concentrated using 100-kDa cut-off ultrafiltration (Gelman) to approximately 0.5 mg/ml. Secreted LN in cell medium and after purification was characterized using linear 5 or 6% SDS-PAGE and 3–12% gradient SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Proteins were visualized using silver staining or blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using semi-dry blotting system (Bio-Rad). For immunodetection, Renaissance ECL-system (NEN Life Science Products) was used in conjunction with the anti-laminin α4, anti-EHS laminin, anti-FLAG, and anti-laminin γ1 Abs described above. Protein quantitation was done by measuring absorbance at 280 nm or using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay kit, Bio-Rad). Rotary shadowing electron microscopy (EM) was performed as described previously (23.Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When purifying for rotary shadowing, the matrix was equilibrated with 0.15 mNH4HCO3/acetate buffer, pH 7.4 and the rLN-8 was then eluted with FLAG peptide in the same buffer. For adhesion assays, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Maxi-Sorp, Nunc) were coated by incubating with proteins diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at +4 °C (50 μl/well). The remaining protein binding capacity was saturated by addition of 2% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (50 μl/well) and further incubation for at least 4 h. Prior to assay, the coating/blocking solution was aspirated, and the wells were washed with the binding medium (100 μl/well). Drying of coated protein was avoided, since this was found to be detrimental to adhesion in some cases. All cells were cultured in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. HT-1080 and BCE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, pyruvate at 37 °C, BCE on gelatin-coated plastic. IBE cells were cultured in F-12, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 units ml−1 γ-interferon on gelatin-coated plastic at 33 °C. Transfected K562 cells were grown in suspension in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 at 37 °C. For K562 cells transfected with both α6 and β4 integrins, 0.7 mg/ml hygromycin was also included in the medium. Prior to dissociation, the cells were washed twice with PBS. HT-1080 cells were dissociated using 5 mm EDTA in PBS, while the others were dissociated using trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). To remove trypsin, cells were pelleted and resuspended twice in serum-free medium. Cells were counted and suspended in buffered serum-free medium at 2–3 × 105cells/ml. K562 cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and resuspended at 106 cells/ml. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm Hepes, pyruvate was used for HT-1080 cells, F-12, 25 mm Hepes, 0.25% BSA for others. Antibodies or other test compounds were added to the cell suspension and the cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C for 30 min. Integrin mAbs were used at 10 μg/ml, heparin at 2 mg/ml, and EDTA at 5 mm. K562 cell stimulation was done using 5 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma). The cells were then added to the protein-coated 96-well plates (100 μl/well) and allowed to adhere for 30 (K562) or 60 (other cells) min at 37 °C. To remove unbound cells, wells were washed by two to three cycles of careful addition of 100 μl of binding medium followed by aspiration. The remaining cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) for 30 min and unbound stain was removed by four washes with water. Bound stain was solubilized in 2% SDS (100 μl/well), and quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using a microplate reader. None of the cell lines bound appreciably to BSA. When the quantitative results were calculated, binding to BSA was given a value of zero, while the relevant control was given the value 100. The mean and standard error (S.E.) were calculated from results obtained from parallel wells. Unconcentrated medium from wild-type HEK-293 cells did not react in Western blots with the anti-LN α4, anti-LN γ1, anti-EHS-LN, or anti-FLAG Abs, indicating that these cells express endogenous LNs at very low amounts if at all (data not shown). The transfected α4 chain could be secreted to some extent even when expressed alone, but secretion of the other chains required simultaneous expression of all three chains of a trimer. Cells transfected with LN α4, β1, and γ1 chain expression constructs secreted large amounts of all three chains to the medium. The best cell clones were estimated to produce 3–5 mg of rLN-8 per liter of medium. The rLN-8 bound to anti-FLAG M2 matrix with high specificity. When eluted competetively with the FLAG-peptide, only LN α4, β1, and γ1 bands were seen in silver-stained 3–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.1). Under nonreducing conditions the purified protein hardly entered the gel, which was to be expected as the predicted molecular mass for the mature trimer is at least 570 kDa. In a minor fraction of the purified trimer, the β1 and γ1 chains were disulfide-bonded, whereas the α4 chain was noncovalently associated. Under reducing conditions, the protein appeared as a broad band at around 200 kDa, which reacted on Western blots with α4, EHS, γ1, and anti-FLAG Abs. The predicted molecular masses for mature α4, β1, and γ1polypeptides are 200, 195, and 174 kDa, respectively. LNs are heavily glycosylated which may account for the slight discrepancy inM r observed in SDS-PAGE. The β1and γ1 chains of LN-1 purified from EHS tumor showed similar or slightly slower mobility than those of rLN-8. A silver-stained gel with Ab reactivities indicated is shown in Fig.1. Rotary shadowing EM revealed the rLN-8 protein as Y-shaped molecules with two short and one long arm in accordance with the predicted structure. In many cases, a very short (5–10 nm) rod-like stub could be seen at the junction of the arms. The G-domains could sometimes be seen as consisting of two moieties. Representative pictures of rLN-8 molecules are shown in Fig. 2. We assayed the binding of human fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) and transfected K562 cells to rLN-8 in the presence of different blocking anti-integrin antibodies to identify integrin receptors binding to rLN-8. Immortomouse brain capillary endothelial (IBE) and bovine adrenal microvascular endothelial (BCE) cells were also used to study the adhesion of endothelial cells to rLN-8. The BCE cells express at least integrins α6β1, α6β4, α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α5β1, αvβ1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 (24.Klein S. Giancotti F.G. Presta M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas IBE cells have been reported to express integrins α3, α5, and β1 but not α1, α2, or α6 (25.Kanda S. Tomasini-Johansson B. Klint P. Dixelius J. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When compared with LN-1, the adhesiveness of rLN-8 was quantitatively similar or slightly weaker for the cell lines studied, as approximately the same number of cells bound to both substrates after washing (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained with IBE and BCE cells (not shown). In further experiments with blocking integrin mAbs, a coating concentration of 10 μg/ml was used. mAbs against integrins α1 and α2 were tested only in the HT-1080 cell line, where they had no or only small effects on cell binding indicating that these integrins were not major mediators of adhesion to rLN-8 (Fig.4 A). Adhesion to collagen type IV was reduced to about 50% by the anti-integrin α2 mAb, demonstrating the presence of active α2 integrin (not shown). Integrin α1 mAb had only slight effect on adhesion to collagen IV when used alone, but it had a synergistic effect when used in combination with the α2 mAb (not shown). The mAb against integrin α3 had only minor effects on adhesion of HT-1080 (Fig. 4 a) cells to fibronectin or LN, despite that the cells have been shown to express high levels of α3β1 (26.Wayner E.A. Gil S.G. Murphy G.F. Wilke M.S. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The blocking of integrin α5 had a slight stimulating effect on HT-1080 adhesion to both LN-1 and rLN-8 (Fig. 4 a), whereas adhesion of BCE cells to rLN-8 was slightly reduced (Fig. 4 b). The mAb did block adhesion of HT-1080 cells to fibronectin almost completely indicating the presence of active α5 integrin in these cells (not shown).Figure 4Cell adhesion assays on LNs coated at 10 μg/ml.

On the right, the rLN-8 has been covered by a drop, whereas on the left it has been briefly air dried. The BCE cells on the dried area are rounded and only a few of them show any signs of spreading. On the area kept wet, practically all cells are well spread and tightly adhered to the surface. In the assay, and cells were allowed to adhere 1 h at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) α6 Subunit containing integrin(s) were identified as the major mediators of adhesion to rLN-8. The integrin α6subunit is known to associate into a dimer with either β1or β4 (27.Sonnenberg A. Linders C.J. Daams J.H. Kennel S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 207-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using a mAb (GoH3) that blocks both α6β1- and α6β4-mediated binding, we could completely abolish binding of HT-1080 and BCE cells to rLN-8. An anti-β1 integrin mAb (AIIB2) also completely blocked the binding of HT-1080 cells to rLN-8 indicating that integrin α6β1 is crucial for adhesion of these cells to rLN-8 (Fig. 4 a). In contrast, binding of BCE cells was blocked only partially (about 70%) by the anti-β1 mAb, suggesting that these endothelial cells use both α6β1 and α6β4to adhere to rLN-8 (Fig. 4 b). In another endothelial cell line, the mouse IBE cells, the anti-α6 subunit mAb blocked the binding to rLN-8 only partially (about 60%) suggesting that the cells are using, in addition to α6-subunit containing integrins, also other receptors (Fig. 4 c). Interestingly, when adhesion to rLN-8 was compared with that of LN-1, it was observed that the adhesion was quite differently affected by the blocking anti-α6 and anti-β1 integrin mAbs. HT-1080 cells interacted with LN-1 not only via α6β1 integrin but also via other β1-subunit containing integrin(s), since the blocking was only partial with anti-α6 but complete with anti-β1 (Fig. 4 a). Furthermore, the adhesion of BCE cells to LN-1 was mediated by β1 integrin(s) other than α6β1, since the adhesion was completely blocked by anti-β1 but was only minimally affected by anti-α6 (Fig. 4 b). Similarly, in IBE cells, the adhesion to LN-1 was mediated by receptors other than α6 integrin(s) since it was not affected by anti-α6 (Fig. 4 c). To verify the role of α6β1 and α6β4 integrins as rLN-8 receptors, transfected K562 cells were used. Parental K562 cells express endogenously only integrin α5β1, which is in an inactive state. The cells normally grow in suspension but can be made adherent with an activating anti-β1 Ab or stimulation with PMA. K562 cells transfected with the α6subunit express α6β1 on the cell surface (21.Delwel"

However, it is unclear why threonine has been conserved in all proteasomal active sites, because its replacement by a serine in proteasomes from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum (T1S mutant) does not alter the rates of hydrolysis of Suc-LLVY-amc (Seemüller, E., Lupas, A., Stock, D., Lowe, J., Huber, R., and Baumeister, W. (1995) Science 268, 579–582) and other standard peptide amide substrates. However, we found that true peptide bonds in decapeptide libraries were cleaved by the T1S mutant 10-fold slower than by wild type (wt) proteasomes. In degrading proteins, the T1S proteasome was 3.5- to 6-fold slower than the wt, and this difference increased when proteolysis was stimulated using the proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN) ATPase complex. With mutant proteasomes, peptide bond cleavage appeared to be rate-limiting in protein breakdown, unlike with wt. Surprisingly, a peptide ester was hydrolyzed by both particles much faster than the corresponding amide, and the T1S mutant cleaved it faster than the wt. Moreover, the T1S mutant was inactivated by the ester inhibitorclasto-lactacystin-β-lactone severalfold faster than the wt, but reacted with nonester irreversible inhibitors at similar rates. T1A and T1C mutants were completely inactive in all these assays. Thus, proteasomes lack additional active sites, and the N-terminal threonine evolved because it allows more efficient protein breakdown than serine.

Proteins marked for degradation by an attachment of a polyubiquitin chain are hydrolyzed by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner (3.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

This complex consists of the 20 S core proteasome, in which proteolysis occurs, and two 19 S regulatory complexes (6.Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 7.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). 20 S proteasomes also exist in archaea and many eubacteria, which lack both 26 S proteasomes and ubiquitin (8.Zwickl P. Goldberg A.L. Baumeister W. Wolf D.H. Hilt W. Proteasomes in Prokaryotes. Proteasomes: The World of Regulatory Proteolysis. Landes Bioscience Publishing Co., Georgetown, TX1999: 8-20Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome from Thermoplasma acidophilum has proven to be especially useful for studies of the proteasome's structure and catalytic mechanism (9.Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 10.Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Like the eukaryotic core particle, theT. acidophilum proteasome is a cylindrical complex consisting of four superimposed 7-membered rings (11.Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, these archaeal particles are simpler and more symmetric in organization. The two outer rings are composed of identical α-subunits, and its inner rings are composed of identical β-subunits, each of which contains an active site. These 14 active sites are located on the inner surface of this particle. The narrow openings in the α-rings serve as sites of substrate entrance into the inner chamber of the cylinder where proteolysis occurs. Globular proteins are too large to traverse these openings and need to be unfolded to be translocated into the 20 S particle for degradation (11.Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Presumably, the ATPases in the 19 S particle catalyze this process (12.Larsen C.N. Finley D. Cell. 1997; 91: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13.Rubin D.M. Finley D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 854-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, a homologous ATPase complex, the proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN),1 was described in archaea. In the presence of ATP, this complex dramatically stimulates protein breakdown by 20 S proteasomes from T. acidophilum(14.Zwickl P. Ng D. Woo K.M. Klenk H.P. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26008-26014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and presumably, PAN was the evolutionary precursor of the 19 S complex. Both archaeal and eukaryotic 20 S and 26 S proteasomes degrade proteins in a highly processive manner; i.e. they cut polypeptides at multiple sites without release of intermediates and generate small peptides, 95% of which are shorter than 20 residues (10.Akopian T.N.

The sequences and overall structural fold of the proteasomal subunits as well as their proteolytic mechanism differ from those of other classes of proteolytic enzymes (9.Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of proteasome subunits is related to that of several other amidases, which all utilize the side chain of the N-terminal residue as the catalytic nucleophile. These enzymes, therefore, have been termed N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases (19.Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G.

Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). The catalytic β-subunits are synthesized as inactive precursors containing N-terminal extensions, autocatalytically cleaved off during particle assembly (37.Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38.Zwickl P. Kleinz J. Baumeister W. Nature Struct.

In addition to preventing catalysis before assembly, these propeptides protect the N termini from acetylation in eukaryotic cells (39.Groll M. Heinemeyer W. Jager S. Ullrich T. Bochtler M. Wolf D.H. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10976-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which also abolishes catalytic activity (40.Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M.

Biol. 1999; 291: 997-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations indicate an essential role of free N-terminal primary amine in catalysis, which presumably promotes nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl group (9.Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 42.Lupas A. Zwickl P. Wenzel T. Seemüller E. Baumeister W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutation of catalytic threonine into a serine in archaeal proteasomes was not found to change the rate of cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide Suc-LLVY-amc, which is routinely used to assay proteasome activity (28.Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). By contrast, in serine proteases, the replacement of the active site serine by a threonine reduces proteolytic activity by several orders of magnitude (43.Corey D.R. Craik C.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1784-1790Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, in another Ntn family member, glycosylasparaginase, the replacement of the catalytic threonine by serine also reduced its activity by more than 10-fold (44.Liu Y. Guan C. Aronson Jr., N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9688-9694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings raise an important question of why proteasomes have evolved with only threonine and not serine in their active sites. If threonine and serine were in fact functionally interchangeable, random mutations would have replaced threonine by serine in many, if not most, proteasomes, because threonine has four codons (ACX), whereas serine has six (UCX and AG(U/C)). These experiments were undertaken to investigate more thoroughly the catalytic properties of proteasomes containing N-terminal a threonine or serine residue and thus to enhance our understanding of the proteasome's novel proteolytic mechanism. We therefore compared activities of the wild type and the T1S mutant of proteasomes from archaea T. acidophilum against a variety of peptide and protein substrates as well as their susceptibilities to the inactivation by various irreversible inhibitors. Wild type T. acidophilum proteasomes and the T1S, T1A, and T1C mutants in the β-subunit were expressed inEscherichia coli without propeptides (28.Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R.

The proteasome-activating nucleotidase, PAN, from Methanococcus jannaschii was kindly provided by Dr. A. Navon. A mutant, M74A, of PAN was used because it allowed purification of the homogeneous PAN (i.e. it abolished the production of some truncated PAN subunits that result from an internal initiation of translation 2D. Ng, P. Zwickl, and A. L. Goldberg, submitted for publication.). Proteasome and PAN concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (46.Bradford M.M. Analyt. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). All protein substrates were prepared as described by Akopian et al. (10.Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Reduced and carboxymethylated bovine α-lactalbumin and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF) were reductively methylated. All 12 amino groups in bovine β-casein were either reductively methylated or modified with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Concentrations of substrate proteins were determined using UV absorption (47.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Analyt. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar), except FITC-casein, which was measured with the Bradford assay because of the high absorbance of FITC at 280 nm. Synthetic peptide amides were purchased from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA), except Z-LLE-amc, which was a kind gift from Leukocyte, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Amino acid derivatives for peptide synthesis were from Calbiochem/Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Peptide libraries Biotin-LLVYX 4QQ that is homologous to the substrate Suc-LLVY-amc and Biotin-X 8QQ (whereX is any amino acid residue except Cys) were synthesized as described (48.Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar). Z-GGL was synthesized on a solid phase using standard Fmoc protocol (49.Wellings D.A. Atherton E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), starting with Fmoc-Leu-Wang resin and using Z-Gly at the last step. It was purified with HPLC after cleaving from the resin. 10 mg (27 μmol) of Z-GGL were dissolved in 24 μl of dimethylformamide (DMF), which was used as the solvent for this synthesis, and mixed with 35 μl of 1m 2-naphtol. After addition of 20 μl of 2 mdicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), the reaction mixture was placed on ice for 1 h and then at room temperature for 15 h. Precipitated dicyclohexyl urea was removed by centrifugation and thoroughly washed with DMF. Because HPLC analysis demonstrated that the reaction was not complete at this stage, the reaction mixture was concentrated to 50 μl, and, after the addition of 10 μl of 2 m DCC, was left at room temperature for additional 50 h. The excess DCC was destroyed by the addition of water, and the dicyclohexylurea precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Reaction mixture (100 μl) was diluted with 4 ml of 40% acetonitrile in 20 mmammonium acetate, and the reaction product was purified using HPLC. Structure of Z-GGL-2-naphtyl ester was confirmed using mass-spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Cleavage of fluorogenic peptide amides and ester was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by continuously monitoring the release of fluorogenic products, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 460 nm), 2-naphtylamine (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 410 nm), or 2-naphtol (excitation, 329 nm; emission, 410 nm) (50.Kisselev A.F.

The reaction velocities were determined from the slopes of the initial linear portions of the reaction progress curves. Peptide libraries and proteins were incubated with proteasomes in 50 mm bis-tris propane, pH 7.5. At different times, aliquots were withdrawn, mixed with an equal volume of 1.2% SDS to stop the enzymatic reaction, and assayed for free amino groups with fluorescamine assay (10.Akopian T.N.

A mixture of peptide standards, whose concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis, was used to calibrate the assay (10.Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). All incubations were performed at 54 °C. All K m and V maxvalues were determined from direct linear plots (51.Henderson P.F.J. Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 277-316Google Scholar).k cat calculations were based on the assumption that all 14 active sites in all molecules of the enzyme preparation were catalytically active. Cleavage of Suc-LLVY-amc (100 μm) by proteasomes was allowed to proceed for 5–10 min without the inhibitor (see Fig. 3). The inhibitor was added, and the incubation continued for up to 3 h. Fluorescence of the reaction product (amc) was followed continuously during the entire incubation. Not more than 1% of the substrate was consumed during the incubation, and the reaction progress curves were linear in the control experiments, where Me2SO carrier was used instead of inhibitors. Values fork obs for 4-hydroxyl-3-iodo-3-nitrophenyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucine vinyl sulfone and epoxomycin were obtained using nonlinear least square fit of the reaction to the equation: fluorescence =v f t + [(v o −v s)k obs][1 − exp(−k obs t)], wherev o and v s are initial and final velocities, respectively (52.Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Such a fit was impossible for β-lactone due to the reversibility of reaction (see Fig. 3). Rate constants for this inhibitor were determined as kobs = [ln(v o/v t)]/t, where v t is the reaction velocity at the inflection point, which was reached 4–13 min after the addition of β-lactone (see Fig. 3). The wild type and T1S mutant were found to hydrolyze the fluorogenic peptide amide Suc-LLVY-amc at similar rates, in accord with findings by Seemüller et al. (28.Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Also, there was no significant difference in the rates of hydrolysis of several different peptide amides (Table I) by the two forms, except that the T1S cleaved Z-LLE-2-naphtylamide about 40% slower than the wild type (Table I). In all these substrates, the scissile bond is an amide bond between an amino acid residue and an aromatic amine (amc). Amide bonds differ in several structural features from true peptide bonds, and they are not hydrolyzed by numerous proteolytic enzymes, such as metalloproteases and aspartic proteases. To compare the abilities of the wild type and T1S proteasomes to cleave true peptide bonds, the fluorogenic leaving group in these substrates was replaced by a sequence of natural amino acids. Moreover, to exclude the possibility that different sub-site preferences of the two forms might affect the results and to compare their activities toward the maximal possible array of peptide substrates, we constructed two peptide libraries with the general sequences, LLVYX 4QQ and X 8QQ with N-terminal amino groups blocked by biotinylation. This N-terminal modification greatly reduced the background in the fluorescamine assay, which we used to measure the rates of cleavage of peptide bonds in these libraries. Fluorescamine forms a fluorescent adduct with primary amines (53.Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar) and was used, as in our prior studies (10.Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Peptide hydrolysis with both decapeptide libraries appeared to obey simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.1). Surprisingly, although the T1S mutant hydrolyzed fluorogenic amides at similar rates as the wild type, it cleaved the peptide libraries with 10-fold lowerV max values than the wild type enzyme (TableII). Although the Ser substitution led to a surprising severalfold decrease in K m for peptides, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for the serine mutant was still significantly lower than for the wild type (Table II). In other words, replacement of the active site threonine by a serine results in a severalfold decrease in peptidase activity without affecting the particle's amidase activity.Table IIProteasomes with catalytic serine (T1S) have similar amidase activity as wild type enzymes but cleave true peptide bonds much more slowlySubstrateConstantProteasome mutantwtT1ST1CT1ASuc-LLVY-amck cat, s−10.210.1700 (amide bond-cleaved)K m, mm0.030.03k cat/K m, s−1mm−17.05.7Biotin-LLVYXXXXQQk cat, s−14.00.400K m, mm0.40.06k cat/K m, s−1mm−1105.8Biotin-XXXXXXXXQQk cat, s−13.80.4200K m, mm0.80.2k cat/K m, s−1mm−14.82.1X = any amino acid except Cys.

Molar concentrations of libraries were calculated assuming that the average molecular mass of the amino acids in each divergent position is 110 Da. k cat is defined as a number of individual peptide bonds cleaved per second. All values are the averages of at least two experiments. It is also noteworthy that at V max the wild type proteasome cleaved both peptide libraries at much greater rates (up to 20-fold faster) than Suc-LLVY-amc, which is the most widely used fluorogenic substrate of the proteasome. However, theK m for Suc-LLVY-amc was much lower, perhaps because the bulky fluorogenic amide (amc) downstream of the scissile bond allowed binding with higher affinity (Table II). It has been proposed that, aside from the N-terminal threonine, additional active sites may exist in proteasomes (34.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar, 54.Rechsteiner M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley J. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 147-189Crossref Google Scholar). Such active sites may be capable of cleaving true peptide bonds only, and they may have specificity different from the threonine sites. Therefore, they would not be evident with the standard fluorogenic substrate, Suc-LLVY-amc. However, two other active site mutants, T1A and T1C, were completely inactive against the peptide libraries. This lack of peptide hydrolysis in these mutants makes it very unlikely that proteasomes contain additional proteolytic sites, as had been proposed by some investigators (34.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar, 54.Rechsteiner M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley J. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 147-189Crossref Google Scholar). To test whether these findings with libraries of synthetic peptides can be extended to protein breakdown, we first established that the T1S mutant, like the wild type enzyme (10.Akopian T.N.

Chem. 274, 32855–32862) revealed that physical interactions between phospholamban (PLN) and the fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA1a) were retained, even with PLN monoclonal antibody 1D11 bound to an epitope lying between PLN residues 7 and 17. Because the 1D11 antibody relieves inhibitory interaction between the two proteins, it was of interest to determine whether PLN phosphorylation or elevation of Ca2+, which also relieves inhibitory interactions between PLN and SERCA, would disrupt physical interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ca2+ or after phosphorylation of PLN by protein kinase A. Physical interactions were dissociated by elevated Ca2+ but not by PLN phosphorylation. The addition of ATP enhanced interactions between PLN and SERCA. The further addition of vanadate and thapsigargin, both of which stabilize the E2 conformation, did not diminish binding of PLN to SERCA. These data suggest that physical interactions between PLN and SERCA are stable when SERCA is in the Ca2+-free E2conformation but not when it is in the E1 conformation and that phosphorylation of PLN does not dissociate physical interactions between PLN and SERCA. Previous co-immunoprecipitation studies (Asahi, M., Kimura, Y., Kurzydlowski, K., Tada, M., and MacLennan, D. H. (1999) J. Biol.

Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These proteins contain 10 transmembrane helices, which form the Ca2+ binding and transport domain, and an elaborate cytoplasmic catalytic domain in which ATP is bound and hydrolyzed to energize the conformational changes that result in Ca2+ transport. Phospholamban (PLN) is a 52-amino acid, integral membrane protein highly expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers that interacts with and, at low Ca2+ concentrations, reversibly inhibits the activity of SERCA2a by lowering its apparent affinity for Ca2+ (2.Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In its role as a modulator of the activity of the Ca2+ pump, PLN is a major regulator of the dynamics of cardiac contractility (3.Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J.

Domain IA, amino acids 1–20, is largely helical (6.Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pitzenberger S.M. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Garsky V.M. Johnson R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7603-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and contains sites of regulatory phosphorylation by protein kinase A at Ser16 and by Ca2+-calmodulin kinase at Thr17 (7.Simmerman H.K.

J. 1999; 76: 1784-1795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and contains a high proportion of amidated residues. Domain II, amino acids 31–52, forms a transmembrane helix (2.Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We have identified clusters of amino acids in both SERCA and PLN in which mutation diminishes the ability of PLN to inhibit SERCA molecules, suggesting that these residues form the sites through which SERCA2a and PLN interact. These sites of interaction include residues in cytosolic (10.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Although mutation of key cytosolic residues reduces PLN/SERCA2a inhibitory interactions, reconstitution with PLN domain IA/IB peptides has failed to show any affect on the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+(16.Sasaki T.

By contrast, domain IB-domain II constructs, from which residues 1–27 were removed or replaced, retained the ability to lower the affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1674-1679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, we have proposed that PLN and SERCA2a interact via a four (or possibly six) base circuit through which long range inhibitory interactions might be propagated among a series of cytoplasmic and transmembrane interaction sites (14.Kimura Y.

Molecular models of the mechanism by which PLN reversibly inhibits SERCA suggest that a reversible physical interaction occurs between the two proteins. James et al. (20.James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) reconstituted purified PLN and SERCA2a and showed that covalent cross-links were formed between cytosolic domains of PLN and SERCA2a only in low Ca2+ and when PLN was dephosphorylated. In a later study, Negash et al. (21.Negash S. Chen L.T. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11247-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation of PLN results in a nearly 2-fold reduction in rotational mobility of SERCA2a. These results suggest that PLN phosphorylation leads to altered interactions between PLN and SERCA2a. In this study, we have used co-immunoprecipitation with antibody 1D11 (22.Mayer E.J. McKenna E. Garsky V.M. Burke C.J. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Sardana M. Smith J.S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol.

We have also used co-immunoprecipitation with antibody 285, directed against a Ser16-phosphorylated PLN peptide (25.Mayer E.J. Huckle W. Johnson Jr., R.G. McKenna E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), to determine whether physical interactions between PLN and SERCA are retained following Ser16 phosphorylation of PLN. Enzymes for DNA manipulation were obtained from New England Biolabs and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. G-Sepharose and a chemiluminescence kit for measurement of co-immunoprecipitation were purchased from Pierce, vanadate was from Fisher Scientific, and thapsigargin was from Calbiochem. The preparation, expression, and assay of mutant PLN and SERCA1a or SERCA2a in microsomal fractions were described in earlier publications (10.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J.

Membranes were washed in TBS/0.1% Tween, and the signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Super Signal). The relative amounts of SERCA and PLN in each lane in exposed films were quantified by scanning densitometry using a Kodak X-omat Processor. Protein expression levels in all experiments were estimated by immunoblotting using antibodies A52, IID8F6, and 1D11. The elevation of Ca2+ to micromolar concentrations leads to activation of SERCA2a activity, independent of the phosphorylation state of PLN, the loss of the ability of PLN to form cross-links with SERCA2a (20.James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), or the disaggregation of PLN-regulated SERCA2a complexes (29.Voss J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 190-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The effects of elevated Ca2+ on physical interactions between PLN and SERCA1a and PLN and SERCA2a are shown in Fig.1. Elevation of Ca2+ frompCa 8 to pCa 5 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the amount of SERCA1a that was co-immunoprecipitated with antibody 1D11 directed against PLN (Fig. 1, A and B). At pCa 5, the amount of SERCA1a that was co-immunoprecipitated was reduced to about 27% of the amount co-immunoprecipitated at pCa 7. The same pattern of Ca2+-dependent inhibition was observed for the co-immunoprecipitation of SERCA2a with PLN (Fig. 1,C and D). The effects of PLN phosphorylation on co-immunoprecipitation of PLN·SERCA1a and PLN·SERCA2a complexes are shown in Fig.2. In this case, antibody 285, which is specific for Ser16-phosphorylated PLN, was used (25.Mayer E.J. Huckle W. Johnson Jr., R.G. McKenna E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 2 A show that Ser16-phosphorylated PLN forms a complex with SERCA1a that is co-immunoprecipitated with antibody 285, and the data presented in Fig. 2 B show that Ser16-phosphorylated PLN forms a complex with SERCA2a that is co-immunoprecipitated with antibody 285. It is difficult to compare the amount of SERCA that is co-immunoprecipitated by antibody 285 to that which is co-immunoprecipitated with antibody 1D11. In previous studies, we used both PLN and SERCA mutants with a range of inhibitory properties to show that there is a reasonable correlation between the amount of wild-type or mutant SERCA1a protein that is co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type or mutant PLN by antibody 1D11 and the activity of the mutant PLN·SERCA complex (15.Asahi M.

Open table in a new tab *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 against phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated wild type PLN or wild type SERCA. In Table I, Part A, column 2, the co-immunoprecipitation of SERCA1a by wild-type phosphorylated PLN is assigned a value of 1. Significantly different levels of co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type or mutant SERCA1a were observed with wild-type or mutant phosphorylated PLN, confirming that the level of co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type SERCA1a by wild-type phosphorylated PLN was not merely at a background level but lies in a range where variation, associated with different mutations, can be recorded. Co-immunoprecipitation following PLN phosphorylation was reduced compared with wild-type for mutants E2A, K3A, N27A, N30A, L31A, and N34A, but was increased compared with wild-type for mutant I40A. It is of particular interest that the fractional amount of SERCA1a co-immunoprecipitated with PLN was most strongly affected by phosphorylation for the superinhibitory, pentameric N27A and N30A mutants (column 2), when compared with the fractional amount co-immunoprecipitated by unphosphorylated PLN (column 4) (0.69 and 0.70 compared with 2.26 and 2.09). By contrast, the effect of phosphorylation on the fractional amount of SERCA1a precipitated by the superinhibitory, monomeric I40A mutant was less pronounced (1.76versus 2.45). Data presented in Table I, Part B, column 2, show that co-immunoprecipitation of the loss of function SERCA1a mutant, L802A, with phosphorylated wild-type PLN was reduced compared with wild-type SERCA1 both before and after phosphorylation of PLN. In Table I, part C, the effects of mutations in the cytosolic domain of SERCA2a on co-immunoprecipitation by wild-type phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PLN are described. These mutations were shown by Toyofuku et al. (11.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22929-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to diminish PLN-SERCA2a interactions and led to the postulate that the sequence Lys397-Asp398-Asp399-Lys400-Pro401-Val402is the binding site in SERCA2a for PLN. The double SERCA2a mutants, K397E/K400E and D398R/D399R, as well as the single mutant, P401L, all showed substantial reductions in co-immunoprecipitation by either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated wild-type PLN. The conformation of SERCA is dependent on the ligands bound to the molecule (30.Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18855-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ and ATP bind independently to SERCA, with Ca2+ driving the protein into the E1 conformation and ATP causing significant conformational changes (31.Mahaney J.E. Froechlich J.P. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4864-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both vanadate (23.Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thapsigargin (24.Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) drive SERCA molecules into a stable E2 conformation. Co-immunoprecipitation data, presented in Fig.3, show that neither vanadate nor thapsigargin affected the ability of wild-type PLN to co-immunoprecipitate either wild-type SERCA1a or wild-type SERCA2a. The addition of 5 mm ATP, in the absence of Ca2+, increased the extent of co-immunoprecipitation of both SERCA1a and SERCA2a by wild-type PLN. The addition of either vanadate or thapsigargin did not diminish this enhanced level of co-immunoprecipitation. In this study, we have examined the question of whether physical interactions are retained between PLN and SERCA2a under a variety of conditions that alter functional interactions between the two proteins or that alter the conformation of SERCA molecules. The question of whether Ca2+ disrupts physical interactions is relatively clear cut. The elevation of Ca2+ causes a reduction in the amount of either SERCA1a or SERCA2a that is co-immunoprecipitated with PLN to 27% of the amount that is co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of EDTA. This residual binding is probably a background level of interaction that is difficult to decrease under the conditions of the experiment. This result is consistent with earlier studies of Jameset al. (20.James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) who showed that cross-linking between the cytoplasmic domains of PLN and SERCA2a was disrupted by elevated Ca2+ concentrations. The mechanism might be explained by the fact that PLN binds to M6 (15.Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32855-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a key transmembrane sequence in Ca2+ binding that contributes at least 3 of 6 known ligands to binding of 2 mol of Ca2+ in SERCA1a or SERCA2a (1.MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 32.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). M6 may undergo conformational changes in the presence of Ca2+ (33.Soulie S. Neumann J.M. Berthomieu C. Moller J.V. le Maire M. Forge V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5813-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); a helical structure, extending above the Ca2+ binding cavity near the center of the transmembrane sequence in the E2 state, is converted to an extended conformation in the E1 state. Large conformational changes in M6, a key component of the transmembrane interaction site between SERCA and PLN, would provide the physical basis for dissociation of PLN from SERCA molecules in the presence of elevated Ca2+. It is not so clear whether phosphorylation of PLN, leading to loss of functional interaction (34.Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2640-2647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also leads to physical dissociation. In the experiments of James et al. (20.James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of PLN diminished the formation of cross-links between PLN Lys3and a sequence in SERCA2a that included Lys397 and Lys399. Our current results show that an antibody directed against Ser16-phosphorylated PLN can immunoprecipitate SERCA1a and SERCA2a, indicating that physical interactions are retained between PLN and SERCA molecules in the absence of functional interactions. It has not been possible to make a direct comparison of efficiency of the antibody that precipitates phosphorylated PLN (antibody 285) with the antibody that precipitates unphosphorylated PLN (1D11). However, we have been able to show that the amount of SERCA1a or SERCA2a that is co-immunoprecipitated with PLN by antibody 285 varies with a series of mutations. Thus we feel that we are not co-immunoprecipitating a background level of SERCA protein with the phosphorylated PLN. Since multiple cytosolic and transmembrane interaction sites between PLN and SERCA have been documented, it is reasonable to assume that phosphorylation might disrupt a key site in the circuit of functional interactions (14.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) without disrupting physical interactions at all sites. Thus phosphorylation at Ser16 may cause conformational changes in PLN that disrupt its ability to inhibit SERCA2a and the ability of PLN Lys3 to form cross-links to SERCA2a Lys397 or Lys400 but may not affect physical interactions at other sites in cytosolic or transmembrane domains of SERCA1a or SERCA2a. The study of mutants highlights residues that might be involved in the interaction of SERCA with phosphorylated PLN. Mutation of the Lys397 to Pro401 sequence in SERCA2a dramatically decreased the amount of mutant SERCA2a bound to phosphorylated PLN, as did the mutation of Lys3 to Ala and Glu2 to Ala in PLN. The dephospho forms of the pentameric, superinhibitory mutants, N27A and N30A, which gain both inhibitory function and physical interaction with SERCA1a (15.Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32855-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), lost 67–69% of their enhanced physical interaction when phosphorylated. By contrast, the monomeric, superinhibitory, transmembrane domain mutant, I40A, lost only 28% of its ability to co-immunoprecipitate SERCA1a when phosphorylated. Abrogation of key functional interactions between PLN and SERCA by PLN phosphorylation does not abrogate all physical interactions. Both vanadate and thapsigargin bind to SERCA, stabilizing the E2 conformation. When either SERCA1a or SERCA2a were treated with either vanadate or thapsigargin, there was no significant effect on the amount of SERCA protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with PLN. Since thapsigargin binds to the S3 stalk segment (35.Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36.Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PLN binds to M6 (15.Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32855-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that thapsigargin binds in a position where it could influence binding of PLN to M6 directly. Vanadate binds in the ATP binding site (23.Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is also unlikely to have any direct effect on PLN interaction with SERCA. Thus stabilization of the E2 conformation is the common theme for the stabilization of the interaction of SERCA with PLN by thapsigargin and vanadate. By contrast, elevation of Ca2+to as high as 10 mm (data not shown), driving SERCA into the E1 conformation, led to a dramatic reduction in the amount of SERCA that was co-immunoprecipitated with PLN. We also investigated the effects of ATP on physical interactions between PLN and SERCA. Surprisingly, ATP, in the absence of Ca2+, increased the amount of SERCA that was co-immunoprecipitated with dephospho-PLN, suggesting that it caused conformational changes in SERCA that were beneficial to the PLN/SERCA interaction. It is unlikely that these were changes driving the enzyme into the E1 conformation, because PLN binding is destabilized in the E1 conformation. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the complexity of the physical interactions that occur between PLN and SERCA. We have shown that elevated Ca2+ is very effective in disrupting PLN/SERCA physical interactions, probably through its effect on the conformation of M6, the major component in PLN/SERCA transmembrane interactions. Phosphorylation disrupts functional interactions more effectively than it disrupts physical interactions, and differences in the effects of phosphorylation on interactions between different mutant proteins might lead to a better understanding of the interaction sites that are affected following phosphorylation. Agents that stabilize the E2 conformation of SERCA, such as thapsigargin and vanadate, also stabilize physical interactions between PLN and SERCA molecules. ATP, in the absence of Ca2+, also enhances PLN/SERCA interactions, but the mechanism is unknown. We thank Dr. Robert G.

Environmental deprivation of Mg2+ activates the PhoP/PhoQ signal transduction cascade, which results in an increased expression of genes necessary for survival inside the host.

This activity depends on the intactness of the conserved His-277, suggesting that the phosphatase active site overlaps the H box. The integrity of the N-terminal domain of PhoQ was essential for the induction of the phosphatase activity, because Mg2+ did not stimulate the release of inorganic phosphate from phospho-PhoP in a fusion protein that lacks this sensing domain.

In prokaryotes and in lower eukaryotes and plants (1Perraud A.-L. Weiss V. Gross R. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the most widespread and efficient sensory-response devices rely on protein phosphotransfer. They are the so-called two-component regulatory systems that enable bacteria to monitor changes in their environment and adjust their structure and physiology accordingly to survive. The prototypical architecture of the two-component regulatory systems consists of a sensor protein and an associated effector protein (2Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995: 25-51Google Scholar, 3Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The sensor is generally a membrane protein whose C-terminal domain projects into the cytoplasm. This domain harbors a histidine autokinase activity and, in several sensors of this large family, a phosphatase activity (2Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J.

The cognate response-regulator is most often a transcriptional regulator protein. Its N-terminal domain harbors a conserved aspartate that accepts the phosphate from the phosphohistidyl residue of the sensor protein. This modification is propagated to the C-terminal domain affecting its DNA binding properties (2Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995: 25-51Google Scholar). Two major biochemical activities play an opposite role to balance the phosphorylation status of the response regulator: the autokinase activity of the sensor that defines the phosphotransfer availability and a specific phosphatase that dephosphorylates the response regulator. By modulating these reactions, the sensor component defines the phosphorylation status of the response regulator, which directs the expression of a specific set of target genes. This modulation results in the final adaptive response of the bacteria to its primary signal. Despite a considerable amount of research on different two-component systems, carried out to understand how the signal regulates the catalytic activities of the sensor to control the phosphorylation state in the effector molecule, a clear picture of this mechanism has not yet emerged. In Salmonella, the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system governs the adaptation to environmental Mg2+ deprivation and controls the expression of essential virulence factors (10Garcı́a Véscovi E.

However, it was not clear which activity or activities that reside in PhoQ were affected by the Mg2+-induced conformational switch of the sensor. In this work we examined how Mg2+, as the specific regulatory signal, controls the phosphorylation state of PhoP. We demonstrated that the interaction of Mg2+ with PhoQ activates a phosphatase activity of the sensor protein that promotes the dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoP. Stimulation by Mg2+of this phosphatase activity required the N-terminal domain of the sensor, because no phosphatase was detected in a fusion protein lacking this domain while it retained the reversible autokinase and phosphotransfer activities. These results reveal that the sensor PhoQ harbors a phosphatase activity that acts on PhoP and that this phosphatase activity is the target of the Mg2+-triggered regulation of the PhoP/PhoQ system. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Cell culture media reagents were from Difco, and chemicals were from Sigma. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) strain EG5172 (phoQ::MudJ) was transformed with plasmid pEG9050 (16Soncini F.C. Garcı́a Véscovi E. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) or with the vector pUHE21-2lacI Q (16Soncini F.C. Garcı́a Véscovi E. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These strains were used for the isolation of membranes harboring PhoQ or the control membranes, respectively. Escherichia colistrain PB1277 is BL21[DE3] carrying plasmid pPB1020. pPB1020 harbors a phoP His-tag fusion gene (full-length phoPfused to 6 His codons in its C terminus) under the control of the T7 φ10 promoter of the pT7-7 plasmid. This fusion gene was generated by polymerase chain reaction, using forward primer PhoP-NTF (5′-GAGGATCCATATGATGCGCGTACTGG-3′) and reverse primer PhoP-H6-CTR (5′-TCCAAGCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGCGCAATTCAAAAAGATATC-3′), and cloned between the NdeI and HindIII sites of plasmid pT7-7. The phoP His-tag fusion gene cloned into pUHE21-2lacI Q complemented aSalmonella phoP − strain to the same extent as the wild-type phoP. This shows that the addition of the His-tag to the PhoP C terminus does not affect its properties. 1M. E. Castelli, E. Garcı́a Véscovi, and F. C. Soncini, unpublished results. pPB1021 is a pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) derivative that encodes for the maltose binding protein fused to the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of PhoQ (MBP-Qc). The gene fusion was constructed by subcloning the phoQ fragment excised from pEG9050 encompassed between the StuI and the HindIII sites (which encodes from the Pro-220 to the C-terminal Glu-487 of PhoQ) into the vector pMAL-c2 between the XmnI and HindIII sites, respectively. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB)2 broth with shaking, and with the addition of 0.7 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when indicated. Ampicillin was used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Plasmid DNA was introduced into bacterial strains by electroporation using a Bio-Rad apparatus as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant DNA techniques were performed according to standard protocols (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To replace His-277 with Val in PhoQ, and Asp-55 with Ala in PhoP, we used the site-directed mutagenesis protocol described by Deng et al. (18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-derived constructions and site-directed mutagenesis were all confirmed by DNA sequence analysis performed using the femtomole DNA sequencing system as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Overnight cultures of S. typhimurium strains EG5172/pEG9050 and EG5172/pUHE21-2lacI Q were used to inoculate LB media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. They were then grown at 37 °C to logarithmic phase (OD 0.6) and induced by addition of 0.7 mm IPTG for an additional 3 h with shaking. Cells were collected, washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and resuspended in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% sucrose, 5 mm M EDTA, and 150 μg/ml lysozyme. After 40-min incubation at 4 °C, 20 mm MgCl2was added and cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 ×g. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and subjected to sonication. Nonruptured spheroplasts were removed by a brief centrifugation at 7000 × g, and the membrane fraction was recovered after a 45-min centrifugation at 30,000 × g. The membranes were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 m KCl and centrifuged 30 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA. Finally, the membranes were washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and resuspended in the same buffer at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The His6-tagged fusion protein PhoP-H6 was purified from strain PB1277. Expression of PhoP-H6 was achieved by addition of 0.7 mm IPTG to induce the DE3-encoded T7 RNA polymerase. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl) and subjected to sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was passed through a Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. The PhoP-H6 protein was recovered by elution with 0.5m imidazole and dialyzed exhaustively against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl. The MBP-Qc fusion protein was purified from the E. coli strain TB1 (obtained from the pMAL Protein Fusion and Purification System, NEB, Inc.) transformed with plasmid pPB1021. Expression of MBP-Qc was achieved by addition of 0.3 mm IPTG to a log-phase cell culture in LB broth. After sonication and centrifugation, the soluble cellular extract containing the MBP-Qc protein was collected and subjected to amylose affinity chromatography analysis following the manufacturer's instructions (NEB, Inc.). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The protein profile of the purified proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For the autokinase assay, membranes (50 μg of total protein) harboring PhoQ were incubated with 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (7500 cpm/pmol, NEN Life Science Products), in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl (buffer TK). Unless stated otherwise, 1 mm MgCl2 was added to the reaction medium. Reactions were started by addition of the membrane fraction, incubated 5 min at 37 °C, and stopped by addition of 6 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 9% glycerol, 10% SDS, 600 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.006% bromphenol blue). The amount of radiolabeled PhoQ increased proportionally to the amount of membrane protein used in the range from 0.16 to 2.6 μg/μl; this indicated that PhoQ was not in excess at 1.66 μg/μl, the membrane concentration used in the autophosphorylation assay. To remove remnant Mg2+, ATP, and free inorganic phosphate, the membranes containing autophosphorylated PhoQ were washed once with buffer TK with 5 mm EDTA, followed by two washes with buffer TK. This fraction was analyzed by TLC to confirm absence of residual ATP and inorganic phosphate and used to test the stability of phosphorylated PhoQ and for the PhoQ → PhoP phosphotransfer assay. The phosphotransfer assay was carried out as follows: typically, membranes (50 μg of total protein) harboring phosphorylated PhoQ were coincubated in a 30-μl total volume with 10 μg of purified PhoP-H6 in a reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mm KCl for different periods of time. MgCl2 was added to the reaction as indicated in each individual assay. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. To obtain isolated phosphorylated PhoP-H6, 10 μg of purified PhoP-H6 was added to a 30-μl final volume containing membranes (50 μg of total protein) harboring PhoQ, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (7500 cpm/pmol), and 1 mm MgCl2 in buffer TK, and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. This reaction mixture was centrifuged at 24,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C to remove the membrane fraction. The supernatant containing the phosphorylated PhoP-H6 was recovered, purified using a Ni2+-NTA agarose affinity column to eliminate remnant ATP, applied to a G-50 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer TK to remove imidazole, and immediately used to test phosphorylated PhoP stability or for the phosphatase assay. For the phosphatase assay, phosphorylated PhoP-H6 (5 μg of protein) was incubated with control membranes, membranes enriched in PhoQ or in PhoQH277V (50 μg), or with purified MBP-Qc fusion protein (5 μg) in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, at 37 °C, in the presence or absence of 1 mm MgCl2 for different periods of time as indicated in each assay. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. All reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose, and then subjected to autoradiography. When TLC analysis was performed, reactions were stopped by addition of 1% SDS, applied to a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose plate (J. T. Baker), and developed in 0.8 m LiCl, 0.8 m acetic acid as described (19Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 188-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The plates were air-dried and then exposed to autoradiography films. Additionally, the stability of phospho-PhoP-H6 or phospho-PhoQ was determined by incubating each phosphoprotein in buffer TK with addition of 1 mm EDTA or 20 mmMgCl2, at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at different time points, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, followed by autoradiography. Autoradiographies from SDS-PAGE analysis or TLC assays were densitometrically scanned to perform quantitative determinations. For the stability assays, the PhoP or PhoQ bands were cut from the gel and the incorporation of 32P was determined using a Wallac 1209 Rackbetta liquid scintillation counter. Chemical stability assays of the phosphoproteins (alkali and acid lability) were performed as described (9Shi L. Liu W. Hulett F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10119-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Binding of Mg2+ to the sensor protein PhoQ was identified as the primary event in the signal transduction cascade that results in the down-regulation of the PhoP-activated genes (10Garcı́a Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 15Véscovi E.G. Ayala Y.M. DiCera E. Grosiman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1440-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine the activities of PhoQ that are affected in response to the signal, we sought to analyze sequentially the steps that are involved in the transduction mechanism. To examine in vitro the biochemical activities of the Mg2+ sensor PhoQ, this protein was expressed from the pEG9050 plasmid. Cellular fractionation was performed to isolate the membranes that harbor the sensor protein. The electrophoretic analysis of the membrane fraction revealed a major protein band (estimated to be 5–7% of the total protein by densitometric analysis) that corresponded to the predicted mobility of PhoQ. The identity of the protein was assessed also by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (data not shown). To avoid conformational distortions or artifacts that would result from the solubilization of the membrane protein with detergents, all experiments involving PhoQ were performed with the sensor protein in its native membrane environment. This approach ensures an accurate response to different variables in the reaction medium that mimic the environmental cues that control the system. According to the two-component paradigm, PhoQ would first undergo autophosphorylation in a conserved histidine residue, and the phosphate would in turn be transferred to a conserved aspartate residue in the cognate transcriptional regulator PhoP. Indeed, we showed that incubation of the membranes with [γ-32P]ATP resulted in autophosphorylation of the sensor protein. This autokinase activity was dependent on the presence of micromolar concentrations of Mg2+, because no phosphorylation was detectable in membranes devoid of the divalent cation after exhaustive washes with EDTA (Fig. 1 A). When Mg2+ concentrations above 200 μm(demonstrated to down-regulate the system (10Garcı́a Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 11Soncini F.C. Garcı́a Véscovi E. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5092-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)) were used, the divalent cation had no inhibitory effect on the autokinase activity of PhoQ. This result showed that micromolar concentrations of Mg2+ are required for the autophosphorylation reaction, suggesting that Mg2+-ATP is the true substrate of the autokinase. Additionally, we determined that the acid lability and alkali resistance of the phosphorylated moiety corresponded to the chemical characteristics of a phosphohistidine residue (data not shown). Moreover, the PhoQH277V mutant protein, where the conserved His-277 is replaced by Val, was unable to undergo autophosphorylation, irrespective of the presence of Mg2+in the phosphorylation reaction (data not shown). This indicates that the phosphorylation takes place in the predicted conserved histidine residue. We decided to investigate the next step in the activation by phosphorylation of the response regulator PhoP. To uncouple the autokinase from the phosphotransfer reaction and to analyze the effect of Mg2+ exclusively on the latter, the membrane-bound PhoQ was first subjected to autophosphorylation. Immediately after, the membranes were exhaustively washed with EDTA to deplete the membranes of remnant Mg2+and ATP. The membranes harboring phospho-PhoQ were incubated with purified PhoP resulting in the phosphorylation of the response regulator. Chemical stability tests and site-specific mutagenesis identified amino acid Asp-55 of PhoP as the phosphorylated residue (not shown). As it is shown in the time course assays performed in the presence of different concentrations of Mg2+ (Figs.2 and 3), the initial rate of phosphotransfer is favored by increasing the concentration of the divalent cation. Strikingly, Mg2+concentrations higher than 250 μm stimulated the dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoP along the time course (Figs. 2 and3 B). A net loss of the protein-bound radiolabeled phosphate becomes evident when we compare the radioactivity associated to PhoQ (Figs. 2 and 3 A) and to PhoP (Figs. 2 and 3 B) as a function of time, for each Mg2+ concentration used. Moreover, the total protein-bound phosphate decreased up to 60% when concentrations of MgCl2 higher than 250 μmwere added to the phosphotransfer reaction and up to 90% at concentrations higher than 10 mm MgCl2 (Figs. 2and 3 C). On the other hand, when the stability of each individual phosphorylated protein was assayed, phospho-PhoQ retained a 72 ± 13% of the initial label over the 120-min period tested (irrespective of the MgCl2 concentration used), whereas phospho-PhoP showed a half-life of 64 min in the presence of 1 mm EDTA and of 60 min in the presence of 20 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 4).Figure 3Densitometric analysis of the PhoQ → PhoP phosphotransfer reaction. Autoradiographs from three independent assays like the one shown in Fig. 2 were densitometrically scanned, and the total amounts of phospho-PhoQ (A), phospho-PhoP (B), and protein-bound phosphate (C) were plotted. The average results are expressed as the ratio between the indicated phosphorylated protein and the total phospho-PhoQ present at the initial time of the phosphotransfer reaction (0 min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effect of Mg2+ on the stability of the phosphorylated PhoQ and PhoP proteins. Membranes harboring phosphorylated PhoQ depleted of Mg2+, ATP, and inorganic phosphate (0 min) were split into two equal fractions and incubated in buffer TK, with addition of 1 mm EDTA or 20 mmMgCl2, respectively. Aliquots were taken at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min, and 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and autoradiography (PhoQ-P). An identical protocol was carried out using phospho-PhoP free of ATP and inorganic phosphate as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” (PhoP-P).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results indicate that Mg2+ neither activates an autophosphatase activity of the response regulator nor promotes PhoQ dephosphorylation and strongly suggest that a Mg2+-induced phosphatase is present and acts on phosphorylated PhoP. The status of the environment as detected by the sensor is reflected by the phosphorylation state of the effector molecule. The phosphorylation status of PhoP is predicted to be due to the balance of three fundamental biochemical reactions: PhoQ autophosphorylation, the phosphotransfer from PhoQ to PhoP, and the dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoP that restores the effector protein to its original state. To examine if PhoQ was responsible for the Mg2+-induced dephosphorylation of PhoP, radiolabeled phospho-PhoP was incubated with membranes harboring unlabeled PhoQ. Surprisingly, in the absence of added Mg2+ we observed dephosphorylation of PhoP with the simultaneous phosphorylation of PhoQ, indicating that a reverse phosphotransfer from PhoP to PhoQ took place (Fig.5 A). The reverse phosphotransfer was partially inhibited by EDTA, showing that a low concentration of the divalent cation favors the reaction. However, when we added 1 mm MgCl2 to the reaction medium, dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoP took place but no phosphorylated PhoQ was detected, resulting in a net loss of the total label associated to proteins (Fig. 5 A). This effect was not due to a PhoQ-unrelated phosphatase activity present in the membrane fraction, because membranes lacking the sensor protein did not show Mg2+-stimulated phosphate release from phospho-PhoP (Fig.5 A). Moreover, this result was consistent with the PhoQ-mediated dephosphorylation of PhoP triggered in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+ previously observed in the direct phosphotransfer assay (Figs. 2 and 3). Although controlled proteolysis of native PhoQ and binding assays performed using its purified sensing domain demonstrated that extracellular Mg2+ interacts with the periplasmic domain of the sensor, thereby triggering a conformational change in the protein (10Garcı́a Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 15Véscovi E.G. Ayala Y.M. DiCera E. Grosiman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1440-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it was still unclear how this change was transduced in the modulation of the biochemical activities of PhoQ. To assess the role of the periplasmic sensing domain of PhoQ in the Mg2+-induced phosphatase activity, we constructed a fusion protein containing its cytoplasmic domain fused to the maltose binding protein (MBP-Qc). MBP-Qc was able to undergo autophosphorylation (not shown) and to receive the phosphate from PhoP analogously to wild-type PhoQ (Fig.5 A). However, the addition of Mg2+ did not promote the dephosphorylation of PhoP. A comparative densitometric analysis of a reverse phosphotransfer time course from phospho-PhoP to either PhoQ or to MBP-Qc in the presence of 1 mmMgCl2 is shown in Fig. 5 B. A net loss of label associated to the proteins was evident only when wild-type PhoQ was used (Fig. 5 C). When we analyzed by TLC the dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoP in the presence of control membranes, membranes harboring PhoQ, or MBP-Qc, we confirmed that the detected loss of label shown in Fig. 5 corresponded to the release of inorganic phosphate (Fig.6). This release was significantly enhanced only when wild-type PhoQ and 1 mmMgCl2 were present in the reaction (Fig. 6 A). The densitometric analysis shows the relative distribution of the total label between the phosphate bound to the proteins and the inorganic phosphate released in each sample (Fig. 6 B). More than 80% of the total label was released as inorganic phosphate by membrane-bound PhoQ in the presence of MgCl2, whereas less than 15% of the label was detected as inorganic phosphate in the absence of the cation. On the other hand, regardless of the concentration of Mg2+ used in the assay, more than 80% of the total radioactivity remained protein-bound when phospho-PhoP was incubated with either control membranes or MBP-Qc. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that Mg2+ triggers a specific PhoP-phosphatase activity in PhoQ that"

The distribution of CGRP within the thymus and the presence of CGRP receptors on thymocytes suggest that this neuropeptide could also regulate the maturation of T cells in the thymus. CGRP mediates its activities through interactions with specific membrane receptors. Pharmacological studies strongly suggest the existence of at least two CGRP receptors (CGRP-R). CGRP-R belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Little is known about the downstream signaling pathways used by CGRP to mediate its effects. CGRP activates adenylate cyclase leading to the induction of cAMP production. Activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C have been suggested to mediate calcium release by CGRP (8.Poyner D.R.

Although CGRP has been reported to regulate thymocyte cell proliferation and cell death, no molecular mechanism has been elucidated. In this study, using the NFκB-luciferase reporter transgenic mice, we demonstrate that CGRP is a selective inhibitor of NF-κB activity in thymocytes in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our data indicate that the down-regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity by CGRP is associated with an increase in cell death. The reporter transgenic mice expressing the luciferase gene under the control of AP-1 or NFAT-binding sites were described previously (31.Rincón M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell.

The NFκB-luciferase reporter mice were made using the pBIIX-luciferase construct with two copies (2x NF-κB) of the κB sequences from the Igκ enhancer. 2R. J. Phillips, manuscript in preparation. DP and mature CD4+ thymocytes were obtained by staining total thymocytes with directly fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and/or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Becton Dickinson FACStar Plus cell sorter). The average purity for each population was >98%. Total thymocytes or purified thymocyte populations were activated with PMA (5 ng/ml) (Sigma) and ionomycin (250 ng/ml) (Sigma) for different times. The cells were pretreated with specific concentrations of human CGRP (Peninsula, Inc., Belmomt, CA) for 30 min prior activation and remained present in the culture during the activation period. Recombinant murine TNFα (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) (100 ng/ml) was also used as apoptotic stimulus. Equivalent number of thymocytes (106 or 5 × 105 cells) for each condition were harvested, washed in PBS, and lysed (Luciferase assay, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Corp.) for 30 min at room temperature. The lysates were then analyzed using a luciferase kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and measured in a luminometer (Lumat LB9501) for 10 s (two measurements were made for each sample). Results are presented as the average of two measurements where background has been subtracted. Nuclear extracts were obtained from treated and untreated total thymocytes, DP or CD4+ thymocytes as described previously (37.Phillips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB binding reactions were carried out using 5–10 μg of nuclear proteins and a 32P double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence derived from the mouse κ intronic enhancer (GATCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAG). Supershift analysis were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with 1 μl/reaction of an anti-p50 mAb, anti-p65 mAb, or anti-c-Rel mAb (gifts from N. Rice) for 1 h at 4 °C prior to addition of the NF-κB-labeled probe. DNA binding of the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein was examined by using 2 μg of nuclear extracts and a32P ds oligonucleotide containing the CRE sequence (ATCTCTCTGACGTCAGCCAAGGAGGAGGCG) (38.Montminy M.R. Bilezikijan L.M. Nature. 1986; 328: 175-178Crossref Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The samples were then electrophoresed under standard conditions. For supershift analysis, 1 μl of the appropriate antibody was preincubated with each extract at 4 °C for 1 h prior to assay by EMSA. Immunoblot analysis was performed on 30 μg of cytoplasmic extract from treated and untreated thymocytes as described previously (37.Phillips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following fractionation by SDS-polyacryalmide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (IκBβ antiserum at 1:1500 dilution; IκBα at 1:1500 from N. Rice, or polyclonal rabbit antibodies specific for IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), or specific for phospho-IκBα (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA)). Proteins detected by the primary antibodies were finally visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly isolated thymocytes or thymocytes were cultured in the presence of medium, CGRP, or TNFα for 6 or 20 h at 37 °C and then analyzed for apoptosis, by TUNEL staining using the APO-direct kit (PharMingen), as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. CGRP has been defined as an anti-proliferative agent for T lymphocytes (13.Bulloch K. Radojcic T., Yu, R. Hausman J. Lenhard L. Baird S. Prog. Neuroendocrinimmunol. 1991; 4: 186-194Google Scholar, 17.Umeda Y. Takamiya M. Yoshizaki H. Arisawa M. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39.Boudard F. Bastide M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 29: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), andin vitro treatment of thymocytes with CGRP leads to a reduced number of viable cells (19.Sakuta H. Inaba K. Muramatsu S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 67: 103-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20.Bulloch K. Mc Ewen B.S. Nordberg J. Diwa A. Baird S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 1: 551-562Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether CGRP may also be an apoptotic stimulus rather than an antiproliferative agent, we examined whether CGRP induced apoptosis in thymocytes. Freshly isolated thymocytes were treated with different doses of CGRP for 20 h. Apoptosis was examined by TUNEL assay to measure DNA fragmentation (a hallmark of apoptosis). Although the incubation of thymocytes with medium alone caused some levels of spontaneous apoptosis, the presence of CGRP resulted in a substantial enhancement of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). CGRP maximal effect was observed at the concentration range of 10−8-10−9m. TNFα has been previously reported to induce apoptosis in several cell types including thymocytes (40.Hernandez-Caselles T. Stutman O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3999-4012PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the percentage of apoptotic cells obtained after treatment with CGRP was higher than the percentage of apoptotic cells caused by TNFα treatment (Fig.1 B). CGRP was also able to augment TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, CGRP also increased Fas-mediated thymocyte apoptosis (data not shown). These results indicated that CGRP could induce thymocyte cell death in vitro and increase susceptibility of thymocytes to death triggered by thymic environmental stimuli. To address the physiologic relevance of the regulatory role of CGRP in thymocyte cell death, we examined the effect of CGRP in vivoby administering CGRP to mice. CGRP (26.5 nmol/mouse) or PBS (as a control vehicle) was injected intraperitoneally into mice. After 24 h, the administrated dose of CGRP did not cause any obvious symptoms in the mice (data not shown). However, CGRP treatment resulted in a significant loss (30–58% reduction) of the total number of thymocytes (Fig. 1 C). After 48 h the number of thymocytes in CGRP-treated mice was comparable to the number of thymocytes in PBS-injected mice (data not shown). This transient effect observed upon injection of CGRP showed the specific and non-toxic effect of CGRP on the thymus, and it is explained by the short life of this neuropeptide in the circulation. Thus, CGRP can regulate thymocyte apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Despite the large number of studies that involve CGRP in the regulation of specific functions of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, central nervous and immune systems, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects. To determine the signaling pathways involved in CGRP-induced cell death, we examined whether CGRP could regulate the activity of NF-κB transcription factor which has been considered as an anti-apoptotic signal in several cell types including thymocytes (41.Beg A.A.

We have generated NFκB-luciferase reporter transgenic mice2 to examine NF-κB-mediated transcription in primary cells. In these mice, the luciferase reporter gene is driven by two copies of the NF-κB regulatory element. Using these mice we found that NF-κB was constitutively activated in bone marrow and spleen as expected due to the presence of B cells, but not in kidney or liver (data not shown). Interestingly, we also observed constitutive NF-κB transcriptional activity in thymocytes (Fig.2 A). We examined AP-1 and NFAT transcriptional activity in freshly isolated thymocytes using the AP1-luciferase and NFAT-luciferase reporter transgenic mice that we have previously generated (31.Rincón M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32.Rincón M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 33.Rincón M. Flavell M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34.Rincón M.

Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). No AP-1 or NFAT transcriptional activity could be detected in thymocytes (Fig. 2 A) even if a large number of cells was used (data not shown). Thus, NF-κB but not AP-1 or NFAT was transcriptionally active in freshly isolated thymocytes (Fig. 2 A). CD4−CD8− double negative thymocytes are the most immature stage in thymocyte development and constitute a minor proportion (3–5%) of total thymocytes. CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes represent the major thymic population (Fig. 2 B). DP thymocytes differentiate into mature single CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes that also represent small populations in the thymus. To examine whether NF-κB was constitutively active in these thymocyte subsets, we measured luciferase activity in double negative, DP, and CD4+ thymocytes purified from thymuses from the NFκB-luciferase reporter mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. High levels of NF-κB transcriptional activity was observed in double negative and DP thymocytes, but only very low levels were found in CD4+ thymocytes (Fig. 2 B). NF-κB therefore was constitutively active in DP thymocytes which are the predominant subset and the most susceptible to cell death. The incubation of freshly isolated thymocytes at 37 °C in the absence of stimuli resulted in a progressive decrease of the constitutive NF-κB transcriptional activity (Fig. 2 C) which correlated with a progressive increase in cell death (Fig. 2 D). The rapid decline in NF-κB activity observed in thymocytes in the absence of thymic microenvironment preceded the increase in apoptotic thymocytes (Fig. 2, C and D), consistent with an anti-apoptotic activity of this transcription factor. To examine the regulation of NF-κB by CGRP, thymocytes isolated from the NFκB-luciferase reporter transgenic mice were incubated with medium alone either in the presence or the absence of different concentrations of CGRP. We found that CGRP caused a rapid inactivation of constitutive NF-κB activity in thymocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). The level of NF-κB transcriptional activity in thymocytes incubated in the presence of CGRP was substantially lower that the level observed in thymocytes incubated with medium alone. The inhibition of NF-κB by CGRP (Fig.3 A), detectable as early as 2.5 h, was observed prior to the detection of significant levels of cell death caused by the neuropeptide (Fig. 1). We examined the effect of other neuropeptides on NF-κB activity. Thymocytes from the NFκB-luciferase reporter transgenic mice were isolated and treated in vitro with vasoactive intestinal peptide, somatostatin, or Substance P. Unlike CGRP, none of these neuropeptides significantly affected NF-κB-mediated transcription (Fig. 3 B). These results showed the specific regulation of NF-κB by the neuropeptide CGRP on thymocytes. To determine whether CGRP was able to inhibit NF-κB activity in vivo, we administered CGRP or PBS intraperitoneally into the NFκB-luciferase reporter transgenic mice. After 10 h, equal numbers of freshly isolated thymocytes isolated from CGRP or PBS-injected mice were used to measure NF-κB transcriptional activity. CGRP treatment in vivo resulted in a substantial reduction of NF-κB transcriptional activity compared with the PBS control mice (Fig. 3 C). Flow cytometry analysis showed no effect of CGRP in the distribution of thymocyte populations after 10 h of treatment, indicating that the diminished NF-κB activity was not due to changes in thymocyte populations (not shown). We also examined the effect of CGRP on NF-κB DNA binding in thymocytesin vivo. Nuclear extracts were generated from thymocytes freshly isolated from mice treated with CGRP or PBS for 10 h. NF-κB DNA binding was then examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using an oligonucleotide that contains the consensus NF-κB-binding site. In correlation with the reduction in NF-κB transcriptional activity, the constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity present in freshly isolated thymocytes was also inhibited by CGRPin vivo (Fig. 3 D). NF-κB, but not AP-1 and NFAT was constitutively activated in thymocytes (Fig. 2 A). However, both NFAT and AP-1 transcriptional activities can be induced in thymocytes upon stimulation (31.Rincón M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 47.Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. Mol. Cell.

To determine whether CGRP also inhibited transcription mediated by other nuclear factors, we examined its regulatory effects on NFAT, AP-1, and NF-κB activity in stimulated thymocytes. Total thymocytes were freshly isolated from AP1-luciferase, NFAT-luciferase, and NFκB-luciferase reporter transgenic mice and stimulated with PMA in combination with a calcium ionophore, ionomycin. The stimulation was performed in the presence or the absence of CGRP. Transcriptional activity of each factor was determined by luciferase measurements at the times indicated. AP-1, NFAT, and NF-κB transcriptional activities were induced upon activation with PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 4, A andB). However, CGRP inhibited transcription mediated by NF-κB (Fig. 4 B), but did not affect NFAT and AP-1 transcriptional activities (Fig. 4 A). The inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity by CGRP in activated cells was dose-dependent (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, these results indicated that CGRP selectively induced signals that interfere with the signaling pathway involved in the activation of NF-κB in thymocytes. DP thymocytes represent the major subpopulation within the thymus, suggesting that CGRP targets primarily this population. To determine the regulation of NF-κB by CGRP in specific thymic subpopulations, we isolated DP and CD4+ thymocytes from NF-κB-luciferase reporter mice by cell sorting. Unlike DP thymocytes, only a very low level of constitutive NF-κB transcriptional activity was detected in CD4+ thymocytes. We therefore stimulated purified DP and CD4+ thymocytes with PMA plus ionomycin to induce NF-κB activity in these populations. The stimulation was performed in the absence or presence of CGRP. NF-κB transcriptional activity was highly up-regulated upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin in both DP and CD4+ thymocytes (Fig.5 A). In correlation with the inhibition of NF-κB by CGRP observed in total thymocytes, CGRP prevented NF-κB activation in DP thymocytes (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, CGRP did not affect NF-κB mediated transcription in mature CD4+ thymocytes (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether the selective inhibition of the NF-κB transcriptional activity in DP thymocytes by CGRP was caused by blocking the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, we examined NF-κB DNA binding. Total thymocytes or purified DP and CD4+ thymocytes were stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin in the presence or absence of CGRP. After 4 h, nuclear extracts were isolated and NF-κB DNA binding was examined by EMSA. In correlation with the effect of CGRP on NF-κB transcriptional activity (Fig.4 A), the presence of CGRP caused a significant reduction of the level of nuclear NF-κB complexes in activated total thymocytes (Fig. 5 B). No difference was observed in the levels of the CREB nuclear factor, demonstrating the specific effect of CGRP on the accumulation of NF-κB nuclear complexes. NF-κB DNA binding was also induced in both DP and CD4+ thymocytes (Fig.5 B). However, CGRP inhibited the accumulation of NF-κB complexes in the nucleus of DP thymocytes, but did not affect the presence NF-κB complexes in CD4+ thymocytes. Together these results indicated that CGRP prevented the activation of NF-κB selectively in DP thymocytes. To determine the effect of CGRP on the composition of the NF-κB complexes, NF-κB DNA binding reactions were performed in the absence or the presence of mAb against specific NF-κB family members. NF-κB DNA binding was abrogated by an anti-p50 mAb or by a combination of both p65 and anti-c-Rel mAbs in thymocytes activated in the absence of CGRP (Fig. 5 C). These results indicated that the NF-κB complexes in thymocytes contain p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel heterodimers. Although very low levels of NF-κB DNA binding could be detected in thymocytes stimulated in the presence of CGRP, heterodimers of p50/p65 or p50/c-Rel also appeared to be the major components of the NF-κB complexes. Therefore, CGRP interfered with the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB complexes but not the composition of the complexes. The activation of NF-κB requires the degradation of IκB proteins which normally retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm preventing nuclear translocation (49.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of CGRP on the levels of both IκBα and IκBβ which are known to"

Chem. 1975; 250: 2640-2647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits the activity of SERCA2a at low Ca2+ concentrations by lowering its apparent affinity for Ca2+. Inhibition is overcome by phosphorylation of PLN by either protein kinase A or Ca2+-calmodulin kinase (3.Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2640-2647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4.Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). That PLN regulates left ventricular basal contractile parameters and their responses to β-agonists has been demonstrated through the analysis of the function of myocytes infused with an antibody against PLN (5.Sham J.S. Jones L.R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1344-H1349PubMed Google Scholar), of PLN-null mice (6.Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 7.Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and of mice overexpressing wild-type (wt) PLN (8.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Hemodynamic tests proved that the ablation of PLN is associated with significant increases in intraventricular systolic pressure, in the rate of change of both positive (+dP/dt) and negative (−dP/dt) hemodynamic pressure, and in τ, a measure of the rate of cardiac muscle relaxation. These elevated parameters could be stimulated only minimally with the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (9.Kiss E. Edes I. Sato Y. Luo W. Liggett S.B. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H785-H790PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the 2-fold overexpression of wt PLN in transgenic mice resulted in an inhibition of Ca2+transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, decreased Ca2+kinetics, contractile parameters in transgenic ventricular myocytes, and depressed basal left ventricular systolic function in vivo (8.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Wild-type PLN exists in pentameric and monomeric forms (10.Jones L.R. Simmerman H.K. Wilson W.W. Gurd F.R. Wegener A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7721-7730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but mutations in one face of the PLN transmembrane helix, including Leu37 to Ala (L37A) and Ile40 to Ala (I40A), lead to monomer formation (11.Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12.Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These mutations also enhance the inhibitory function of PLN, leading to the proposal that monomeric PLN is the inhibitory species (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 14.Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This view has been supported by measurement of the monomer concentration in membranes (15.Reddy L.G. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7649-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If the monomer is the inhibitory species, the superinhibitory function of monomeric mutant forms of PLN can be explained, at least in part, by mass action, since the normal PLN pentamer to monomer ratio of about 10:1 is reduced to less than 1:10 (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). PLN mutants N27A and N30A are also superinhibitors, even though they are not monomeric (16.Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have proposed that these mutant PLN pentamers dissociate normally and inhibit as monomers, but the monomer has enhanced affinity for SERCA2a (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 16.Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Anomalous mutants have also been described. The C41A mutant is about 75% monomeric but does not gain inhibitory function at 25 °C (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C41F mutant is largely monomeric at 37 °C (17.Fujii J. Maruyama K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but loses partial inhibitory function in vitro(18.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (19.Chu G. Dorn G.W., II Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), when compared with controls. The studies of Luo et al. (6.Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) have shown that PLN ablation, which results in chronic relief of the inhibitory properties of PLN, alters cardiac function but does not lead to cardiomyopathy. As a corollary, it was of interest to determine whether chronic high inhibition of SERCA2a by superinhibitory, monomeric forms of PLN might affect cardiac function and possibly lead to cardiomyopathy. Accordingly, we created transgenic mice in which L37A and I40A are overexpressed. Overexpression results in a dramatic shift to lower affinity in the range over which Ca2+ is regulated, compared with overexpression of similar amounts of wild-type PLN (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements and studies of myocytes support the view that the transgenic overexpression of the L37A and I40A superinhibitory forms of PLN impairs cardiac contractility. The mutations L37A and I40A were introduced into rabbit PLN cDNA as described previously (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The construct used previously was modified by the addition of an XhoI restriction endonuclease site at the 5′ end and by modification of the region to a consensus translation initiation sequence (20.Kozak M. Nature. 1984; 308: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) for efficient mRNA translation. The 5′ nucleotide sequence, used as a forward primer in PCR amplification of the clone, was 5′-CTG TTA CTC GAG GCC ACC ATG GAG AAA GTT C-3′. AHindIII restriction endonuclease site was introduced into the 3′ end of the clone using the reverse PCR primer 5′-CTG TCA AGA AGC TTA GTC AGA GAA GCA TGA CGA TG-3′). The amplified DNA fragments were ligated into the SalI andHindIII sites of plasmid pC126 (21.Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) downstream of the 5.5-kb mouse cardiac α-MHC promoter and upstream of the poly(A) signal sequence from the human growth hormone. The presence of the mutations and the sequences of the expression constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. The complete 6.3-kb expression constructs were excised from the plasmid vector byNotI restriction endonuclease digestion, gel-purified, and extracted from the gel using a Qiaquick DNA purification kit (Qiagen). DNA samples were then introduced by microinjection into the pronuclei of one-cell-stage C57BL/6 × CBA murine embryos (in the laboratory of Dr. F. Jirik, University of British Columbia) to generate transgenic mice. Mice carrying the mutated PLN transgene were identified by the presence in DNA extracted from tail tips of a 6.243-kb BamHI restriction fragment that included most of the α-MHC promoter sequence, the 159-bp PLN coding sequence (including the stop codon), and the 3′ end of the human growth hormone cDNA sequence. A 1.108-kb DNA fragment, cut from the middle of the α-MHC promoter sequence between restriction sites SphI andEcoRI, was used as a probe for non-radioactive genomic Southern and slot-blot analysis. The probe was labeled (22.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) with dioxygenin-11-dUTP following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hybridized to DNA on positively charged membranes, as described by Hauge and Goodman (23.Hauge B.M. Goodman H.M. Koncz C. Chua N.-H. Shell J. Methods in Arabidopsis Research. World Scientific Publishing Corp., Singapore1992Google Scholar), except that 1% bovine serum albumin was replaced by 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected on membranes with CDP-Star as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Since the endogenous α-MHC gene yielded a 6035-bp BamHI fragment in which 5439 bp were from the promoter region and thus were identical to the transgene, this fragment hybridized to the same probe in wild-type animals. The copy number of the construct was estimated by comparison of densitometric scans of lanes in Southern blots of DNA samples from transgenic mice with those from wt mice in which the copy number of the endogenous α-MHC gene was assumed to be 2. A 500-bp PCR product that covered the junction between the α-MHC promoter and PLN-encoding sequences was generated using the forward primer (MHC, 5′-CAG CCT CTG CTA CTC CTC TTC CTG CCT GTT C-3′) and the reverse primer (PLN, 5′-GAC GTG CTT GTT GAG GCA TTT CAA TGG TG AGG-3′) and used for the routine identification of L37A, I40A, and wtOE transgene-positive animals. Transgenic mice in which wt PLN is overexpressed 2-fold (wtOE) were used as a control for the overexpression of superinhibitory mutant PLN (8.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The PLN L37A and PLN I40A transgenic mice, produced in the laboratory of Dr. F. Jirik, were primarily on a C57BL/6 genetic background owing to five backcrosses with C57BL/6, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing the murine wt PLN, produced in the laboratory of Dr. E. Kranias, were on an FVB/N background. Thus only first generation C57BL/6 × FVB/N heterozygotes overexpressing either wild-type or superinhibitory transgenes were studied wherever a common genetic background was required for comparison of the effects of the transgene. In most experiments, first generation C57BL/6 × FVB/N wt animals expressing normal amounts of wt PLN were included as controls. Animals 12–16 weeks old were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Hearts were excised and frozen within seconds in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. The frozen hearts were powdered under liquid N2 with a chilled mortar and pestle, and microsomal fractions were prepared as described previously (24.Harrer J. Kiss E. Kranias E. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 995-997PubMed Google Scholar), except that the homogenizing buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 μm CaCl2, 0.3 mm sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete™ protease mixture. The apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a was determined from measurement of the Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ transport, as described previously (18.Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Relative levels of expression of pentameric and monomeric PLN were determined by SDS-PAGE of measured amounts of cardiac microsomes at several dilutions, followed by densitometric analysis of Western blots using monoclonal antibody 1D11 against PLN (a gift from Drs. Robert Johnson and Edward McKenna, Merck). Binding of primary antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ventricular myocyte isolation procedures were modified from a previously described protocol (25.Wolska B.M. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1250-H1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (6.5 mg, intraperitoneal); aortas of excised hearts were cannulated in ice-cold Ca2+-free Tyrode buffer, and the hearts were attached to a Langendorff perfusion apparatus. The composition of Tyrode was as follows: 118 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mmMgCl2, and 30 mm taurine. Hearts were perfused at 2 ml/min at 37 °C with oxygenated, Ca2+-free Tyrode for 3 min, followed by 25 μm Ca2+/Tyrode containing a mixture (2:1) of type 2 and type 1 collagenase (Worthington) totaling 0.5 mg/ml and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). When the heart became flaccid, the left ventricle was cut into 6–8 pieces, pipette-dissociated, and filtered through 250-μm nylon mesh. Cells were washed sequentially in 100 μmCa2+, 200 μm Ca2+, and 1 mm Ca2+ and resuspended in 1.8 mmCa2+-Tyrode solution. Typical isolations yielded at least 30% rod-shaped cells in 1 mm Ca2+-Tyrode. Ventricular myocytes, suspended in 1.8 mmCa2+-Tyrode, were placed in a Plexiglas chamber on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot 200). Myocytes were stimulated at 0.5 Hz with a Grass S5 stimulator (pulse duration of 4 ms), and a video edge detector (Crescent Electronics) was used to track myocyte contractions. Signals were recorded and analyzed using a Delta Scan-1 dual-beam spectrophotofluorometer and Felix software (Photon Technologies Inc.). Myocyte length, fractional shortening, shortening rate (+dL/dt), and relengthening rate (−dL/dt) were determined for an average of nine myocytes from each heart. A single heart was considered as a single sample. The average age of the mice was 17.6 weeks. Mice were anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine (50–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (3–6 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. After achieving full anesthesia, mice were placed in a supine position. The right carotid artery was isolated and cannulated with a polyethylene tube (PE-200) stretched to an outer diameter of 150–300 μm and a 20–30-μm wall thickness. The polyethylene catheter was connected to a TXD-310 low compliance pressure transducer (MicroMed, Louisville KY) and amplified by a blood pressure analyzer (BPA model 300, MicroMed, Louisville, KY). The pressure recording system had a 28 ± 2-Hz roll-off frequency measured at −3 db, which might be expected to produce some distortion of our pressure recordings. After insertion of the catheter into the carotid artery, the catheter was advanced into the aorta and then into the left ventricle to record the aortic and ventricular pressures. The parameters measured and analyzed were heart rate, aortic pressure, left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure, LV diastolic pressure, and the maximum and minimum first derivatives of the LV pressure (+dP/dt max and −dP/dt max, respectively). Both +dP/dt max and −dP/dt max give a measure of the contractility of the heart, whereas −dP/dt max is also strongly influenced by the rate of pressure relaxation. To complement the −dP/dt max estimates, the time constants for pressure relaxation were also estimated by fitting the relaxation phase of the pressure traces (from 30 to 80% of the peak systolic pressure) to a monoexponential. Some pressure recordings (n = 3 or 4 in each group) were also made using a 1.4 French Millar catheter (Millar Inc., Houston) connected to an amplifier (TCP-500, Millar Inc.), The pressure signals were filtered at 300 Hz (3 db), recorded using an A/D data acquisition board (2801A, Data Translation, Marlboro, MA) at a 1-kHz sampling rate and stored in the computer for later analysis. No significant difference in peak pressure was observed between the two recording methods. However, the maximum ±dP/dtwas about 18% lower for the fluid-filled catheters than the Millar-based measurements. Only the pressure recordings made using the fluid-filled catheters were included in the analyses reported below. M-mode and Doppler echocardiography were performed for non-invasive assessment of left ventricular (LV) function and dimensions, using previously described methods (26.Hoit B.D. Khoury S.F. Kranias E.G. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were lightly anesthetized with 2.5% avertin (0.01 ml/g) intraperitoneally and were allowed to breathe spontaneously. The chest was shaved, acoustic coupling gel was applied to the left precordium, and a warming pad was used to maintain normothermia. Mice were imaged in a shallow left lateral decubitus position using an Interspec Apogee X-200 ultrasonograph with a 9-MHz imaging and a 5–7.5-MHz pulsed-wave Doppler transducer. Studies were performed at base line and after the administration of 2.0 μg/g isoproterenol intraperitoneally. Left ventricular percent fractional shortening, velocity of circumferential shortening corrected for heart rates at matched heart rates, and end diastolic wall thickness/cavity radius ratio were calculated as described previously (8.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 26.Hoit B.D. Khoury S.F. Kranias E.G. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). LV mass was calculated using M-mode LV measurements according to American Society of Echocardiography conventions and the modified American Society of Echocardiography-cube LV mass equation (27.Devereux R.B. Alonso D.R. Lutas E.M. Gottlieb G.J. Campo E. Sachs I. Reichek N. Am. J. Cardiol. 1986; 57: 450-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5607) Google Scholar), as described previously (8.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 26.Hoit B.D. Khoury S.F. Kranias E.G. Ball N. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The feasibility of the use of cardiac ultrasound in the in vivo assessment of LV mass in mice has been shown in a necropsy validation study (28.Manning W.J. Wei J.Y. Katz S.E. Litwin S.E. Douglas P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1672-H1675PubMed Google Scholar). Hearts were excised and frozen within seconds in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. The frozen hearts were powdered under liquid N2 with a chilled mortar and pestle, and microsomal fractions were prepared as described under “Calcium Uptake Assays,” except that 50 mm sodium fluoride and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, were added to the homogenizing buffer to inhibit phosphatase activity. Relative levels of phosphorylation of pentameric and monomeric PLN were determined by SDS-PAGE of cardiac microsomes at several dilutions, followed by densitometric analysis of Western blots using antibodies specific against PLN-peptide-Thr(P)17 and PLN-peptide-Ser(P)16 (rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PLN phosphoserine peptide or PLN phosphothreonine peptide (number 010-12/010-13, PhosphoProtein Research). Binding of primary antibody was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected on membranes with CDP-Star as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The number of mice (n) used in each study are indicated. Statistical analysis was performed by t test between wild-type and transgenic mice. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To create the PLN L37A founder mice, 290 embryos were injected; 142 embryos were implanted, and 10 pups were born. One of two positive pups died early, and the other founded the line used in this study. For PLN I40A mice, 286 embryos were injected, 159 embryos were implanted, and 20 pups were born. Of these, 5 were positive, but 3 did not transmit or showed poor expression levels; 1 line could not be propagated, and the other founded the line used in this study. This resulted in one transgenic line for each of the PLN mutant constructs that could be propagated for further analysis. However, the L37A and I40A lines have similar phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, so that creation of two comparable lines from two comparable mutations makes insertional mutagenesis and inter-line variability of phenotypes unlikely. The founders of both transgenic lines and their progeny did not appear to differ from their littermates in either behavior or reproductive ability. In the Southern blots shown in Fig.1 B, the presence of a heavily stained 6243-bp BamHI fragment representing most of the α-MHC promoter, the PLN coding sequence, and part of the human growth hormone sequence in the transgene vector was used to identify transgenic mice. In control lanes, a weakly stained 6035-bpBamHI fragment, which overlaps the mobility of the 6243-bp transgene fragment, represents the endogenous murine α-MHC gene, and the level of staining is equivalent to two copies of the gene. The level of hybridization of the probe to the endogenous α-MHC gene fragment in wt mice compared with the level of hybridization of the probe to the transgenic α-MHC gene fragment revealed that the L37A and I40A transgenes were integrated into the mouse genome at copy numbers of about 20 and 15, respectively. The expression of monomeric mutant PLN in cardiac microsomes from transgenic mice was assessed by Western blotting with the PLN-specific monoclonal antibody, 1D11. In previous experiments on the transient expression of L37A and I40A in HEK-293 cells, L37A was 94% monomeric, whereas I40A was 100% monomeric (13.Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus any increase in PLN monomer content in L37A and I40A transgenic mice could be attributed to the expression of these mutant transgenes. Data presented in Fig.2 and TableI show that content of pentameric PLN was constant in microsomal fractions from wt, L37A, and I40A transgenic lines, whereas the content of pentameric PLN was increased about 2-fold in the wtOE line, as described previously (8.Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The content of monomeric PLN was also constant for wt and wtOE lines at about 5.5–5.7% of total PLN. In the L37A line, however, the distribution between monomer and pentamer was increased to 40.5% and in I40A to 46.2% of total PLN (Table I). The overall increase in PLN expression for the L37A line was about 1.54-fold, and the increase in monomeric PLN was about 11-fold. The overall increase in PLN expression for the I40A line was about 1.71-fold, and the increase in monomeric PLN was about 13-fold.Table IRelative expression and phosphorylation of pentameric and monomeric PLN in cardiac microsomes from wt and L37A, I40A, and wtOE transgenic linesRelative pentamer contentRelative monomer contentMonomer contentRelative phosphorylation of pentameric Ser16Relative phosphorylation of pentameric Thr17% totalwt1.000.065.71.001.00L37A0.970.6640.51.861.24I40A0.920.7946.22.391.63wtOE1.900.115.50.740.58Equal aliquots of microsomal fractions from three pooled hearts from each mouse line (wt; L37A: I40A; wt OE) were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by densitometric analysis of Western blots using monoclonal antibody 1D11 against PLN (see Fig. 2). Binding of primary antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL detection reagents. The content of pentameric PLN in each line was normalized to pentameric wt (1.0). The content of monomeric PLN is presented relative to pentamer for each line and as a percent of total PLN in that line. The relative amount of pentameric Ser16 and Thr17 phosphorylation in each line (normalized to 1.0 for pentameric wt) was determined by densitometric analysis of Western blots using antibodies specific against PLN-peptide-Ser(P)16 or PLN-peptide-Thr(P)17 (rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PLN phosphoserine peptide or PLN phosphothreonine peptide). Binding of primary antibody was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies with CDP-Star, as described by the manufacturer."
https://openalex.org/W2032790265,"The protein catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) is a reverse transcriptase (RT) that utilizes an internal RNA molecule as a template for the extension of chromosomal DNA ends. In all retroviral RTs there is a conserved tyrosine two amino acids preceding the catalytic aspartic acids in motif C, a motif that is critical for catalysis. In TERTs, however, this position is a leucine, valine, or phenylalanine. We developed and characterized a robustin vitro reconstitution system for Tetrahymenatelomerase and tested the effects of amino acid substitutions on activity. Substitution of the retroviral-like tyrosine in motif C did not change overall enzymatic activity but increased processivity. This increase in processivity correlated with an increased affinity for telomeric DNA primer. Substitution of an alanine did not increase processivity, while substitution of a phenylalanine had an intermediate effect. The data suggest that this amino acid is involved in interactions with the primer in telomerase as in other RTs, and show that mutating an amino acid to that conserved in retroviral RTs makes telomerase more closely resemble these other RTs.

The data suggest that this amino acid is involved in interactions with the primer in telomerase as in other RTs, and show that mutating an amino acid to that conserved in retroviral RTs makes telomerase more closely resemble these other RTs. telomerase reverse transcriptase human immunodeficiency virus polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase wild type nucleotide dithiothreitol Telomeres form a protective cap on chromosome ends and are usually composed of short G-rich DNA repeats complexed with proteins (1Blackburn E.H.

The evolutionary conservation of TERT1 suggested that it and the telomerase RNA form a core catalytic unit. This was supported by experiments in which in vitro translated TERT and the telomerase RNA were sufficient to reconstitute both human and Tetrahymena telomerase activity (15Collins K. Gandhi L. Proc.

The derived amino acid sequences of the TERT proteins contain motifs common to all reverse transcriptases, consistent with the role of telomerase in RNA-templated DNA polymerization (23Nakamura T.M. Cech T.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 587-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Within these reverse transcriptase motifs is an invariant trio of aspartic acids that are directly involved in catalysis (24Jacobo-Molina A. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6351-6356Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these three aspartic acids in yeast or human TERT abolished telomerase activity in vitro and in vivo, confirming the importance of the RT motifs for telomerase catalysis (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 10Harrington L. Zhou W. McPhail T. Oulton R. Yeung D.S. Mar V.

Tahara E. Saito M. Ito K. Nakamura H. Nakanishi T. Tahara E. Ide T. Ishikawa F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). While the basic RT catalytic mechanism is undoubtedly conserved in telomerase, there are many features of telomerase that distinguish it from other RTs. The current model for the in vitro action of Tetrahymena telomerase (27Greider C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4572-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig.1. The 3′ end of the DNA primer first base pairs with the telomerase RNA, and the primer is then extended using the RNA as a template. When the end of the 9-nucleotide (nt) template region is reached, the primer either dissociates from the complex, or translocates on the RNA template and realigns for another round of elongation. In contrast, retroviral RTs do not form stable complexes with the RNA template, and they catalyze processive DNA synthesis that does not normally involve translocation of the template relative to the primer (for an informative exception, see Ref. 29Ricchetti M. Buc H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14970-14983Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The amino acids that are unique to telomerase presumably contribute to these differences. Even within the RT motifs, TetrahymenaTERT and the RT from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV RT) share only 16% amino acid sequence identity. Outside these motifs the sequences are even less conserved, and the TERTs have long amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions that are absent in HIV RT. It is therefore of interest to study the details of telomerase action to determine similarities and differences from what is already known of the mechanisms of other RTs. One amino acid that differs between telomerase and other RTs is located two residues prior to the two conserved catalytic aspartic acids in RT motif C (Fig. 2). This residue is a leucine, valine, or phenylalanine in all TERTs identified to date, while it is a tyrosine in 29 out of 29 retroviral RTs (30Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this tyrosine is critical for catalytic activity of the retroviral RTs. Mutation of this residue to alanine or serine in either HIV RT or murine leukemia virus RT reduced reverse transcriptase activity to 1–7% of wild type (wt) levels (31Larder B.A. Purifoy D.J. Powell K.L. Darby G. Nature. 1987; 327: 716-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 32Harris D. Kaushik N. Pandey P.K. Yadav P.N.S. Pandey V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33624-33634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Harris D. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9630-9640Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Kaushik N. Singh K. Alluru I. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutation of the tyrosine to phenylalanine led to a more modest reduction of HIV RT activity (22–30% of wt levels; Refs. 32Harris D. Kaushik N. Pandey P.K. Yadav P.N.S. Pandey V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33624-33634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and 33Harris D. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9630-9640Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and had no effect on murine leukemia virus RT activity (34Kaushik N. Singh K. Alluru I. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure of HIV RT provides a plausible explanation for these effects. The shape of the protein resembles a right hand, with a large cleft between the “fingers” and “thumb” domains in which the template and primer nucleic acids bind (35Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 36Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The tyrosine of motif C protrudes into this cleft and forms several contacts with the template and primer: two carbon atoms in its side chain phenyl ring show hydrophobic interactions with the deoxyribose of the terminal primer nucleotide (37Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Jacobo-Molina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and the hydroxyl group on its side chain hydrogen bonds with atoms in the penultimate primer nucleotide (37Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Jacobo-Molina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 38Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). It was hence postulated that the tyrosine is involved in precisely positioning the template-primer relative to the active site (37Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Jacobo-Molina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of the tyrosine with a phenylalanine (which lacks a hydroxyl group) would eliminate the hydrogen bond to the primer, and substitution of an amino acid lacking a phenyl ring such as alanine or serine would further reduce interaction with the primer. It is therefore curious that the TERT proteins do not need a tyrosine at this site for activity. In order to further investigate the role of this amino acid (Leu-813) in Tetrahymena telomerase action, we mutated it to tyrosine, phenylalanine, and alanine. The tyrosine mutant (L813Y), while not showing any change in telomerase activity level, did show an increase in enzyme processivity. This is an unusual case where a single amino acid substitution provides an “improvement” in enzyme action. Because this substitution does not occur in any of the nine TERTs that have been identified, we propose that it may be advantageous to telomerases to synthesize rather small numbers of repeats in a single enzymatic cycle. The cloning of the T. thermophila TERT gene has been described (14Bryan T.M. Sperger J.M. Chapman K.B. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A synthetic Tt_TERT gene was constructed in order to correct the 66 Tetrahymena Glu codons (TAA and TAG) to the universal genetic code and to change the codon usage to more closely resemble that of both Escherichia coli and rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). 469 of the 3351 base pairs of the gene were changed without changing any encoded amino acids. The sequence of the synthetic gene is available from the authors upon request. A set of 42 100-mer oligonucleotides was synthesized on an ABI DNA synthesizer. These oligonucleotides spanned the Tt_TERT gene, with each alternate oligonucleotide representing the sense and antisense strands of the gene, respectively, and a 20-nt overlap between them. A combination of two approaches was used to assemble the gene. In the first approach, adjacent pairs of 100-mer oligonucleotides were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing short (24 nt) oligonucleotides complementary to the ends of the 100-mers, and the enzyme Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting PCR products were combined in pools of adjacent pairs and subjected to another round of PCR using the short primers. This process was repeated for 5 rounds of PCR, resulting in a single product of 2 kilobases representing the 5′-half of the gene, which was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the vector pCR-ScriptTM (Stratagene). In the second approach, all 42 100-mers were combined in one tube, extended with Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs), ligated, and run on a 1% agarose gel. The smear at around 600–800 base pairs was cut out of the gel, purified with a gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and amplified with short PCR primers, spaced about 600 base pairs apart in the 3′-half of the gene sequence. The resulting fragments were digested with restriction enzymes, ligated, and cloned into the HindIII and HincII sites of pCR-ScriptTM. The inserts from the two plasmid constructs were combined to form the complete gene. Sequencing of the entire insert revealed 19 PCR-induced errors, which were repaired by site-directed mutagenesis (39Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar, 40Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The insert was then subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pET-28a expression vector (Novagen). Mutant versions of synthetic Tt_TERT in pET-28a were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (39Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar, 40Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The presence of the mutation and the lack of any second site mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Tt_TERT was expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate kit (Promega). In a typical 400-μl reaction, 8 μg of pET-28a-TERT DNA was incubated with 432 ng (8 pmol) in vitro transcribed telomerase RNA (see below), 32 μl of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl; NEN Life Science Products Inc.), and other kit components as recommended by the manufacturer, at 30 °C for 60 min. Translation reactions were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The telomerase complex was either used in a telomerase assay directly from the translation reaction, or first purified on agarose beads coupled to antibodies to the T7-tag encoded by the pET-28a expression vector. Immunopurification was carried out as follows. T7-tag antibody-agarose beads (Novagen; 100 μl) were washed 4 times in 1.5 ml of Wash Buffer-100 (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm potassium glutamate), centrifuging at 1,500 ×g for 2 min between washes. The beads were incubated twice with 1 ml of Blocking Buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05 mg/ml glycogen, 0.1 mg/ml yeast RNA) for 15 min at 4 °C with agitation. Reticulocyte lysate translation reaction (350 μl) was added to 350 μl of Blocking Buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any particulates. The supernatant from that spin was added to the 100 μl of blocked beads and agitated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed 4 times in 1.3 ml of Wash Buffer-300 (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 300 mm potassium glutamate), 2 times in 1.3 ml of TMG (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol), and resuspended in 100 μl of TMG to make a 1:1 slurry. To check protein recovery, 1.5 μl of the slurry or 2.5 μl of the original translation reaction was added to Laemmli's sample buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 0.72 mβ-mercaptoethanol), heated to 100 °C for 3 min, and electrophoresed in an 8% polyacrylamide/SDS gel (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). The gel was fixed in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min, dried at 80 °C, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen overnight. The amount of full-length protein was calculated by comparison to [35S]methionine standards spotted onto the dried gel (spots were placed on the front and back of the gel and their intensity averaged). Immunopurification typically recovered 15–25% of the full-length TERT protein present in the original translation reaction, resulting in a final full-length TERT concentration of 2–10 nm in the 1:1 bead slurry. A plasmid containing the Tetrahymena telomerase RNA gene, a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase and a hammerhead ribozyme self-cleavage domain to process the 5′ end of the RNA was constructed as described (43Zaug A.J. Cech T.R. RNA. 1995; 1: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was digested with the enzyme Ear1, which cuts at the 3′ end of the telomerase RNA gene. Linearized plasmid (25 μg) was transcribed in a 500-μl reaction containing 40 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 10 mmDTT, 2 mm spermidine, 1 mm each rNTP, and 25 μl of T7 RNA polymerase (1 mg/ml), at 37 °C for 60 min. Hammerhead cleavage was stimulated by the addition of an extra 10 mmMgCl2 and incubation at 50 °C for 30 min. The reaction was centrifuged briefly at 16,000 × g to remove the precipitate, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 100 μl of loading buffer (0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol in formamide). The entire reaction was heated to 70 °C for 10 min, loaded on a 1.5-mm thick 4% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel and electrophoresed at 25 W for 1 h. UV shadowing allowed visualization of the band representing processed RNA, which was then excised and the RNA was eluted in 1 ml of TEN (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m NaCl) at 4 °C overnight before ethanol precipitation. T. thermophilastrain B7 (from the American Type Culture Collection) was grown vegetatively and harvested as described (14Bryan T.M. Sperger J.M. Chapman K.B. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). S100 extracts were made from the cells as described (6Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1987; 51: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The extracts were partially purified on a 2-ml DEAE-agarose (Bio-Rad) column. The column was equilibrated with TMG before loading 5 ml of S100 extract, washed with 6 ml of TMG plus 0.2 m potassium glutamate, and eluted with 12 ml of TMG plus 0.35 m potassium glutamate in 1-ml fractions. Fractions containing active telomerase were pooled, dialyzed against TMG at 4 °C overnight, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. A standard telomerase assay included 10 μl of partially purified Tetrahymena extract, reticulocyte lysate translation reaction, or 1:1 slurry of immunopurification beads (see above). Where different translation reactions or immunopurifications were being assayed in the same experiment, the amounts used were adjusted in order to equalize their TERT protein contents. Typical reactions contained full-length TERT to a concentration of 1–5 nm. A standard 20-μl telomerase assay included 1 × Telomerase Buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT), 250 nm to 1 μm primer [(G4T2)3], 100 μmdTTP, and 10 μm [α-32P]dGTP at 80 Ci/mmol (0.4 μl of nonradioactive dGTP at 450 μm and 1.6 μl of [α-32P]dGTP at 10 μCi/μl, 800 Ci/mmol). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and terminated by the addition of 80 μl of TES (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS). The reaction was phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer (0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol in formamide). A 2.5-μl portion was loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide, 8 murea sequencing gel and electrophoresed in 1 × TBE at 50 watts for 2 h. The gel was dried at 80 °C and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen. As a control for recovery and loading, a 100-mer oligonucleotide (or an 18-mer for assays of Tetrahymenaextracts) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and 5,000 cpm was added to the reaction prior to phenol/chloroform extraction. As a size marker, (G4T2)3 primer was labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and either [α-32P]dGTP or [α-33P]ddGTP, and 5,000 or 10,000 cpm, respectively, were loaded on the gel. For the pulse-chase telomerase assays (Figs. 4 A and E, and 7, A and D) a 5′ biotinylated primer ((G4T2)3) (Integrated DNA Technologies) was used as a substrate. The biotinylated primer (250 nm) was incubated with immunopurified telomerase (the volume adjusted to result in equal protein concentrations) under standard assay conditions (1 × Telomerase Buffer (see above), 100 μm dTTP, and 10 μm[α-32P]dGTP, 80 Ci/mmol) for 2 min at 30 °C. A “chase” of 40 μm non-biotinylated (G4T2)3 or (G4T2)5G primer was then added, and incubation at 30 °C continued for a total of 10, 20, or 30 min. A control with no chase and a control in which non-biotinylated chase primer was added prior to incubation were both incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. All reactions were terminated with 80 μl of TES, extracted with 100 μl of phenol/chloroform, and the biotinylated primer was recovered on magnetic Streptavidin Dynabeads (Dynal) as follows. Dynabead slurry (50 μl; 10 mg/ml) was prewashed twice in 50 μl of 0.1 m NaOH, 0.05 m NaCl, once in 50 μl of 0.1m NaCl, once in 50 μl of 2 × Binding Buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mNaCl) and then resuspended in 100 μl 2 × Binding Buffer. The 100 μl of phenol-extracted telomerase reaction was added to the Dynabeads and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with rotation. The beads were then washed 3 times with 100 μl of 2 × Binding Buffer, resuspended in 5 μl of formamide loading buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min to release the biotinylated products; 2.5 μl was electrophoresed as above. As a recovery and loading control, a 3′ biotinylated 12-mer primer was end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and 5,000 cpm was added to the reaction prior to phenol/chloroform extraction.Figure 7Telomerase assays with chase primers to test processivity of L813Y reconstituted telomerase.

https://openalex.org/W1980414224,"Resistance to Gram-negative infection can be induced by pretreating animals with several agents such as turpentine and interleukin (IL)-1. Because these agents are powerful inducers of acute phase proteins, we wondered whether these proteins, more particularly α1-acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP), are involved in nonspecific resistance to infection. Turpentine and IL-1 protect completely against a lethal challenge of Klebsiella pneumoniae when given 48 and 12–48 h before the challenge, respectively. α1-AGP induction in the serum reached peak values 48 h after turpentine and 12–48 h after IL-1 injection. Administration of α1-AGP, 2 h before a challenge of K. pneumoniae, significantly increased the survival. Numbers of bacteria cultured from blood and organs were significantly lower in mice pretreated with a protective dose of turpentine, IL-1, or α1-AGP. These data suggest that α1-AGP is a possible mediator in turpentine- or IL-1-induced protection because time points of maximal induction of α1-AGP by turpentine or IL-1 and of optimal protection by α1-AGP coincide. Transgenic overexpression of rat α1-AGP protected mice from a K. pneumoniaeinfection. Bacterial counts in blood and organs were significantly lower in transgenic mice, and only in control mice were large necrotic areas, apoptosis, and blood clots observed in the spleen. Our data suggest that α1-AGP prevents Gram-negative infections and may be an essential component in nonspecific resistance to infection.

It is caused by an overwhelming infection (1.Donnelly P.B. Lancet. 1965; 10: 822-823Abstract Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and several bacterial organisms have been identified to induce that syndrome (2.Petersdorf R.G. Thorn G.W. Adams R.D. Braunwald E. Isselbacher K.J. Petersdorf R.G. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. McGraw-Hill Kogakusha, Tokyo1977: 770-775Google Scholar). The disease is accompanied by a high death rate, exceeding 50%, depending on the type of organism involved. Treatment with antibiotics has proven to be effective, but because bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, alternative solutions have to be found. One possibility is to identify endogenous molecules that are involved in increasing nonspecific resistance to infection and to evaluate their therapeutic use. The natural resistance of the host to infection can be increased by injection of various substances, most of which are of bacterial origin, such as lipopolysaccharide and muramyl peptides (3.Shilo M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1959; 13: 255-278Crossref Google Scholar, 4.Parant M. Parant F. Chedid L. Minor L.L. Ann. Immunol. 1975; 126: 319-326Google Scholar, 5.Chedid L. Parant M. Parant F. Lefrancier P. Choay J. Lederer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, because of their toxicity, these immunomodulatory substances cannot be used therapeutically in humans. Substances that increase nonspecific resistance are able to stimulate mononuclear phagocytes to secrete interleukin (IL)-11and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (6.Parant M. J. Immunopharmacol. 1994; 16: 445-449Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that IL-1, and to a lesser extent TNF, are able to induce natural resistance to infection (7.Ozaki Y. Ohashi T. Minami A. Nakamura S. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Czuprynski C.J. Brown J.F. Young K.M. Cooley A.J. Kurtz R.S. J.

However, resistance can only be induced if certain time intervals are respected. For example, bacillus Calmette-Guérin has to be administered 2 weeks, lipopolysaccharide between 6 and 48 h, and IL-1 24 h prior to a lethal challenge ofKlebsiella pneumoniae (4.Parant M. Parant F. Chedid L. Minor L.L. Ann. Immunol. 1975; 126: 319-326Google Scholar). To study septic shock, a lethal infection of K. pneumoniae is a relevant model because these Gram-negative bacteria were recognized, besides Escherichia coli, Proteus, Pseudomonas andSerratia, as some of the most frequent culture isolates (13.Turck M. Thorn G.W. Adams R.D. Braunwald E. Isselbacher K.J. Petersdorf R.G. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. McGraw-Hill Kogakusha, Tokyo1977: 830-835Google Scholar). α1-Acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) is a highly glycosylated protein of 43 kDa with a pI of 2.7 (14.Schmid K. Putman F.W. The Plasma Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetic Control. Academic Press, New York1975: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar). It is an acute phase protein in all mammals investigated so far (15.Kushner I. Mackiewicz A. Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 3-19Google Scholar). α1-AGP is produced mainly in the liver (16.Sarcione E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although also some extrahepatic synthesis has been reported (17.Gahmberg C.G. Andersson L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18.Eap C.B. Baumann P. Moretta A. Experientia (Basel). 1989; 45 (abstr.): 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19.Sörensson J. Matejka G.L. Ohlson M. Haraldsson B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H530-H534PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse serum, α1-AGP is normally found at a concentration of 0.2–0.4 mg/ml (20.Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Köhler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). During an acute phase condition, the concentration rises 2–5 times, making it one of the predominant proteins in the serum (14.Schmid K. Putman F.W. The Plasma Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetic Control. Academic Press, New York1975: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar). Like most acute phase proteins, α1-AGP is induced both by cytokines and corticosteroids (21.Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). IL-6 and IL-1 have proven to be very powerful inducers of α1-AGP bothin vitro and in vivo (22.Baumann H. Prowse K.R. Won K. Marinkovic-Pajovic S. Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 409-423Google Scholar). Although α1-AGP is an abundant protein, its real physiological significance is not fully understood. Inhibition of platelet aggregation (23.Costello M. Fiedel B.A. Gewurz H. Nature. 1979; 281: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and of neutrophil function (24.Bennett M. Schmid K.

Inflammation. 1990; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have been reported. Also, α1-AGP was found to inhibit selectively the transport of molecules through the endothelial layer (26.Haraldsson B. Rippe B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1987; 129: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 27.Muchitsch E.M. Teschner W. Linnau Y. Pichler L. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1996; 331: 313-321PubMed Google Scholar).In vivo protective effects of α1-AGP have been described (28.Libert C. Brouckaert P. Fiers W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1571-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29.Van Molle W. Libert C. Fiers W. Brouckaert P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3555-3564PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Williams J.P. Weiser M.R. Pechet T.T. Kobzik L. Moore Jr., F.D. Hechtman H.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G1031-G1035PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in finding whether acute phase proteins are involved in nonspecific resistance to infection against K. pneumoniae. Therefore we studied the possible protection by turpentine oil and IL-1, two well known and very strong inducers of the acute phase response (31.Baumann H. Held W.A. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 566-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Dinarello C.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 33.Birch H.E. Schreiber G. J.

Acute Phase Proteins: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 275-287Google Scholar), and by α1-AGP itself, and we compared the kinetics of induction of α1-AGP in the serum and of optimal protection against K. pneumoniae. We describe that α1-AGP significantly protects against a lethal infection with K. pneumoniae. This activity of the acute phase protein was observed in normal mice using purified α1-AGP as well as in transgenic mice that overexpress rat α1-AGP. Female C57BL/6 mice (Iffa-Credo, Saint Germain-sur-l'Arbresle, France) were used at the age of 8–12 weeks. Rat α1-AGP transgenic mice were generated and described previously (35.Dewey M.J. Rheaume C. Berger F.G. Baumann H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4392-4398PubMed Google Scholar). They were generated by injecting genomic DNA into (C57BL/6 × DBA/2)F1 zygotes, and the resulting transgenic mice were back-crossed eight generations into a C57BL/6 background. Heterozygous transgenic mice from the line 9.5–5 constitutively produce about 2 mg/ml α1-AGP. This is 10-fold more than wild-type (wt) animals. The colony was propagated by breeding heterozygous transgenic mice with C57BL/6 female mice; the offspring, containing heterozygous transgenics and wt littermates, was genotyped at weaning age by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 100 μl of blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding, after which serum was prepared. α1-AGP was purified by phenol extraction (36.Chan J. Yu D. Protein Express. Purif. 1991; 2: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and coated on the bottom of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate. After washing, rat α1-AGP was detected using an anti-rat α1-AGP polyclonal antibody (generated by H. Baumann in rabbits) (1/1,000) and an anti-rabbit antibody, conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 1/5,000). The anti-rat α1-AGP antibody did not cross-react with mouse α1-AGP. About 50% of the offspring were heterozygous transgenic. Only female mice of 8–12 weeks were used in the experiments. Both transgenic and control (nontransgenic littermate) mice had comparable body weights. Mice were kept in a conventional, air-conditioned mouse room in 12-h light-dark cycles and received food and water ad libitum. Intraperitoneal injections had a volume of 0.5 ml. The reagents were diluted in pyrogen-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) immediately before injection. Mice were injected intramuscularly with bacteria (right thigh) in a volume of 100 μl. Mice were bled by retro-ocular bleeding or heart puncture under ether or tribromoethanol (160 mg/kg) anesthesia, respectively, and serum was prepared by clotting 30 min at 37 °C, removal of the clot, and centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g). Bovine α1-AGP, bovine serum albumin (BSA), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, andp-nitrophenyl phosphate were obtained from Sigma. The α1-AGP preparations contained 10 ng of endotoxin/mg of protein. α1-AGP was >99% pure as mentioned by the manufacturer and as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining. Recombinant mouse IL-1β was expressed in and purified from E. coli in our laboratory, had a specific activity of 3.65 × 108 units/mg, and contained less than 10 ng of endotoxin/mg of protein. K. pneumoniae (ATCC 43816), a strain that produces a lethal infection in normal mice (9.van der Meer J.W.M. Biotherapy. 1988; 1: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was inoculated in the right thigh muscle as described (37.Kunst M.W. Mattie H. van Furth R. Infection. 1979; 7: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An inoculum of 1 × 106 CFU/mouse was used except in the studies with rat α1-AGP transgenic mice, where we used 105CFU/mouse. Survival was scored over a period of at least 5 days. 36 h after injection of K. pneumoniae, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of tribromoethanol. Blood was taken by heart puncture. For preparation of plasma, 450 μl of blood was added to 50 μl of sodium citrate (0.1 m). Immediately thereafter, mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Then, mice were perfused with 10 ml of a 0.9% NaCl solution to wash out the blood. The liver, spleen, and kidney were removed aseptically, weighed, and homogenized mechanically in sterile saline. For homogenization, the liver was diluted (w/v) 2-fold; spleen and kidney were diluted 10-fold. The suspensions were diluted and plated out on sterile nutrient agar. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, CFU numbers were counted. The concentration of α1-AGP in mouse serum was measured using a home-developed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A rat monoclonal antibody was coated (0.1 μg/ml) on 96-well Maxisorb plates. After blocking with 1% BSA and PBS, samples and a murine α1-AGP standard were titrated, after which the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1/1,000) and subsequent alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1/5,000) were used as secondary and third antibody. Human α1-AGP was measured by nephelometry using a goat anti-human α1-AGP polyclonal antibody. Survival was scored and evaluated using a log rank test. Final lethality was scored using a χ2 test. The statistical significance of the number of bacterial colonies in the blood and the organs, as well as of induction of α1-AGP after injection of IL-1 or turpentine, was determined using a Dunnett analysis of variance test. p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. *, **, and *** represent p < 0.05, p < 0.01, andp < 0.001, respectively. To investigate whether turpentine conferred protection, mice were pretreated with 100 μl of turpentine subcutaneously 24 or 48 h before a lethal bacterial challenge (106 CFU unless otherwise stated) of K. pneumoniae. When turpentine was given 48 h before the challenge, mice were significantly (p < 0.0001) protected versus PBS-pretreated controls. In contrast, turpentine treatment 24 h before the challenge was unable to induce significant protection (p = 0.1137; not significant). Mice were observed for 6 days, after which no further deaths occurred (Fig. 1). To determine the time point of optimal protection by IL-1, 1 μg of IL-1 was given at 12, 24, and 48 h before the lethal challenge (Fig. 2). IL-1 protected significantly when given 48 h (p = 0.0279), 24 h (p = 0.0020), or 12 h (p< 0.0001) prior to the challenge, compared with PBS-pretreated controls. IL-1 protected significantly better at −12 h compared with −48 h (p = 0.0455). To study the kinetics of induction of α1-AGP by turpentine or IL-1, mice were injected subcutaneously with 100 μl of turpentine or intraperitoneally with 1 μg of IL-1. At different time points after the injection, mice were sacrificed, and serum was collected. The concentration of α1-AGP in the serum was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The α1-AGP levels in the serum were induced significantly 48 h (p < 0.01) and 72 h (p < 0.01) after turpentine injection compared with the basal levels (PBS injected mice had no increased α1-AGP at any time point) and 12 h (p < 0.01), 24 h (p < 0.01), and 48 h (p < 0.05) after IL-1 injection. The levels after 12 h were significantly higher than those after 48 h (p = 0.0455). The α1-AGP levels 144 h after turpentine or IL-1 injection had reached basal levels again (p > 0.05; not significant) (Fig.3). To test whether α1-AGP was able to protect, several doses were injected intraperitoneally 2 h before and/or 24 h after a lethal challenge with K. pneumoniae. When mice were treated with 10 mg of α1-AGP 2 h before the lethal challenge or with 10 mg of α1-AGP spread over two injections (5 mg 2 h before and 5 mg 24 h after the lethal challenge), significant protection was observed (p = 0.0094 andp = 0.0006, respectively) compared with the control mice that received PBS as pretreatment (Fig.4). When mice were given a total dose of 5 mg, protection was only marginal, whereas a dose of 2 mg did not protect. Furthermore, pretreatment with α1-AGP proved to be necessary because mice treated with 10 mg of α1-AGP 24 h after the lethal challenge were not protected (data not shown). In a separate experiment (Table I), we observed that 10 mg of BSA was not able to protect against 106 CFU of K. pneumoniae, which illustrates the specificity of the effect of α1-AGP.Table IProtection by α1-AGP and lack of protection by BSA against a lethal infection of K. pneumoniaePretreatmentaBSA or α1-AGP was given at −2 h (5 mg) and at +24 h (5 mg) intraperitoneally relative to challenge with 106 CFU of K. pneumoniae (intramuscularly).Lethal responsebScored at day 6 (no further deaths occurred).

Open table in a new tab To compare the serum levels of α1-AGP induced by turpentine or IL-1 on the one hand and those after injection of 10 mg of α1-AGP on the other hand, we performed the experiment shown in Table II. Mice were injected with 10 mg of human α1-AGP, and α1-AGP was measured in the blood after 2, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h. It was found that, taking into account a blood volume of 2 ml and a serum volume of 1 ml, 2 h after injection 2.3 mg of α1-AGP/ml of serum was present, which is comparable with the amounts found after injection with turpentine or IL-1 (Fig. 3).Table IIBlood concentration of α1-AGP after injection of 10 mg of human α1-AGPTime after injectionaInjected intraperitoneally (n = 3).Blood concentrationhmg/ml010 ± 024.675 ± 0.12582.73 ± 0.15241.21 ± 0.141480.61 ± 0.05720.34 ± 0.05a Injected intraperitoneally (n = 3). Open table in a new tab To shed light on the mechanism of protection against a lethal challenge withK. pneumoniae, we studied the number of bacteria in the blood and in different organs. Mice received either 10 mg of α1-AGP (5 mg at 2 h before and 5 mg at 24 h after the lethal challenge), 1 μg of IL-1 24 h before the lethal challenge, or 100 μl of turpentine 48 h before the lethal challenge. Mice treated with α1-AGP, IL-1, or turpentine showed significantly less bacteria in the blood (p < 0.001, p = 0.0087, and p = 0.0021, respectively), liver (p = 0.0058, p = 0.0038, and p = 0.0038, respectively), spleen (p = 0.0021, p = 0.0135, andp = 0.0010, respectively), and kidney (p = 0.0079, p = 0.0312, andp = 0.0046, respectively) compared with control mice 36 h after an intramuscular injection of 1 × 106CFU of K. pneumoniae (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the mechanism of protection by all of these agents could be at the same level and that α1-AGP may mediate both the IL-1 and turpentine effects. It is also clear from Fig. 5 that turpentine, which induces higher amounts of α1-AGP than IL-1, is better in reducing the spread of bacteria. It has already been shown that IL-1 is not directly cytotoxic to bacteria (9.van der Meer J.W.M. Biotherapy. 1988; 1: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have tested the effect of α1-AGP by plating out bacteria on nutrient agar plates containing different concentrations of α1-AGP (1.5, 0.5, 0.15 mg/ml or none). We found no difference in the number of bacteria grown in the presence or absence of α1-AGP (data not shown). A challenge of 105 bacteria results in almost 100% lethality over a period of 2 weeks. When heterozygous α1-AGP transgenic mice and wt littermates were challenged with bacteria, the transgenic mice were significantly protected compared with the wt littermates (Fig. 6). The constitutive α1-AGP levels in these heterozygous transgenic mice amount to 2 mg/ml (38.Libert C. Hochepied T. Berger F.G. Baumann H. Fiers W. Brouckaert P. Transgen. Res. 1998; 7: 1-7Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This result was reproduced four times. Control mice started dying at day 2 and transgenic mice at day 5. Eventually, 83% control mice and 39% transgenic mice succumbed (p= 0.0002). At a higher inoculum, protection by the transgenic α1-AGP was no longer observed (data not shown). As described before, 24–48 h after challenge, bacteria are found in most organs (9.van der Meer J.W.M. Biotherapy. 1988; 1: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), most pronounced in the spleen (39.Uchiyama J. Kuniki H. Fujikura Y. Fukumoto T. Koshiro A. Immunobiology. 1991; 184: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We injected α1-AGP transgenic mice and control littermates and counted the bacteria in blood, spleen, liver, and kidney 36 h later. The numbers of CFU are expressed per g of tissue (Fig. 7). We found that in the blood, spleen, liver, and kidney, α1-AGP transgenic mice had significantly several 100-fold less invasion of bacteria (p = 0.0432, p = 0.0033,p = 0.0437, and p = 0.0256, respectively). 2 days after a challenge of 105 K. pneumoniae, transgenic as well as control mice were sacrificed and their tissues fixed. Tissue sections revealed that mainly the spleen of control mice was heavily damaged (Fig.8). In these mice, massive influx of bacteria was observed, along with erythrocytes. Also, large necrotic areas, apoptosis and blood clots were found. α1-AGP-transgenic mice were completely protected from these lesions (Fig. 8). Septic shock is the result of an overwhelming Gram-negative bacterial infection (1.Donnelly P.B. Lancet. 1965; 10: 822-823Abstract Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The bacteria and/or their lipopolysaccharides are found in the circulation, and shock is the result of the combined action of several proinflammatory cytokines induced in macrophages and other cells (40.Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Septic shock and sepsis, leading to cardiovascular depression and multiple organ failure, are causing more than 100,000 casualties per year in the United States (41.Stone R. Science. 1994; 264: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Several clinical trials had the proinflammatory cytokines as a target: the IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble TNF receptors, or TNF-neutralizing antibodies were used. These approaches and also those inhibiting platelet-activating factor or bradykinin were relatively disappointing (42.Abraham E. Marshall J.C. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 56-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Clearly new and other approaches are needed. The toxic and lethal effects of a variety of infections or of bacterial endotoxins can be reduced by preadministration of a small dose of endotoxin 6–48 h before (4.Parant M. Parant F. Chedid L. Minor L.L. Ann. Immunol. 1975; 126: 319-326Google Scholar). Several other substances of natural origin or synthetic compounds based on microbial structures also increase the natural endogenous resistance mechanisms. The protective effects are clearly nonspecific because endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria can protect against lethality caused by an antigenically unrelated organism such as Candida albicans (43.van't Wout J.W. van der Meer J.W.M. Barza M. Dinarello C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore the phenomenon was called induction of “nonspecific resistance to infection” (11.Dinarello C.A. Neta R. Biotherapy. 1989; 1: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Administered under adequate conditions, such bacterial agents markedly increase nonspecific immunity, even against strains made resistant to antibiotics (4.Parant M. Parant F. Chedid L. Minor L.L. Ann. Immunol. 1975; 126: 319-326Google Scholar). However, because of their toxicity, these immunomodulatory substances have not gained acceptance as a therapy in humans. Therefore, further investigation is needed to obtain a clear insight into the mechanism of induction of nonspecific immunity. Several investigators found that IL-1 plays a crucial role in inducing nonspecific resistance to infection because it can protect mice against a lethal challenge of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Listeria monocytogenes, C. albicans, and K. pneumoniae (7.Ozaki Y. Ohashi T. Minami A. Nakamura S. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Czuprynski C.J. Brown J.F. Young K.M. Cooley A.J. Kurtz R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 962-968PubMed Google Scholar, 9.van der Meer J.W.M. Biotherapy. 1988; 1: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.van der Meer J.W.M. Barza M. Wolff S.M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1620-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 44.van der Meer J.W.M. Helle M. Aarden L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was also shown that pretreatment with IL-6 or TNF could protect against a lethal bacterial challenge, although these cytokines were clearly less potent than IL-1 (9.van der Meer J.W.M. Biotherapy. 1988; 1: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 44.van der Meer J.W.M. Helle M. Aarden L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These cytokines all play an important role in inducing the acute phase response. The acute phase response is the answer of the organism to disturbances of homeostasis caused by infection, tissue injury, or immunological disorders. It consists of a local reaction at the site of injury characterized by a number of responses, such as platelet aggregation and activation of leukocytes, which in turn release acute phase cytokines (such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6). In addition, activated fibroblasts and endothelial cells are able to produce cytokines such as IL-6. These cytokines act on specific receptors on different target cells leading to a systemic reaction characterized by fever, leukocytosis, increase in secretion of glucocorticoids, activation of complement, and clotting and dramatic changes in the concentration of some plasma proteins called acute phase proteins (45.Richards C. Gauldie J. Baumann H. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1991; 2: 89-98PubMed Google Scholar). The acute phase response is a fundamental protective system that has evolved (21.Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The expression of several proteins is augmented by the liver several hours and days after the start of an infection or trauma. Most of these proteins are supposed to have protective or healing activities. The set of acute phase proteins varies from one species to another. The most predominant acute phase proteins in the mouse are serum amyloid A, serum amyloid P, and α1-AGP (15.Kushner I. Mackiewicz A. Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 3-19Google Scholar). α1-AGP"

The biosynthesis of multisubunit proteins entering the secretory pathway is regulated at the ER where individual subunits are synthesized and their assembly is co-ordinated. Studies on the biogenesis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I have highlighted intermediate stages during assembly of this multisubunit complex and suggested that a number of ER resident proteins, including calnexin (1.Capps G.G.

Science. 1994; 264: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) play a role during the assembly process. Interactions with other proteins such as BiP (7.Noessner E. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Grp94 (8.Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have also been reported, but it is not clear if these interactions occur during the normal assembly of the MHC class I molecule. Mature MHC class I molecules consist of three subunits, a heavy chain, which assembles with β2-microglobulin within the ER, and an antigenic peptide whose assembly with the β2-microglobulin-heavy chain complex is essential for subsequent transport of a stable and functional class I complex to the cell surface (9.Germain R.N. Margulies D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 403-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The dynamics of ER chaperone-mediated interactions, the identity of the specific intermediates each ER protein interacts with, and the role these proteins play during assembly remain to be established. The sequence of events leading to transport of the fully assembled MHC class I complex from the ER is an area of intense study. As the MHC class I heavy chain is translocated into the ER, intra-chain disulfide bonds are formed within the α2 and α3domains (10.Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19638-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Only the fully disulfide-bonded form is assembled with β2-microglobulin, emphasizing that the formation of these bonds is a requirement for correct folding and assembly (11.Wang H. Capps G.G. Robinson B.E. Zúniga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22276-22281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both nondisulfide- and disulfide-bonded forms of heavy chain have been shown to associate with calnexin, suggesting that this protein plays a role in preventing nonspecific association of heavy chains prior to disulfide bond formation and assembly with β2-microglobulin (10.Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19638-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Once a heavy chain-β2-microglobulin dimer is formed, this then dissociates from calnexin and associates with calreticulin, TAP, and tapasin to form a complex that is required for peptide loading (3.Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 6.Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampé R.

Med. 1995; 181: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The order of assembly of this complex is unclear, but as soon as the heavy chain is loaded with peptide, the complex dissociates allowing the MHC class I complex to be transported from the ER to the cell surface (3.Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 4.Suh W.-K. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Fruh K. Wang K. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Mutations within the heavy chain, which prevent this complex from forming (12.Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), or expression of heavy chains in cells lacking tapasin (6.Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J.

Alexander J. Anderson K. Lamb C. Cresswell P. McMicheal A. Gotch F. Townsend A. Nature. 1990; 345: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) lead to transport of empty unstable complexes to the cell surface. This indicates that this complex plays a role in ER retention or quality control as well as peptide loading. The role of the thiol-dependent oxidoreductase ERp57 (15.Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) in MHC class I assembly is less clear. It has been suggested that ERp57 may be involved in stabilization of the MHC class I peptide-loading complex, peptide trimming, or the ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins (30.Hughes E.A. Cresswell P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ERp57 has been shown previously to form a complex with newly synthesized proteins that, like the interaction with calnexin and calreticulin, is glycoprotein-specific. These studies used a cross-linking approach to identify ERp57 as a cross-linking partner that interacted with glycoproteins forming a complex with calnexin or calreticulin (15.Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 27.Rupp K. Birnbach U. Lundström J. Van P.N. Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2501-2507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Significantly, ERp57 has also been shown to form a complex with MHC class I in intact cells (29.Morrice N.A. Powis S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30.Hughes E.A. Cresswell P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation was extended in a kinetic analysis of rodent MHC class I heavy chain interaction with calnexin, ERp57, and TAP (29.Morrice N.A. Powis S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which suggested that there is a delay in the interaction of ERp57 with MHC class I in comparison with calnexin. In human cells, ERp57 has been shown to interact with MHC class I heavy chain, β2-microglobulin, calreticulin, and tapasin in a subcomplex that is dependent on the presence of β2-microglobulin and tapasin but not TAP (30.Hughes E.A. Cresswell P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ERp57 may be recruited to this peptide-loading subcomplex to facilitate crucial structural changes by formation or rearrangement of disulfide bonds prior to association with TAP and peptide loading. To study what is clearly a complex process, one would ideally investigate folding and assembly within a functionally intact ER. To address this aim we have developed techniques that will allow us to delineate the time course of folding, assembly, and interaction of MHC class I molecules with ER resident proteins. This approach makes use of semipermeabilized cells (SP cells) that can be prepared from any cell line grown in culture and then added to an in vitrotranslation system where they act as a source of ER (14.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, folding and assembly can be studied as it would occur in intact cells using a system amenable to experimental manipulation. We have shown that the synthesis of heavy chains can be synchronized allowing the sequential interaction with calnexin, calreticulin, and tapasin to be studied. We also show that the recently discovered glycoprotein-specific chaperone ERp57 (15.Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) interacts with heavy chain during disulfide bond formation. The cDNA coding for HLA-B2705 heavy chain was a gift from Dr. Linda Tussey (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK) and was subcloned as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). The recombinant plasmid was designated pAJM2. Transcription reactions were carried out as described by Gurevich et al. (16.Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmid was linearized with BamHI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Southampton, UK). Reactions (100 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Following purification over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Dorking, UK), the RNA was resuspended in 100 μl of RNase-free water containing 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) and 40 units of RNasin (Promega). The human T-lymphoblastoid cell line CEM (17.Howell D.N. Andreotti P.E. Dawson J.E. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 971-976PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in Iscoves' modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. SP cells from this cell line were prepared as described previously (18.Allen S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RNA was translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (FlexiLysate, Promega) at 30 °C. The translation reaction (per 25 μl) contained 17.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 0.5 μl of 1 mm amino acids (minus methionine), 0.5 μl of 100 mm KCl, 15 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine (NEN, Dreiech, Germany), 1 μl of transcribed RNA, and 5.5 μl (approximately 2 × 105) of SP cells. Translations were carried out for 5 min prior to the addition of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATCA) (75 μm) to prevent re-initiation of translation (19.Stewart M.L. Grollman A.P. Huang M.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were incubated for various lengths of time after ATCA addition as described in individual experiments. Translation was terminated by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to a final concentration of 20 mm and by the isolation of the SP cells by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in KHM buffer (110 mm KOAc, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgOAc) and re-isolated by centrifugation as above. Cell pellets were processed for immunoprecipitation as described below. Cross-linking was performed using BMH, a homobifunctional reagent specific free sulfhydryls. Following in vitro translation, the membrane fraction was incubated for 20 min on ice in the presence of 50 μm BMH added from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO4. Control reactions were carried out in the presence of Me2SO4 alone. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.1 volume of 100 mm DTT, and the samples were incubated for 10 min on ice. After cross-linking, samples were subjected to denaturation in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% SDS for 5 min at 100 °C. This was followed by cooling on ice, removal of 10% of the sample to provide a total cross-linked sample, and the addition of 10 volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer without added SDS. Samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies as described below. Isolated cell pellets were made up to a final volume of 1 ml with ice-cold CHAPS immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), containing 2% CHAPS, 200 mmNaCl, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) and pre-incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline) for 60 min at 4 °C to preclear the samples of protein A binding components. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min after preclearing. Precleared samples were incubated for 2 h with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and either 10 μl of monoclonal antibody HC10 (Dr. Hidde Ploegh, MIT, Cambridge, MA), 1 μl of W6/32 (Serotec Ltd., Oxford, UK), or 1 μl of polyclonal antibody to β2-microglobulin (AMS Biotechnology UK, Oxon, UK), 5 μl of calnexin (12.Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), 1 μl of calreticulin (Cambridge Biosciences, Cambridge, UK), 1 μl of tapasin Rgp48C (Dr. Peter Cresswell, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University Medical School), or 1 μl of ERp57 (Dr. T. Wileman, IAH, Pirbright, UK). The complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer then prepared for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described below. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.0625 m Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), SDS (2% w/v), glycerol (10% v/v), and bromphenol blue) in the presence or absence of 50 mm DTT and boiled for 5 min. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, processed for autoradiography, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film or image intensities were quantified by phosphorimage analysis. We have previously demonstrated that, when HLA-A2 heavy chain was translated in the presence of SP cells derived from the human cell line HT1080, a heavy chain/β2-microglobulin heterodimer could be formed as judged by immunoprecipitation with the conformation-specific antibody W6/32 (14.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This assembly was inefficient, probably due to a limited amount of β2-microglobulin or peptide in this cell line. To improve efficiency of assembly we use here the human cell line CEM, which is lymphoblastoid in origin and has been used previously to study MHC class I assembly (20.Sadasivan B.K. Cariappa A. Waneck G.L. Cresswell P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; LX: 267-275Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For these studies we translated HLA-B27 heavy chain, but it should be noted that HLA-A2 also assembled efficiently with SP cells prepared from this cell line (results not shown). Our initial experiments were designed to demonstrate that the translated heavy chain was targeted to, translocated across, and integrated into the ER membrane of SP cells. In the absence of added cells, HLA-B27 heavy chain is translated (Fig.1 A, lane 1) but remains sensitive to proteinase K treatment (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Translocation could be demonstrated by protection of the translation product synthesized in SP cells from proteolysis by added proteinase K (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The increase in mobility observed after proteinase K treatment is caused by the removal of the cytoplasmic tail, demonstrating that the translated heavy chain was translocated and integrated into the ER membrane (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 3 and 5). We also investigated whether the translocated heavy chain becameN-link-glycosylated. Such a post-translational modification was suggested by the decrease in mobility of the translation product synthesized in the presence of cells as compared with the translation product synthesized in the absence of cells. Glycosylation was confirmed by sensitivity of the translation product to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6). We also demonstrate that, when heavy chain was translated in the presence of SP cells derived from CEM cells, assembly occurs as judged by immunoprecipitation with the conformation-specific antibody W6/32 (Fig.1 B). The HLA-B27 complex has been shown to be relatively stable in the presence of peptide (22.Tan L. Anderson M.H. Elliott T. Haurum J.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 209: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and we confirmed these results by showing that the complex formed in our system was stable up to 55 °C (Fig. 1 B). This would suggest that the majority of complexes were loaded with peptide. These experiments show that when B27 heavy chain RNA was translated in the presence of SP cells derived from CEM cells, assembly of the translocated, glycosylated product with endogenous β2-microglobulin and peptide resulted in the formation of a stable MHC class I complex. In these initial experiments, the HLA-B27 mRNA was translated for 60 min, which resulted in a heterologous mixture of polypeptide chains at various stages of synthesis, folding, and assembly. To follow the folding and assembly of a more homogenous population of molecules, we attempted to synchronize the synthesis of polypeptide chains by only allowing a single wave of translational initiation. We incubated our translation reactions for 5 min to allow initiation to occur and then added aurintricarboxylic acid (ATCA), a compound that inhibits initiation but does not inhibit chain extension or cause dissociation of mRNA-ribosome complexes (19.Stewart M.L. Grollman A.P. Huang M.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using this approach, in the absence of added SP cells, we observed the first full length chains 8 min after initiation of synthesis with no further increase of translation product 12 min after synthesis (Fig.2, A and B). Hence, we could follow a wave of translation products with the time difference between synthesis of the first and last chains being 3–4 min. Such an approach has previously been used to study the sequential interaction of cytosolic chaperones with newly synthesized proteins (24.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Having established this synchronized translation system, we next investigated the time course of assembly of heavy chains with β2-microglobulin in our SP cells. Translation reactions were incubated for 5 min prior to the addition of ATCA and allowed to proceed for a further 5, 10, 15, 25, or 40 min. Cells were isolated from the translations and solubilized, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with antibodies to β2-microglobulin, or antibodies to heavy chain, W6/32 and HC10. In the presence of cells the first full-length chains were observed 10 min after initiation of synthesis (Fig. 3 A,bottom panel) as judged by immunoprecipitation with HC10 that recognizes unassembled chains. The time difference of appearance of full length chains between translations carried out in the presence and absence of cells probably reflects the time taken for targeting to the ER and translocation across and integration into the ER membrane. The first appearance of β2-microglobulin-heavy chain (HC-β2M) dimers occurred 5 min later (Fig. 3 B,middle panel), which compares well with the time taken for assembly in intact cells (25.Hill A. Takiguchi M. McMicheal A. Immunogenetics. 1993; 37: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26.Neefjes J.J. Hämmerling G.J. Momburg F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The precipitation of translocated heavy chain with the W6/32 antibody followed a similar time course confirming the appearance of HC-β2M dimers (Fig.3 A, top panel). The ratio of heavy chains present as part of a complex with β2-mircoglobulin increased dramatically over the time course (ratio unassembled:assembled was 1:0.5 at 15 min and 1:2 at 40 min) and indicated that the unassembled full length chains were assembling post-translationally with β2-microglobulin. The amount of heavy chain assembling with β2-microglobulin was still increasing after 40 min, whereas the amount of heavy chain immunoprecipitated by W6/32 did not increase after 30 min (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the supply of peptide to these cells is limiting. The results demonstrate that a population of heavy chain molecules synthesized within SP cells can assemble with endogenous β2-microglobulin and peptide and that we can follow the assembly of these complexes within a synchronized translation system. When the same translation products were separated without prior reduction, the disulfide status could be evaluated. The rabbit reticulocyte lysate used in these experiments contains no added DTT and supports the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins translocated across ER membranes (14.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). All the heavy chain precipitated with W6/32 and β2-microglobulin antibodies migrated with a faster mobility than the reduced samples, thus indicating the formation of intra-chain disulfide bonds as would be expected for assembled chains (Fig. 3 A, top and middle panels). The unassembled chains precipitated by the HC10 antibody were mostly nondisulfide-bonded at early time points but became progressively more oxidized (Fig. 3 B, bottom panel). These disulfide-bonded chains migrated with a diffuse pattern that could reflect partial oxidation or the formation of non-native disulfides (compare samples precipitated with W6/32 and HC10 run under nonreducing conditions). Thus it would appear that in our SP cell system we have a population of heavy chains, which form disulfide bonds and associate with β2-microglobulin, and a population of heavy chains, which remain nondisulfide-bonded or form non-native disulfides and remain unassembled. This indicates that for heavy chain the process of disulfide bond formation and assembly with β2-microglobulin is connected as has been suggested previously (10.Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19638-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction of the translocated heavy chains with the glycoprotein-specific chaperones calnexin and calreticulin we carried out a similar time course and immunoprecipitated the products of translation with antibodies specific for these proteins. The results are shown in Fig. 4 A(top and middle panels) and clearly demonstrate that both these antibodies precipitate heavy chains and, therefore, interact during assembly, which confirms previous results (1.Capps G.G. Zuniga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11634-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19638-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The time course and the disulfide status of the heavy chains interacting with calnexin were quite distinct from those interacting with calreticulin. Hence, calnexin interacted predominantly with heavy chains soon after synthesis and with nondisulfide-bonded forms at early time points. The oxidized form of heavy chain that calnexin interacted with at later time points showed a similar diffuse mobility to the material immunoprecipitated with the HC10 antibody, suggesting that calnexin interacts mainly with unassembled chains. In contrast, calreticulin interacted with heavy chain at later time points and almost exclusively with disulfide-bonded forms, which migrated as a sharp band similar to the material immunoprecipitated with W6/32 and anti-β2-microglobulin, suggesting that calreticulin interacts with assembled chains (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). This is in agreement with previous results that suggest calreticulin and not calnexin forms a complex with HC-β2M dimers (2.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). We were not able to determine whether the material immunoprecipitated with calreticulin was indeed assembled, because the conditions required to elute the heavy chains from calreticulin disrupt the heavy chain-β2-microglobulin complex (data not shown). The difference in the timing of interaction (Fig.4 B) and the mobility of the heavy chains when separated under nonreducing conditions are highly suggestive that calreticulin associates with assembled dimers, whereas calnexin associates with unassembled chains. We also investigated the interaction of ERp57 with heavy chains during assembly using the synchronized SP cell translation system. Here we show that ERp57 interacts with heavy chains during assembly using a co-immunoprecipitation approach (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). This co-immunoprecipitation was specific because no heavy chains were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to protein disulfide isomerase (results not shown). The disulfide status of the heavy chains interacting with ERp57 indicated that there is an association with both native and oxidized heavy chains, particularly at early time points. This is in contrast with the exclusively disulfide-bonded material interacting with calreticulin and is more similar to the material associating with calnexin. Thus, these results suggest that ERp57 interacts with a separate population of heavy chain polypeptides than calreticulin, at least during early stages of assembly. The interaction of ERp57 with a nondisulfide-bonded population at earlier time points may suggest a role for ERp57, in association with calnexin, in the folding and disulfide bond formation of heavy chain prior to an interaction with calreticulin and the TAP-associated peptide loading complex. At later time points, ERp57 interacts with fully oxidized heavy chain that is likely to be complexed with β2-microglobulin, calreticulin, and tapasin. Recruitment of a thiol-dependent reductase to assembled heavy chains would not suggest a role directly in disulfide bond formation because the intra-chain disulfide bonds have formed prior to assembly but could indicate a role in preventing disulfide reduction. Alternatively, the co-immunoprecipitation of heavy chains with antibodies to ERp57 could simply reflect a stable interaction with calreticulin. A role for ERp57 also has been suggested in the degradation of misfolded proteins (31.Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is possible that the population of heavy chain molecules that do not assemble with β2-microglobulin or peptide remain associated with ERp57 to facilitate disulfide reduction prior to unfolding and dislocation from the lumen of the ER for proteasome-mediated degradation. The kinetics of MHC class I interaction with tapasin was also analyzed. The anti-tapasin antibody Rgp48C was utilized to precipitate tapasin-heavy chain complexes. This antibody is only functional under denaturing conditions, and, therefore, it was necessary to perform a cross-linking reaction prior to immunoprecipitation. Conditions for BMH-mediated cross-linking were determined (Fig.5 A), and these were used to isolate heavy chain complexes in the synchronized MHC class I assembly assay (Fig. 5 B). Tapasin-specific heavy chain cross-links were clearly isolated after 25 min and suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry between tapasin and heavy chain, because the size of the cross-link was approximately 90 kDa (heavy chain has a molecular mass of 43 kDa and that of tapasin is 48 kDa). The interaction of tapasin with MHC class I at later time points is in agreement with the suggestion that the heterodimeric complex of heavy chain-β2-microglobulin must form prior to the assembly of a peptide-loading subcomplex which also comprises calreticulin. The discrete nature of the tapasin-specific cross-linking product is also suggestive of a direct interaction between heavy chain and tapasin and emphasizes the crucial role that this protein plays in the association between heavy chains and the TAP peptide transporter (31.Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In summary, we have developed a synchronized SP cell translation system that has allowed us to evaluate the timing of interaction of calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, and tapasin with unassembled and assembled chains. The ability to add any cell line to this system will give us the opportunity to determine the folding, assembly, and interaction of MHC class I molecules with ER resident proteins in cells deficient in specific proteins thought to be involved in this process. Using this approach, we have clearly demonstrated distinct roles for calnexin and calreticulin during the assembly of the MHC class I complex. In addition, we have confirmed that tapasin interacts directly with heavy chain and that this interaction is probably dependent on the formation of a heavy chain-β2-microglobulin heterodimer. We have also shown that ERp57 interacts with both unassembled and assembled heavy chains and suggest that this protein plays a role in initial MHC class I heavy folding, the final stages of assembly, and possibly, the degradation of misfolded heavy chains. We are grateful to all our colleagues who have provided us with reagents for this work (see “Experimental Procedures”)."

Previously, a subunit of the proteasome, S5a, was identified that was able to bind to polyubiquitinin vitro and thus proposed to act as a substrate recognition component. Deletion of the correspondingSaccharomyces cerevisiae gene, MCB1/RPN10, rendered cells viable indicating that other proteasomal polyubiquitin receptors must exist. In this study, we describepus1 + , the fission yeast homologue of RPN10. This gene is also not required for cell viability; however, the Δpus1 mutant is synthetically lethal with mutations in other proteasomal component-encoding genes, namely mts3, pad1, and mts4 (RPN12,RPN11, and RPN1). Overexpression ofpus1 + is able to rescue mts3–1 at 32 °C but overexpression of a cDNA encoding a version of Pus1 that does not bind to polyubiquitin cannot and leads to greatly reduced viability when used to rescue the mts3–1Δpus1 double mutant. The Mts3 protein was unable to bind to polyubiquitin in vitro, but the Pus1 and Mts3 proteins were found to bind to one another in vitro, which taken together with the genetic data suggests that they are also closely associated in vivo.

It is responsible for the proteolysis of a wide variety of cellular proteins including important short-lived regulatory proteins such as p53, I-κB, c-Myc, c-Fos, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (reviewed in Refs. 1.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 2.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Another crucial function of this pathway is the elimination of misfolded or denatured proteins such as those that arise in cases of heat shock or other forms of cellular stress (5.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Proteins are targeted for destruction by the addition of a polyubiquitin chain and then degraded by a large multisubunit protease known as the 26 S proteasome.Ubiquitin is a highly conserved, 76 amino acid protein that is synthesized into chains by an enzymatic cascade. Through the actions of an activating enzyme, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and in most cases a separate ubiquitin ligase, a chain of ubiquitin monomers are joined to each other through a series of isopeptide bonds that are formed between the C-terminal glycine in one ubiquitin moiety and the side chain of an internal lysine in the next one (reviewed in Refs. 1.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 3.Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and 6.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). A ubiquitin chain elongation factor has recently been identified, and the term E4 is used to describe this type of activity (7.Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The linkage between the polyubiquitin chain and the substrate is also via an isopeptide bond, usually utilizing a lysine residue within the target protein, forming a structure known as a polyubiquitinated protein conjugate. Although there is more than one lysine residue within the ubiquitin sequence, polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys-48 seem to be the most important in targeting substrates to the proteasome (8.Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.van Nocker S. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24766-24773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin chains linked by Lys-63 do not appear to have a role in proteolysis but are involved somehow in mediating post-replicative DNA repair (8.Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11.Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar).After a ubiquitinated substrate conjugate has been generated, the next step in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway is the recognition of the polyubiquitin chain by the 26 S proteasome. This large multisubunit protease consist of two subcomplexes, the 20 S catalytic core and the 19 S regulatory cap (reviewed in Refs. 6.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar and 12.Lupas A. Koster A.J. Baumeister W.

The 20 S core consists of four seven-membered rings of subunits, grouped into two types, α and β. The various catalytic activities of the proteasome are formed by the N-terminal threonine residues of some of the β-subunits and are housed in the interior of the 20 S core shielding the rest of the cell from the proteolytic activity (15.Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16.Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Frommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P.-M. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 17.Seemueller E. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Nature. 1996; 382: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Crystallography studies have determined the three-dimensional structure of the 20 S core from Thermophilus acidophilum andSaccharomyces cerevisiae (18.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 19.Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). At the ends of the 20 S core in T. acidophilum, there are narrow channels, through which it is presumed that substrates can enter. In the case of the yeast 20 S core, however, there are no openings at all suggesting that the channels are gated presumably by association with the 19 S cap. The finding that the 20 S core alone can degrade small peptides but not native proteins suggests that the recognition of polyubiquitinated conjugates, unfolding of substrates and their translocation into the 20 S core are functions performed by the 19 S regulatory cap sub-complex. The 19 S cap consists of 17 different proteins that fall into two groups (20.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six subunits are members of a family of ATPases, and it has been proposed that they function as reverse chaperones, unfolding substrates and translocating them into the core particle (21.Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22.Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23.Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrates that the ATPases do, in fact, have the ability to act as chaperones and refold substrates in vitro (24.Braun B.C. Glickmann M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P-M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The remaining proteins are termed the non-ATPases. Their role is less clear but proposed functions also include unfolding and recognition of substrates as well as the recycling of ubiquitin moieties.One of the major unanswered questions regarding the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway is how are polyubiquitinated substrates recognized by the 26 S proteasome? The simplest model would suggest that one particular subunit of the 19 S cap would be responsible and therefore possess polyubiquitin chain binding activity. One of the non-ATPase subunits of the human proteasome, S5a, was found to possess polyubiquitin chain binding activity in vitro (25.Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homologues of this protein in Arabidopsis,Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae were also subsequently found to have in vitro chain binding activity (26.van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27.Haracska L. Udvardy A. Eur. J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletion of the corresponding yeast geneRPN10 (formerly MCB1) resulted in cells that were viable and that degraded the majority of short-lived proteins in a manner similar to wild type (28.van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast have shown that the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates is essential for the progression of the cell cycle (22.Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23.Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), thus Rpn10 is presumably not the sole proteasomal recognition factor for polyubiquitin conjugates, although the strain lacking Rpn10 was sensitive to amino acid analogues suggesting that this protein does play a role in proteolysis. Intriguingly, the role of this subunit in degradation and its ability to bind to polyubiquitin appear to be mediated by different and distinct parts of the Rpn10 protein (29.Fu H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Van Nocker S. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1970-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Various studies have identified a region of S5a/Rpn10 that is necessary for binding to polyubiquitin (29.Fu H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Van Nocker S. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1970-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30.Haracska L. Udvardy A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is a stretch of conserved hydrophobic amino acids usually LAL(M)AL, a finding consistent with reports that have implicated hydrophobic residues on the surface of ubiquitin as being important in the binding of polyubiquitin chains to the 26 S proteasome (32.Beal, R., Deveraux, Q., Xia, G., Rechsteiner, M., and Pickart, C. (1996) 93, 861–866Google Scholar). Surprisingly, neither the complementation of the sensitivity to amino acid analogues nor the ability to degrade certain test substrates required a wild type polyubiquitin-binding site, but instead both were dependent upon an intact N-terminal sequence. It was unclear, therefore, whether the polyubiquitin-binding site identifiedin vitro has any relevance in vivo.Recent work has demonstrated that the 19 S regulatory cap of the yeast proteasome can be dissected into two discrete subcomplexes called the base and the lid (33.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). These sub-complexes were formed upon purification of the proteasome from the Δrpn10 strain, and their formation was then re-produced from wild type proteasomes using high concentrations of salt. The base consists of the six ATPases, Rpn10/S5a, and the two largest non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2, whereas the lid is made up of the remaining non-ATPases. These sub-complexes were used to assign functions of the 19 S cap to various groups of subunits, and it was found that the base could activate the 20 S core in peptide hydrolysis but that for the degradation of polyubiquitinated conjugates both the base and lid were required. It would seem, therefore, that the ability of the proteasome to recognize polyubiquitinated substrates is due to either non-ATPase subunit(s) in the lid complex or by a combination of subunits in the lid and the base.Despite a non-essential role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, Rpn10/S5a would appear to contribute to the degradation of polyubiquitin conjugates in vivo as the steady-state levels of polyubiquitin conjugates were found to increase in aΔRPN10 strain (28.van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of exogenous Mbp1 (the Arabidopsis homologue of S5a) inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in a cell-free system, presumably by competing with the proteasome for ubiquitinated conjugates (34.Deveraux Q. Van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29660-29663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One possible way of identifying other possible polyubiquitin receptors would be to look for mutants that interact genetically with Δrpn10. Previously, we have identified mutations in a number of genes that encode subunits of the fission yeast 26 S proteasome (23.Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25768-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the cloning and analysis of a fission yeast gene,pus1 + , encoding the homologue of Rpn10/S5a.DISCUSSIONThe discovery of a subunit of the 26 S proteasome that was able to bind to polyubiquitin led to the simple model that this was the mechanism by which the complex recognized and bound to its substrates (25.Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possible importance of S5a in substrate recognition was enhanced by the identification of other eukaryotic S5a proteins with binding activity and by the ability of the Arabidopsis S5a protein to inhibit ubiquitin-mediated degradation in cell-free systems (34.Deveraux Q. Van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29660-29663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the surprising discovery that the budding yeast S5a protein, Rpn10/Mcb1, was not essential for cell viability indicated that other polyubiquitin recognition factors existed (28.van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We were interested to see if the fission yeast Rpn10 subunit was also dispensable for growth and therefore cloned the corresponding gene. Pus1, at 243 amino acids, is the shortest Rpn10 protein cloned to date and like its S. cerevisiae orthologue is not essential for cell growth. We demonstrated that this protein had the expected properties of the fission yeast Rpn10 orthologue, namely that it co-purified with the fission yeast proteasome and that the recombinant Pus1 protein was able to bind to polyubiquitin in vitro. Furthermore, Pus1 is able to bind to tetra-ubiquitin that is linked exclusively through Lys-48 residues (data not shown). Chains formed in this manner are believed to be responsible for targeting substrates to the 26 S proteasome, and other Rpn10 orthologues have been shown to possess Lys-48 chain binding activity. Pus1, like Rpn10, has only one polyubiquitin-binding site. Higher eukaryotic orthologues, on the other hand, have a second possible site located in their extended C termini. The potential role in binding of this second site is unclear. One study with the human S5a protein demonstrated that mutating the LALAL sequence to AAAAA (A5) in the first site resulted in a moderate decrease in polyubiquitin binding, whereas conversion of the second site to A5 resulted in a dramatic decrease in binding ability. When both sites were changed to A5, binding was abolished altogether. This study also suggested that the two sites might bind polyubiquitin in a cooperative manner (31.Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In contrast, analysis of theArabidopsis Mbp1 protein found that the second potential binding site did not appear to have significant polyubiquitin chain binding activity (29.Fu H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Van Nocker S. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1970-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When the Pus1 LALAL sequence was mutated to N5, binding was abolished as expected from previous studies on Rpn10 and Mbp1. Interestingly, changing the sequence to A5 did not abolish binding, indicating that in Pus1 at least, the hydrophobic nature of this patch is the critical feature for polyubiquitin binding rather than the alternating size of the hydrophobic residues.The Pus1 protein exists in a low molecular mass form as well as sedimenting in the 26 S proteasomal fractions at the high molecular weight end of a glycerol gradient. This has previously been seen with the S. cerevisiae and Drosophila Rpn10/S5a proteins and suggests that this aspect of S5a is conserved (28.van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the free S5a arises due to dissociation of the complex during purification procedures; however, during glycerol gradient centrifugation after anion exchange chromatography, all the Pus1 protein migrated with the proteasome suggesting that the additional Pus1 had been removed during the first purification step and that the low molecular mass form did not arise due to dissociation during the glycerol gradient step. Given the ability of S5a/Rpn10 to bind to polyubiquitin, a possible role for the additional free form is to shuttle substrates to the proteasome. Previously, we have found that the fission yeast proteasome is localized predominantly around the inner side of the nuclear periphery (42.Wilkinson C.R.M. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.-P. McIntosh J.R. Gordon C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6465-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for the S. cerevisiae proteasome (49.Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These results suggest that this location is a major site of proteolysis in the cell and could necessitate the use of shuttling proteins to bring substrates to the complex. We were therefore very interested to examine the localization of the Pus1 protein in fission yeast cells to see if the cellular distribution of Pus1 was different to the rest of the proteasomal components. The Pus1 protein, however, displayed an identical localization pattern as the proteasome. If the extra Pus1 was distributed nonspecifically throughout the cell, it would not be obvious from this type of analysis, and therefore cell fractionation techniques might be required to determine where the additional Pus1 is and if indeed it is present in the non-stoichiometric amounts, with respect to the other proteasomal subunits, that it appears to be. If Rpn10/Pus1 does shuttle substrates to the proteasome, there will need to be other factors involved given the non-essential nature of this gene. Possible candidates might be expected to display genetic interactions with the rpn10/pus1 null mutants. Therefore, it is of interest that loss of the proteasome-interacting factor Rad23 in combination with loss of Rpn10 leads to increased canavanine sensitivity and an increase in polyubiquitinated substrates (50.Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other possible candidates include de-ubiquitinating enzymes and E4 factors as they obviously possess the necessary ability to recognize polyubiquitin chains. One such DUB enzyme, Doa4, has recently been shown to interact with the proteasome (51.Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A mutant version of the E4-encoding geneUFD2, in combination with the rpn10 null strain, was found to be hypersensitive to conditions known to induce increased substrates for the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway (7.Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Further genetic analysis using the Δrpn10/Δpus1 strains may well identify more candidates.The pus1 + gene is not essential for cell viability, a finding that confirmed the surprisingRPN10(MCB1) results. All other fission yeast proteasomal subunits cloned to date are essential, and the mutants display a mitotic arrest phenotype presumably reflecting the requirement for the degradation of certain key cell cycle substrates. There are, however, consequences of losing pus1. As with therpn10 null strain, the cells are sensitive to amino acid analogues such as canavanine and also display a mild accumulation of polyubiquitin conjugates (data not shown). Rescue of the canavanine sensitivity did not require an intact polyubiquitin-binding site so these results and those described previously suggested that the polyubiquitin-binding site has no in vivo relevance. Recently, the gene encoding the Rpn10 orthologue in the mossPhyscomitrella patens was cloned and deleted (52.Girod P.A. Fu H. Zryd J.P. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1457-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the strain was viable, it was developmentally abnormal, generating caulonema that were unable to form buds and gametophores. A mouse Rpn10 homologue has also now been cloned, so it will be interesting to see if there are any developmental abnormalities associated with a null phenotype in this case and also to assess if developmental functions are associated with the increased size of the higher eukaryotic Rpn10 proteins (53.Pusch W. Jahner D. Ivell R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Despite the considerable increase in size, it is clear that there is functional conservation among the Rpn10 orthologues by the ability of the human S5agene to rescue the canavanine sensitivity of the pus1 null mutant, as illustrated here and other previous studies.The ability of pus1 + to rescue themts3–1 mutant at 32 °C when overexpressed is probably due to the fact that the two subunits bind to one another in the proteasome. Most likely is that overexpression ofpus1 + helps to force the physical interaction between these two proteins thus increasing the incorporation of the mutant version of Mts3 into the complex. This close physical association is also apparent from studying the mts3–1mutant at 25 °C, and as shown in this case, the Pus1 protein smears across a glycerol gradient more than in wild type extracts (data not shown). The fact that we have shown that the two proteins can interactin vitro substantiates this idea. Furthermore, we have determined the nature of the mts3–1 mutation and shown that it results in the deletion of more than a quarter of the protein. As the mts3–1 mutant is viable at 25 °C, this C-terminal part of the protein is dispensable for cell viability but appears important in mediating incorporation into the complex as increasing the temperature results in an increasing smearing of the protein across a glycerol gradient with the highest amount being in the low molecular weight fraction. Previously, it has been shown that at 36 °C, this mutation results in the truncated version of Mts3 being totally lost from the proteasome. One reason why overexpression of pus1is unable to rescue the mutant at 36 °C could be that the binding between the two proteins is greatly reduced at this higher temperature and that in this case it is not possible to force the equilibrium of binding sufficiently in favor of the direction in which the truncated Mts3 will become incorporated into the proteasome. Also, overexpression of pus1 + does not rescue a mts3 null mutant indicating that these two genes are not functionally redundant. This is in contrast to a previous study where overexpression of theS. cerevisiae RPN10 gene (also known as SUN1) was found to rescue a rpn12 (nin1) disruptant.RPN12 is the homologue of mts3 (48.Kominami K. Okura N. Kawamura M. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Shimbara N. Chung C.H. Fujimura M. Yokosawa H. Shimizu Y. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This difference is intriguing although it is not clear if there was a complete loss of RPN12 in the disruption constructs. If partial RPN12 sequence remained and gave rise to a partial Rpn12 protein, overexpression of RPN10 might rescue a truncated version.The inability of the N5 version of Pus1 to rescue theΔpus1mts3–1 or just the mts3–1 mutant (data not shown) at 32 °C is intriguing. Presumably the N5 mutation doesn't cause any great perturbation in structure as it is able to rescue the canavanine sensitivity of the deletion strain and also theΔpus1pad1–1 and Δpus1mts4–1 double mutants as well as the wild type Pus1 protein. Furthermore, the Pus1N5 protein is equally able to bind to Mts3 in vitro and also to the truncated version of Mts3 (data not shown). Moreover, the distribution of the C-terminally truncated Mts3 is identical in gradients made from cells overexpressing either the wild type or N5-mutated pus1cDNA as is the distribution of these two versions of Pus1. If the LALAL region were involved in direct binding to Mts3, then mutating it to N5 would be expected to disrupt this binding and alter the gradient profiles. This was not observed. Also, one might expect in the case of direct binding involving LALAL that the addition of increasing amounts of Mts3 to Pus1 in vitro before the addition of polyubiquitin would diminish binding of the chains, but this was also not observed (data not shown). So what is the reason behind the failure of Pus1N5 to rescue mts3–1? One possible explanation is that Mts3 is another polyubiquitin-binding protein. However, ourin vitro assays failed to detect any activity. This could be due to improper folding of the recombinant protein or perhaps Mts3 has to be assembled into the complex before assuming the right conformation to bind polyubiquitin. Alternatively, perhaps, the combined loss of Mts3 from the complex at 32 °C in combination with a version of Pus1 that cannot bind to polyubiquitin results in too little ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, and"

Among such cofactors is the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1. Remarkably, BAG-1 is expressed as multiple isoforms, which are distinguished by their amino termini. We investigated whether distinct isoforms differ with respect to their Hsc70-regulating activity. By comparing the mainly cytosolic isoforms BAG-1M and BAG-1S, opposite effects of the two isoforms were observed in chaperone-assisted folding reactions. Whereas BAG-1M was found to inhibit the Hsc70-mediated refolding of nonnative polypeptide substrates, the BAG-1S isoform stimulated Hsc70 chaperone activity. The opposite effects are not due to differences in the regulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 by the two isoforms. Both isoforms stimulated ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 in an Hsp40-dependent manner through an acceleration of ADP-ATP exchange. Our results reveal that the different amino termini of the distinct BAG-1 isoforms determine the outcome of an Hsc70-mediated folding event, most likely by transiently interacting with the polypeptide substrate. Employing isoforms of a cofactor with different substrate binding properties appears to provide the means to influence the chaperone function of Hsc70 in addition to modulating its ATPase cycle.

During these processes Hsc70 recognizes and stabilizes nonnative polypeptide substrates in a manner regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. In recent years several Hsc70-associated cofactors have been identified that modulate the Hsc70 ATPase cycle and, thus, alter the substrate binding affinity of the chaperone protein (2.Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3.Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One important group of cofactors is the Hsp40 protein family. Members of this family stimulate ATP hydrolysis, driving Hsc70 into the ADP-bound form with high affinity for the substrate (2.Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). Another cofactor shown to accelerate the ATPase cycle of Hsc70 is the BAG-1 protein (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8.Takayama S.

Notably, BAG-1 is expressed as distinct isoforms, which arise from a common transcript through the use of alternative in-frame translational start sites (11.Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12.Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although all isoforms share a central ubiquitin-like domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain, which is sufficient for Hsc70 binding and regulation, the isoforms differ considerably in the length of their amino termini (see Fig. 1 A). This is reflected in a different number of a hexapeptide motif (TRSEEX, in one letter code) present in the amino termini. Whereas the longer human isoforms BAG-1L and BAG-1M display 10 TRSEEX repeats, the human BAG-1S isoform possesses only four repeats (see Fig.1 A). In addition, the extended amino terminus of BAG-1L comprises a putative nuclear localization signal. BAG-1L was indeed shown to localize predominantly to the nucleus, whereas BAG-1M and BAG-1S were mainly found in the cytosol (11.Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12.Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, oncogenic transformation results in an altered ratio of the distinct isoforms (12.Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Yang X. Hao Y. Ding Z. Pater A. Tang S.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1816-1822PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the M isoform has been detected in human but not in mouse cells, where only the longer (L-) and shorter (S-) isoforms seem to be generated (12.Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have now revealed that the distinct BAG-1 isoforms differentially affect cellular processes (see Table I). For example a stimulation of the transactivation activity of the androgen receptor was observed for BAG-1L but not for BAG-1M and BAG-1S (15.Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In another study BAG-1L and BAG-1M were shown to inhibit the DNA binding and transactivation activity of the glucocorticoid receptor, whereas BAG-1S did not affect this activity (16.Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether the observed functional diversity is related to differences in the Hsc70-regulating activity of the distinct BAG-1 isoforms. As a first step toward answering this question we decided to compare the mainly cytosolic isoforms BAG-1M and BAG-1S with regard to their activity in the regulation of the Hsc70 ATPase cycle and in Hsc70-mediated refolding reactions. We show that human BAG-1M as well as human and murine BAG-1S all stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 in an Hsp40-dependent manner and in this way induce the release of substrates from Hsc70. Yet BAG-1M and BAG-1S affect the Hsc70-mediated refolding of denatured polypeptide substrates in opposite ways. Whereas BAG-1M inhibits the refolding reaction, BAG-1S displays a stimulating activity. The different amino termini of the BAG-1 isoforms apparently determine the effect of the cofactor on Hsc70-mediated protein folding, most likely due to transient interactions with the polypeptide substrate.Table ICellular functions of BAG-1 isoformsObservation/cellular functionInvolvement of BAG-1 isoformsReference No.Binding to Bcl-2 and protection from apoptosisBAG-1S27.Takayama S.

BAG-1M-containing fractions were pooled, 10 volumes of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added, and the diluted fractions were loaded on a Source 30Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For equilibration and washing of the 30Q column buffer C (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was used. BAG-1M was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 20–200 mmKCl. To obtain the cDNA sequence corresponding to the human BAG-1S isoform (amino acids 45–274 of human BAG-1M) plasmid pVL-bag-1 (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) was used as template in a polymerase chain reaction with primers containing EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites for subcloning into vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen). The cDNA of murine BAG-1S was cloned from total RNA of mouse NIH3T3 cells by employing the Access reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction system (Promega). RNA was purified with the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen). To generate recombinant baculovirus the digested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fragment was inserted into theEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of plasmid pVL1392. The resulting constructs pVL-hbag-1s and pVL-mbag-1s were used for co-transfection of Sf9 cells, and recombinant baculoviruses were generated. After infection of insect cells with recombinant viruses and expression of human and mouse BAG-1S for 4 days, cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell. Both proteins were purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Bio-Gel HT hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad), and Source 30Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resins. Purification of human BAG-1S was performed as described above for the human BAG-1M isoform. The mouse BAG-1S isoform was purified similarly except for binding to the hydroxyapatite resin, which was performed at 15 mmpotassium phosphate followed by elution with a gradient of 15–500 mm potassium phosphate. Pooled fractions were diluted 10-fold with 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing protease inhibitors and loaded on a Source 30Q column equilibrated in buffer D (20 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 20 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Mouse BAG-1S was eluted using a gradient of 20–250 mm KCl in buffer D. The cDNA sequence coding for the carboxyl-terminal fragment of human BAG-1 (C130, amino acids 145–274 of human BAG-1M) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from plasmid pVL-bag-1 (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and subcloned into NdeI/SmaI-digested plasmid pTYB2 (New England Biolabs) using an NdeI restriction site overlapping the ATG start codon. In the resultant construct, the cDNA sequence of the BAG-1 fragment is fused in-frame to the coding region of a self-cutting intein/chitin binding domain. For the expression and purification of the carboxyl-terminal fusion protein, the IMPACT T7 kit (New England Biolabs) was employed according to a standard procedure described in the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed in a French pressure cell in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA) containing Complete protease inhibitor. The cleared lysate was mixed with a chitin affinity resin for 1 h at 4 °C, and after binding of the fusion protein, the resin was washed extensively with lysis buffer and finally with cleavage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA). The affinity matrix was equilibrated in cleavage buffer containing 40 mm dithiothreitol and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The reducing agent induced intein-mediated self-cleavage of the fusion protein, resulting in the release of the BAG-1 fragment. For elution the resin was washed with 20 mmMOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The obtained BAG-1 fragment differed from the native sequence by one additional glycine residue at the carboxyl terminus. After purification of the BAG-1 isoforms and the deletion fragment, proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford reagent with purified IgG (Sigma) as the standard and by measuring absorbance at 205 nm (17.Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of purified proteins were calculated for monomeric proteins. Purity of the protein preparations was determined by scanning and quantification of the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. ATPase activity was measured as described (18.Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Hsc70 was incubated at 30 °C with cofactors as indicated in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 70 μCi/ml [α-32P]ATP. After 10-fold dilutions of aliquots into 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 20 mm EDTA and thin layer chromatography, ADP formation was quantified using the Bio-imaging Analyzer (Fuji). ADP release from Hsc70-32P-nucleotide complexes in the presence of human BAG-1S was investigated as described for the M isoform (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). 3 μm Hsc70, 2 μm Hsp40, and 6 μm BAG-1 as indicated were preincubated in complex formation buffer (20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) supplemented with 2 mm ATP at room temperature for 5 min. 1 μm luciferase was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 42 °C. After denaturation of luciferase, one volume of ice-cold glycerol/EDTA buffer (20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) was added. Alternatively, BAG-1 (6 μm) or just complex formation buffer were added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min before mixing with glycerol/EDTA buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 4 °C and 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fractions were subjected to gel filtration analysis using a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (19.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Refolding of heat-denatured firefly luciferase in the absence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate was performed as described (19.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 100% activity corresponds to the enzyme activity of native luciferase that was diluted into refolding buffer A (10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For the refolding of chemically denatured β-galactosidase, a recently published assay was employed (8.Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Refolding of 3.4 nm guanidine hydrochloride-denatured β-galactosidase in the presence of 1.6 μm Hsc70, 3.2 μm Hsp40, and 3.2 μm indicated proteins was assayed with the Galacto-Light system (Tropix). At various time points an aliquot of each sample was mixed with reaction buffer in a luminometer tube and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The tube was placed in the luminometer and, after injection of accelerator solution, light emission was counted for 10 s. The enzymatic activity of native β-galactosidase in refolding buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol) was set to 100%. Aggregation of luciferase during heat denaturation was assayed as before (19.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) except for the centrifugation step, which was performed at 20,800 × g. The β-galactosidase aggregation assay was performed as described previously (20.Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After denaturation of β-galactosidase for 30 min at 30 °C in denaturation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride) denatured β-galactosidase was diluted 1:125 to a final concentration of 3.4 nm into refolding buffer B containing 1.6 μm Hsc70, 3.2 μm Hsp40, and other proteins (3.2 μm) as indicated. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, placed on ice, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 20,800 × g. Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Promega). Soluble β-galactosidase detected in the supernatant fraction was quantified relative to the total amount of β-galactosidase detected in both fractions by employing a LAS-1000 CCD camera and Image Gauge analysis software (Fuji). To test whether isoforms of BAG-1 that differ in their amino termini behave similarly in the regulation of Hsc70 function, we expressed and purified recombinant human BAG-1M, BAG-1S, and mouse BAG-1S (Fig. 1,A and B). All protein preparations were at least 93% pure. In addition, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of human BAG-1, C130, was expressed and affinity-purified to homogeneity (>98% pure) (Fig. 1, A and B). The ATPase activity of Hsc70 was measured in the presence of the various BAG-1 proteins. As we have shown previously, Hsc70 ATPase activity is strongly stimulated by human BAG-1M in the presence of Hsp40 (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 18.Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). When we replaced the human M isoform with either the shorter S isoform or a carboxyl-terminal fragment of human BAG-1, C130, we observed the same strong stimulation of Hsc70 ATPase activity (Fig.2 A). This effect was dependent on the presence of Hsp40, as addition of BAG-1 isoforms or the fragment alone did not significantly affect the low basal ATPase activity of Hsc70 (Fig. 2 A). The human M isoform increases the Hsc70 ATP hydrolysis rate by accelerating nucleotide exchange in the presence of Hsp40 (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Similarly, the BAG-1S isoform stimulated ADP release from Hsc70 when added together with Hsp40 (Fig. 2 B). It appears that accelerating nucleotide exchange on Hsc70 is a common function of the distinct human BAG-1 isoforms. Compared with its human counterpart, the murine BAG-1S isoform possesses an amino terminus of slightly different primary structure. The amino acid similarity in this part of the molecules is not as high as in the ubiquitin-like and carboxyl-terminal domains, and the murine protein displays only two copies of the repeat motif TRSEEXcompared with four repeats in human BAG-1S (Fig. 1 A). Therefore we also tested the mouse protein for its ability to stimulate the chaperone ATPase activity in conjunction with Hsp40. Similar to the human isoforms, the mouse BAG-1S protein strongly stimulated the rate of ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 in a manner dependent on the presence of Hsp40 (Fig. 2 A). Apparently, the structural differences observed within the amino termini of the BAG-1 isoforms do not affect the regulation of the Hsc70 ATPase cycle by the cofactors. We have recently shown that BAG-1M can dissociate Hsc70-substrate complexes based on its nucleotide exchange activity (19.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A stimulation of substrate release from Hsc70 was also observed for the shorter human BAG-1S isoform. When firefly luciferase was heat-denatured in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40, formation of a high molecular mass chaperone-substrate complex was observed (about 600–700 kDa) (Fig.3 A) (19.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the presence of human BAG-1S, however, the complex was no longer detectable, and luciferase eluted from the gel filtration column as an uncomplexed form (Fig. 3 A). To verify that accelerated substrate release as opposed to an inhibition of substrate binding is responsible for this observation, an additional experiment was performed. In this case, BAG-1M or BAG-1S was added after formation of the chaperone-substrate complex, and samples were incubated for 15 min under refolding conditions. Whereas a significant amount of the high molecular mass complex was still detectable in the absence of the BAG-1 isoforms under these conditions, the complex was completely dissociated in the presence of the cofactors (Fig. 3 B). This is consistent with an accelerated release of substrates from Hsc70 triggered by the distinct BAG-1 isoforms. Taken together, the BAG-1M and BAG-1S isoforms both stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 by facilitating nucleotide exchange and, in this way, promote the dissociation of an Hsc70-substrate complex. How do the distinct BAG-1 isoforms affect Hsc70-mediated protein folding? To answer this question, firefly luciferase was heat-denatured in the presence of Hsc70, Hsp40, and different BAG-1 isoforms, and effects of the isoforms on the refolding reaction were analyzed. In agreement with previous findings (19.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the human BAG-1M isoform inhibited the Hsc70/Hsp40-mediated reactivation of luciferase (Fig. 4 A). Surprisingly, however, under the same conditions the shorter human S isoform had the opposite effect and strongly stimulated the refolding capacity of the Hsc70/Hsp40 system in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B). When we examined the mouse BAG-1S isoform, a stimulating activity was again observed, and the amount of reactivated luciferase was comparable with that obtained in the presence of human BAG-1S (Fig. 4 A). It was conceivable that the stimulating activity of the small isoforms was due to contaminating proteins following expression of the isoforms in insect cells. In fact, minor amounts of polypeptides in the 70-kDa size range were detectable in the BAG-1S preparations (Fig. 1 B). However, the refolding activity of Hsc70/Hsp40 was also stimulated by the BAG-1 fragment C130, which was derived from a corresponding fusion protein expressed in E. coli and was affinity-purified to homogeneity (Fig. 4 A, see also Fig. 1 B). We therefore conclude that the stimulating activity represents an authentic function of the BAG-1S isoforms and that the amino terminus of the human BAG-1M isoform negatively affects the reactivation of heat-denatured luciferase by Hsc70 and Hsp40. We extended our analysis using β-galactosidase as an additional substrate protein. Consistent with our results in the luciferase refolding assay, reactivation of chemically denatured β-galactosidase by Hsc70 and Hsp40 was blocked in the presence of human BAG-1M, whereas either the human or the mouse BAG-1S isoform exerted a significant stimulation of the refolding reaction (Fig.5). Interestingly, however, the yield of refolded β-galactosidase was not increased by the addition of the C130 fragment, which stimulated the refolding of luciferase. In the case of β-galactosidase, the amino terminus of the BAG-1S isoform is apparently necessary to mediate a stimulating activity, whereas the extended amino terminus of BAG-1M inhibits the reactivation reaction. Again, distinct isoforms of BAG-1 differentially affect Hsc70-mediated protein folding. We next investigated the capacity of the Hsc70/Hsp40 system to prevent the aggregation of denatured polypeptide substrates in the absence and presence of BAG-1 isoforms, respectively. Luciferase was heat-denatured in the presence of different combinations of Hsc70 and cofactors, and the amount of soluble luciferase was assessed. Similarly, the aggregation of β-galactosidase was analyzed after dilution of chemically denatured β-galactosidase into buffer containing Hsc70 and cofactors in different combinations. Hsc70 in conjunction with Hsp40 stabilized denatured luciferase and β-galactosidase, and about 80% and 35% of the total amount of the substrates, respectively, remained soluble in this situation. Addition of BAG-1M, however, strongly impaired the stabilizing activity of Hsc70 (Fig. 6, A and B). This is in agreement with the inhibitory function of BAG-1M observed in the refolding experiments (see above). In contrast, upon the addition of the human and murine BAG-1S isoforms or the C130 fragment to an Hsc70/Hsp40-containing reaction, luciferase or β-galactosidase were efficiently stabilized (Fig. 6 A). These results again reveal a differential regulation of Hsc70 chaperone function by the BAG-1M and BAG-1S isoforms. When we incubated the denatured substrates in the presence of each BAG-1 isoform alone, human BAG-1M stabilized a significant portion of both denatured luciferase and β-galactosidase (60–65% soluble; Fig.6, A and B). In the case of the BAG-1S isoforms and the C130 fragment, however, both substrate proteins were found mainly in the insoluble pellet fractions (5–20% soluble; Fig. 6,A and B). Thus it appears that the BAG-1M isoform can interact with a substrate protein to promote stabilization in the absence of Hsc70. For this interaction, the extended amino terminus of the M isoform appears to be essential, as the shorter S isoforms did not stabilize denatured luciferase and only weakly affected denatured β-galactosidase. Here we demonstrate that distinct isoforms of the chaperone cofactor BAG-1 differentially affect Hsc70 chaperone function. The mainly cytosolic isoforms BAG-1M and BAG-1S in fact display opposite effects. The longer M isoform acts as an inhibitor of the Hsc70 chaperone system, whereas the S isoform promotes the folding capacity of the chaperone protein. Remarkably, these differences are not caused by distinct regulatory activities of the two isoforms in the modulation of the ATPase cycle of Hsc70. Both BAG-1M and BAG-1S strongly stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 in a manner dependent on Hsp40. This appears to be due to an accelerated exchange of ADP against ATP following the Hsp40-induced hydrolysis step, since both isoforms are able to trigger ADP release from Hsc70 (Fig. 2 B) (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). An Hsp40-dependent stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 was also observed for a carboxyl-terminal fragment of BAG-1, which lacks the ubiquitin-like domain and the amino-terminal TRSEEX repeat region (Fig. 2 A). Apparently, the amino-terminal portion of BAG-1 does not influence the regulation of the Hsc70 ATPase cycle by the cofactor. Yet, the distinct amino termini of the different BAG-1 isoforms determine the effect of the cofactor in Hsc70-mediated folding reactions. How can this be explained? Secondary structure analysis of the BAG-1M amino terminus predicts that the 10 TRSEEX repeats form an extended amphipathic α-helix with the negatively charged residues aligned in three rows along the axis of the helix (21.Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, six positively charged residues are found at the extreme amino terminus of BAG-1M and appear to form a cluster on top of the amphipathic helix (Fig. 1 A). It is tempting to speculate that this remarkable structural arrangement represents a protein-protein interaction domain. The BAG-1S isoform lacks the positively charged head group and displays an incomplete repeat region (Fig. 1 A). Conceivably, these differences in the structure of the amino termini may cause altered protein binding properties of the BAG-1 isoforms. The different effects observed for BAG-1M and BAG-1S in Hsc70-mediated protein folding may thus be explained by an altered interaction of the cofactors with the chaperone protein or, alternatively, with the polypeptide substrate. We favor the latter notion because the amino terminus of BAG-1 is dispensable for the interaction of the cofactor with Hsc70 and does not modulate the regulatory function of the cofactor in the ATPase cycle (Fig. 2). The amino termini of the BAG-1 isoforms may represent substrate interaction domains with distinct binding properties. In fact the BAG-1M isoform alone is able to stabilize denatured luciferase and β-galactosidase, whereas the BAG-1S isoform does not prevent luciferase aggregation during heat treatment and displays only a weak stabilizing activity in the case of β-galactosidase (Fig. 6). Despite the stabilizing activity of BAG-1M we were unable to demonstrate the formation of a complex comprising the chaperone cofactor and the denatured substrate (not shown). The interaction that causes the observed stabilization appears to be rather transient. In any case, our data clearly reveal distinct substrate binding properties of the BAG-1 isoforms determined by their distinct amino termini. The findings presented here regarding the function of the mouse BAG-1S isoform differ from previously published observations. A recent report described that the protein inhibits the refolding of chemically denatured β-galactosidase mediated by Hsc70 and Hsp40 (20.Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas we observed a stimulating activity of the BAG-1S isoform. We can only speculate about the reasons for these differences. Important aspects might be the source of the recombinant proteins that were used and possibly a modification of the proteins for facilitated purification. To ensure functionality, we expressed the different BAG-1 isoforms in eukaryotic cells without any modifying tags. Leaving the amino terminus unperturbed might be of particular importance in the light of our findings indicating a role in substrate binding. In this regard it is also noteworthy that Nollen et al. (22.Nollen E.A.A. Brunsting J.F. Song J. Kampinga H.H. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) recently described an inhibiting activity of BAG-1S on the refolding of heat-denatured luciferase in vivo. BAG-1S-induced release of luciferase from Hsc70, which results in productive folding in vitro, may thus be unproductive in the cellular environment, possibly due to inappropriate interactions with other proteins. An interaction of a chaperone cofactor with nonnative polypeptide substrates has previously been described for the bacterial Hsp40 homologue DnaJ (23.Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The cofactor appears to deliver polypeptide substrates to its Hsp70 partner protein. In this way a transfer of the chaperone into the high affinity substrate binding state, which is induced by the Hsp40 homologue, may only occur when a substrate is present in the near vicinity. The BAG-1 isoforms act later in the ATPase and peptide binding cycle of Hsc70 and can trigger the dissociation of the chaperone-substrate complex (Fig. 3) (19.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The isoforms may thus bind to the polypeptide substrate following its release from Hsc70. Remarkably, BAG-1M alone stabilizes heat-denatured luciferase but, in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40, promotes aggregation (Fig. 6). In the latter case, the polypeptide substrate might be presented to BAG-1M in a more extended conformation, and accordingly, a transient interaction with the cofactor might be insufficient to exert a stabilizing effect while at the same time the cofactor interferes with the action of Hsc70. We cannot exclude that a so-far undetected interaction of the amino terminus of BAG-1M with Hsc70 might occur during this process. Our results are intriguing with respect to recently observed functional differences between the BAG-1 isoforms in the regulation of signal transduction pathways (see Table I). For example BAG-1L and BAG-1M but not BAG-1S were found to inhibit the transactivation activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (16.Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For the inhibition the complete TRSEEX repeat region of the longer isoforms was required. Since Hsc70 cooperates with the molecular chaperone Hsp90 during the regulation of steroid hormone receptors (2.Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,6.Caplan A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar), the distinct effects of the BAG-1 isoforms in receptor activation may be caused by their distinct Hsc70-modulating activities. By combining the carboxyl-terminal Hsc70 binding domain of BAG-1 with different amino termini, the cell appears to have found means to expand the regulatory function of the cofactor. In this regard it is remarkable that several BAG-1-related proteins have recently been identified (26.Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). All carry a region of about 45 amino acids similar to the Hsc70 binding domain of BAG-1 (BAG-domain; Fig. 1 A). The BAG domain is often located near or at the carboxyl terminus of these proteins, whereas different sequence motifs and domains extend toward the amino terminus. It is intriguing to speculate about an involvement of these BAG-1-related proteins in inducing functional specificity of the Hsc70 chaperone system. The diversity in Hsc70 regulation achieved by employing distinct BAG-1 isoforms may thus have been further extended through the recruitment of a larger family of BAG-1-related proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1963924076,"The activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels is the final step in olfactory and visual transduction. Previously we have shown that, in addition to their activation by cyclic nucleotides, nitric oxide (NO)-generating compounds can directly open olfactory CNG channels through a redox reaction that results in the S-nitrosylation of a free SH group on a cysteine residue. To identify the target site(s) of NO, we have now mutated the four candidate intracellular cysteine residues Cys-460, Cys-484, Cys-520, and Cys-552 of the rat olfactory rCNG2 (α) channel into serine residues. All mutant channels continue to be activated by cyclic nucleotides, but only one of them, the C460S mutant channel, exhibited a total loss of NO sensitivity. This result was further supported by a similar lack of NO sensitivity that we found for a natural mutant of this precise cysteine residue, the Drosophila melanogasterCNG channel. Cys-460 is located in the C-linker region of the channel known to be important in channel gating. Kinetic analyses suggested that at least two of these Cys-460 residues on different channel subunits were involved in the activation by NO. Our results show that one single cysteine residue is responsible for NO sensitivity but that several channel subunits need to be activated for channel opening by NO. The activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels is the final step in olfactory and visual transduction. Previously we have shown that, in addition to their activation by cyclic nucleotides, nitric oxide (NO)-generating compounds can directly open olfactory CNG channels through a redox reaction that results in the S-nitrosylation of a free SH group on a cysteine residue. To identify the target site(s) of NO, we have now mutated the four candidate intracellular cysteine residues Cys-460, Cys-484, Cys-520, and Cys-552 of the rat olfactory rCNG2 (α) channel into serine residues. All mutant channels continue to be activated by cyclic nucleotides, but only one of them, the C460S mutant channel, exhibited a total loss of NO sensitivity. This result was further supported by a similar lack of NO sensitivity that we found for a natural mutant of this precise cysteine residue, the Drosophila melanogasterCNG channel. Cys-460 is located in the C-linker region of the channel known to be important in channel gating. Kinetic analyses suggested that at least two of these Cys-460 residues on different channel subunits were involved in the activation by NO. Our results show that one single cysteine residue is responsible for NO sensitivity but that several channel subunits need to be activated for channel opening by NO. cyclic nucleotide-gated cyclic nucleotide nitric oxide human embryonic kidney green fluorescent protein base pair S-nitrosocysteine Activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG)1 channels is the final step in the transduction pathways in both vision and olfaction (1.Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The opening of olfactory and photoreceptor CNG channels relies on the binding of at least two molecules of cAMP or cGMP. These ubiquitous cyclic nucleotide second messengers bind at intracellular sites on the channel protein to activate a nonspecific cation conductance. This conductance has a significant permeability to calcium ions (1.Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and thus, CNG channel activation can lead not only to depolarization but also to Ca2+ influx. Native olfactory CNG channels are constructed from at least three different but highly homologous subunits, variously called CNG2 or α (original designation OCNC1 (2.Dhallan R.S. Yau K.W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar)), CNG5 or β (original designation OCNC2 (3.Bradley J. Li J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Zinn K. Proc. Natl.

J. 1998; 75: 825-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have identified several regions and residues that play an important role in channel activation. Several intracellularly located cysteine residues in or near the cyclic nucleotide (CN) binding region (see Ref. 7.Biel M. Zong X. Hofmann F. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar for review and Fig. 1 A for diagram) appear to affect the gating reaction either through subunit-subunit interactions or within single channel subunits (19.Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2667-2679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Gordon S.E. Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 431-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The gaseous messenger nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to exert its gating effects on the CNG channel by a redox modulation of at least one of these intracellular cysteines by reactive nitrogen species that are downstream of NO itself (i.e. the nitrosonium ion, NO+) (21.Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This direct regulation of protein by NO, so-called “S-nitrosylation,” has been proposed to play a critical role in many processes such as blood pressure regulation, host defense, and neurotransmission (22.Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 2002–2012Google Scholar, 23.Broillet M.-C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ion channel regulation has also been postulated to occur by S-nitrosylation (24.Lei S.Z. Pan Z.H. Aggarwal S.K. Chen H.S.V. Hartman J. Sucher N.J. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 25.Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J. Pagano P. Cohen R.A.

Science. 1998; 279: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Among ion channels, only the CNG channel has been shown to be directly activated by NO (21.Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Of the 8 cysteine residues distributed throughout the rat olfactory rCNG2 (α) channel (Fig. 1 A), our previous biochemical evidence identified 1 residue located on the intracellular face of the channel as the putative target site for S-nitrosylation (21.Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have therefore focused on the cysteines located on the intracellular face of the channel, and we generated a series of mutant subunit constructs in which each of these cysteines was changed to a serine residue. After expression in HEK 293 cells, we were able to test each of these channels for activation by cAMP and/or NO. We found that the cysteine in position 460, within the C-linker region just N-terminal to the CN binding region, is the critical residue in the reaction that leads to channel activation by NO. Cysteine to serine mutants of rCNG2 (α) were generated by substituting the specific cysteine residues with serines using the polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis described by Nelson and Long (28.Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, CA) was used to reduce the rate of contaminating mutations. The point mutants were designated as C460S, C484S, C520S, and C552S. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 1% gentamicin. A pCIS expression vector (Genentech, CA) containing either the wild type rat olfactory subunit rCNG2 (α) (29.Chen T.-Y. Peng Y.-W. Dhallan R.S. Ahamed B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1993; 362: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) or one of the four different types of mutant rCNG2 (α) channel was used to perform transient transfections using a standard calcium phosphate protocol (30.Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Techniques. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with a vector containing the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (kind gift of M. Chalfie) at a 1:1 molar ratio. Patch clamp recordings were made 2–3 days after transfection. GFP was used as an indicator of transfection success (31.Cubitt, A. B., Heim, R., Adams, S. R., Boyd, A. E., Gross, L. A., and Tsien, R. Y. (1995) Trends Biochem. Sci. 448–455Google Scholar, 32.Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 951-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), efficiency, and probable expression of rCNG2 (α) wild type or mutants. GFP fluorescence was visualized in living cells without histological processing with a fluorescence microscope using fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets that span the excitation wavelengths 450–500 nm. For Northern blot experiments, HEK 293 cells were harvested 2 days after transfection with rCNG2 (α) wild type or mutant cDNAs. The total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 15 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated on formaldehyde gel and blotted. The blot was hybridized at 42 °C with DIG-11-dUTP-labeled 500-bp cDNA fragment located at wild type rCNG2 (α) coding region 1251–1751 bp. The hybridized blot was detected by DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Electrophysiological patch clamp recordings were made using the inside-out configuration (33.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). Electrodes were fabricated from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, TW150F-6) and fire-polished to tip resistances of 10 to 20 megohms. The pipette solution was the same as the Ca2+-free solution (see below), so that both faces of the membrane patch were bathed in symmetrical solutions. The Ca2+-free solution contained (in mm) NaCl, 145; EGTA, 0.5; EDTA, 0.5; HEPES, 10; pH 7.6. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and stored on digital audiotape (DAS 75, Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Signals were played back, digitized, and stored on a Macintosh Quadra 800 using the software Acquire (Instrutech, NY). The filter bandwidth was 0–2000 Hz, and the sampling interval was 100 μs. The signals have been analyzed using the software programs MacTac (Instrutech, NY), pClamp 6 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and Igor (Wavemetrics Inc., OR). Channel detection was by the 50% threshold protocol. Observation of the degree of fluorescence after co-transfection with a vector containing the gene for the GFP allowed us to reliably select for cells with a high probability of either single channel or macroscopic currents (hundreds of channels) in the membrane patch. The macroscopic currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and stored on a Macintosh Quadra 800 using the software Pulse (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) and analyzed with the software Igor (Wavemetrics Inc., OR). SNC was prepared on ice from the combination of equimolar amounts of l-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium nitrite (24.Lei S.Z. Pan Z.H. Aggarwal S.K. Chen H.S.V. Hartman J. Sucher N.J. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). This stock solution remains effective for approximately 2 h. All pharmacological agents were dissolved in the Ca2+-free solution for perfusion via a multibarreled perfusion pipette (Warner Instrument Corp., CT) positioned close to the membrane patch. This rapid perfusion system was computer-controlled by the software Pulse (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) and had a mean rise time in response to a solution change of ∼29 ms. All recordings were made at room temperature. The data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Differences between means were analyzed using the Student's t test for paired experiments. From experiments utilizing membrane-impermeant SH-modifying reagents to activate olfactory CNG channels in inside-out patches, we previously identified the probable NO target site as one of four intracellular cysteine residues (21.Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, the four intracellular cysteines of the rat olfactory CNG channel rCNG2 (α) occur C-terminally to the sixth transmembrane region. Three of them (Cys-484, Cys-520, and Cys-552) are within the cyclic nucleotide binding domain, and the fourth (Cys-460) is in a region of the molecule that links the last transmembrane domain to the CN binding domain, known commonly as the C-linker region. In order to determine the possible contribution of each of these residues to the activation of the channel by NO, we prepared a series of mutant rCNG2 (α) channel subunits sequentially replacing the intracellular cysteine residues in positions 460, 484, 520, and 552 (Fig. 1,A and B) with serine residues by site-directed mutagenesis (28.Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 34.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). This is a conservative mutation in which the SH group of the cysteine, thought to be the redox site of NO action, is replaced by an OH group. Northern blot analysis of each mutant construct showed uniformly high level of expression in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1 C). In all cases, functional channels were produced, as determined by cAMP-induced currents in transfected cells (see below). By using co-transfection with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an indicator of transfection efficiency (32.Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 951-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we found variable levels of protein expression in different cells. This allowed us to obtain membrane patches containing from 1 to several hundred channels. Exploring first the three channels with mutations in the CN binding region (C484S, C520S, and C552S), we were surprised to find that each of these mutants produced a functional channel with single channel properties not significantly different from those of wild type rCNG2 (α) channels (Fig. 2 and TableI). At a concentration of cAMP (50 μm), which approximates the K 12 of the wild type rCNG2 (α) channel, the open probability, open and closed times, single channel conductance, and voltage dependence (data not shown) were similar in all three constructs. Although we did not test this further, cAMP binding did not appear to be affected by these single cysteine mutations.Table ISingle channel properties of wild type and mutant rCNG2 channels after activation by cAMP (50 μm)gP oτopenτclosednV mpSmsmsmVWild type43 ± 40.51 ± 0.060.51 ± 0.031.13 ± 0.086−60C484S37 ± 50.47 ± 0.040.53 ± 0.061.26 ± 0.056−60C520S41 ± 40.52 ± 0.050.47 ± 0.091.23 ± 0.115−60C552S38 ± 30.54 ± 0.030.49 ± 0.081.18 ± 0.086−60C460S42 ± 40.30 ± 0.02aSignificant difference between wild type and C460S forP o and τclosed, respectively,p < 0.05.0.56 ± 0.091.97 ± 0.04aSignificant difference between wild type and C460S forP o and τclosed, respectively,p < 0.05.6−60Values represent mean ± S.E.a Significant difference between wild type and C460S forP o and τclosed, respectively,p < 0.05.

Application of the NO donor S-nitrosocysteine (SNC) at 100 μm induced channel activity in these three mutants that was similar to that previously observed in the rCNG2 (α) wild type channel. In particular, the records were marked by the long openings characteristic of NO activation (Fig. 2). From these data, we conclude that the cysteine residues located in the CN-binding site are not involved in the activation of the channel by NO. In contrast to the results above, mutating the cysteine residue in the C-linker region (C460S) produced a channel that was completely insensitive to NO (Fig. 3). Concentrations of the NO donor SNC up to 1000 μm failed to elicit any channel activation, even after 30 min of continuous application. These single channel data could be reproduced with macroscopic current recordings in patches with hundreds of channels (data not shown). This result strongly implicated the Cys-460 as the only intracellular cysteine residue involved in the process of channel activation by NO. As a further test, we made use of the cloned Drosophila melanogaster CNG channel (kind gift of Dr. U. B. Kaupp) which is the only known CNG channel that lacks this highly conserved cysteine residue, whereas it shares a 64% overall identity to the vertebrate CNG channels and does possess the three other cysteine residues in the CN-binding site (35.Baumann A. Frings S. Godde M. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5040-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In agreement with Baumann et al. (35.Baumann A. Frings S. Godde M. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5040-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found that cGMP (50 μm) activated the cloned D. melanogaster channel expressed in HEK 293 cells. However, as we expected from our results with C460S, this channel was also found to be insensitive to NO (1–1000 μm) (Fig. 3). This observation further verified the unique involvement of this single cysteine residue in the NO activation process and confirmed the results obtained with the rat olfactory C460S mutant channel. Interestingly, activation by cAMP (50 μm), at the single channel level, also appeared to be affected by the C460S mutation. The cAMP response was still present, confirming that this mutant channel was expressed, but a significant reduction in the open probability and an increase in the closed time constant of the channel were observed compared with the wild type rCNG2 (α) channel (Table I). Meanwhile, the cAMP sensitivity was not affected. Thus, when we used membrane patches with large numbers of channels and recorded macroscopic currents in the presence of increasing concentrations of cAMP (1–1000 μm, Fig. 4), we obtained similar concentration-response curves for cAMP for the wild type rCNG2 (α) channel and for the mutant C460S channels. The best fit of the Hill equation to the data gave a K 12 (half-maximal activation) of 64 ± 4 μm cAMP, a Hill coefficient (n) value of 2.1 for the rCNG2 (α) channel, aK 12 of 55 ± 4 μm cAMP, and ann of 1.9 for the C460S mutant. These values were not significantly different, thus further confirming that this particular cysteine residue does not affect nucleotide binding but only the channel gating characteristics. As shown above, NO appears to interact with a single cysteine residue per channel subunit. A functional CNG channel is believed to be a tetramer composed of 2 or 3 different types of subunits (8.Liu D.T. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9.Liu D.T. Tibbs G.R. Paoletti P. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 235-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each of the subunits carries the conserved C-linker cysteine (Cys-460 for CNG2, Cys-350 for CNG5, and Cys-581 for the newly cloned subunit CNG4.3) providing four potential cysteine residues per channel that can undergoS-nitrosylation. This raises the question as to whether all four subunits must be nitrosylated for channel activation. Here we make use of the fact that the rCNG2 (α) subunit alone will form a functional homomeric channel of four subunits, allowing us to investigate the concentration-response relation for SNC. For these experiments, we used patches with large numbers of channels and recorded macroscopic currents. Application of SNC in 10-s pulses at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 μm induced currents of 1 pA to 1 nA (Fig. 5 A). The currents activated with a time course that was concentration-dependent (see below) and returned to base line upon removal of SNC. Concentration-response relations were obtained by normalizing the NO-activated current in each patch to the current induced by 500 μm cAMP in that patch. Each experiment was then separately fitted by the Hill equation:I/I max =c n /(c n +K 12 n). Half-maximal activation (K 12) of rCNG2 (α) occurred at 78.8 ± 13.7 μm (n = 6). Activation by NO showed a clear cooperativity with a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.4 ± 0.1 (n = 6) suggesting that the opening of a single channel depends on the cooperative binding of at least two NO molecules. The mean normalized currentsI/I max for 6 experiments are plotted in Fig. 5 B on a semi-log scale. High levels of expression resulted in patches of membrane with hundreds of channels, and this allowed us to analyze the time course of the modification of Cys-460 by NO using a rapid perfusion system. Fig.6 A shows the onset of SNC-induced response at different concentrations on such an inside-out patch. The maximal current corresponded to the simultaneous activation of ∼420 channels, as calculated from the 43-pS single channel conductance (Table I). Due to the cooperativity of the NO effect it is only possible to provide a qualitative analysis, but nonetheless the opportunity to analyze these effects through macroscopic currents provides a check on the single channel data. We focused on the rate of development of the current after a rapid change in SNC concentration (the On relaxation) and the observed rate constant of the exponential component required to describe the increase in current (the On rate). To analyze the responses shown in Fig. 6 A, the rising phase of the currents induced by the application of SNC was fit separately with exponential functions. A single exponential component was sufficient to describe the increase of the current (for example see Fig. 6 B). For SNC concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 μm, τ varied from 248 (1 μm SNC) to 38 ms (1000 μm SNC). In Fig. 6 C, the On rates (1/τ) obtained by the exponential fits were represented as a function of SNC concentration. The On rate value obtained for 1000 μm SNC was not taken into account since this measures not only reflects NO binding but was probably also influenced by the solution exchange time (∼29 ms, see “Materials and Methods”). The slope of this plot provided an estimate of the association rate constant, k on, and the intercept yielded an estimate of the dissociation rate constant,k off, according to first-order kinetics: 1/τ = k on·[SNC] +k off. We obtained a value fork on of 32·103m−1 s−1 and fork off of 3.8·s−1. This estimation of k off is very close to the value obtained by an exponential fit of the currents after the removal of SNC, 3.9 ± 0.5 s−1 (n = 6). From these two kinetic values, we could obtain another value of the affinity constantK d, as K d =k off/k on. We estimatedK d = 116 μm, a value in agreement with the one calculated at equilibrium by the Hill equation (79 μm). This concentration of SNC corresponds to a free NO concentration of about 1 μm in solution, which is close to the physiological NO concentration that has been measured in the brain (36.Malinski T. Bailey F. Zhang Z.G. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Direct modulation of function by NO has now been demonstrated in a wide array of proteins (37.Butler A.R. Flitney F.W. Williams D.L.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 38.Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and may represent an alternative pathway for protein modulation analogous to phosphorylation. In all of these cases it is generally believed that a redox like reaction proceeds at free SH groups on selected cysteine residues. However, in only a few cases have the specific cysteine residues been determined (39.Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 40.Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P.

In the present study, we have attempted to demonstrate conclusively the required involvement of a particular cysteine by utilizing olfactory CNG channels in which specific cysteine residues have been mutated to serine. The main result of our study is that a single cysteine residue within the intracellular C-linker region in the rCNG2 (α) channel subunit is shown to be the NO target site, essential and capable of fully activating the channel, even in the absence of cyclic nucleotides. Other intracellularly located cysteines appear not to participate in the NO-mediated gating of the channel. It is not uncommon for several cysteine residues on a given protein to be candidates for nitrosylation. In the ryanodine receptor, out of a total of 364 cysteines, 84 provide free SH groups, but only 12 are thought to undergo nitrosylation (27.Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Whereas the precise parameters governing accessibility by NO are unknown, the existence of a consensus nitrosylation acid-base motif has been postulated based on large data base screenings (41.Stamler J.S.

We have used two approaches to investigate whether ARF1 interacts directly with the clathrin adaptor protein, AP-1. Using an in vitrorecruitment assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we could isolate an AP-1·ARF1 complex. Then we used a site-directed photocross-linking approach to determine the components that act downstream of ARF1 in clathrin coat formation on ISGs. Myristoylated ARF1, with a photolabile phenylalanine analogue incorporated into its putative effector domain (switch 1), showed a specific, GTP-dependent interaction with both the γ- and β−adaptin subunits of AP-1 on ISGs. These experiments provide evidence for a direct interaction of ARF1 with AP-1. On mature secretory granules myristoylated ARF1 does not bind, and hence clathrin coat formation cannot be initiated, supporting the hypothesis that molecules involved in coat recruitment are removed during ISG maturation.

Ultimately, the site of coat assembly becomes a transport vesicle as the membrane is deformed by the rearrangement of the clathrin triskelion, driven by interaction with other coat constituents (for recent review see Refs. 1.Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholarand 2.Marsh M. McMahon H.T.

The mechanism underlying assembly of the clathrin coat at specific sites involves a complex set of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that is not fully understood. At all intracellular sites where clathrin assembles, the minimum machinery is the adaptor proteins (APs)1and clathrin. Four types of adaptors, AP-1 through AP-4 (1.Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2787-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have been identified to date. All adaptors are heterotetrameric complexes of two large subunits with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa, a medium subunit (∼50 kDa) and small subunit (∼20 kDa). The first identified and most studied adaptors are AP-1 and AP-2. AP-1 consists of the large subunits γ and β1, medium chain μ1, and small chain ς1 and is found primarily on the Golgi complex (5.Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 4: 919-929Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and immature secretory granules (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas AP-2, which consists of the α, β2, μ2, and ς2 subunits, is localized mainly to the plasma membrane and endosomes (7.Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The localization of AP-1 and AP-2 to different compartments can, in part, be attributed to their ability to bind to different sequences in the cytoplasmic domains of trans-membrane receptors (for recent reviews see Refs. 8.Kirchausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar and 9.Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ARF1 recruits AP-1 to both ISG membranes (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and thetrans-Golgi network (10.Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E.

ARFs are a family of small molecular mass (∼20 kDa) GTP-binding proteins that associate with lipid bilayers and membranes via a myristoylated, hydrophobic amino terminus (12.Boman A.L. Kahn R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13.Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). ARF in the GDP-bound form is cytosolic. Interaction of ARF with its exchange factor allows GDP to be exchanged for GTP, and this causes a major structural change in the switch 1 domain of ARF1 (14.Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), thus exposing the myristic acid and promoting interaction of ARF with the membrane. ARF1 has been identified as a component of Golgi-derived nonclathrin coated (COP-coated) vesicles (15.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and is required for the formation of COPI vesicles (16.Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, unlike COP-coated vesicles, ARF is not present in clathrin-coated vesicles in sufficient quantities to be a stoichiometric component of the coat, although it has been shown to recruit AP-1 in a stoichiometric manner (17.Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ARF1 in the presence of GTPγS generates high affinity binding sites for AP-1 that are stable even in the presence of high concentrations of Tris (17.Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ARF1 interacts with AP-1, we used an in vitro recruitment assay with [35S]myrARF1, followed by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against AP-1 and discovered an AP-1·ARF1 complex on ISG membranes. A second approach using site-specific cross-linking was employed to start to understand the nature of the ARF1 interaction with AP-1 on ISG membranes. Recent work using this approach has demonstrated that the switch 1 domain of ARF1 interacts directly with COPI (18.Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ARF1, with amino acid Ile-46 replaced with the photoactivatable analogue of phenylalanine ((Tmd)Phe) (19.Brunner J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 628-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), cross-linked to both β- and γ-COP (20.Zhao L. Helms B.J. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14198-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using the ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 mutant, we performed cross-linking experiments with ISGs as the acceptor compartment for ARF and AP-1. We have found that on ISG membranes ARF1 can be cross-linked to AP-1 in a GTP-dependent manner via the γ- and β1-adaptin subunits of AP-1, and this interaction is strictly dependent on the presence of ISG membranes. Mature secretory granules (MSGs) or liposomes do not facilitate a direct interaction between ARF and AP-1. Our data show that the switch 1 domain of ARF1, encompassing Ile-46, interacts with AP-1 as well as COPI. ISGs and MSGs were prepared from PC12 cells by velocity and equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation, as described previously (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Each gradient generated 3 ml of ISGs and 2 ml of MSGs, 124 of which was used per reaction. Bovine adrenal AP-1 was purified essentially as described (21.Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22.Smythe E. Carter L.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with some modifications: the precipitated coat proteins that had been stripped from the isolated clathrin coated vesicles using 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, were purified using a Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (5 × 68 cm). The adaptor-rich fractions were pooled, adjusted to a final concentration of 2 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, loaded on to an Econo-Pac® CHT-II cartridge (Bio-Rad), and eluted with a 90-ml gradient of 2–350 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% sodium azide at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The AP-1 containing fractions were dialyzed into 25 mmHepes, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgOAc, pH 7.2 (binding buffer). The AP-1 isolated was ∼80% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar).

Myristoylated ARF1 (myrARF1) was prepared as described by Francoet al. (26.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), except that a 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation was performed on the lysed cell supernatant (27.Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) after dilution of the protein concentration to 10 mg/ml. Sequential chromatography by DEAE-Sepharose, HiTrap® SP and Superdex 75 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed to obtain myrARF1 that was >95% pure and >95% myristoylated, as determined by Coomassie Blue-stained 15% SDS-PAGE gels. The binding assay was performed as described elsewhere (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125 μl of ISGs were incubated in binding buffer with purified AP-1 and recombinant myrARF1 in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTPγS in a total volume of 250 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min the samples were diluted 4-fold in binding buffer, centrifuged (100, 000g for 1 h), and analyzed by immunoblotting with subsequent incubations of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-γ-adaptin, 100/3 (Sigma), rabbit anti-mouse antiserum, and125I-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The radioactivity bound to the ISGs was quantified using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). All assays were done at least in duplicate. The human ARF1 cDNA (pET-11d vector) was in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate based Flexi-lysate kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ARF1 was labeled during the in vitro translation reaction with 1 μCi/μl [3H]myristic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) instead of [35S]methionine as described (28.Utsumi T. Kuranami J. Tou E. Ide A. Akimaru K. Hung M.C. Klostergaard J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 25 μl of ISGs were incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]ARF with 100 μm GTPγS or GDPβS in a total of 50 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. The ISGs were sedimented, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated under native conditions (see below) with either preimmune serum or the γ-adaptin antiserum, STO-25 (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, quantified using a PhosphorImager system, and then subjected to autoradiography. The cDNA encoding human ARF1, inserted into the pET-11d plasmid, with amino acid Ile-46 replaced by the amber stop codon (TAG), was obtained from Felix Wieland (Biochemie-Zentrum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) (20.Zhao L.

In vitrotranslation was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine and 5 μm ligated suppressor (Tmd)Phe tRNA at 30 °C for 2 h. The resulting [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In a total volume of 250 μl, ISGs or MSGs were incubated in binding buffer with 25 μl of in vitro translated [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 with 100 μm nucleotide (either GDPβS or GTPγS) in the presence or absence of purified AP-1 or recombinant myrARF1 as described in the figure legends, at 37 °C for 30 min, followed 4-fold dilution in binding buffer, and pelleted (100,000 g for 1 h) over a 400-μl cushion of 0.5 m sucrose in binding buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 0.15m sucrose. For the samples without membranes, a volume of 25 μl was used; these were not centrifuged but irradiated directly. Samples were irradiated as described (18.Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and then either trichloroacetic acid precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or immunoprecipitated. Antibodies used include: rabbit polyclonal antiserum anti-γ-AP, STO-25 (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal antisera against β-COP and γ-COP (a gift from F. T. Wieland); mAb anti-γ-AP, 100/3 (Sigma); mAb anti-β-AP (a gift from T. Kirchhausen, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA) (29.Clairmont K.B. Boll W. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); mAb anti-α-AP, 100/2 (Sigma); and mAb anti-ARF (a gift of R. Kahn). For immunoprecipitation under native conditions, cross-linked ISG pellets were solubilized in 250 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 (TNTE buffer). For denaturing conditions, the samples were boiled for 3 min in the presence of 1% SDS and then diluted as for the native conditions except that the Triton X-100 concentration was increased to 0.9%. Rabbit anti-mouse antiserum was added to all incubations containing mAbs. The immune complexes were bound by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing in TNTE buffer and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, samples were solubilized in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting and autoradiography. We used a method previously shown to deplete 80% of COPI from rat liver cytosol (30.Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). 110 μl of the translation mix containing in vitrotranslated [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 was placed over a 40-μl 0.5 m sucrose cushion (in binding buffer) and centrifuged at 300,000 × g using a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman) for 2 h at 4 °C. Liposomes were prepared using soyabean mixed lipids (Azolectin), containing 20%l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma P5638), according to the reverse-phase evaporation method (31.Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). The resulting liposomes were filtered through a 0.8-μm Millex®-PF filter (Millipore). 72.5 mg of liposomes were used per sample. It has previously been shown, using a cell-free assay system and partially purified components, that ARF1 is required for γ-adaptin binding to PC12 ISGs (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We have reproduced the ARF1-dependent AP-1 recruitment to ISGs using purified components (Fig. 1). Quantification relies on the use of the mAb 100/3 that recognizes bovine but not rat γ-adaptin; hence only the bound exogenous bovine γ-adaptin is detected. Both purified bovine AP-1 and purified recombinant myrARF1 were titrated into the binding assay (Fig. 1 A). We used bovine AP-1 because we could obtain large amounts of tissue for the purification. Our previous experiments have shown that bovine AP-1 binds to ISGs as efficiently as rat AP-1 (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human, bovine, and mouse ARF1 are 99% identical; thus it was assumed that the human ARF1 would bind as efficiently to rat ISGs as the endogenous rat ARF1. Increasing the myrARF1 concentration up to 20 μg/ml resulted in an increase in the γ-adaptin bound to the ISGs at all concentrations of AP-1 used except 1 μg/ml. At 1 μg/ml AP-1, the γ-adaptin binding was saturated at 4 μg/ml myrARF1, this may be due to limiting amounts of AP-1. In the absence of added ARF1 there is a basal level of γ-adaptin binding (Fig. 1 B); this is likely to be due to endogenous ARF1 already bound to the ISGs and is similar to the level observed in the presence of ARF1 but in the absence of any nucleotide. The addition of GTPγS increases γ-adaptin binding to ISGs 3–4-fold but only in the presence of ARF1 (Fig. 1 B). We did not observe GTP-dependent binding of nonmyristoylated ARF1 to the membranes (results not shown). Hence, the only cytosolic component required for purified AP-1 to bind to the ISGs is GTP-bound myrARF1. To monitor ARF1 binding to the ISGs, we wanted to generate [35S]myrARF1 by in vitro translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. To demonstrate that the ARF1 was myristoylated during the translation reaction, ARF1 mRNA wasin vitro translated in the presence of [3H]myristic acid. This resulted in a3H-labeled ∼20-kDa band whose migration was identical to purified recombinant myrARF1 (Fig.2 A, lane 1). Others have also observed N-myristoyltransferase activity (28.Utsumi T.

Biophys. 1998; 349: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In vitrotranslation of ARF1 mRNA in the presence of [35S]methionine resulted in a broader ∼20-kDa band (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) that, after a lower exposure time, is visible as a doublet (not shown) corresponding to myristoylated and nonmyristoylated [35S]ARF1. These results confirm that ARF1 is myristoylated during the in vitro translation reaction. To determine whether AP-1 and ARF1 form a complex, ISG binding assays were performed in the presence of [35S]ARF1. After incubation of [35S]ARF1 with the ISGs in the presence of GTPγS or GDPγS, immunoprecipitation of γ-AP was performed with polyclonal, STO-25 to determine whether the [35S]myrARF1 was interacting with AP-1 (Fig. 2, B and C). The myristoylated form of [35S]ARF1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with AP-1 in the presence of GTPγS (Fig.2 B). The amount of [35S]myrARF1 co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of GTPγS was twice that in the presence of GDPβS and 4-fold more than preimmune controls. Approximately 1% of the total membrane bound [35S]myrARF1 added to the assay could be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-γ−AP antibodies. These results demonstrate that AP-1 and myrARF1 do form a complex on the ISG membrane. To investigate whether ARF1 interacts directly with AP-1, we decided to use site-directed photocross-linking, as used previously by others to demonstrate a direct interaction of the nonclathrin coat, COPI and ARF1 (18.Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Full-length photoactivatable [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 was generated by mutating the codon for Ile-46, in the human ARF1 cDNA, to amber, followed by in vitro translation (of the corresponding mRNA) in the presence of a suppressor tRNA ligated to the photolabile group, (Tmd)Phe, which recognizes this stop codon (18.Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 was then incubated with ISGs with or without AP-1 in the presence of GTPγS. The GTPγS-dependent binding of [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 to the ISG membranes (Fig.3 A, lower panel, compare lane 1 versus lane 3 and lane 5 versus lane 7) excludes the possibility that replacement of Ile-46 with the (Tmd)Phe severely alters the GTP-dependent ARF binding to ISGs. The migration of the [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 bound to the ISG membranes is identical to the migration of myrARF1. Irradiation resulted in at least three cross-linked products with estimated molecular masses of 120–140 kDa (region marked X, Fig. 3 A, upper panel,lanes 3 and 7). Addition of AP-1 appeared to increase the intensity of the 120-kDa bands (Fig. 3 A,lane 7). This was consistent with cross-linking of ARF (∼20 kDa) to one or both of the large subunits of AP-1 (∼100 kDa). The photocross-linked products are specific because they were not observed in the presence of GDPβS (Fig. 3 A, upper panel,lanes 1 and 5), or in the absence of irradiation (Fig. 3 A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 6). Displacement of the membrane-bound [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 using excess unlabeled recombinant wild type myrARF1 (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, lanes 4 and 8) abolished the photocross-linking (Fig. 3 A, upper panel, lanes 4and 8). Importantly, the cross-linked products were not observed in the absence of ISG membranes either in the presence or absence of added AP-1 (Fig. 3 A, upper panel,lanes 9 and 10), demonstrating that only membrane-bound myrARF1 interacts with the 100–120-kDa proteins and that ARF1·AP-1 does not interact in solution. Immunoprecipitation of the specific cross-linked products confirmed an interaction of myrARF1 with AP-1. Immunoprecipitation of the whole AP-1 complex with the γ-AP polyclonal, STO-25 (6.Dittié A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) under native conditions resulted in a 35S-labeled doublet (Fig. 3 B,lane 3), whereas immunoprecipitation of the dissociated subunits under denaturing conditions showed a single band of lower intensity corresponding to γ-AP (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4). Because the pattern of cross-linked products derived from [35S]ARF-(Tmd)Phe-46 bound to ISGs were similar to that observed with Golgi membranes in the presence of coatomer (20.Zhao L. Helms B.J. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14198-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), antisera to β- and γ-COP were used to characterize the other cross-linked products observed with the ISG membranes. Similar to the result obtained for Golgi membranes (20.Zhao L. Helms B.J. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14198-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), anti-β-COP immunoprecipitated a band of 120 kDa (Fig. 3 B, lane 5), and the anti-γ-COP immunoprecipitated two bands of approximately 120 and 140 kDa (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). To increase the efficiency of cross-linking of [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 to AP-1 on the ISGs, purified bovine AP-1 was titrated into the photocross-linking binding assay (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1–3). The cross-linking pattern showed an increase in the intensity of the labeled 120-kDa bands with increasing AP-1 (Fig.4 A, top panel, lanes 1–3). Immunoprecipitation of the whole AP-1 complex with 100/3 confirmed an increase in the efficiency of cross-linking of [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 to AP-1 (Fig. 4 A, middle panel, lanes 1–3). Increasing the [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 caused a further increase in the intensity of the cross-linked products (Fig.4 A, top panel, lanes 6 and7), which is due to increased cross-linking to AP-1 (Fig.4 A, middle panel, lanes 6 and7). Because the mAb 100/3 only recognizes bovine and not rat AP-1, it was surprising that, in the absence of exogenous bovine AP-1, 100/3 could immunoprecipitate a cross-linked product (Fig.4 A, middle panel, lane 1). This suggested that there might be AP-1 in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate used to generate the [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46. Western blot analysis demonstrated that indeed this was the case (data not shown). Using purified bovine AP-1 as a standard and assuming equal cross-reactivity of 100/3 with rabbit AP-1 it was estimated that the rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains ∼16 μg/ml AP-1, giving a final concentration of ∼1 μg/ml rabbit AP-1 in the binding assay. AP-2 and COPI were also detected in the lysate using polyclonal anti-β-COP and anti-γ-COP and may explain the source of β- and γ-COP cross-linked to ARF1 on the ISG membranes. Thus, the rabbit reticulocyte lysate acts like a cytosol, providing the adaptor proteins and coatomer for recruitment to ISGs. Increasing the amount of [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 resulted in an increased binding (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel, lanes 4–7), whereas increasing AP-1 had no effect on the amount of [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 bound to the membrane (Fig.4 A, bottom panel, lanes 1–3). This suggests that AP-1 does not influence [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 binding to the membrane. These results confirm a direct interaction of [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 with both exogenous rabbit and bovine AP-1 on ISG membranes. Immunoprecipitation with STO-25 under native and denaturing conditions (Fig. 3 B, lane 3 and 4) implied that both γ- and β1-AP may interact with ARF. The photocross-linking assay in the absence of added bovine AP-1 contains endogenous rat AP-1 from the PC12 ISGs and exogenous rabbit AP-1 from the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Anti-γ-AP antiserum, STO-25 recognizes rat and, to a lesser extent, rabbit γ-AP, whereas anti-γ-AP antibody 100/3 recognizes rabbit and not rat γ-AP. Quantative immunoprecipitation with STO-25 (Fig.4 B, lane 3) and 100/3 (Fig. 4 C,lanes 3 and 5) under denaturing conditions demonstrate that both rat and rabbit γ-AP directly bind to [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46. Immunoprecipitation of the whole AP-1 complex with the same antisera under native conditions revealed bands of greater intensity than that immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions, again suggesting cross-linking of [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 to both β1- and γ-AP. This was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the dissociated AP-1 subunits with the anti-β-AP (Fig. 4, C, lane 6 andD, lanes 3 and 5). Because the anti-β-AP antibody also recognizes both β1- and β2-AP, we cannot rule out from these immunoprecipitations that β2-AP also cross-links with myrARF1. However, [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 does not interact with α-AP of AP-2 because no products were immunoprecipitated with anti-α-AP under native or denaturing conditions (data not shown); therefore, it is unlikely that [35S]ARF1-(Tmd)Phe-46 interacts with β2-AP. Although ARF1 has been shown to recruit AP-2 to endosomal membranes in a GTPγS-dependent manner (34.West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we failed to detect a GTP-dependent association of AP-2 to ISGs, 2C. Austin, unpublished observations. consistent with the cross-linking data. To make the cross-linking assay dependent on exogenous AP-1, we removed the high molecular mass coat proteins in the rabbit reticulocy"

These results indicate Cox18p to be a new member of a group of mitochondrial proteins that function at a late stage of the cytochrome oxidase assembly pathway. nuclear respiratory-deficient mutant of yeast kilobase(s) Cytochrome oxidase, the terminal enzyme complex of the respiratory chain, is a hetero-oligomeric lipoprotein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane (1.Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2.Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaethe three major subunits of cytochrome oxidase are encoded in mitochondrial DNA. They form the catalytic core of the enzyme, bearing the copper and heme A prosthetic groups. The other subunits are products of nuclear genes that are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported into mitochondria. Active preparations of the purified enzyme contain 11 polypeptides (3.Taanman J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22481-22485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, many nuclear genes, other than those coding for the structural subunits, are also essential for cytochrome oxidase synthesis (4.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these genes have been implicated in processing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase transcripts (5.Pel H.J. Tzagoloff A. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in translation of mature mRNAs (6.Fox T.D. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), in heme A synthesis (7.Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M.P. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar), and in maturation of subunit 2 (8.Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another group of genes affects assembly of the enzyme, but the precise functions of these genes in this process still need to be clarified (9.Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10.McEwen J.E. Hong K.H. Park S. Preciado G.T. Curr.

Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants have been ascertained to have mutations in a nuclear gene that has been named COX18. This gene corresponds to reading frame YGR062C on chromosome VII.COX18 codes for a mitochondrial membrane protein of 316 amino acid residues that is essential for the assembly of functional cytochrome oxidase. Mutations in COX18 result in a marked decrease of subunit 2 of the enzyme. This phenotype is not due to a block in transcription/translation of the mRNA or to a defect in export/processing of the subunit 2 precursor. Rather, Cox18p appears to be a new member of the class of mitochondrial proteins that chaperone late events in assembly of the complex. The strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study are listed in TableI. Strain NSG1 (MATα, cox18::URA3, ade2–101, ura3–52, pet111–11, [ρ− pJM30]) was constructed by transforming strain JJM190 (12.Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to Ura+ with linearized pG34/ST12 containing the disrupted copy of COX18(cox18::URA3). The presence of pJM30 as a ρ− mtDNA was confirmed by the ability of NSG1 to produce respiring diploids when mated with a pet111,ρ+ strain. W303ΔPET309 was constructed by transforming the wild-type haploid strain W303–1B with a linear fragment of DNA containing the pet309::HIS3 allele in which 1.14 kb of the coding region defined by the two BamHI sites in the gene were replaced with a 1-kb BamHI fragment with the yeast HIS3 gene. 2A.

Open table in a new tab Wild-type and mutant yeast were grown to stationary phase in YPGal medium (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone), and mitochondria were prepared by the procedure of Faye et al. (13.Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except that Glusulase was replaced by zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with 35S in the presence of cycloheximide (14.Douglas M. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1083-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and total cell proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cytochrome spectra of mitochondrial extracts were obtained at room temperature. Cytochrome oxidase activity was measured as described previously (15.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 826-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COX18 was cloned by complementation of the G34 mutant E2–27/L1 with a yeast genomic library using the transformation method of Schiestl and Gietz (16.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). This mutant and others from the same complementation group were derived from strain D273–10B/A1 by mutagenesis (4.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The a mating type derivatives with appropriate auxotrophic markers were obtained after sporulation of diploid cells formed by crosses of mutants to CB11 (11.Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and W303–1B. The library used for the transformation was constructed from partial Sau3A1 fragments of nuclear DNA (averaging 7–10 kb) cloned into the BamHI site of the shuttle vector YEp13 (17.Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). This library was kindly provided by Dr. Kim Nasmyth. To create a gene expressing Cox18p with a biotinylation site at its carboxyl terminus (18.Murtif V.L. Bahler C.R. Samols D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the BamHI site located at the end of the bacterial transcarboxylase gene in pBIO-1 (YEp352 with a 0.28-kb BamHI fragment coding for the biotinylation peptide of transcarboxylase) was destroyed by partial digestion and ligation. The proper construct bearing a single BamHI site was selected, and the vector was digested with BamHI and PstI. To amplify theCOX18 gene we used a 25-nucleotide-long primer (position −254) introducing a PstI site (5′-GCAGTCAACTGCAGTAAAACCTTCC-3′) and a 24-nucleotide-long primer (position +960) including a BamHI site (5′-CAGCTTGGATCCTCGTTGGTAAGG-3′). Ligation of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified gene to the linear plasmid resulted in removal of the termination codon of COX18 and an in-frame fusion of its 3′ end to the bacterial sequence. This construct (pBIO-1/COX18) was used to isolate theCOX18-BIO gene fusion as a 1.2-kbSphI-SmaI fragment, which was ligated to the multicopy shuttle vector YEp351 and the integrative vector YIp351 (19.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). To integrate COX18-BIO into chromosomal DNA, the respiratory-competent strain W303–1B and the null mutant W303ΔCOX18 were transformed with the above plasmid linearized at theAflI site internal to the LEU2 gene in YIp351. Mitochondria were prepared from transformants expressing the fusion gene either on a multicopy plasmid (W303ΔDCOX18-BIO/ST7) or integrated in a single copy in chromosomal DNA (W303ΔDCOX18-BIO/Int). The mitochondria were extracted in the presence of 0.1 msodium carbonate (20.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) to solubilize peripheral membrane proteins or with 1% deoxycholate and 0.5 m NaCl (21.Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to solubilize most integral membrane proteins. Total RNA was isolated from log phase cells grown in YPD medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone) as described (22.Rose M.D. Winston F.D. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 140-147Google Scholar). 4.5 μg of total RNA were denatured in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 16% formaldehyde, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing the same buffer, and blotted to nitrocellulose. The filter was hybridized with a radioactively labeled probe generated by random priming of the 465-base pair RsaI fragment ofCOX2. For normalization, the filters were rehybridized with a radiolabeled probe specific for the 15 S rRNA of mitochondria (23.Shen Z.H. Fox T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4535-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).COX2 and 15 S rRNA levels were quantitated using a Betascope 603 analyzer (Betagen Corp.). Standard methods were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The preparation of yeast nuclear DNA and the conditions for Southern hybridizations were as described by Myers et al. (25.Myers A.M. Pape L. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) except that probes were labeled by random priming (26.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (27.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 449-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and remaining gaps were closed by using the Sanger manual chain termination procedure (28.Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the buffer system of Laemmli (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of proteins on Western blot was carried out with 125I-protein A (30.Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (31.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation group G34 of thepet mutant collection used to screen for cytochrome oxidase mutants consists of 13 independent isolates (4.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants are unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol and ethanol. The mutants are complemented by ρ o mutants, indicating that the respiratory defect is caused by recessive mutations in a nuclear gene. Mitochondria of cox18 mutants lack cytochromesa and a 3 but have the absorption bands corresponding to cytochromes b, c, andc 1 (Fig.1 A). This type of spectrum is characteristic of mutants specifically defective in cytochrome oxidase. Enzymatic assays of the respiratory chain complex showed the mutant mitochondria to be deficient in cytochrome oxidase but not in NADH-cytochrome c reductase or ATPase (data not shown). Western blot analysis of cytochrome oxidase constituents with a polyclonal antibody against the holoenzyme and antibodies against individual subunits indicated that the cox18 mutant has severely reduced concentrations of subunit 2 but retains significant levels of the nuclear encoded subunits (subunits 4–9) (Fig.1 B). The antibody used for the immunoblot does not detect subunits 1 and 3 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and4). In vivo labeling of the mitochondrially encoded subunits in the presence of cycloheximide to block cytoplasmic protein synthesis indicated markedly lowered incorporation of the radioactive precursor into subunit 2. A faint band corresponding to subunit 2, however, was detected at the position of the mature protein, indicating correct processing and membrane insertion of this constituent. Labeling of subunits 1 and 3 in the mutant under these conditions was similar to the wild-type strain (Fig. 1 C). Because the COX18 function seemed to be required primarily for the synthesis or stability of subunit 2, the concentration of the mitochondrial COX2 mRNA was compared in the wild type and the mutant. The steady-state level of COX18 mRNA in the cox18 mutant normalized to mitochondrial 15 S rRNA was approximately 93% that of the wild-type strain (Fig.2). An alternative explanation for the large reduction of subunit 2 incox18 mutants despite normal levels of the COX2mRNA is that Cox18p might function as a translational activator similar to PET111 (32.Poutre C.G. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1987; 115: 637-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether cox18mutations block the same step in COX2 gene expression as thepet111 mutations, we asked whether a pJM30 ρ−genome (12.Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coding for a chimeric COX3-COX2 mRNA could suppress the cox18::URA3 allele when present heteroplasmically with wild-type ρ+ mtDNA. This chimeric mRNA with the COX3 5′-untranslated leader fused to theCOX2 structural gene is translated in the absence of the translational activator protein coded by PET111, allowing expression of subunit 2 (32.Poutre C.G. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1987; 115: 637-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cox18 deletion strain NSG1 carrying the pJM30 ρ− mtDNA was constructed (see “Materials and Methods”) and mated to thecox18::URA3, ρ+ strains W303ΔDCOX18 and C34/LU1 to generate homozygous cox18mutants heteroplasmic for ρ+ and pJM30 mtDNAs. In both cases, the diploid cells failed to grow on non-fermentable medium, demonstrating that the cox18 defect could not be bypassed by replacement of the normal COX2 mRNA 5′-untranslated leader. Thus COX18 appears to function downstream of translation in the expression, assembly, or stability ofCOX2. Subunit 2 of yeast cytochrome oxidase is synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes as a precursor with a hydrophobic amino-terminal extension of 15 residues. Insertion of the precursor into the inner membrane with concomitant export of the amino terminus to the intermembrane space has been shown to depend on an inner membrane protein encoded byOXA1 (33.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34.He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 35.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Following its export, the precursor is cleaved to its mature size by the Imp1p/Imp2p protease located in the intermembrane space (8.Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutations preventing either the export or processing step lead to an increased turnover of the subunit 2 precursor. The low level of subunit 2 detected in cells pulse-labeled in the presence of cycloheximide had a size identical to the mature protein (Fig. 1 C), indicating that neither export nor processing of the precursor is likely to be compromised in thecox18 strain. The observed reduction in subunit 2 must therefore be due either to a lowered efficiency of translation of the mRNA independent of the 5′-untranslated leader or to an extreme instability of the protein after its export and processing. The wild-typeCOX18 gene was cloned by transformation of the G34 mutant E2–27/L1 with a yeast genomic library constructed in the shuttle plasmid YEp13 (17.Broach J.R. Strathern J.N. Hicks J.B. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A Leu+ respiratory-competent clone obtained from the transformation was used to isolate a plasmid (pG34/T1) with a nuclear DNA insert of 6 kb. The nuclear DNA insert in pG34/T1 was mapped by restriction analysis, and a number of subclones (Fig. 3) were constructed by ligation of restriction endonuclease fragments to YEp351 (19.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The ability of the subclone pG34/ST1 to complement the mutant localized the gene to a region that includes two reading frames, one coding for a 316-amino acid product and the other encompassing most of the coding region ofADE6 (36.Andreichuk Y.V. Domkin V.D. Ryzhova T.A. Koulikov V.N. Kostikova T.R. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1997; 62: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). ADE6 was excluded as the active gene by the fact that introduction of a frameshift mutation at a uniqueBglII site in the gene did not affect conferral of respiration by pG34/ST1. Complementation of the G34 mutant pG34/ST7 containing only reading frame YGR062C located between coordinates 616,322 and 617,272 on chromosome VII confirmed this to be the correct gene. This gene was named COX18 in keeping with our previous nomenclature to designate genes required for expression of yeast cytochrome oxidase (4.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two constructs were made to inactivate COX18 in situ (37.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). In one case the 400-bpNcoI fragment internal to COX18 was deleted and replaced with the yeast URA3 gene. The disrupted allele was isolated on a linear fragment and used to transform the respiratory-competent haploid strain W303–1B and the diploid strain W303d. Four respiratory-deficient and uracil-prototrophic clones (one haploid and three diploid) obtained from the transformation were verified by genomic Southern analysis to have acquired the disruptedcox18::URA3 allele (Fig.4). A second disruption, created by insertion of the URA3 gene at the HindIII site, also exhibited a respiratory-deficient phenotype. The loss of respiration in the mutant harboring the disruption at theHindIII site is at variance with the observation that pG34/ST1 lacking the sequence upstream of this site is able to complement the mutant. Because the pG34/ST1 is a multicopy plasmid, it is possible that a partial loss of function as a result of the amino-terminal truncation is compensated by overexpression of the protein. There are known instances of proteins whose mitochondrial targeting sequences have been removed but, when expressed from a multicopy plasmid, are able to enter the correct mitochondrial compartment (38.Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 3R. L. Souza, N. S. Green-Willms, T. D. Fox, A. Tzagoloff, and F. G. Nobrega, unpublished observations. It is also not uncommon for yeast genes to be expressed from plasmid sequences that can act as surrogate promoters (unpublished observations). This explanation is supported by the properties of the mutant transformed with pG34/ST1 that grows at a noticeably slower rate than the transformant harboring pG34/ST7 with the complete COX18gene. The viability of the disrupted haploid strain indicates thatCOX18 is not an essential gene. Several lines of evidence indicate that G34 mutants have mutations in COX18. For example, the respiratory-deficient phenotype of both disruption constructs was complemented by ρo tester strains but not by mutants of group G34. Furthermore, disruption of theCOX18 gene produces a cytochrome oxidase deficiency similar to that of the point mutants. To study the localization of Cox18p, COX18 was fused in-frame to a sequence coding for the biotinylation signal of a bacterial transcarboxylase (39.Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion gene (COX18-BIO) was expected to express a hybrid protein consisting of native Cox18p with a carboxyl-terminal extension of 78 residues containing covalently attached biotin. Transformation of the W303ΔDCOX18 disruption mutant with the fusion gene in the high copy plasmid YEp351 conferred wild-type growth on the non-fermentable substrate glycerol. Integration of the COX18-BIO construct as a single copy gene into chromosomal DNA also restored respiration in the mutant. Western blot analysis using peroxidase-conjugated avidin to detect biotinylated proteins revealed an abundant novel protein of approximately 39 kDa in the mitochondria of the transformants. The properties of the biotinylated Cox18p are consistent with a membrane localization of the protein. Following disruption of mitochondria by sonic irradiation, most of biotinylated Cox18p cofractionates with the submitochondrial membranes. Washing the membrane particles with alkaline sodium carbonate or extraction with 1 m KCl and 0.5% deoxycholate also failed to remove the polypeptide from the membrane fraction (Fig. 5). The polypeptide encoded byCOX18 consists of 316 amino acids with an amino-terminal region displaying characteristic features of a mitochondrial targeting sequence; its first 42 residues include 10 hydroxylated amino acids and 8 basic residues (Fig. 6). The algorithm of Claros and Vincens (40.Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) predicts a 0.96 probability of mitochondrial targeting for this sequence and a putative signal sequence length of 43 amino acids. The calculated molecular weight of the primary translation product is 35,675 with a pI of 11.3. Four potential transmembrane segments to anchor the polypeptide to the membrane bilayer are predicted by the PHDhtm program (41.Burkhard R. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533PubMed Google Scholar). These hydrophobic sequences could account for the tight interaction of the protein with the mitochondrial membrane. The only other protein with high sequence similarity (47% identity) to Cox18p found in the current protein data bases is the product of the homologous Kluyveromyces lactis geneKlCOX18 (Fig. 6) described by Hikkel et al. (42.Hikkel I. Gbelska Y. van der Aart Q.J. Lubecu G. Subik J. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This gene is capable of complementing yeast cox18 mutants, confirming the functional equivalence of the K. lactis andS. cerevisiae proteins (42.Hikkel I. Gbelska Y. van der Aart Q.J. Lubecu G. Subik J. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect the mRNA of COX18 using labeled probes and total yeast RNA. This could be explained in part by the low codon bias (−0.033) and codon adaptation index (0.070) of the coding region as suggested by others (43.Sharp P.M. Li W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). The COX18 mRNA was detected by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (results not shown). Its abundance did not change when cells were grown on 8% glucose (catabolite-repressed conditions) or 3% glycerol (derepressed). This result agrees with the data obtained by DeRisiet al. (44.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar) on the expression of yeast genes analyzed by a DNA microchip array. In conclusion, our results show that COX18 codes for an integral mitochondrial membrane protein that is essential for expression of cytochrome oxidase. Low steady-state concentrations of subunit 2 have been reported in other studies to be characteristic of mutants impaired in assembly of cytochrome oxidase (35.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 45.Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Our results also rule out interaction of Cox18p with the 5′-untranslated leader of the mRNA-like Pet111p. Cox18p, therefore, must function at a step following transcription/translation of theCOX2 mRNA. The trace amounts of subunit 2 detected incox18 mutants migrate as the mature subunit, suggesting that Cox18p acts subsequent to export and proteolytic processing of the precursor (8.Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that Cox18p is another member of a group of mitochondrial proteins that play important roles at late stages of the assembly pathway of cytochrome oxidase, perhaps by helping in proper folding/assembly of the subunits. The almost complete absence of subunit 2 in cox18 mutants is therefore most probably a consequence of an increased turnover of the protein by mitochondrial quality control proteases that are known to target unassembled subunits in such mutants (46.Arit H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 47.Guelin E. Rep M. Grivell L.A.

G protein-coupled receptor GTPase activating protein regulator of G protein signaling Initiation of signal transduction cascades involving heterotrimeric G proteins requires that the binding of an agonist ligand to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 results in the stabilization of conformations of the GPCR which increase the rate of dissociation of bound GDP from the nucleotide binding pocket of the α subunit of a cognate G protein. Binding of GTP is thus allowed. With GTP bound the G protein produces a series of activating conformational changes and can thence regulate, directly or otherwise, the activity of several enzymes which generate intracellular second messengers or the probability of opening of a range of ion channels (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 614-649Crossref Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). Effector regulation is terminated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G protein α subunit. Although this cycle of events is clear (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 614-649Crossref Scopus (4682) Google Scholar), it is only in recent years that explanations for the measured discrepancy in GTPase activity rates of heterotrimeric G proteins, which appeared too slow to account for biochemically and electrophysiologically measured functional end points, have begun to become apparent. A number of effector enzymes have been shown to display GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity toward their partner G proteins (2Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Chidiac P. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 6Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) has indicated this to be the key state for these interactions.Many initial studies on the interactions of G proteins and RGS family members simply used “single turnover” studies to confirm RGS function (15Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 17Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Perlata E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Such studies involve the co-addition of a recombinant RGS and a G protein which has been preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP under ionic conditions which limit nucleotide hydrolysis. Release of this constraint allows measurement of accelerated GTP hydrolysis in the presence of an active RGS. Although highly useful, only a limited amount of kinetic information can be derived from such studies, and steady-state GTPase activity and its regulation by the presence of GPCRs and appropriate agonist ligands can provide more detailed information (4Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, to date, such studies have been restricted to the reconstitution of GPCR (e.g. the M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors), G protein, and RGS into phospholipid vesicles and have not been performed in native membrane systems under conditions capable of monitoring GTPase turnover number.We have recently generated a series of fusion proteins between the α2A-adrenoreceptor and the α subunits of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins by the simple expedient of fusing the N terminus of the open reading frame of the G protein cDNA in-frame with C-terminal end of the GPCR cDNA from which the stop codon was removed (19Wise A.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These fusion proteins have a number of distinct properties ideal for quantitative functional analysis (see Refs. 24Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and25Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar for reviews). First, they ensure a 1:1 stoichiometry of expression of GPCR and G protein. This ratio establishes the validity of saturation ligand binding studies using [3H]antagonist as a direct measurement of the level of expression of the G protein as well as the GPCR, which is difficult to achieve with independently co-expressed GPCRs and G proteins. Second, the fusion protein strategy ensures equivalent proximity of the GPCR to each G protein linked to it. Most importantly, the fusion proteins function as agonist-activated GTPases. Addition of agonist to membranes expressing such a fusion protein results in stimulation of GTPase activity (20Wise A. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Wise A. Carr I.C. Groarke D.A. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the two elements of such fusion proteins inherently cannot fully physically separate upon agonist stimulation, a considerable range of studies have recently questioned the previous assumption that such separation does indeed occur (Ref. 26Lachance M. Ethier N. Wolbring G. Schnetkamp P.P. Hebert T.E. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, see Ref. 27Chidiac P. Biochem.

Furthermore, a role for RGS proteins in the stabilization of GPCR-G protein interactions has also been suggested (4Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Many studies with closely related, isolated, G proteins have suggested that the effects of RGS proteins are generally nonselective. However, very recent work has indicated that the N-terminal region of RGS4 allows GPCR-selective regulation of signaling complexes which involve Gq (28Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S.

In the current study we now demonstrate selective regulation by RGS4 of Gi family G proteins coupled to the same GPCR and that the effect of RGS4 includes both concentration dependent increase in rate of agonist-stimulated hydrolysis of GTP and an increase in Km for this nucleotide.RESULTSA fusion protein was constructed between the porcine α2A-adrenoreceptor from which the stop codon had been removed and a variant of Gαo1 in which Cys351, the site for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, was converted to Val. This resulted in production of a single open reading frame in which the N terminus of the G protein was attached in-frame with the C terminus of the GPCR. This construct was expressed transiently in COS-7 cells and following extensive treatment with pertussis toxin (25 ng/ml, 24 h) membranes were prepared. Addition of a maximally effective concentration of the α2-adrenoreceptor agonist UK14304 (100 μm) caused a substantial increase in high affinity GTPase activity measured using 0.5 μm GTP as substrate. Parallel specific ligand binding studies were performed in these membranes with the α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist [3H]RS-79948-197 (19Wise A. Milligan G. J. Biol.

As the fusion protein strategy defines a 1:1 ratio of expression of the α2-adrenoreceptor and G protein, the stimulation of the GTPase activity by UK14304 at this concentration of GTP was calculated to be 2.8 ± 0.4 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/mol of fusion protein−1 min−1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 6). When equivalent studies were performed using a fusion protein between the α2A-adrenoreceptor and Val351-Gαi1, UK14304 (100 μm) stimulation of the high affinity GTPase of this fusion protein was substantially greater at 8.5 ± 0.3 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/mol of fusion protein−1 min−1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 3). (Fig. 1). Addition of purified, recombinant RGS4 (33Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12851-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (30 nm) to membranes expressing the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351-Gαo1fusion protein did not significantly alter basal high affinity GTPase activity but produced a strong enhancement (p < 0.005) of UK14304 stimulated activity (Fig. 1), increasing the effect of agonist to 10.0 ± 0.2 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/mol of fusion protein−1 min−1. In contrast to this effect of RGS4, addition of the recombinant protein to membranes expressing the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351-Gαi1fusion protein produced neither an alteration in basal GTPase activity nor a significant enhancement (p = 0.42) of the stimulation of GTPase activity produced by UK14304 (9.1 ± 0.3 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/mol of fusion protein−1min−1) (Fig. 1).Addition of varying amounts of recombinant RGS4 to membranes expressing the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351-Gαo1fusion protein resulted in a concentration-dependent enhancement of the effect of UK14304 with an EC50 for RGS4 of 30 ± 3 nm (Fig.2). This effect of RGS4 was likely to be dependent on specific, high affinity G protein binding since addition of equivalent amounts of an Asn88-Ser RGS4 mutant was unable to enhance the stimulation of GTPase produced by UK14304 (Fig.2). This mutation produces an RGS4 protein which is unable to bind effectively to any form of Gαi1 (33Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although RGS4 enhanced the effect of UK14304 on maximal stimulation of the GTPase activity of membranes expressing the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351-Gαo1fusion protein, it also increased the EC50 for the agonist by some 3-fold. In the absence of RGS4 this was 31 ± 5 nm while in the presence of added RGS4 it was 113 ± 23 nm (Fig. 3).Figure 2Wild type RGS4 but not Asn88-Ser RGS4 promotes UK14034 stimulation of α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351Gαolhigh affinity GTPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner.

Basal and regulated GTPase activity in membranes expressing this fusion protein were measured at a wide range of concentrations of GTP to explore the kinetic basis of RGS4 action (Fig.4). Analysis of this data by extrapolation to V max demonstrated that UK14304 increased the basal GTPase rate, as previously demonstrated for a number of other GPCR-G protein fusion proteins (20Wise A.

Addition of RGS4 (100 nm) along with UK14304 substantially further increased the V max of the system. Now, however, a marked increase (from 0.21 ± 0.03 μm in the absence of RGS4 to 1.26 ± 0.16 μm in the presence of 100 μm RGS4, mean ± S.E., n = 5, p = < 0.001) in the estimated Km for GTP was also observed (Fig.4). With knowledge of the levels of expression of the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351-Gαo1fusion protein from [3H]RS-79948-197 binding studies, UK14304-stimulated GTPase turnover number atV max was calculated to increase from 6.3 ± 1.4 min−1 to 81.7 ± 16.0 min−1 with addition of 100 nm RGS4 (mean ± S.E.,n = 5, p = 0.002) (TableI).Figure 4RGS4 enhancesV max and Km of UK14304 stimulated α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351-Gαolfusion protein GTPase activity.

Following transient expression in pertussis toxin-treated COS-7 cells, UK14304 (100 μm) stimulation of the GTPase activity of α2A-adrenoreceptor-Ile351-Gαi2at 0.5 μm GTP (2.7 ± 0.5 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/mol of fusion protein−1 min−1) was further enhanced by addition of recombinant RGS4 (30 nm) to the membranes (6.3 ± 0.9 mol of GTP hydrolyzed mol of fusion protein−1 min−1, mean ± S.E.,n = 4) (Fig. 6). By contrast, although the GTPase activity of membranes expressing the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Ile351-Gαi3fusion protein was effectively stimulated by UK14304 (5.6 ± 0.9 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/mol of fusion protein−1min−1), no further significant enhancement (p = 0.6) of the agonist effect was produced by addition of RGS4 (7.0 ± 0.6 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/mol of fusion protein−1 min−1, mean ± S.E.,n = 3) (Fig. 6). As with the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Val351-Gαo1fusion protein, the effects of RGS4 on the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Ile351-Gαi2was to increase both GTP turnover number and the Kmfor GTP (Fig. 7, Table I). In the absence of RGS4, the UK14304 stimulated GTP turnover number was 4.4 ± 0.3 min−1 and this was increased to 23.8 ± 3.0 min−1 with addition of 100 nm RGS4 (mean ± S.E., n = 5, p = 0.001).Figure 6Recombinant RGS4 enhances agonist stimulation of the GTPase activity of α2A-adrenoreceptor-Ile351-Gαi2α but not α2A-adrenoreceptor-Ile351-Gαi3.α2A-Adrenoreceptor- Ile351-Gαi2(a2AGi2 C351I) or α2A-adrenoreceptor-Ile351-Gαi3(a2AGi3 C351I) fusion proteins were expressed transiently in COS-7 cells.

Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 6Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) suggests that they are likely to display marked selectivity of expression patterns and/or function. Striking variation in their distribution patterns in the central nervous system has been observed (38Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlmanm H.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, early studies of purified G proteins and RGS proteins indicated little selectivity in the capacity of individual RGS proteins to regulate the GTPase activity of individual members of the Gi and Gq family G proteins. However, emerging data suggest inherent selectivity of RGS proteins toward G proteins may indeed exist in their native environment. For example, a recent study examining the ability of a range of GPCRs to regulate Ca2+ signaling via Gq family G proteins in pancreatic acinar cells showed both marked variation in potency of individual RGS proteins to regulate function via a single GPCR and of the same RGS to regulate the signaling output from multiple, related, GPCRs (29Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although the basis of the interactions between the highly conserved core domain of RGS proteins with Gαi1 has been elucidated at atomic level (16Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), recent studies have indicated that the N-terminal region of RGS4 might confer selectivity toward particular GPCR-G protein tandems (28Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Such studies thus provide a conceptual basis to further explore selectivity in function of RGS proteins and suggest that direct interactions between RGS proteins and GPCRs occur.Previously, selectivity in regulation of individual Gifamily G proteins by the most widely studied RGS, RGS4, has not been observed. Herein we demonstrate the selective enhancement of the GTPase activity of Go1 and Gi2 by RGS4 when these G proteins are activated by the α2A-adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, for the first time, the experiments were performed in membrane preparations rather than in reconstituted lipid vesicles. These studies have utilized a series of fusion constructs between the α2A-adrenergic receptor and the α subunit of each of Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, and Go1in which the N terminus of the G protein was linked directly and in-frame with the C terminus of the GPCR from which the stop codon had been removed.

Here we report studies on the membrane localization of the isolated PH domain from the amino terminus of PLCβ1(PLCβ1-PH) using fluorescence microscopy of a green fluorescent protein fusion protein. Whereas PLCβ1-PH does not localize to the plasma membrane in serum-starved cells, it undergoes a rapid but transient migration to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of cells with serum or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Regulation of the plasma membrane localization of PLCβ1-PH by phosphoinositides was also investigated. PLCβ1-PH was found to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate most strongly, whereas other phosphoinositides were bound with lower affinity. The plasma membrane localization of PLCβ1-PH induced by serum and LPA was blocked by wortmannin pretreatment and by LY294002. In parallel, activation of PLCβ by LPA was inhibited by wortmannin, by LY294002, or by the overexpression of PLCβ1-PH. Microinjection of βγ subunits of G proteins in serum-starved cells induced the translocation of PLCβ1-PH to the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate that a cooperative mechanism involving phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and the Gβγ subunit regulates the plasma membrane localization and activation of PLCβ1-PH.

This hydrolysis is catalyzed by the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C enzymes, which release two intracellular second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol (3.Berridge M.J.

Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs have been grouped by sequence into three major families, PLCβ, PLCδ, and PLCγ (5.Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PLCβ is stimulated by activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, whereas PLCγ is activated by receptor-tyrosine protein kinases. The mechanism of PLCδ regulation is presently not clear. All mammalian PLCβs have a modular domain organization, containing an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, four elongation factor hand motifs, a catalytic X/Y domain, a C2 domain, and a carboxyl-terminal extension that is unique to the PLCβ family. PLCs in all three classes have a PH domain at their amino terminus. In the cases of PLCδ and PLCγ, this PH domain appears to be essential for membrane association and for efficient activity in cellular membranes (6.Paterson H.F. Savopoulos J.W. Perisic O. Cheung R.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Akt/PKB activation in response to insulin or PDGF requires both its PH domain and PI 3-kinase activity (18.Burgering B.M.

Growth factor-induced activation of PI 3-kinases leads to an increase in the levels of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides that bind specifically to its PH domain, consequently recruiting the protein to the plasma membrane (20.Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have previously shown that the amino-terminal PH domain from PLCγ1 is targeted to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on PI 3-kinase activity (7.Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P.

Another 3-phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), has recently been shown to have a potential role as a second messenger, specifically in vesicular transport (21.Gaullier J.M.

In fact, recent data have revealed that a conserved zinc binding domain, the FYVE finger (named after the first letter of four proteins containing it) binds specifically to PtdIns(3)P (21.Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 22.Patki V. Lawe D.C. Corvera S. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A.

FYVE domains are found in several proteins, some of which have been shown to be involved in membrane trafficking (23.Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigate the role of the PH domain of PLCβ1(PLCβ1-PH) in plasma membrane binding and enzyme activation. We show that PLCβ1-PH binds to PtdIns(3)P and that the Gβγ subunit is involved in the signal-dependent membrane localization of PLCβ1-PH. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction of these two ligands with its PH domain mediates the specific membrane association and activation of PLCβ1. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the PH domains from rat PLCβ1 (residues 6–154), rat PLCγ1 (residues 14–150), and rat PLCδ1 (residues 11–140) were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were digested withBamHI alone (for PLCγ1-PH) or BamHI plus EcoRI (for PLCβ1-PH and PLCδ1-PH), depending on the sites present in the oligonucleotides used for PCR, and were ligated into the appropriately digested pGEX-2T or pGEX-2TK bacterial expression vector to direct expression of the GST-PH domain fusion proteins. The DNA sequence of each PH domain insert was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. cDNA encoding the different PH domains was subcloned (in frame with GFP) into the GFP fusion protein expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), using theBseAI and EcoRI sites for PLCβ1-PH,BglII, and BamHI sites for PLCγ1-PH and the BglII and EcoRI sites for PLCδ1-PH. The sequence of each insert was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The pGEX-2TK plasmid containing the PH domains was transformed intoEscherichia coli DH5α. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.3–0.4 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h at 37 °C (for PLCδ1-PH) or for 4–7 h at 25 °C (for PLCγ1-PH and PLCβ1-PH). After pelleting, cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Triton X-100 was added to 1% in the lysate, and particulates were removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 rpm in an SS34 (Sorvall) rotor. The clarified lysate was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors, and the protein bound to the glutathione-agarose beads was stored at 4 °C. For microinjection studies, the protein was eluted from the beads by incubation with 15 mm reduced glutathione in PBS, and the eluted protein was buffer-exchanged into microinjection buffer (PBS) using a Centricon-10 (Amicon). pGEX-2TK-encoded GST-PH fusions were labeled with 32P essentially as described previously (24.Kavran J.M.

Phosphoinositides in 1:1 chloroform/methanol solution (containing 0.1% HCl) were spotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (Micron Separations). After drying, the nitrocellulose was blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus 3% bovine serum albumin containing no detergent. The 32P-labeled GST-PH fusion proteins were then added to TBS, 3% bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, and this solution was used to probe the phosphoinositide-containing nitrocellulose for 30 min at room temperature. Filters were washed 5 times with TBS (containing no detergent), dried, and the bound radioactivity visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Centrifugation assays were performed as described previously (24.Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Lipid mixtures contained 80% (molar) di(dibromostearoyl)phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) plus 20% (molar) dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-l-serine (Sigma). Phosphoinositides were added to 3% (molar). Mixtures of standard [3H]inositol phosphates (NEN Life Science Products, 21 Ci/mmol; ARC Inc., St. Louis), used at the same concentrations, were added to the GST-PH fusion proteins (50 μg) on glutathione-agarose beads. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, the beads were washed 3 times with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the bound counts eluted with 0.1 N HCl. The eluted material was analyzed by strong anion exchange (SAX) HPLC as described previously (25.Falasca M. Carvelli A. Iurisci C. Qiu R.G. Symons M.H. Corda D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using a Partisil 10 SAX analytical column, eluting with a shallow gradient from 0 to 1 m (NH4)2HPO4 (pH 3.80). Radioactivity in the eluate was monitored with an on-line radioactivity flow detector (Packard FLO ONE A-525). Quantitative analysis was obtained by calculating the amount of radioactivity under the peaks, and using the same protein concentrations and specific activities of the different [3H]inositols. This assay was initially tested by using several PH domains, and other putative lipid binding domains, derived from different proteins, and gave very reproducible results consistent with those obtained with other binding assays. In addition, with several PH domains, such as those from pleckstrin and dynamin, we did not find any binding at all (as for GST alone), indicating that only specific binding was detected. HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and starved in 0.5% FBS for 16–24 h in DMEM. The transfection of GFP fusion protein vectors was done with cells grown on glass coverslips in 25-cm dishes using 2 mg of plasmid DNA and 5 ml of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, cells were serum-starved in DMEM with 0.5% FBS overnight. GFP fusion proteins were visualized following fixation of cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature using an upright SARASTRO 2000 CLSM confocal microscope (Molecular Dynamics). For living cells experiments, cells were plated onto 25-mm diameter circular glass coverslips. Cells were examined in an inverted microscope under a × 63 oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena GmbH D) and a Bio-Rad laser confocal microscope system (MRC-1000) connected to an Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss). Confocal images were taken at every 60 s using a Kalman filter (n = 2). The laser potency, photomultiplier, and pin-hole size were kept constant during the whole experiment. For inositol metabolite evaluation, cells grown in 6-well plates were labeled for 24 h in medium 199 containing myo-[3H]inositol (6 μCi/ml). Following this labeling the cells were washed once with PBS and preincubated for 10 min in 2 ml of PBS containing 10 mmLiCl (pH 7.4) at 37 °C, prior to the addition of the agonist. The cells were then extracted with methanol/HCl (1n)/chloroform (1:1:1) and analyzed by HPLC as described previously (25.Falasca M. Carvelli A. Iurisci C. Qiu R.G. Symons M.H. Corda D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 104 onto 13-mm glass coverslips. The following day, cells were serum-starved in 0.5% calf serum for 12 h in DMEM. The cDNAs of GFP-PLCβ1-PH, and Gβ1 and/or Gγ2 subunits in PBS were then microinjected into the cells in HEPES-buffered culture medium, using a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axiovert IM 35 microscope and an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) micromanipulator. The cDNA of the G protein subunits (β1γ2) were kindly provided by Prof. P. Gierschik (Ulm, Germany). The concentration of microinjected GST-PLCβ1-PH fusion protein was 0.5–1.0 mg/ml. After microinjection NIH 3T3 cells were incubated in DMEM at 37 °C. Microinjected cells were identified by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran. Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding of phosphoinositides to the PH domains of the PLCγ and PLCδ isozymes leads to their membrane association and plays a role in enzyme activation (6.Paterson H.F.

To investigate the function of the PH domain from the other family of PLC isozymes, PLCβ, the cellular localization of the amino-terminal PH domain from PLCβ1(PLCβ1-PH), was explored by fusing it to green fluorescent protein (GFP). The GFP-PLCβ1-PH fusion protein was transiently overexpressed in COS-7 and HeLa cells, and the distribution of the fluorescent label was examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. These studies showed that the protein is homogenously distributed in the cell cytoplasm in the absence of serum (Fig. 1 A), whereas in the presence of serum it is concentrated at the plasma membrane, as shown in Fig. 1 B for HeLa cells and in COS-7 cells (data not shown). This result provides evidence that PLCβ1-PH localizes to the plasma membrane, at least in cells that have been subjected to constant serum stimulation. In order to understand the mechanism of PLCβ1-PH binding to the plasma membrane, and to test its signal dependence, localization of PLCβ1-PH was studied in serum-starved COS-7 and HeLa cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, the protein is homogenously distributed in the COS-7 cell cytoplasm in the absence of serum stimulation. However, upon stimulation of the cells with either LPA (Fig. 2 B) or serum (data not shown), PLCβ1-PH is rapidly localized to the plasma membrane. These findings argue that the plasma membrane localization of PLCβ1-PH occurs only in activated cells, as previously reported for PLCγ1-PH and several other proteins (SOS, Grp1, etc.). Stimulation of COS-7 cells with growth factors such as EGF (Fig. 2 C) and PDGF (data not shown) did not induce a clear translocation of GFP-PLCβ1-PH to the plasma membrane. Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown). The nuclear staining present in both unstimulated and stimulated cells was also found with the empty vector and therefore represents nonspecific staining due to the small size of the fusion protein that permits its diffusion through the nuclear pores. To characterize further whether the PLCβ1-PH could localize to the nucleus, we microinjected a GST fusion protein of PLCβ1-PH into NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.3 no nuclear localization was observed either in serum-starved cells (Fig. 3 A) or in serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 3 B), whereas in serum-stimulated cells a clear plasma membrane localization was observed (Fig. 3 B). As there can be questions about data selection or variability between controls and samples, we have also monitored the same cells before and after the addition of serum. As shown in Fig.4, serum-starved COS-7 cells did not show any membrane localization. Serum addition induced a clear translocation of PLCβ1-PH to the plasma membrane that appears after 2 min of stimulation and reaches its maximum after around 5 min; this localization then gradually disappeared and was totally redistributed into the cytoplasm after 10 min of serum addition. To investigate the interactions of PLCβ1-PH with phosphoinositides, a GST-PLCβ1-PH fusion protein was generated and purified. We have recently developed a “lipid blotting” approach for screening lipid extracts and mixtures for potential PH domain ligands (24.Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Different lipids are spotted onto nitrocellulose, and the dried nitrocellulose is blocked as described (24.Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), without detergent, and is probed with the 32P-labeled GST fusion proteins of PH domains that have been labeled by protein kinase A phosphorylation of a protein kinase A site included in the construct. We used this approach to analyze phosphoinositide binding by PLCδ1-PH and PLCβ1-PH. As shown in Fig.5, we loaded the different phosphoinositides onto nitrocellulose and probed with GST and GST fused to PLCδ1-PH and PLCβ1-PH. GST-PLCδ-PH, our positive control, binds most strongly to PtdIns(4,5)P2(Fig. 5 A), whereas GST alone did not show any binding (data not shown). Interestingly, GST-PLCβ1-PH binds specifically to PtdIns(3)P (Fig. 5 B). Since this assay does not allow a quantitative comparison, we further investigated the phosphoinositide binding to PLCβ1-PH by using a different assay. We incubated a GST fusion of PLCβ1-PH bound to glutathione beads with phospholipid extracts from cells labeled with [3H]inositol. In order to eliminate artifacts due to unspecific micelle aggregation, and since binding of phosphoinositides to most PH domains occurs via the polar head group, we deacylated the cell extracts, obtaining the respective glycerophosphoinositols (gPtdIns(3)P, etc.). After a brief incubation and the washing off of nonspecifically bound counts, the radioactivity associated with the GST fusion proteins was analyzed by HPLC. With GST alone, no radioactivity was detected (data not shown). When PLCβ1-PH was incubated with the cell extracts, the product that it associated with to the greatest extent was gPtdIns(3)P (Fig. 6 A). A much smaller degree of interaction was seen with the other glycerophosphoinositides. The results obtained were consistent with those obtained using the lipid dot-blot assay. These data suggest that the isolated PLCβ1-PH specifically interacts with PtdIns(3)P and binds more weakly to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Similar data were obtained when the GST fusion of PLCβ1-PH was incubated with a mixture of [3H]inositol phosphate standards (Fig. 6 B; see “Experimental Procedures”) and by using a centrifugation assay for PH domain binding to lipid vesicles (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). Our previous work with PLCγ1-PH showed that stimulation of cells with serum or PDGF causes an immediate change in the intracellular localization of this PH domain, from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (7.Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), and that this localization is induced by the formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 upon stimulation of PI 3-kinase. Similar findings have been reported for Btk, cytohesin-1, ARNO, Grp1, and Gap1 (16.Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavaré J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24.Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14853-14861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI 3-kinase is important for membrane recruitment of PLCβ1-PH, we incubated COS-7 and HeLa cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (25 μm). In unstimulated cells transfected with GFP-PLCβ1-PH, only cytosolic fluorescence was seen (Fig. 2 A). LPA stimulation resulted in a clear localization of PLCβ1-PH to the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells (Fig. 7 A). However, when cells were pretreated with wortmannin or LY294002 (data not shown) for 10 min, no membrane localization was observed upon LPA stimulation (Fig. 7 B). These results strongly support the idea that the PLCβ1-PH plasma membrane localization induced by LPA involves PI 3-kinase. Previous studies have demonstrated that the PH domain of PLCβ1 binds to the Gβγ subunit and may play a role in the anchoring of the protein to the membrane surface (28.Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In order to test whether the Gβγ subunit interaction with PLCβ1 is involved in the signal-dependent recruitment of PLCβ1 to the plasma membrane, we microinjected DNA of the Gβ and the Gγ subunits together with GFP-PLCβ1-PH into NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 8 A, no specific localization was observed in serum-starved cells microinjected with GFP-PLCβ1-PH together with the Gβ subunit alone, whereas when the Gβγ subunits were microinjected GFP-PLCβ1-PH was recruited to the plasma membrane (Fig.8 B). Interestingly, pretreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with wortmannin completely abolished the effect of the Gβγ subunit on GFP-PLCβ1-PH translocation (Fig. 8 C). We have recently shown that the PH domain of PLCγ1 binds most strongly to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3and that PI 3-kinase activity plays a role in PLCγ1activation and membrane localization (7.Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To investigate how suppression of PI 3-kinase affects PLCβ activity, Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation was examined in COS-7 cells stimulated with LPA (25 μm; 3 min). As shown in Fig.9 A, pretreatment of COS-7 cells with 100 nm wortmannin or 25 μmLY294002 inhibited LPA-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation by more than 50%. In order to analyze further the role of the PH domain in PLCβ activation, the effect of overexpression of PLCβ1-PH on Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation induced by LPA was also investigated. The data presented in Fig. 9 Bshows that LPA-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 production is reduced by around 50% in cells that overexpress PLCβ1-PH. In contrast, no effect was seen when PLCγ1-PH or PLCδ1-PH were overexpressed under the same conditions, indicating that this effect is specific to PLCβ1-PH. Taken together, these results indicate that by binding to PtdIns(3)P the PLCβ1 PH domain may play a role in signal-dependent recruitment of the enzyme to the cell surface. LPA stimulates PI 3-kinase activity in diverse cell types. To test the hypothesis that LPA regulates PLC-β1 activity by inducing PtdIns(3)P formation, we determined the time course for the activation of PI 3-kinase in LPA-stimulated COS-7 and HeLa cells by measuring the accumulation of labeled 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. As shown in Fig. 10, PtdIns(3)P increases by about 50% after stimulation of COS-7 cells with LPA; this peak value is reached within 2 min and decreases thereafter with time (data not shown). Although modest (about 50% over basal), this increase is significant and could account for a role in PLC-β1 activation. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of PI 3-kinase activation in PH domain-mediated translocation of a number of signaling proteins, such as PLCγ1, Btk, Akt, Grp1, etc. (7.Falasca M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Other findings have suggested that PH domains of some proteins can bind to membrane proteins such as the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (29.Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The data reported here demonstrate that the activity of PLCβ1 is also regulated by PI 3-kinase, possibly by its product PtdIns(3)P, and by the Gβγ subunits. PI 3-kinase can phosphorylate the 3 position of inositol in PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, or PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro, althoughin vivo PtdIns(4,5)P2 seems to be its preferred substrate (30.Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced PI 3-kinase activity leads to the rapid accumulation of intracellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, with the other 3-phosphorylated lipids arising primarily as breakdown products of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. These data might be interpreted as meaning that PtdIns(3)P is a degradation product from the primary, agonist-sensitive PI 3-kinase activity and that it is unlikely to have any functional significance. However, recent results suggest that this is an over-simplification. First, a series of PtdIns-specific PI 3-kinases have been characterized in yeast and in mammalian cells (31.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Second, in human platelets it has been recently reported that integrin-dependent signaling activates the transient formation of PtdIns(3)P, followed by the generation of PtdIns(3,4)P2, but not PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (32.Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,33.Zhang J. Banfic H. Straforini F. Tosi L. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14081-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is the first evidence for stimulatory control of PtdIns(3)P formation in any cell. Finally, PtdIns(3)P has been reported to bind an important component of clathrin-coated structures, known as the adaptor complex AP-2, and leads to a significant enhancement in its capacity to recognize tyrosine-based endocytic signals (34.Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). More recently, it was also shown that the human early-endosomal autoantigen EEA1 binds to PtdIns(3)P through a protein domain called the FYVE domain (21.Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 22.Patki V. Lawe D.C. Corvera S. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Nature. 1998; 394: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that PtdIns(3)P might play a role in signal-induced membrane targeting of proteins, as already reported for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. PLCβ1 binds with relatively high affinity to membranes, and it has been proposed that the membrane localization of PLCβ isozymes is likely to be mediated by both the COOH-terminal domain and the PH domain that could bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 as reported for PLCδ1 (35.Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Direct measurements of the affinities of the mammalian PLCβ or PLCγ for PtdIns(4,5)P2 have shown that these isozymes did not bind the polar head group of PtdIns(4,5)P2 with a specificity comparable to that of PLCδ1 (7.Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 36.Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37.Tall E. Dorman G. Garcia P. Runnels L. Shah S. Chen J. Profit A. Gu Q.M. Chaudhary A. Prestiwich G.D. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7239-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In fact, the amino acid residues responsible for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding to the PLCδ1 PH domain are not well conserved in other PLC isozymes. Therefore, the affinities of the other PLC isoforms for PtdIns(4,5)P2 appear too weak to account for membrane translocation; hence, an additional membrane component is required. It is well known that the carboxyl-terminal portion of PLCβ1is a critical region required for activation by G proteins (38.Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the amino-terminal PH domain of PLCβ1 represents another region responsible for enzyme regulation. Thus, as reported for the PH domain of PLCγ1, which is likely to cooperate with the SH2 domain in signal-dependent membrane recruitment of the intact molecule (7.Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 40.Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), a similar scenario could be depicted in the case of PLCβ1. Interestingly, a similar mechanism that we propose for the PLCβ1 PH domain has already been suggested for the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (41.Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In fact, the PH domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase has been shown to interact with both Gβγ and PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the carboxyl and amino termini, respectively, of the PH domain (41.Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The interaction of these two ligands with the intact enzyme is required for its membrane association and activation. The evidence that phosphoinositides and Gβγ bind to different parts of the PH domain suggests a cooperative, and not a competitive, role of their interaction (30.Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The potentially cooperative binding of multiple ligands to PH domains may give a significance to some weak interactions found in the case of some PH domains and phosphoinositides and membrane proteins that might display higher affinity in the presence of both. This cooperative mechanism could also reveal a functional role giving a specificity to the localization of specific proteins. The data presented demonstrate that the PH domain of PLCβ1 localizes to the plasma membrane, although we cannot rule out a specific localization to internal compartments under different circumstances. Thus, a mechanism already shown for EEA1 can be hypothesized, where PtdIns(3)P together with the small G protein Rab5 induces the localization of the EEA1 to the Golgi compartment (42.Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Tohl B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The data that the PLCβ1 PH domain binds to PtdIns(3)P introduces the novelty that a PH domain can bind specifically to PtdIns(3)P and that this interaction occurs at the plasma membrane. The localization of the PLCβ1 PH domain to the plasma membrane and its displacement by pretreatment with wortmannin (known to reduce the level of PtdIns(3)P) suggest not only that a PH domain may bind specifically to this lipid but also that a portion of the PtdIns(3)P could be constitutively present on the plasma membrane or, alternatively, be produced by ligand stimulation as our data might suggest. The PI 3-kinase involved in PLCβ-PH translocation is probably an enzyme that specifically produces PtdIns(3)P and is distinct from the class I PI 3-kinase that produces mainly PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In fact, it is well known that PDGF induces increases in PtdIns(3,4)P2and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels but not that of PtdIns(3)P (30.Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In summary, our studies using the PH domain of PLC-β1indicate that LPA-stimulated inositol lipid turnover is dependent on a cooperative mechanism involving PtdIns(3)P and Gβγ activation.

Previous studies have identified two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which are expressed in the majority of HPV-associated carcinomas. The ability of high risk HPV E6 protein to immortalize human mammary epithelial cells has provided a single gene model to study the mechanisms of E6-induced oncogenic transformation. In recent years, it has become clear that in addition to E6-induced degradation of p53 tumor suppressor protein, other targets of E6 are required for mammary epithelial cells immortalization. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interaction of HPV16 E6 with protein kinase PKN, a fatty acid- and Rho small G protein-activated serine/threonine kinase with a catalytic domain highly homologous to protein kinase C. We demonstrate direct binding of high risk HPV E6 proteins to PKN in wheat-germ lysatein vitro and in 293T cells in vivo. Importantly, E6 proteins of high risk HPVs but not low risk HPVs were able to bind PKN. Furthermore, all the immortalization-competent and many immortalization-non-competent E6 mutants bind PKN. These data suggest that binding to PKN may be required but not sufficient for immortalizing normal mammary epithelial cells. Finally, we show that PKN phosphorylates E6, demonstrating for the first time that HPV E6 is a phosphoprotein. Our finding suggests a novel link between HPV E6 mediated oncogenesis and regulation of a well known phosphorylation cascade.

Transfection of the high risk HPV DNA into primary human keratinocytes results in their immortalization, indicating that the HPV genome encodes oncogenes that mediate cellular transformation (3.Woodworth C.D.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4620-4624PubMed Google Scholar). The unphosphorylated Rb protein is a critical cell cycle regulatory protein that is in complex with transcriptional factors, E2Fs during G1 phase of the cell cycle. Upon phosphorylation or association with oncogenes such as E7, E2F complex is released, leading to S phase or continuous proliferation. Unlike keratinocytes, discrete subpopulations of mammary epithelial cells are uniquely susceptible to immortalizing effects of E6 or E7 oncogenes alone (17.Wazer D.E. Liu X.L. Chu Q. Gao G. Band V.

This mammary epithelial cell model provides an opportunity to dissect out cellular pathways that are targeted by individual HPV oncogenes. Although p53 is an important target of E6, other potential targets have recently emerged. Recently, it has been shown that introduction of HPV16 E6 into epithelial cells results in an early increase in telomerase activity and essentially all HPV E6-immortalized cells have a dramatic increase in telomerase activity (20.Klingelhutz A.J. Foster S.A. McDougall J.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 21.Kiyono T. Foster S. Koop J. McDougall J. Galloway D. Klingelhutz A. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Telomerase enzyme is responsible for replicating telomeres, the DNA elements located at the ends of chromosomes (22.Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 23.Greider C.W. Curr.

Telomerase is composed of an RNA subunit, which acts as a template for replication, and the catalytic subunit hTERT, which functions as a reverse transcriptase (22.Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 23.Greider C.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R178-R181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Holt S.E. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity has been found to be low in most of the normal tissues in vivo but is known to be elevated during tumorigenesis (22.Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 23.Greider C.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R178-R181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Holt S.E. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recent findings have directly implicated telomerase in escape from cellular senescence. Indeed, transfection of hTERT component of telomerase into selected cell types can itself induce immortalization (25.Jiang X.R. Jimenez G. Chang E. Frolkis M. Kusler B. Sage M. Beeche M. Bodnar A. Wahl G.M. Tlsty T.D. Chiu C.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 26.Morales C. Holt S.E. Ouellette M. Kaur K.J. Yan Y. Wilson K.S. White M.A. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). It is likely that the ability of E6 to activate telomerase is one mechanism by which E6 can immortalize normal mammary epithelial cells. However, there is no direct evidence that E6-induced telomerase activity is responsible for E6-induced immortalization. E6 has also been shown to stabilize the c-Myc protein levels in cells through a post-transcriptional mechanism (27.Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Myc-binding sites have been identified in the promoter of hTERT (28.Greenberg R. O'Hagan R.C. Deng H.

Since the E6-induced telomerase activation may be c-Myc-dependent and c-Myc can activate hTERT transcription, E6 may immortalize cells via c-Myc-induced telomerase activation. However, c-Myc and hTERT do not directly interact with E6. In addition to hTERT and c-Myc, a number of other E6-interacting proteins have been reported recently. These include E6BP (also referred as ERC55), a putative calcium binding protein; paxillin, a focal adhesion protein involved in transducing signals from the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton; clathrin adaptor complex AP-1; the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein; interferon regulatory factor-3, multicopy maintenance protein 7, a subunit of the replication licensing factor-M; Bak, a Bcl2 antagonist that promotes apoptosis (E6 inhibits Bak-induced apoptosis); and E6TP1, a novel protein with homology to Rap1GAP (32.Chen J.J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that E6 binding to hDlg, E6BP, and IRF3 are not required for E6-induced immortalization of cells (21.Kiyono T. Foster S. Koop J. McDougall J. Galloway D. Klingelhutz A. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 38.Ronco L. Karpova A. Vidal M. Howley P.M.

Virol. 1999; 73: 7297-7307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies are under way in many laboratories to define the role of other remaining E6-binding proteins in E6-induced immortalization. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we report here a novel interaction of E6 protein with protein kinase PKN, a fatty acid- and Rho-small G protein-activated serine/threonine kinase (42.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 43.Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Takanaga H. Mori K. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Hirao K. Ono Y.

Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PKN was originally cloned by screening a human hippocampus cDNA library with the catalytic portion of protein kinase C (PKC) βII cDNA as a probe (42.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However unlike the PKC family protein, the NH2terminus of PKN lacks Ca2+ or phorbol ester binding motif (42.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of PKN contains leucine zipper-like sequences and a basic region located immediately amino-terminal to the first leucine zipper-like motif (42.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a small GTP-binding protein Rho binds to the amino-terminal region of PKN in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting that PKN functions at the downstream of Rho in the Rho signal transduction pathway (45.Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 618-650Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 46.Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We showed that E6 binds to carboxyl-terminal region of PKN; importantly, PKN binds to high risk but not low risk HPV E6. Furthermore, all the immortalizing and many non-immortalizing E6 mutants tested bind to PKN; implicating binding to PKN may have a potential role in E6 oncogenesis. Furthermore, using wild-type PKN and a kinase-defective mutant of PKN, we demonstrate that PKN phosphorylates HPV E6. These results implicate a prominent cellular phosphorylation cascade in mediating HPV E6-dependent oncogenesis. The detailed yeast two hybrid screening procedures have been described previously (33.Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S. Wazer D. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HPV16 E6 bait in pGBT9 (E6 residues 2–158) was used to screen a normal mammary epithelial cell strain 76N cDNA library in pGAD10 vector (custom-made through CLONTECH) with 1.5 × 106 primary recombinants and an average insert size of 1.5 kilobase pairs. The HPV16 E6 interacting proteins were identified by screening for growth on Trp−, Leu−, and His− selection medium and expression of β-galactosidase activity. Clones that remained positive in both assays were re-tested for E6-specific interaction by assessing their interaction with pGBT9-E6 versus two control baits, pLam 5′ (which encodes a human laminin/GAL4 DNA binding domain hybrid in pGBT9) and pVA3 (which encodes a murine p53/GAL4 DNA binding domain hybrid in pGBT9) (CLONTECH). The phPKN H4 (full-length human PKN cDNA in pBluescript II SK−), pMhPKN4 (full-length human PKN cDNA cloned in the mammalian expression plasmid pTB701), and pMhPKN PK-2 (kinase-negative K644E version of PKN in pTB701) have been described (42.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). pRC/CMV/PKN/AF3-FL (FLAG epitope-tagged constitutively active PKN) and pRC/CMV/PKN/AF3-FL (K644E) (kinase negative version of PKN) in pRC/CMV mammalian expression vector have also been described (47.Takahashi M. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The full-length PKN was cloned as anEcoRI fragment into pGEX2TK to produce GST-PKN fusion protein. Cloning of HPV16, -18, -11, and -6 E6 into pSP65 vector forin vitro translation has been described earlier (32.Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All the HPV16 E6 mutants have been described previously (41.Liu Y. Chen J.J. Gao Q. Dalal S. Hong Y. Mansur C.P. Band V.

GST-E6AP, and its mutant lacking aa 391–408, GST-E6APmut, was provided by Peter Howley (13.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell.

The HPV16, -18, -11, -6 E6, and -16 E6 mutant proteins were generated by in vitrotranslation in the presence of [35S]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) using a wheat germ lysate-based coupled transcription/translation system (TNT wheat germ lysate system; Promega) according to supplier's recommendations. The35S-labeled, in vitro translated proteins were incubated with 1 μg of appropriate GST fusion proteins non-covalently bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 300 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 2 h at 4 °C, and bound 35S-labeled proteins were resolved by a 17% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by fluorography. 293T cells (5 × 105) were transfected with 5 μg of pRC/CMV/PKN/AF3-FL, pRC/CMV/PKN/AF3-FL (K644E) (47.Takahashi M.

The total amount of DNA per dish was kept constant at 10 μg/dish. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (100 mmTris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), precleared twice with protein G-agarose, and incubated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed six times with lysis buffer, proteins were solubilized in sample buffer, and resolved on 17% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blotted with anti-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, obtained from Dr. Hamid Band, Harvard Medical School), incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To assess HPV E6-dependent degradation, HPV16 E6, HPV6 E6, p53, and PKN proteins were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]cysteine using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based coupled transcription/translation system (TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system; Promega). Five-μl aliquots of p53 or PKN translation reactions were incubated together with 5 μl of HPV E6 or water-primed (control) translation reaction. After a 12-h incubation at 30 °C, the degradation reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. 293T cells were transfected with 10-μg DNA of pSG5 vector, pSG5–16E6, pSG5-E6TP1, pMhPKN7, or pMhPKN PK-2 individually or in the indicated combination. The total amount of DNA was held constant at 20 μg/dish by adding vector DNA. Cells were harvested in sample buffer after 48 h, and 100 μg of total protein was resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blotted with a rabbit anti-PKN (42.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or anti-E6TP1 antisera (33.Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S. Wazer D. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 293T cells (5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish, two 100-mm dishes per transfection) were transfected with 10-μg DNA of pSG5 vector, pSG5-HPV16E6, pMhPKN7, pMhPKN PK-2 (K644E), or their indicated combinations using the Fugene reagent. The total amount of DNA was held constant at 20 μg/dish by adding vector DNA. One set of transfected cells were labeled in 3 ml of phosphorus-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 30 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (NEN Life Science Products) for 3 h. The other set of cells was labeled in 3 ml of cysteine-free medium containing 15 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine for 3 h. Each dish of cells was harvested in 5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). HPV16 E6 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HPV16 E6 antiserum (33.Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S. Wazer D. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and resolved on a 17% SDS-PAGE, and immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Screening of 1.5 × 106individual recombinants of normal mammary epithelial cell yeast two-hybrid cDNA library with HPV16 E6 (amino acids 2–158) identified clones capable of growth on Trp−, Leu−, and His− selection medium. Further screening of these clones using LacZ complementation yielded 88 colonies. These clones were re-tested for their interaction with E6 relative to control baits pLam 5′ and pVA3 murine p53. Twenty-eight clones were found to specifically interact with HPV16 E6 and were sequenced. One relatively weak positive clone encoded the 476 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of E6-AP, a known E6-binding protein, including its 18-aa E6-binding motif (13.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This result indicated that the cDNA library and the method of screening were suitable for isolating E6-binding proteins. A set of 11 identical and 1 distinct strongly positive clone identified overlapping regions of a novel E6-binding putative Rap-specific GAP, E6TP1, which we have reported recently (33.Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S. Wazer D. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of the remaining positive clones encoded the carboxyl-terminal 169-aa protein kinase PKN, a previously identified serine/threonine kinase (Fig. 1). The region of PKN present in the isolated clone lacked basic and leucine zipper-like regions, which are known to be involved in intramolecular regulation via interaction with and binding to Rho, which regulates the activity of PKN. This region of PKN includes part of the catalytic domain and the extreme COOH-terminal region of PKN, which corresponds to the substrate binding region in PKC. To further confirm the interaction between E6 and PKN, we prepared a GST fusion protein encoding the full-length PKN and used it for in vitro binding experiments with the in vitro wheat germ lysate-translated 35S-labeled E6 protein of two high risk (HPV16 and HPV18) and two low risk (HPV6 and HPV11) HPVs. As shown in Fig. 2, GST-E6AP (aa 37–865), used as a positive control, showed substantial binding to HPV16 but no binding to HPV6 E6 or HPV11 E6 proteins, as expected. As has been previously published, E6AP binds significantly less to HPV18 E6 as compared with HPV16 E6 (12.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). GST-E6AP mutant (Δ391–408), that lacks the 18-aa E6 binding motif, did not bind to the HPV E6 proteins above background level demonstrating the specificity of binding. GST-PKN protein showed substantial binding to the high risk HPV E6 proteins (HPV16 E6 and HPV18 E6), but a relatively low level of binding to the low risk HPV E6 proteins (HPV6 E6 and HPV11 E6). Thus, PKN appears to preferentially bind to E6 proteins of high risk HPVs. As binding assays were carried out in wheat germ lysates, which lack E6AP, the interaction between PKN and HPV E6 proteins is likely to be independent of E6AP similar to E6 interaction with E6AP but unlike E6 interaction with p53 (8.Scheffner M.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To assess whether E6 can interact with PKN in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with either vector or a plasmid encoding myc-tagged E6 protein with or without plasmid encoding the FLAG-tagged wild-type PKN-AF3 or the kinase-defective PKN-AF3 (K644E). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the exogenously expressed PKN was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2), followed by Western blotting for E6 using the anti-myc antibody (9E10). As expected, no E6 protein was detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with either vector alone or when E6 and PKN constructs were transfected individually (Fig.3, lanes 1–3). In contrast, anti-myc-reactive E6 protein was clearly detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates of cells co-transfected with E6 and PKN constructs (lane 4). Western blotting of whole cell lysates with anti-myc antibody indicated that E6 was expressed in all of the transfectants where E6 construct was introduced. These results demonstrate that E6 can associate with PKN in vivo. Furthermore, the kinase-defective PKN mutant (K644E) also associated with HPV16 E6 at levels similar to wild-type PKN, demonstrating that the kinase activity of PKN is not required for binding to HPV E6. Previous analyses have revealed that the high risk HPV E6 proteins target a number of interacting proteins for degradation, whereas other binding proteins are not targeted for degradation (8.Scheffner M.

Members of the family share a highly conserved NH2-terminal sequence termed the Rel homology domain, which is required for DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear localization, and interaction with the IκB molecules. In response to an inflammatory stimulus, cytokine, or viral infection, IκB proteins are rapidly degraded by the 26 S multicatalytic proteasome. Degradation of IκBα, the most intensively characterized inhibitor, requires phosphorylation on serine residues 32–36 (1.Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Benneriah Y. Proc.

As a consequence of IκBα degradation, the freed NF-κB accumulates in the nucleus, where it activates gene transcription. NF-κB acts on genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, immune receptors, and adhesion molecules, and its activation leads to a coordinated increase in the expression of inflammatory and immune response mediators (reviewed in Ref. 14.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). Apart from the well characterized inhibitory function on NF-κB in the cytoplasm, IκBα also participates in the inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription in the cell nucleus. Once the stimulus is withdrawn, NF-κB activity is rapidly shut down, ensuring that the κB-dependent transcriptional activity is only transient (15.Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Hohmann H.P. Remy R. Scheidereit C. van Loon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 259-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is accounted for by two mechanisms. First, free, non-NF-κB-associated IκBα has the capacity to enter the nucleus when the protein is overexpressed from a heterologous promoter (17.Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 18.Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a property seems to rely on an active process mediated by a non-canonical nuclear import sequence located within the second ankyrin domain of IκBα protein (19.Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Turpin P. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6804-6812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Second, IκBα has the ability to both prevent NF-κB binding to and to dissociate NF-κB from specific DNA consensus sequences (18.Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 22.Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of IκBα is induced by stimuli activating NF-κB and can be considered as part of a physiological mechanism regulating NF-κB-dependent transcription. This assumption is supported by the fact that a massive accumulation of IκBα, which becomes detectable in the nucleus upon extinction of the cell signaling, occurs concomitantly with loss of NF-κB-DNA binding activity and extinction of NF-κB-dependent transcription (15.Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compelling additional evidence for a role of nuclear IκBα in the regulation of NF-κB activity in vivo came from a murine model of IκBα gene knockout (23.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 24.Klement F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, fibroblasts from IκBα-deficient mice showed an abnormally long lasting expression of nuclear NF-κB upon removal of TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α) (23.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). In addition to that mechanism, termination of NF-κB-dependent transcription by IκBα could be completed by a newly described retrograde transport of NF-κB·IκBα complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (25.Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A nuclear export sequence (NES)1 (IQQQLGQLTLENL) located in the C-terminal (residues 265–277) region of IκBα, which resembles the prototypical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev NES (LPPLERLTLD) (25.Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

Taylor S.S. cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), would confer the protein with the capacity to interact with the Crm1-dependent export pathway (27.Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This pathway ensures retrograde transport toward the cytoplasm of numerous proteins containing a homologous NES (reviewed in Ref. 28.Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, a new NES motif (MVKELQEIRLE) was recently identified within the N-terminal 45–55 residues of IκBα (29.Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Both studies demonstrate that nuclear exclusion of the NF-κB·IκBα complexes depends critically on this N-NES and is mediated by a Crm1-dependent pathway (29.Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Persistent activation of NF-κB, required for full T-cell responsesin vivo (31.Attar R.M. Macdonald-Bravo H. Raventos-Suarez C. Durham S.K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 477-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), takes place while IκBα is being resynthesized and localized to the nucleus. The question arises of how termination of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity by IκBα is prevented if continuous nuclear import of the IκBα molecule occurs early following the onset of cell activation and is prolonged while cell signaling persists. To address this question, we have investigated whether IκBα expression could be regulated in the nucleus during the process of cell activation, which initiates and maintains NF-κB-dependent transcription. Based on the susceptibility of post-translationally modified IκBα to the multicatalytic core activity of the 26 S proteasome and the well characterized existence of nuclear proteasome complex (32.Peters J.M. Franke W.W. Kleinschmidt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7709-7718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Palmer A. Rivett A. Thomson S. Hendil K. Butcher G. Fuertes G. Knecht E. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that IκBα in the nuclei of activated cells could be exposed to proteolytic attack by the proteasome. Thus, in situ degradation of IκBα would prevent precocious and abrupt termination of ongoing NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Here we provide evidence that the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β (interleukin-1β) activate a permanent shuttling of IκBα from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. IκBα becomes detectable in the cell nucleus within minutes following cell induction. The amount of IκBα accumulating in the nucleus while cell signaling and NF-κB activation persist is regulated in situ by an inducible proteasome-mediated degradation. Human HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were transiently transfected with CMV-IE-promoter-driven (pcDNA3) vectors (200 ng for 104 cells) expressing either wild type (β-TrCP) or mutant forms (β-TrCPΔF) of β-TrCP. HeLa 57A cells stably co-transfected with Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase and 3EnhConA luciferase expression vectors were provided by R. Hay (University of St. Andrews, United Kingdom) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% FCS and 200 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Luciferase activity contained in total extracts was measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold), and results were expressed as relative luciferase units per μg of protein, the background signal being subtracted from the values obtained from each sample. β-Galactosidase measurement on total cellular extracts was performed using a kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HeLa cells (1 × 105) were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and stained for indirect immunofluorescence 36–40 h later. They were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Anti-human IκBα or RelA rabbit polyclonal (C-21 and C-20, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA)) antibodies were applied for 1 h followed by a 1-h incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology). In some experiments, nuclei were counterstained by a 1-h incubation in propidium iodide and RNase A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst). Confocal laser microscopy analysis was performed on a Leica TCS4D instrument with the 488-nm and 568 laser wave lines to excite fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide dyes, respectively, using a × 63 oil immersion PL APO objective. All of the data were recorded at the same laser and multiplier settings. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described (36.Rodriguez M. Wright J. Thompson J. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J.

Immobilized antigen-antibody complexes were detected with secondary anti-IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Pierce) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was estimated in freshly collected cytosolic and nuclear fractions using a kit (DG 1340, Sigma) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described (15.Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 4 μg of nuclear extracts incubated for 15 min at room temperature with a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 LTR binding site for NF-κB. For immunoprecipitation, magnetic beads (Dynal, M-280) were coupled with anti-human IκBα (C-15) or anti-human RelA (C-20) and were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting performed as described above. The proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxyl-leucin-leucin-leucinal (z-LLL-h) was provided by F. Baleux (Unité de Chimie Organique, Institut Pasteur, Paris). Human recombinant TNFα was provided by the Medical Research Council AIDS reagent program. Human recombinant IL-1β was a gift from Dr. A. Allison. Digitonin was purchased from Fluka. Leptomycin B was a kind gift of B. Wolff (Novartis, Vienna, Austria). The kinetics of endogenous IκBα and NF-κB proteins expression were analyzed in HeLa cells following stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that within the first minutes following TNFα treatment, a substantial reduction of the cytoplasmic amount of IκBα accompanied by the localization of cytoplasmic RelA to the cell nucleus is observed (Fig.1 A, TNF 5′). Concomitantly, and paralleling the accumulation of RelA, an increase in the nuclear content of p50 occurred, which suggests the presence of bona fide NF-κB in the cell nucleus of TNFα-activated cells (data not shown). Replenishment of the cytoplasmic pool of IκBα by newly synthesized protein becomes detectable 20 min after TNFα induction (Fig.1 A, TNF 20′). Remarkably, by 30 min after the onset of the induction, a shift in the pattern of IκBα subcellular distribution was observed. At that time and while RelA was abundantly expressed in the cell nucleus, the neosynthesized IκBα showed apparently a preferential localization to the nucleus (Fig.1 A, TNF 30′). Neither induced IκBα phosphorylation or ubiquitination permit dissociation of the inhibitor integrated in NF-κB·IκBα complex (14.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that IκBα trafficking to the cell nucleus arises from a massively resynthesized, NF-κB-unbound pool of the protein. This and the reported decreased activity of IκB kinase complexes, which declines progressively in TNFα time course experiments (38.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) along with the IκB kinase complexes' preference for IκBα as a substrate when bound to NF-κB (39.Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may explain that a pool of freed IκBα escapes degradation in the cytoplasm and enters the cell nucleus. The presence of IκBα in the cell nucleus 30 min after the addition of TNFα should counteract the capacity of NF-κB to bind specific DNA consensus sequences and, consequently, NF-κB-dependent transcription. However, it is well established that a functional NF-κB-DNA binding activity is generally reached by 30 min following TNFα induction (see Fig. 4 A,lane 3) by the time IκBα localization to the cell nucleus becomes apparent. How, under those circumstances, are NF-κB-DNA binding and NF-κB-dependent transcription protected from a precocious blockade by nuclear IκBα? Preservation of NF-κB-DNA binding activity could be explained if only low amounts of IκBα enter and accumulate in the nucleus at that time. Alternatively, IκBα could translocate continuously and abundantly to the nucleus of activated cells, but the levels of the protein in this compartment could be actively down-regulated, thus preventing blockade of NF-κB-dependent functions. Two mechanisms capable of reducing the content of IκBα must be considered: export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and in situ nuclear proteolysis of IκBα. A reduced stability of IκBα in the cell nucleus could be the consequence of the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. Indeed, the nuclear localization of the 26 S proteasome is well established, and its catalytic activity has been shown to participate in the regulation of nuclear transcriptional activators (40.Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 41.Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 42.Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 43.Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if the proteosome was involved in the degradation of nuclear IκBα, incubation with pseudopeptides that inhibit the multicatalytic activity of the proteasome complex (44.Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothsein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar) must stabilize the protein. To this purpose, subcellular fractionating and biochemical analysis of the fate of IκBα both in the cytoplasm and nucleus were carried out. It should be stressed that in contrast with the intense nuclear IκBα staining observed in situ by immunofluorescence, the amount of nuclear IκBα detected upon subcellular fractionating is relatively low and is probably underestimated as a result of the loss of a significant fraction during preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (15.Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were induced with TNFα for 30 min and maintained for an additional 10 min in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor z-LLL-h (Fig. 1 B,TNF 30′, TNF 30′ + z-LLL-h , and TNF 40′, respectively). The short treatment withz-LLL-h led to a substantial increase of the cytoplasmic pool of IκBα and an even more marked effect on the accumulation of the protein in the cell nucleus (Fig. 1 B). The accumulation of IκBα in the cell nucleus promoted byz-LLL-h can be explained by the inhibition of an ongoing proteolytic mechanism activated by TNFα, which is simultaneously operating in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. To further characterize the degradation mechanisms of IκBα in the nucleus of activated cells, we investigated the presence of phosphorylated forms of the inhibitor, which is a prerequisite for its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Furthermore, we sought to investigate whether a pool of nuclear IκBα may be phosphorylated in situ. To this aim, we used an experimental approach described previously, which permits induction and long lasting accumulation of IκBα in the cell nucleus leading to termination of NF-κB-dependent transcription. Briefly, cells were treated for a short time by TNFα (30-min pulse). Upon withdrawal of the stimulus, cells were cultured for an additional period of 90 min (chase), and thereafter nuclear proteins were obtained by subcellular fractionating and analyzed by immunoblotting. The fate of IκBα was analyzed in parallel by indirect immunofluorescence. The mechanisms propitiating the constitution of an apparent resident pool of IκBα in the cell nucleus under those experimental conditions (Fig. 1, C, lane 5 andD, panel B) could be explained at least in part by the above discussed, time-dependent decline of the phosphorylation capacity of IκB kinase complex in the course of TNFα stimulation (38.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar), a process that could be specially marked upon the extinction of cell signaling. Analysis of proteins from pulse-chase TNFα-induced cells revealed, as expected, a massive accumulation of the nuclear content of IκBα, where the native form of the protein is predominant and co-exists with the slowly migrating form characteristic of the Ser32–Ser36-phosphorylated species (Fig.1 C, lane 5). Recognition of the slowly migrating form of IκBα by a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes IκBα phosphorylated on Ser32 further characterized the modification undergone by the protein (data not shown). The absence of detectable lactate dehydrogenase enzyme in the nuclear compartment excludes significant contamination of nuclear cell extracts by residual cytoplasmic proteins. In the presence of z-LLL-h, the amount of phosphorylated IκBα increased, thus reflecting the stabilization of the protein in the cell nucleus (Fig. 1 C, comparelanes 5 and 6). The reinforced staining of the nuclear pool of IκBα parallels that finding and sustains that assumption (Fig. 1 D, panel C). However, from this finding, it cannot be concluded whether the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of IκBα results from arrival of cytoplasmic-phosphorylated IκBα or from in situ modification of the nuclear pool. In this regard, induction with IL-1β of pulse-chase TNFα-induced cells proved to be more informative. Indeed, IL-1β stimulation for 10 min efficiently promoted activation of NF-κB as proved by a substantial enhancement of the nuclear content of RelA (Fig. 1 C, α-RelA,lane 7). Concomitantly, IL-1β induction lead to a profound reduction of the total content of IκBα (Fig.1 C, α-IκBα, lane 7; Fig.1 D, panel D). If only IκBα phosphorylated in the cytoplasm was the target of degradation induced by IL-1β in the cell nucleus, the pool of unmodified nuclear IκBα should remain unaffected. However, it should be noted that IL-1β treatment induced in the nucleus a profound decrease of the native, nonphosphorylated IκBα that co-existed with the detection of phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 1 C, α-IκBα,lane 7). These findings are compatible with anin situ modification of the pre-existing nuclear pool of IκBα that would permit ulterior degradation by the proteasome. Supporting this assumption, the simultaneous addition ofz-LLL-h and IL-1β preserved the nuclear pool of IκBα (Fig. 1 C, lane 8; Fig.1 D, panel E), promoting the preferential accumulation of stable, phosphorylated forms of the protein (Fig. 1 C, lane 8). As expected from an in situ phosphorylation of IκBα, the stabilization and accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα was paralleled by a significant reduction of the unmodified pool of the protein (Fig. 1 C, lane 8). The putative phosphorylation of IκBα in the cell nucleus is intriguing, since so far, the IκB kinases α and β appear to be mainly cytoplasmic. However, the kinases have the capacity to localize in the nucleus. Indeed, it has been shown that when overexpressed from a heterologous promoter, both kinases localize in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (38.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). The recent cloning of a new IκBα kinase complex induced by inflammatory cytokines (45.Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and interacting with TANK (a TRAF-binding protein (TNF receptor-associated factor) (46.Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) opens the possibility that, either constitutively or upon cell activation, this or another new kinase from that rapidly growing family could account for the phosphorylation of IκBα in the cell nucleus. We and others showed that the F-box-containing β-TrCP protein integrated in a SCF complex (forSkp1-cullin-F-box protein) is the ubiquitin-E3 ligase that ultimately marks Ser32–Ser36-phosphorylated IκBα for proteolysis by the proteasome machinery (8.Kroll M.

https://openalex.org/W2029918145,"GM3 ganglioside at the surface of mouse melanoma B16 cells is clustered and organized with signal transducer molecules c-Src, Rho A, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to form a membrane unit separable from caveolae, which are enriched in cholesterol and caveolin but do not contain GM3 or the above three signal transducers. The GM3-enriched membrane units are involved in GM3-dependent cell adhesion coupled with activation of c-Src, Rho A, and FAK and are termed the glycosphingolipid signaling domain or the glycosignaling domain (GSD). In order to assess the essential components that display GSD function, membranes with properties similar to those of GSD were reconstituted using GM3, sphingomyelin, and c-Src, with or without other lipid components. The reconstituted membrane thus prepared displayed GM3-dependent adhesion to plates coated with Gg3 or anti-GM3 antibody, resulting in enhanced c-Src phosphorylation (c-Src phosphorylation response). This response in reconstituted membrane depends on GM3 concentration and was not observed when GM3 was absent or replaced with other gangliosides GM1 or GD1a, or with LacCer. The GM3-dependent c-Src phosphorylation response was enhanced when cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine were added. Although GM3, sphingomyelin, and c-Src are essential for GSD function, a small quantity of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine may act as an auxiliary factor to stabilize membrane. GSD function in terms of GM3-dependent adhesion and signaling was blocked in the presence of lyso-GM3 or its analogue but not psychosine, lactosyl-sphingosine, or lyso-phosphatidylcholine. Such susceptibility of reconstituted GSD to lyso-GM3 and other lyso compounds is the same as GSD of original B16 cells. Thus, functional organization of the reconstituted membrane closely simulates that of GSD in B16 cells, which is based on clustered GM3 organized with c-Src as the essential components."

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus S-adenosyl-l-methionine high performance liquid chromatography Pneumocystis carinii is a fungus that causes P. carinii pneumonia (PCP)1in people with AIDS, patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy, and others with conditions causing severe immunosuppression. Although the frequency of PCP in HIV-infected persons has decreased dramatically over the last 8 years, due first to widespread prophylaxis against PCP and more recently to the reduced immunosuppression brought on by improved anti-HIV therapy, PCP remains common in AIDS patients. Treatment for PCP is less than ideal with frequent severe side effects from the two most effective drugs, pentamidine and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole, TMP-SMZ) (1.Wilkin A. Feinberg J. Am. Fam. Physician. 1999; 60 (1713–1714): 1699-1708PubMed Google Scholar). The mortality rate also remains high (21.5%) (2.Azoulay E. Parrot A. Flahault A. Cesari D. Lecomte I. Roux P. Saidi F. Fartoukh M. Bernaudin J.F. Cadranel J. Mayaud C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Beyond the importance ofP. carinii as a pathogen, it is also an unusual and interesting fungus for which most basic metabolic processes are unknown.S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) plays a pivotal role in the physiology of all cells, both as methyl donor in myriad of biological and biochemical events and as a precursor of polyamines. About 95% of AdoMet is used for transmethylation reactions in which the N-methyl group of the methionine moiety is transferred to large molecules such as proteins, complex lipids, and DNA or to small molecules to form lecithin, regenerate methionine, etc. (3.Cohen S. A Guide to Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). The remaining 2–5% of AdoMet is decarboxylated to become the aminopropyl donor for synthesis of the essential polyamines spermidine and spermine (4.Newman E.B. Budman L.I. Chan E.C. Greene R.C. Lin R.T. Woldringh C.L. D'Ari R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3614-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transmethylation reactions result in the formation ofS-adenosylhomocysteine which is then hydrolyzed byS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase to form adenosine and homocysteine. Decarboxylation of AdoMet is catalyzed byS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase producing decarboxylated AdoMet, an intermediate committed to polyamine biosynthesis. Decarboxylated AdoMet donates an aminopropyl group to putrescine to form spermidine or to spermidine to form spermine. The end product of the aminopropyl transfer reactions is methylthioadenosine which is cleaved by a specific phosphorylase, the products being recycled in various ways to methionine and purines, respectively. A comprehensive review of polyamine metabolism and function has been published (3.Cohen S. A Guide to Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar).AdoMet is synthesized by AdoMet synthetase which transfers the adenosyl group of ATP to methionine with the residual triphosphate being hydrolyzed to Pi and PPi by the polyphosphatase activity of AdoMet synthetase. To our knowledge, with the exception of mutants, no cell has previously been reported to lack this enzyme and AdoMet has not been known to be an essential nutrient. That AdoMet is an essential metabolite is shown by a mutant of Escherichia coli with very low AdoMet synthetase activity resulting in a cell division defect (4.Newman E.B. Budman L.I. Chan E.C. Greene R.C. Lin R.T. Woldringh C.L. D'Ari R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3614-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by knockout of this enzyme inSaccharomyces cerevisiae which is lethal but death can be prevented by exogenous AdoMet (5.Cherest H. Sudin-Kerjan Y. Exinger F. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 163: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the universal activity of AdoMet synthetase, exogenous AdoMet can have an effect on wild type cells. For example, added AdoMet can stimulate budding and outgrowth as well as RNA and protein synthesis in S. cerevisiae (6.Brawley J.V. Ferro A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 608-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another example is patients recovering from liver cirrhosis which results in low AdoMet synthetase activity; these patients are benefited by supplementing their diet with AdoMet (7.Duce A.M. Ortiz P. Cabrero C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8.Pisi E. Marchesini G. Drugs. 1990; 40: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since AdoMet has been reported to enhance growth of another fungus (6.Brawley J.V. Ferro A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 608-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we added AdoMet to the medium we used to develop an axenic culture for P. carinii. This caused a qualitative and quantitative improvement inP. carinii culture including the production of cysts. Because of the positive effect of AdoMet on axenic culture of P. carinii culture and because analogues of AdoMet have been explored as pharmaceutical leads, we examined P. carinii for the possibility of an AdoMet requirement, for the ability to transport of AdoMet, for the rate of use of AdoMet and for the capacity to synthesize this essential intermediate. We found that P. carinii has a transport system for AdoMet which seems completely AdoMet-specific. We also found that P. carinii is an AdoMet auxotroph, a condition not previously reported for any cell.DISCUSSIONAdoMet is an essential intermediate in the physiology of the cell, both for synthesis of polyamines and as a methyl donor for nearly all methylation reactions (3.Cohen S. A Guide to Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). To our knowledge, all cells investigated previously were found able to synthesize this intermediate from ATP and methionine using the enzyme AdoMet synthetase; AdoMet has never been described as an essential nutrient. To understand the reason underlying our previous observation that adding AdoMet to culture medium qualitatively promotes P. carinii growth (9.Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and to expand our general investigation of P. carinii polyamine metabolism (10.Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21017-21022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20.Chin K. Merali S. Saric M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we examined P. carinii both for the ability to utilize exogenous AdoMet and to synthesize this compoundde novo. The results indicate that P. carinii has an absolute need for AdoMet and to date is the only cell known to be a natural AdoMet auxotroph.The data reported here demonstrate the degree to which AdoMet both maintains and increases P. carinii growth in vitro. It is interesting to note that in the cultures with whole horse serum but without AdoMet, the initial growth followed by a slow decline is reminiscent of the growth in culture systems described prior to our recently published axenic system (9.Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Previous culture systems (22.Sloand E. Laughon B. Armstrong M. Bartlett M.S. Blumenfeld W. Cushion M. Kalica A. Kovacs J.A. Martin W. Pitt E. Pesanti E.D. Richards F. Rose R. Walzcr P. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1993; 40: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) utilized a mammalian feeder cell and very likely these cells provide a significant but limited amount of AdoMet. A similar role is played by the high concentration of AdoMet in horse serum relative to the more frequently used fetal calf serum. One could speculate that addition of AdoMet to a culture system using mammalian cells would allow continuous passage to fresh feeder cells. We were able to confirm AdoMet utilization by showing that P. carinii causes depletion of this metabolite from the growth medium and this is nicely supported by the in vivo data showing that P. carinii infection causes rat plasma to become depleted of AdoMet. Although our initial culture medium contained 500 μmAdoMet and this concentration was used for the studies reported here, we have found that 50 μm AdoMet is adequate to support growth. Starting at 50 μm, the spontaneous rate of AdoMet degradation in the medium predicts a decline to 14 μm or 5.6 μg ml−1 of medium at 12 h, somewhat less than reported AdoMet concentration in rat lungs, 11.1 μg g−1of tissue (23.Baldessarini R.J. Kopin I.J. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One could speculate that the now popular use of AdoMet as a nutritional supplement could result in increased vulnerability to infection with P. carinii but there is no direct data to support this.Kinetics of AdoMet uptake indicate the presence of a transporter and the effect of metabolic inhibitors indicate that transport is an active, energy-requiring process. One of the most interesting kinetic findings was with natural compounds related to AdoMet none of which competed with AdoMet for transport. These compounds include:l-methionine and ATP (the components of AdoMet), hypoxanthine (a purine frequently scavenged by cells), adenine (the purine moiety of AdoMet), S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoMet missing the S-methyl group), decarboxylated AdoMet (AdoMet missing the carboxyl group of methionine), methylthioadenosine (AdoMet after decarboxylation and donation of a propyl group), andS-adenosylethionine (an analogue with theS-methyl group substituted by an S-ethyl group). Therefore, it seems that the transporter recognizes neither any component of AdoMet nor any physiologically modified AdoMet suggesting that this transporter may recognize AdoMet alone. AdoMet transport byS. cerevisiae is similar to P. carinii in being facilitated by a high affinity transporter which is pH and energy dependent with a similar K m (3.3 μm) (24.Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this S. cerevisiae transporter is not strictly AdoMet specific since both S-adenosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylethionine can compete with AdoMet although adenosine, methionine, and homocysteine do not (24.Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study (18.Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28096-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported an additional transport system in S. cerevisiae as well as cloning the originally described transporter. The originally described transporter is coded by the SAM3 gene and shows homology to the family of amino acid transporters. The newly described transporter is of low affinity (K m = 160 μm), operates by facilitated diffusion and is not able to supply the needs of the cell fully, even at high concentrations of AdoMet. We also detected a second transport system in P. carinii but with a K m = 330 μm it cannot be physiologically significant. It seems likely that the low affinity transporter activity is due to an entirely different transporter that will recognize AdoMet when it is at very high, non-physiological concentrations. The AdoMet transporter of African trypanosomes is as specific for AdoMet as the P. cariniitransporter, although it operates by facilitated diffusion rather than active transport (25.Goldberg B. Yarlett N. Sufrin J. Lloyd D. Bacchi C.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells AdoMet penetrates poorly and extracellular AdoMet is mainly utilized to methylate phospholipids on the surface of plasma membrane (26.Bontemps F. Van Den Berghe G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The effect of metabolic inhibitors on AdoMet transport suggest thatP. carinii utilizes both a cytochrome-mediated electron transport system and alternative oxidase-mediated system for energy production. Azide, which blocked transport by 24%, is a standard inhibitor of cytochrome-mediated ATP production. Salicylhydroxamic acid, which in combination with azide blocked transport by 95%, inhibits the enzyme alternative oxidase which provides a branch in electron transport at the level of ubiquinol. Although alternative oxidase itself does not lead to ATP generation by pumping protons, it does support transport of electrons to molecular oxygen, thus allowing ATP generation based on site 1 of oxidative phosphorylation as well as substrate level phosphorylation in the mitochondrion (27.McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Using an oxygen electrode, we have directly observed the ability of salicylhydroxamic acid to inhibit oxygen consumption (data not shown).We conclude that P. carinii is an AdoMet auxotroph for the following reasons. AdoMet is necessary to support growth in vitro. P. carinii causes depletion of AdoMet from the culture medium. P. carinii has an AdoMet-specific transporter and no AdoMet synthetase activity. Strong evidence that these are not in vitro artifacts is provided by the finding that the concentration of AdoMet in rat plasma declines in proportion to the degree of P. carinii infection. An excellent chemotherapeutic opportunity is presented by this dependence ofP. carinii on exogenous AdoMet and the presence of a specific transporter as well as the fact that mammalian cells do not transport AdoMet well. Although normal metabolites related to AdoMet do not inhibit transport, it may be possible to design analogues that are recognized by the transporter with equal or greater affinity than AdoMet. If transported in place of AdoMet, such compounds can also be expected to interfere with AdoMet-dependent methylation and with polyamine biosynthesis. This dual mode of action would be synergistic because suppression of AdoMet transport will increase the ratio of analogue to AdoMet within P. carinii thus enhancing the effect of the analogue on AdoMet utilizing enzymes. Because mammalian cells do not actively transport AdoMet, the chances of developing a compound with high specificity of P. cariniiare good. Analogues of AdoMet have already been synthesized and considered as pharmaceutical leads for other infectious agents (28.Goldberg B. Rattendi D. Lloyd D. Sufrin J.R. Bacchi C.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); a compound useful as an anti-P. carinii agent may be among these. Pneumocystis carinii is a fungus that causes P. carinii pneumonia (PCP)1in people with AIDS, patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy, and others with conditions causing severe immunosuppression. Although the frequency of PCP in HIV-infected persons has decreased dramatically over the last 8 years, due first to widespread prophylaxis against PCP and more recently to the reduced immunosuppression brought on by improved anti-HIV therapy, PCP remains common in AIDS patients. Treatment for PCP is less than ideal with frequent severe side effects from the two most effective drugs, pentamidine and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole, TMP-SMZ) (1.Wilkin A. Feinberg J. Am. Fam. Physician. 1999; 60 (1713–1714): 1699-1708PubMed Google Scholar). The mortality rate also remains high (21.5%) (2.Azoulay E. Parrot A. Flahault A. Cesari D. Lecomte I. Roux P. Saidi F. Fartoukh M. Bernaudin J.F. Cadranel J. Mayaud C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Beyond the importance ofP. carinii as a pathogen, it is also an unusual and interesting fungus for which most basic metabolic processes are unknown. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) plays a pivotal role in the physiology of all cells, both as methyl donor in myriad of biological and biochemical events and as a precursor of polyamines. About 95% of AdoMet is used for transmethylation reactions in which the N-methyl group of the methionine moiety is transferred to large molecules such as proteins, complex lipids, and DNA or to small molecules to form lecithin, regenerate methionine, etc. (3.Cohen S. A Guide to Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). The remaining 2–5% of AdoMet is decarboxylated to become the aminopropyl donor for synthesis of the essential polyamines spermidine and spermine (4.Newman E.B. Budman L.I. Chan E.C. Greene R.C. Lin R.T. Woldringh C.L. D'Ari R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3614-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transmethylation reactions result in the formation ofS-adenosylhomocysteine which is then hydrolyzed byS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase to form adenosine and homocysteine. Decarboxylation of AdoMet is catalyzed byS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase producing decarboxylated AdoMet, an intermediate committed to polyamine biosynthesis. Decarboxylated AdoMet donates an aminopropyl group to putrescine to form spermidine or to spermidine to form spermine. The end product of the aminopropyl transfer reactions is methylthioadenosine which is cleaved by a specific phosphorylase, the products being recycled in various ways to methionine and purines, respectively. A comprehensive review of polyamine metabolism and function has been published (3.Cohen S. A Guide to Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). AdoMet is synthesized by AdoMet synthetase which transfers the adenosyl group of ATP to methionine with the residual triphosphate being hydrolyzed to Pi and PPi by the polyphosphatase activity of AdoMet synthetase. To our knowledge, with the exception of mutants, no cell has previously been reported to lack this enzyme and AdoMet has not been known to be an essential nutrient. That AdoMet is an essential metabolite is shown by a mutant of Escherichia coli with very low AdoMet synthetase activity resulting in a cell division defect (4.Newman E.B. Budman L.I. Chan E.C. Greene R.C. Lin R.T. Woldringh C.L. D'Ari R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3614-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by knockout of this enzyme inSaccharomyces cerevisiae which is lethal but death can be prevented by exogenous AdoMet (5.Cherest H. Sudin-Kerjan Y. Exinger F. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 163: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the universal activity of AdoMet synthetase, exogenous AdoMet can have an effect on wild type cells. For example, added AdoMet can stimulate budding and outgrowth as well as RNA and protein synthesis in S. cerevisiae (6.Brawley J.V. Ferro A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 608-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another example is patients recovering from liver cirrhosis which results in low AdoMet synthetase activity; these patients are benefited by supplementing their diet with AdoMet (7.Duce A.M. Ortiz P. Cabrero C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8.Pisi E. Marchesini G. Drugs. 1990; 40: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since AdoMet has been reported to enhance growth of another fungus (6.Brawley J.V. Ferro A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 608-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we added AdoMet to the medium we used to develop an axenic culture for P. carinii. This caused a qualitative and quantitative improvement inP. carinii culture including the production of cysts. Because of the positive effect of AdoMet on axenic culture of P. carinii culture and because analogues of AdoMet have been explored as pharmaceutical leads, we examined P. carinii for the possibility of an AdoMet requirement, for the ability to transport of AdoMet, for the rate of use of AdoMet and for the capacity to synthesize this essential intermediate. We found that P. carinii has a transport system for AdoMet which seems completely AdoMet-specific. We also found that P. carinii is an AdoMet auxotroph, a condition not previously reported for any cell. DISCUSSIONAdoMet is an essential intermediate in the physiology of the cell, both for synthesis of polyamines and as a methyl donor for nearly all methylation reactions (3.Cohen S. A Guide to Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). To our knowledge, all cells investigated previously were found able to synthesize this intermediate from ATP and methionine using the enzyme AdoMet synthetase; AdoMet has never been described as an essential nutrient. To understand the reason underlying our previous observation that adding AdoMet to culture medium qualitatively promotes P. carinii growth (9.Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and to expand our general investigation of P. carinii polyamine metabolism (10.Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21017-21022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20.Chin K. Merali S. Saric M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we examined P. carinii both for the ability to utilize exogenous AdoMet and to synthesize this compoundde novo. The results indicate that P. carinii has an absolute need for AdoMet and to date is the only cell known to be a natural AdoMet auxotroph.The data reported here demonstrate the degree to which AdoMet both maintains and increases P. carinii growth in vitro. It is interesting to note that in the cultures with whole horse serum but without AdoMet, the initial growth followed by a slow decline is reminiscent of the growth in culture systems described prior to our recently published axenic system (9.Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Previous culture systems (22.Sloand E. Laughon B. Armstrong M. Bartlett M.S. Blumenfeld W. Cushion M. Kalica A. Kovacs J.A. Martin W. Pitt E. Pesanti E.D. Richards F. Rose R. Walzcr P. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1993; 40: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) utilized a mammalian feeder cell and very likely these cells provide a significant but limited amount of AdoMet. A similar role is played by the high concentration of AdoMet in horse serum relative to the more frequently used fetal calf serum. One could speculate that addition of AdoMet to a culture system using mammalian cells would allow continuous passage to fresh feeder cells. We were able to confirm AdoMet utilization by showing that P. carinii causes depletion of this metabolite from the growth medium and this is nicely supported by the in vivo data showing that P. carinii infection causes rat plasma to become depleted of AdoMet. Although our initial culture medium contained 500 μmAdoMet and this concentration was used for the studies reported here, we have found that 50 μm AdoMet is adequate to support growth. Starting at 50 μm, the spontaneous rate of AdoMet degradation in the medium predicts a decline to 14 μm or 5.6 μg ml−1 of medium at 12 h, somewhat less than reported AdoMet concentration in rat lungs, 11.1 μg g−1of tissue (23.Baldessarini R.J. Kopin I.J. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One could speculate that the now popular use of AdoMet as a nutritional supplement could result in increased vulnerability to infection with P. carinii but there is no direct data to support this.Kinetics of AdoMet uptake indicate the presence of a transporter and the effect of metabolic inhibitors indicate that transport is an active, energy-requiring process. One of the most interesting kinetic findings was with natural compounds related to AdoMet none of which competed with AdoMet for transport. These compounds include:l-methionine and ATP (the components of AdoMet), hypoxanthine (a purine frequently scavenged by cells), adenine (the purine moiety of AdoMet), S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoMet missing the S-methyl group), decarboxylated AdoMet (AdoMet missing the carboxyl group of methionine), methylthioadenosine (AdoMet after decarboxylation and donation of a propyl group), andS-adenosylethionine (an analogue with theS-methyl group substituted by an S-ethyl group). Therefore, it seems that the transporter recognizes neither any component of AdoMet nor any physiologically modified AdoMet suggesting that this transporter may recognize AdoMet alone. AdoMet transport byS. cerevisiae is similar to P. carinii in being facilitated by a high affinity transporter which is pH and energy dependent with a similar K m (3.3 μm) (24.Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this S. cerevisiae transporter is not strictly AdoMet specific since both S-adenosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylethionine can compete with AdoMet although adenosine, methionine, and homocysteine do not (24.Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study (18.Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28096-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported an additional transport system in S. cerevisiae as well as cloning the originally described transporter. The originally described transporter is coded by the SAM3 gene and shows homology to the family of amino acid transporters. The newly described transporter is of low affinity (K m = 160 μm), operates by facilitated diffusion and is not able to supply the needs of the cell fully, even at high concentrations of AdoMet. We also detected a second transport system in P. carinii but with a K m = 330 μm it cannot be physiologically significant. It seems likely that the low affinity transporter activity is due to an entirely different transporter that will recognize AdoMet when it is at very high, non-physiological concentrations. The AdoMet transporter of African trypanosomes is as specific for AdoMet as the P. cariniitransporter, although it operates by facilitated diffusion rather than active transport (25.Goldberg B. Yarlett N. Sufrin J. Lloyd D. Bacchi C.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells AdoMet penetrates poorly and extracellular AdoMet is mainly utilized to methylate phospholipids on the surface of plasma membrane (26.Bontemps F. Van Den Berghe G. Biochem.

This recoding event is directed by a selenocysteine insertion sequence in the 3′-untranslated region. Because UGA also functions as a signal for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, we have investigated how the rates of translational termination and selenocysteine incorporation relate to cis-acting elements in the mRNA as well as to trans-acting factors in the cytoplasm. We used cis-elements from the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase gene as the basis for this work because of its relatively high efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation. The last two codons preceding the UGA were found to exert a far greater influence on selenocysteine incorporation than nucleotides downstream of it. The efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation was generally much less than 100% but could be partially enhanced by concomitant overexpression of the tRNASec gene. The combination of two or three UGA codons in one reading frame led to a dramatic reduction in the yield of full-length protein. It is therefore unlikely that multiple incorporations of selenocysteine are processive with respect to the mode of action of the ribosomal complex binding to the UGA site.

Banu L. Chen Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar),1 and is capable of acting at distances greater than 5000 nucleotides (7.Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen PR. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8.Buettner C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33374-33378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This element has been called the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS). The highly conserved sequences in the SECIS element are: AAA in or near the apical loop, GA on the 3′ side of the stem, and AUGA on the 5′ side of the stem. A particular focus of attention has recently been the sequence region including the GA and AUGA elements, which is thought to form a non-Watson-Crick base paired duplex structure (9.Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1996; 2: 367-379PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. RNA. 1998; 4: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). The recoding of UGA depends on a number of specifictrans-acting components. In bacteria, a special type of seryl-tRNA (tRNASec; SelC) decodes the opal codon as selenocysteine with the assistance of a dedicated EF-Tu-like factor called SelB (1.Böck A. Forchhammer K.

The synthesis of selenocysteyl-tRNASec from seryl-tRNASecrequires three further proteins (SelA, SelC, and SelD; Refs. 13.Forchhammer K. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6324-6328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Leinfelder W. Stadtman T.C. Böck A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 206: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The greatest stumbling block to elucidating the mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes has been uncertainty as to the nature of the eukaryotic equivalent(s) to SelB. There have been reports of at least four different SECIS-binding proteins (16.Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newberger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17.Shen Q. Wu R. Leonard J.L. Newberger P.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). So far, a 120-kDa protein seems to be the most likely candidate for binding specifically to SECIS elements (20.Copeland P.R. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but further work will be needed to determine the other binding partners of this factor and its role in the selenocysteine incorporation process. Most importantly, there is evidence that the 120-kDa protein forms a complex with other proteins, which may mean that the identified SECIS-binding factor is only part of a multicomponent machinery. One potential component of such a complex could be the selenocysteyl-tRNASec-protecting factor described by Yamada and colleagues (21.Yamada K. Mizutani T. Ejiri S. Totsuka T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An important unresolved question is to what extent the synthesis of polypeptide chains beyond an internal UGA codon by virtue of selenocysteine incorporation may be substoichiometric. This would explain why the substitution of a cysteine codon (UGU or UGC) at the site of a UGA results in greatly enhanced levels of polypeptide synthesis (22.Berry M.J. Maia A.L. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1848-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23.Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At the same time, it is essential to consider the implications of UGA recoding for the termination process on the ribosome. It has been suggested that unless the distance between the UGA and the SECIS element is suboptimal, termination will be suppressed (3.Low C.C. Berry M.J. Trends Bichem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, there has been no systematic study to date of the relationship between translation termination and selenocysteine incorporation. In the present work we examine the properties of the UGA site that can influence both the efficiency with which selenocysteine is incorporated and the rate of polypeptide chain termination. There is a further aspect of selenoprotein synthesis that has previously remained unexplained. Genes such as those encoding selenoprotein P (25.Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10050-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (8.Buettner C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33374-33378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) contain multiple UGA codons. This raises the question as to how selenocysteine can be repeatedly inserted at up to 10 positions within the same polypeptide. In the following work, we examine whether processivity is likely to be the molecular basis for this phenomenon. All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols (26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.21-1.105Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides used in plasmid constructions are listed in TableI. To construct the master plasmids pH8A and pH9A, the oligonucleotide pair (PHGPXL-A and PHGPXSL-B) containing the in-frame TGA codon of the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase gene (nucleotides 165–255) of S. scrofa(GenBankTM accession number X76009) was subcloned between the BamHI and SalI sites of the plasmids pBLUGA and pBPHGPx3U (23.Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PBPHGPx3U contains the PHGPx SECIS element in its 3′-UTR. To mutate the TGA codon to TGC, PCR was carried out using the primers PHGP-Xho and PHGP-Bam, and the resulting PCR fragment was inserted between the SalI and BamHI sites of the plasmids pBLUGA and pBPHGPx3U. The resulting plasmids were designated pH8B and pH9B. To mutate the fourth base G to A, C, and T, several PCRs were carried out using the forward primers PHGP-A, PHGP-C, and PHGP-T combined with PHGP-Bam as a reverse primer, respectively. The resulting PCR fragments were inserted between the SalI andBamHI sites of the plasmids pBPLUGA and pBPHGPx3U. The resulting plasmids were designated pT11–pT16. The nature of the fourth base and the presence or absence of the PHGPx SECIS element are indicated in Table II.Table IOligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this work 1.

To mutate the penultimate codons positioned at −1 and −2 relative to the TGA codon, the oligonucleotide pair (PHGPXL-A and PHGPXL-B) was digested with SalI and then subcloned between theBamHI and SalI sites of the plasmid pBPHGPx3U, generating pT5. An oligonucleotide pair (PHGP-1–2 A/B) harboring a region of the PHGPx gene (the amino acids serine and glutamine at positions 44 and 45 were changed to aspartic acid and arginine, respectively) was subcloned in the SalI site of the plasmid pT5. To destabilize the predicted stem-loop located downstream of the TGA codon, an oligonucleotide pair (PHGP-LOA and PHGP-LOB) containing mutations in the stem-loop was subcloned into the SalI site of the plasmid pT5. To investigate selenocysteine incorporation at multiple sites, additional in-frame TGA codons were inserted in thelacZ::luc reporter system. The oligonucleotide pairs SelP1X-A/B, SelP2X-A/B, SelP12X-A/B, and SelP12C-A/B containing the selenoprotein P gene of H. sapiens(GenBankTM accession number Z11793, amino acids 300–318; the in-frame TGA codons are located at positions 300 and 318) were subcloned in the BamHI site of the plasmids pH8A, pH8B, pH9A, and pH9B. The oligonucleotide pairs contain TGA and TGC codons in various combinations so that the constructs contain one, two, or three TGA (or TGC) codons. The resulting plasmids were designated pT18–pT33.

The Xenopus release factor genes were supplied already cloned in the expression plasmids pCYM1–11/XSUP35 (29.Zhouravleva G. Frolova L. Le Goff X. Le Guellec R. Inge-Vechtomov S. Kissilev L.

BHK-21 cells (baby hamster kidney cells; ATCC CC110) were cultivated as described elsewhere (24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were measured according to the protocol described previously (24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Selenium supplementation, where used, was achieved by adding Na2Se2O3 to give a final concentration of 5 μg l−1. Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcriptase-PCR were performed using TRIzol® reagent and SuperscriptTM (Life Technologies), respectively, following the manufacturer's protocols. PCR was performed using primers against the lacZ::lucmRNA and against actin mRNA (as a reference) for 22, 26, 32, and 36 cycles. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the protocol described by Laemmli (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using a semi-dry method (32.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) using cell extracts prepared according to an earlier protocoll (24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The reporter system used in this work is based on the genes encoding β-galactosidase and luciferase, which are fused in-frame via a selenoprotein gene sequence including TGA stop codon(s) (24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Upon transfection of the respective plasmids into BHK-21 cell lines, the DNA is transcribed under control of the SV40 promoter, and translation leads to the synthesis of reporter enzymes. Translation terminates at the internal in-frame UGA stop codon, which leads to the synthesis of β-galactosidase enzyme. The presence of a SECIS element in the 3′-UTR suppresses the UGA stop codon by directing recoding for selenocysteine, which leads to the production of the β-galactosidase-luciferase fusion protein. Calculation of either termination or suppression efficiency is based on the parallel transfection of a plasmid which contains TGC (cysteine) instead of TGA. The ratio of enzymatic activities of the cells transfected with this plasmid was taken as the reference value (set at 100%). In the investigation of the influence of the +4 position on selenocysteine incorporation, the value obtained with G was taken as the 100% reference value. The first stage of our investigation of the factors influencing selenocysteine incorporation efficiency in mammalian selenoproteins focused on the role of the immediate environment of the UGA site. It was our intention to obtain information about the possible upper limits of incorporation efficiency. We therefore chose the pig heart phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx; Ref. 33.Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.-D. Blöcker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Klöppel K.-D. Maiorino M. Rovri A. Schuckelt R. Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) gene as a starting point, because previous work had shown that the SECIS of this gene supported a higher incorporation efficiency than the other SECIS elements tested (24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We used a fusion reporter system (Ref. 24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and Fig.1) to study the influence of the UGA environment. In using this system, we compare the suppression of termination at the central UGA in the presence and in the absence of the SECIS element. In this way, we can determine the recoding that is strictly related to a SECIS-dependent pathway, which reflects selenocysteine incorporation. The reporter gene system is expressed from the SV40 promoter in vivo after transfection of mammalian cells. Translation can either terminate at the C terminus of lacZ or, upon suppression of the nonsense function of the UGA codon, continue through the linker sequence to generate a fusion protein of β-galactosidase and luciferase (Fig. 1). Because we found that supplementation of the culture medium with Na2SeO3 had no effect on the results obtained with this reporter system (data not shown), all the experiments described in this paper were performed in the absence of a selenium supplement. We examined whether the activity of the PHGPx UGA, like its counterpart in the type 1 deiodinase gene (34.McCaughan K.K. Brown C.M. Dalphin M.E. Berry M.J. Tate W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5431-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), is sensitive to the downstream context. The results confirmed that SECIS-dependent incorporation is increased when the fourth base is a pyrimidine (Fig.2 B). This effect is therefore common to different UGA contexts and SECIS elements. We wished to compare this result with the effects of changes in other features of the UGA context that have not previously been investigated. The first of these is the potential influence of mRNA structure downstream of the UGA. For example, a predicted stem-loop structure could potentially be formed 9 nucleotides downstream of the UGA in the PHGPx gene (Fig.2 C). It is known that downstream structure plays a key role in the selenocysteine incorporation process in E. coli (5.Heider J. Baron C. Böck A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Could it also at least modulate the efficiency of eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation, perhaps by virtue of its ability to cause ribosomes to pause longer at the UGA? We investigated whether mutating the putative stem-loop to destabilize it would affect selenocysteine incorporation (Fig. 2 C). Any effect is evidently marginal, thus indicating that downstream secondary structure is unlikely to be involved in eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation. We conclude that the nature of the nucleotide at the +4 position relative to the UGA is likely to be the most relevant feature of the downstream region in terms of determination of the rate of selenocysteine incorporation. In stark contrast to this latter result, we found that changes in the codons immediately upstream of the UGA can markedly affect selenocysteine incorporation efficiency (Fig.3). We replaced the penultimate and final amino acid encoding triplets preceding the UGA in PHGPx with two codons that belong to a group of termination-promoting codons (Fig.3 A and Ref. 35.Bjornsson A. Mottagui-Tabar S. Isaksson L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The impact on selenocysteine incorporation was dramatic. We also observed that the combination of amino acids substituted in these experiments is avoided in all of the known UGA gene contexts found in selenoprotein genes (Fig. 3 B). We conclude from this result that the selenocysteine incorporation rate of the PHGPx UGA is not normally restricted by the presence of 5′ neighbor codons that promote strong termination. Indeed, overall we were not able to identify any cis-acting elements within the open reading frame that could markedly improve selenocysteine incorporation efficiency at the PHGPx UGA. We investigated whether the use of a reporter system introduced by transient transfection might lead to partial saturation of the selenocysteine incorporation machinery, thus potentially restricting the maximum attainable efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation. The results of earlier studies were not conclusive. One group found that co-transfection of tRNASec (SelC) enhances selenocysteine incorporation in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney cells (23.Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas another group observed no increase in the synthesis of selenoproteins as a consequence of tRNASec overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary cells (36.Moustafa M.E. El-Saadan M.A. Kandeel K.M. Mansur D.E. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Diamond A.M. RNA. 1998; 4: 1436-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To address this question in our reporter system, we examined whether the co-transfection of a SelC expression construct would affect the incorporation efficiencies. We found that the incorporation efficiency at UGAG or UGAC was increased by up to approximately 2-fold (Fig. 4). In further experiments, we co-transfected both SelC and SelD. The addition of the latter gene did not enhance the incorporation efficiency any further. In fact, the co-transfection of both SelC and SelD yielded a somewhat smaller enhancement in the incorporation efficiency. Overall, therefore, some increase in selenocysteine incorporation efficiency was supported by an enlargement in the size of the cellular tRNASec pool. There is some ambiguity about the dual role of internal UGA codons in selenoprotein genes, in that estimates of the efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation have varied from a few percent of the polypeptide chains reaching the UGA being extended (23.Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Ohama T. Hatfield D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to the suggestion that this process fully suppresses termination (3.Low C.C. Berry M.J. Trends Bichem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Generally, the absolute efficiencies of selenocysteine incorporation in the known selenoproteins remain unknown quantities. Clearly, if termination and selenocysteine incorporation can both take place at the same UGA, these two processes may effectively proceed competitively. One possible way of testing this model is to examine whether increasing the levels of the translation release factors leads to suppression of selenocysteine incorporation. To perform this experiment, we co-transfected individual reporter constructs together with expression constructs bearing the genes encoding eRF1 and eRF3 (29.Zhouravleva G. Frolova L. Le Goff X. Le Guellec R. Inge-Vechtomov S. Kissilev L. Philippe M EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 30.Tassan J.P. Le Guellec K. Kress M. Faure M. Camonis J. Jacquet M. Philippe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Comparison with the control construct pBLUGA revealed that there was little specific repression of selenocysteine incorporation associated with the overproduction of the eRFs (Fig. 4 C). Further insight into the mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation can be obtained by studying how the system deals with open reading frames containing more than one UGA. Three sites were used for the insertion of either UGA or UGC (encoding cysteine; Fig. 5 A). One of these was the original PHGPx site used in the earlier experiments (Fig. 2 A), although the other two were excised from the SelP gene (nucleotides 934–990) and fused on to the 3′ end of the PHGPx gene segment. It was observed that the incorporation level differed for the respective sites used in this experiment (I00, 0I0, and 00I, Fig. 5 B). The results described earlier in this paper indicate that this variation can be explained at least partially in terms of differences in the environment of each UGA. For example, the distinct identities of the final codon pairs immediately 5′ of each UGA may contribute to the differences in incorporation efficiency. This phenomenon was not investigated further because it is not of immediate relevance to the main objective of the multiple UGA experiments. More strikingly, combining the individual UGAs in different permutations in a single reading frame resulted in very marked reductions in SECIS-dependent suppression of termination (Fig. 5 B). The combination of UGAs at all three sites resulted in particularly low yields of luciferase activity. This effect was also evident in the amounts of β- galactosidase::luciferase protein detectable in cell extracts by means of Western blotting (Fig. 5 C). The sharp reduction in the abundance of the full-length protein upon the introduction of more than one UGA into the reporter system is clearly apparent. Two further types of result indicate that this is due to alterations in the overall efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation rather than changes in the fate of the mRNA. First, we found that the levels of β-galactosidase encoded by these constructs were not reduced in response to the introduction of additional UGA codons (data not shown). Had there been general destabilization of the fusion mRNAs, we would have expected an associated loss of measurable β-galactosidase activity. Second, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments also indicated that these changes were not attributable to variations in the abundance of the mRNAs encoded by the respective constructs (data not shown). Differences in the abundance of the encoded mRNAs were estimated to be no greater than 2-fold with respect to the non-UGA-carrying control. One potential role of SECIS elements, at least theoretically, could be to suppress translation termination directly. However, the Western blotting data (for example see Fig. 5 C) clearly showed that the yield of fusion protein was greatly reduced when multiple UGAs were present in the reporter mRNA. Given that expression through thelacZ domain was maintained (see above), this indicates that the primary non-SECIS-dependent event at the UGA codons was termination, as opposed to amino acid misincorporation. We have investigated a range of parameters that could influence the efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation at single or multiple sites in selenoprotein genes. A number of factors are capable of attenuating the incorporation rate, but not sufficiently to suggest that the normal cellular level of selenocysteine incorporation is equivalent to 100% efficiency. Indeed, the data reported here, combined with the fact that there is considerable variation in the efficiencies supported by different SECIS elements (3.Low C.C. Berry M.J. Trends Bichem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), indicate that termination occurs in parallel with selenocysteine incorporation at the UGA sites in selenoprotein mRNAs. There may be considerable variation in the relative rates of termination and selenocysteine incorporation at different UGA codons. It is striking that using the natural sequence contexts from selenoprotein genes in the expression constructs described here, we have obtained higher absolute levels of selenocysteine incorporation compared with the results obtained previously using short, self-designed UGA-containing sequences (24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the incorporation efficiencies obtained with transfected cells may not be representative of the maximum attainable values. Indeed, the incorporation efficiencies for natural genomic selenoprotein genes may be higher. An alternative model for the mode of action of the SECIS element is that it not only promotes selenocysteine incorporation but also directly suppresses translation termination at UGA codons. However, unless there was a large increase in the mistranslation rate at the UGA site, any suppression on termination rate would have to feed back on the overall rate of protein synthesis. Because neither of these phenomena were observed (Fig. 5), we conclude that this model does not provide an adequate explanation of the results. The competitive relationship between termination and selenocysteine incorporation can be modulated by a number of manipulations in the sequence region containing the UGA. Most strikingly, changes in the penultimate codons that precede the UGA can have a dramatic effect on the ability of the system to incorporate selenocysteine. However, we have found that termination-promoting codons, and thus the encoded amino acids, are evidently avoided among selenoprotein genes. The othercis-acting elements in the neighborhood of the UGA, the fourth nucleotide and downstream sequence and/or structure, exert a comparatively minor influence on selenocysteine incorporation. The observation that increased levels of eRFs have only a minimal observable effect on selenocysteine incorporation is not necessarily inconsistent with the existence of a competitive relationship with termination, because these factors may be close to effective saturation with respect to UGA-directed termination. The consequences of the competition between termination and selenocysteine incorporation in terms of mRNA stability are difficult to predict. In principle, premature translational termination on an aberrant eukaryotic mRNA can trigger the so-called nonsense-dependent mRNA decay pathway (37.Maquat L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar). However, selenoprotein mRNAs may constitute a special case, given that the internal stop codon fulfils a key function in the nonaberrant mRNA. So far, it has been found that the stability of glutathione peroxidase 1 mRNA decreases significantly under conditions of selenium limitation, whereas the destabilizing effect of ongoing termination under nonselenium-limited conditions seems to be small (38.Bermano G. Arthur J.R. Hesketh J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39.Moriarty P.M. Reddy C.C. Maquat L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, even under selenium depletion conditions, neither PHGPx mRNA nor gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase mRNA is destabilized by UGA-directed termination (38.Bermano G. Arthur J.R. Hesketh J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40.Wingler K. Böcher M. Flohé L. Kollmus H. Brigelius-Flohé R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our finding that the stability of the reporter mRNA used in this work is not markedly affected by changes in the efficiency or position of UGA-dependent termination is therefore consistent with the currently available data about the decay behavior of selenoprotein mRNAs. We have established that termination and selenocysteine incorporation can occur at varying ratios at the same UGA. How does this affect the course of translation on selenoprotein mRNAs that have multiple internal UGAs? If substoichiometric incorporation occurs at a series of UGAs, the cumulative terminations at the successive sites would result in a significantly reduced yield of full-length selenoprotein. If the incorporation events are entirely independent, this yield would be equivalent to the multiplicative sum of the efficiencies at the individual UGAs. The loss of complete product could theoretically be limited if the incorporation process was processive, because this would mean that once a selenocysteine-incorporating ribosome complex had been established at the first UGA in the gene sequence, subsequent UGAs would all be recoded as selenocysteine. However, our results are not consistent with the operation of a processive mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation. Even if the efficiencies seen here are not the maximum attainable, this can only have exacerbated (but not generated) the observed result that the combination of two or more UGAs gives rise to additional suppression of the number of polypeptide chains that completes the open reading frame via (multiple) selenocysteine incorporation events. This phenomenon is therefore not attributable to a nonphysiological effect associated with partial saturation of the selenocysteine incorporation machinery and will apply to systems in which the absolute incorporation efficiency per site is greater than that estimated here. Processivity apparently does not provide the key to ensuring that multiple selenocysteine incorporation events occur successfully. The model that emerges from this envisages that termination can occur at any of the internal UGAs and that the interaction of the selenocysteine incorporation machinery with the translating ribosome at one UGA does not lead to enforced incorporation at other UGAs (Fig. 6). This may mean that there can be both assembly and disassembly of the selenocysteine incorporation apparatus on/from the ribosome each time a UGA is recoded. The major distinction to a processive mechanism is that the interaction of the selenocysteine incorporation components with the ribosome does not preprogram its subsequent behavior in a way that commits it to multiple selenocysteine incorporation events. We have previously discussed the possibility that processivity might provide a mechanistic explanation for the generation of a selenoprotein such as SelP in adequate amounts (24.Kollmus H. Flohé L. McCarthy J.E.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the current results indicate that the efficiency of selenocysteine incorporation at individual UGA sites is normally high enough to allow an adequate yield of complete SelP protein molecules in the absence of full processivity. At the same time, the proportion of prematurely terminated polypeptide chains generated from an mRNA bearing multiple UGA codons must be high. Given that genes such as SelP are likely to be rare, the resulting energetic wastage is presumably of little consequence in terms of the overall energetics of the cell. Finally, suboptimal efficiencies of selenocysteine incorporation are not exclusive to eukaryotic systems, because the maximum efficiency of UGA decoding by SelB-GTP-Sec-tRNASec achieved in E. coli so far is estimated to be 7% (41.Suppmann S. Persson B.C. Böck A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is tempting to rationalize such efficiencies purely in terms of the relative absolute abundance of the respective cellular components of the selenocysteine incorporation machineries in the two types of cell. However, as with other cellular systems, it is unlikely that a full understanding of rate control in the selenocysteine incorporation machinery can be achieved until more is known about the supramolecular organization of protein synthesis (41.Suppmann S. Persson B.C. Böck A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42.Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The signal transduction pathway(s) activated by IL-1β that regulate PDGF-Rα expression are not well understood. Our previous studies have shown that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK-1 and -2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) do not mediate IL-1β-induced up-regulation of PDGF-Rα mRNA or protein (37.Lindroos P.M. Rice A.B. Wang Y.Z. Bonner J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3464-3468PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of p38 MAP kinase in IL-1β-induced up-regulation of the PDGF-Rα. We report that p38 MAP kinase activation following IL-1β treatment results in the stabilization of PDGF-Rα mRNA and this requiresde novo protein synthesis. These findings indicate that p38 MAP kinase regulates PDGF-Rα expression at the translational level via synthesis of an mRNA-stabilizing protein.

The membranes were incubated with primary p38 MAP kinase and PDGF-R antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Anti-phospho-p38 antibody (New England BioLab) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Rabbit anti-mouse PDGF-Rα and rabbit anti-human PDGF-Rβ antibodies (Upstate Biotechnologies) were used at a 1:500 dilution. The membranes were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween prior to a 90-min incubation with a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dakopatts, Carpenteria, CA). After thoroughly washing in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween, the horseradish peroxidase-labeled proteins were visualized with an ECLTM kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phospho-p38 MAP kinase blots were subsequently stripped at 50 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptomethonal and re-blotted with an antibody that detects total (activated and unactivated) p38 MAP kinase (New England BioLabs). Confluent, quiescent cells were treated with the agent of interest and cell lysates collected as described above for “Western blotting” were immunoprecipited with total p38 MAP kinase antibody (Santa Cruz). Kinase activity was measured using a p38 MAP kinase Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the immune complex was resuspended in Stratagene reaction buffer containing 120 μg of PHAS-1 substrate along with 3-μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 190 μl. Kinase reactions took place for 30 min at room temperature and were stopped by adding 4 × SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. The reaction samples were resolved on 10 to 20% PAGE gels, dried, and autoradiographed. A similar procedure was used to assay JNK and ERK kinase activities, using c-Jun and PHAS-1 as substrates, respectively. For determination of the effect of SB203580 on the activity of p38 MAP kinase, MAPKAP kinase 2 activity in rat lung myofibroblasts was measured by a MAPKAP kinase-2 immunoprecipitation assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnologies). Briefly, confluent cells were rendered quiescent for 24 h in SFDM and then incubated with or without 50 μm SB203580 for 1 h prior to stimulation with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 2 h. Cells were placed on ice and lysates scraped off the dish with 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation to pellet cellular debris, then incubated with 2 μg of sheep anti-MAPKAP kinase 2 antibody adsorbed to protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 100 μm substrate peptide KKLNRTLSVA, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and blotted onto p81 phosphocellulose paper. The papers were washed twice the 0.75% phosphoric acid, one with acetone and radioactivity measured on a liquid scintillation counter. Cells were grown to confluence with 10% FBS/DMEM in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 cm2 wells) and then rendered quiescent for 24 h with SFDM containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were pretreated with fresh 0.5% FBS/SFDM containing SB203580 in Me2SO or Me2SO alone (vehicle control) for 1 h at 37 °C, then PDGF-AA (1 to 50 ng/ml) was spiked into the medium along with 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 36 h. The cells were washed with Ham's F-12 at 25 °C, placed on ice, and incubated with 0.5 ml/well 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min. After washing 3 times with ice-cold distilled water, solubilization was performed with 0.5 ml/well in 0.2 n NaOH containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min on an oscillating platform. 100 μl of each sample was added to 1 ml of EcolumeTM (Costa Mesa, CA) and radioactivity measured on a liquid scintillation counter. Confluent, quiescent myofibroblasts were treated with the agent of interest and total RNA was isolated with TRITM reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Twenty μg of each sample was electrophoresed in 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and capillary transferred onto BrightStar-PlusTM positively charged nylon membranes (Ambion Inc, Austin, TX). A rat cDNA probe for the PDGF-Rα (gift from Dr. Yutaka Kitami, Ehime University, Japan) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a DECAprime IITM DNA labeling kit (Ambion). The hybridization and washing procedure for blotting was performed with Northern Max-Plus Kit according to the supplied protocol (Ambion). The autoradiographic signal was visualized by exposing the film at −70 °C for the appropriate time. Myofibroblasts in 24-well plates were grown to confluence in 10% FBS/DMEM and then rendered quiescent for 24 h in SFDM consisting of Ham's F-12 with HEPES, CaCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin supplemented with an insulin/transferrin/selenium mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then treated with an agent of interest for 24 h. Cultures were chilled to 4 °C, rinsed in cold binding buffer (Ham's F-12 with HEPES, CaCl2, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin), and exposed to 2 ng/ml 125I-PDGF-AA for 3–4 h at 4 °C on an oscillating platform in the absence or presence of 500 ng/ml nonradioactive PDGF-AA to measure total and nonspecific binding, respectively. For saturation binding analysis, cells were incubated with 0.5 to 20 ng/ml 125I-PDGF-AA in the absence or presence of 500 ng/ml PDGF-AA. Cells were then rinsed 3 times in ice-cold binding buffer, solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 m NaOH, and cell associated radioactivity measured with a γ-counter. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. Saturation binding data were subjected to Scatchard analysis to obtain dissociation constants (K d) and maximum number of binding sites (B max) (38.Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17789) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance and two-sample t tests. A pvalue of <0.05 was considered to be significant. Treatment of cells with IL-1β-activated p38 MAP kinase within 30 min as detected by Western blotting for the phosphorylated form of p38 (Fig.1 A). Western blotting for total p38 protein demonstrated that the amount of unactivated p38 did not significantly change during the course of the experiment. Northern blot analysis showed up-regulation of PDGF-Rα mRNA within 2 h following IL-1β treatment, which continued to increase by 24 h (Fig. 1 B). GAPDH mRNA was not significantly affected by IL-1β treatment during the course of the experiment. Densitometric evaluation of p38 MAP kinase activation and PDGF-Rα mRNA induction demonstrated that phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase peaked prior to an increase in PDGF-Rα mRNA (Fig. 1 C). A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB203580, was used to inhibit activation of p38 MAP kinase in cells stimulated with IL-1β. SB203580 does not inhibit the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, but instead inhibits the kinase activity of p38 for phosphorylating substrates (33.Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar). First, we utilized a kinase assay wherein cells were pretreated with SB203580 for 1 h prior to stimulation with IL-1β, then p38 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and assayed for its ability to phosphorylate the PHAS-1 substrate (39.Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). IL-1β strongly activated p38 kinase activity and SB203580 (50 μm) completely inhibited p38-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-1 (Fig.2, A and B). In addition, we used a MAPKAP kinase 2 assay to measure the inhibitory effect of SB203580, as MAPKAP kinase 2 is a downstream substrate of p38 MAP kinase (23.Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, IL-1β clearly induced MAPKAP kinase 2 activity, which was significantly inhibited by SB203580. Pretreatment of cells with SB203580 (50 μm) reduced the basal expression of PDGF-Rα mRNA and blocked IL-1β-induced up-regulation of PDGF-Rα mRNA by >70% (Fig. 3). IL-1β-induced up-regulation of PDGF-Rα protein was also prevented by pretreatment with SB203580 as determined by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the PDGF-Rα (Fig.4). In these Western blotting experiments, the level of PDGF-Rβ was not changed by IL-1β treatment or by treatment with SB203580 (Fig. 4). An125I-PDGF-AA binding assay was used to quantitate cell surface PDGF-Rα, since PDGF-AA binds selectively to PDGF-Rα and not PDGF-Rβ (1.Heldin C-H. Westermark B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 193-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SB203580 inhibited IL-1β-induced up-regulation of cell surface 125I-PDGF-AA binding to cultured cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50between 5 and 10 μm SB203580 (TableI). IL-1β up-regulated125I-PDGF-AA specific binding in a dose-dependent manner that was maximal at 1 ng/ml and pretreatment with 50 μm SB203580 inhibited IL-1β-stimulated up-regulation of 125I-PDGF-AA by >70% (Fig. 5 A). Scatchard analysis of 125I-PDGF-AA saturation binding data demonstrated that SB203580 prevented an increase in the number of binding sites without altering receptor affinity (Fig. 5 B). A variety of other kinase inhibitors, including those for MEK (PD98059), receptor tyrosine kinases (genistein), and protein kinase C (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) had no inhibitory effect on IL-1β-stimulated PDGF-Rα up-regulation (Table II).Figure 4SB203580 prevents IL-1β-induced up-regulation of PDGF-Rα protein as determined by Western blot analysis. Confluent, quiescent rat pulmonary myofibroblasts were pretreated for 1 h with 5 or 50 μm SB203580 or Me2SO vehicle alone, then stimulated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1β prior to collecting cell lysates for Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” using antibodies specific for either PDGF-Rα or PDGF-Rβ. Panel A, IL-1β pretreatment up-regulated PDGF-Rα protein 2–3-fold and SB203580 blocked the increase in PDGF-Rα levels by ∼50% at 5 μm or 100% at 50 μm. PDGF-Rβ was not affected by IL-1β or SB203580.

https://openalex.org/W2085474797,"Actin-activated MgATPase of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin is activated by thiophosphorylation of two regulatory light chains, one on each head domain. To understand cooperativity between heads, we examined the kinetics of heavy meromyosin (HMM) with one thiophosphorylated head.

By steady-state kinetic analysis, one-head thiophosphorylated heavy meromyosin had a similarK m value for actin but aV max value of ∼50% of the fully thiophosphorylated molecule. However, single turnover analysis, which is not sensitive to small amounts of active heads, showed that one-head thiophosphorylated heavy meromyosin was 46–120 times more active than unphosphorylated HMM but only 7–19% as active as the fully thiophosphorylated molecule. Discrepancy between the single turnover and steady-state values could be explained by a small fraction of rigor heads. These rigor heads would have a large effect on the steady-state kinetics of one-head thiophosphorylated HMM. In summary, thiophosphorylation of one head leads to a molecule with unique intermediate kinetics suggesting that thiophosphorylation of one head cooperatively alters the kinetics of the partner head and vice versa.

Academic Press Ltd., London1995: 1323-1423Google Scholar). The unphosphorylated forms of these regulated myosins have low ATPase activity and are unable to move actin filaments, whereas the phosphorylated forms are activated in both respects. Domain requirements for regulation have been elucidated through studies of various proteolytic and expressed subfragments of SMM.1 SMM contains two head domains (S1) attached to a long α-helical coiled-coil domain (tail). Single-headed myosin (4.Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and S1 (5.Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6.Seidel J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4355-4361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are active in both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states. HMM, which lacks the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the tail, is double-headed and well regulated (5.Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7.Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but expressed HMMs with shorter tails failed to form double-headed structures and were found to be unregulated (8.Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as in S1 and single-headed myosin. Therefore, two heads are critical for down-regulation, suggesting that head-head interaction is an important feature of the unphosphorylated state. It is interesting that in scallop HMM (regulated by Ca2+ binding), communication between the nucleotide- and calcium-binding sites requires the presence of two heads (10.Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15834-15840Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The general location of the phosphorylated subunit (RLC) at the junction between the heads and tail (11.Flicker P.F. Wallimann T. Vibert P. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 723-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12.Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) suggests that RLC-RLC interactions may be a logical consequence of head-head interactions. We have recently shown that certain residues of the RLC can be cross-linked to the RLC of the other head in smooth HMM but only in the unphosphorylated state (13.Wu X. Clack B. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These data strengthen the notion that there is a correlation between a structure where the RLC domains of the two heads are interacting and a down-regulated kinetic behavior. To explore further this structure-function issue, we asked what model best fits the kinetic behavior of the two heads when only one of the heads is phosphorylated. The answer to this question has physiological significance because it is likely that the total level of phosphorylation of myosin is well below 100% (14.Stull J.T. Bowman B.F. Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Hsu L.C. Kamm K.E. Kubota Y. Leachman S.A. Sweeney H.L. Tansey M.G. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 327: 107-126PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) during most of a smooth muscle contraction. This raises the possibility that the kinetic behavior of a one-head phosphorylated molecule will dominate muscle behavior. The question has been previously addressed with conflicting results. Studies on smooth muscle HMM generated by chymotryptic digestion of chicken gizzard myosin indicate that phosphorylation of both RLCs is required to activate the actin-activated ATPase (16.Ikebe M. Ogihara S. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17.Sellers J.R. Chock P.B. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14181-14188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies on the activation of SMM found that, for monomeric and filamentous myosin, both heads must be phosphorylated for activation (17.Sellers J.R. Chock P.B. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14181-14188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Persechini A. Hartshorne D.J. Science. 1981; 213: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas other studies reported a linear correlation between the extent of phosphorylation and ATPase activation of SMM filaments, suggesting independent activation of the heads (19.Chacko S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20.Wagner P.D. Vu N.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7778-7783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Harris D.E. Stromski C.J. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1995; 269: C1160-C1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independent activation by phosphorylation was also observed for nonmuscle thymus myosin II in both filamentous and monomeric states (22.Wagner P.D. Vu N.-D. George J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8084-8089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with smooth muscle tissue have reported independent activation (23.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Science. 1986; 232: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and cooperative activation of SMM, where phosphorylation of a small fraction of myosin light chains resulted in a maximum increase in the rate of nucleotide exchange (24.Vyas T.B. Mooers S.U. Narayan S.R. Witherell J.C. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C210-C219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studies mentioned above have approached the question by examining plots of ATPase activity versus percentage of RLC phosphorylation. However, the percent phosphorylation values from these studies give no direct information about the composition of the possible species present. In most cases, at phosphorylation values greater than 0 and less than 100%, three molecular species are present as follows: 1) both heads unphosphorylated, 2) one head phosphorylated and one head unphosphorylated, and 3) both heads phosphorylated. Because the relative amounts of these species are not determined, models that assume the kinetic behavior of the MLCK are required to assess the meaning of the plots of ATPase activity versuspercentage of RLC phosphorylation. Harris et al. (21.Harris D.E. Stromski C.J. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1995; 269: C1160-C1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) made progress toward solving this problem by partially purifying a mixture of SMM thiophosphorylated states. The interpretation of the above-mentioned plots also raises questions about the mechanism of the MLCK. Does the MLCK tend to phosphorylate the heads randomly? The mechanism of the MLCK may depend upon the environment of the myosin,i.e. soluble monomeric, filamentous, or in situconformations, during the phosphate transfer from MLCK to myosin. Here we describe our approach to circumvent these problems by generating a purified HMM that has one thiophosphorylated and one unphosphorylated head (HMM-1P). We chose to study HMM because it is a soluble, regulated fragment that is kinetically well characterized by previous work (5.Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We analyzed the kinetics of the one-head thiophosphorylated molecule by steady-state ATPase, single turnover of FTP, and in vitro motility assays. The single turnover data were the most informative and showed that the HMM-1P contains two heads turning over at intermediate rates. HMM-1P was 46–120 times more active than unphosphorylated HMM but only 7–19% as active as the fully thiophosphorylated molecule. Therefore, the model that best fits these single turnover data is that both heads are partially activated, but the activation is not to 50% of the fully phosphorylated molecule. SMM was prepared from frozen chicken gizzards (25.Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained from Pel-Freeze (Rogers, AR). HMM was obtained from a Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 (Sigma) digest of SMM (200–400 mg) as described previously (5.Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J.

SDS gel analysis (0.1% SDS, 4–20% acrylamide gradient, Novex, San Diego, CA) and native gel analysis (26.Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that >95% pure HMM was obtained (densitometric scanning, Molecular Dynamics). SMM and HMM concentrations were determined using the following extinction coefficients: SMM, ε2801.0% = 5.6, HMM, ε2801.0% = 6.5. F-actin was prepared from rabbit muscle according to the method of Spudich and Watt (27.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was dialyzed extensively versus 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) to remove ATP. MLCK was prepared from frozen chicken gizzards by the method of Adelstein and Klee (28.Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) except that Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for gel filtration; Super Q (Tosohass) was used for ion exchange, and the calmodulin affinity step was omitted. An Escherichia coli BGL21 (DE3) strain expressing a His tag RLC was a gift from Dr. James T. Stull.

After RLC exchange (see below) and purification of exchanged HMM, the His tag was removed by treatment with thrombin (Sigma) as described in Fig. 2. Thrombin cleaves between arginine and glycine, leaving the three amino acid sequence GSH prior to the NH2-terminal methionine. HMM, His-RLC, and RLC were thiophosphorylated by incubation in 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 4 μg/ml calmodulin, 1 mm ATPγS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 30 μg/ml myosin light chain kinase at pH 7.0, 25 °C for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation on ice. The extent of thiophosphorylation was verified by 8 m urea gel electrophoresis (29.Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). From control experiments, we concluded that the urea gel method can detect 5% or greater of unphosphorylated RLC (data not shown). The exchange procedure used here is similar to previously published methods (29.Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30.Trybus K.M.

The exchange reaction contained 2 mg/ml HMM, 0.2 mg/ml RLC, 20 mm NaPi (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 0.5m NaCl. This mixture was heated to 42 °C and incubated at that temperature for 30 min. The sample was incubated on the bench top for 10 min before adding MgCl2 to 20 mm and then placed on ice. All exchanged samples (see Table I) were prepared from two different exchange mixtures, each typically containing 15 mg of HMM. Unphosphorylated HMM and thiophosphorylated His-RLC were used to prepare HMM-1Pa and HMM-2P. Thiophosphorylated HMM and unphosphorylated His-RLC were used to prepare HMM-1Pb and HMM-0P (see Table I for definitions). HMM-2P was also prepared by thiophosphorylating HMM-0P. After exchange, excess free RLC and His-RLC were removed with a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (2.6 × 60 cm; 10 mm MOPS (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl; run time 3 h). Base-line separation was achieved between the HMM and free RLC or His-RLC peaks (data not shown). To avoid prolonged exposure to non-reducing conditions, fractions containing HMM were pooled and immediately applied to the nickel-affinity column (see Fig. 1).Table ICompositions of HMMs used in this studyHMM preparationHMM starting materialRLC used for exchangeExchange and chromatographyControl unphosphorylatedNativeaThe native and mutant RLC (after thrombin cleavage) differ only in the NH2-terminal sequence.

Open table in a new tab This assay measures the rate of phosphate release from the acto-HMM FDP·Pi state. As phosphate release is rate-limiting (7.Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the decrease in fluorescence as FDP dissociates from HMM can be used to measure phosphate release rates. The rate of dissociation of ADP from smooth acto-HMM is independent of phosphorylation and about 45 s−1 (33.Rosenfeld R.S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Kar S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

In control experiments using the light-scattering technique described by Sellers (7.Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have shown that for unphosphorylated HMM, the turnover rates of ATP (used in steady-state assays) and FTP (used in single turnover assay) are not significantly different (data not shown). The single turnover of FTP allows populations of molecules or heads with different turnover rates to be elucidated (34.Ankrett R.J. Rowe A.J. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35.Jackson A.P. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36.Cross R.A. Jackson A.P.

Assays were performed at 25 °C in a temperature-controlled stopped-flow fluorometer (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) equipped with a 450-watt xenon lamp. The mixing dead time was 5 ms. All solutions were pre-equilibrated to 25 °C in a water bath prior to the experiment. The excitation wavelength was 313 nm, and the excitation bandwidth was 4 nm. The emission wavelength was 350 nm, and the emission bandwidth was 12 nm. The experiment was done with two syringes. The first syringe contained 10 μm actin, 200 μm ATP, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.8 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT. The second syringe contained 0.4 μm HMM heads in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT. Immediately prior to data collection, MgFTP (0.8 μmMgCl2, 0.4 μm FTP) was added to the second syringe. After flushing the cuvette 3 times from syringe 2, 40 μl was repetitively shot (every 10 s or so) from each syringe in 40 ms. These initial shots were not analyzed per se but were used only to observe when the initial fluorescence reached a maximum (indicating maximal binding of FTP to HMM, ∼2.5 min after FTP addition). A complete turnover was then collected from one additional shot. The decrease in fluorescence after mixing reflects the off-rate of MgFDP that is limited by phosphate release. Two thousand data points were collected in the normal fashion by the computer in the first 50 s with the shutter continuously open. After this time data points were collected manually by averaging 4 s of data typically every min until ∼50 min. Between each manual reading the shutter was closed to avoid photolysis of the sample. This dual mode of data collection allowed the full turnover to be documented in one run without appreciable photolysis of the fluorophore. Photolysis was characterized by a linear increase in fluorescence over time and was not prevented by degassing the solutions. For the fully phosphorylated samples, only 20 s of data were collected. In some data sets (data not shown) the turnover was monitored to 50 min to confirm that additional amplitude in very slow rates was not missed. The total amplitude of turnovers for all samples appears to be quite similar.Table IIISummary of rate constants and fractional amplitudes calculated from stopped-flow single-turnover experimentsUnphosphorylatedSingly thiophosphorylatedFully thiophosphorylatedSampleRatesaFTP single-turnover rates were measured, and data were fit as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data for unphosphorylated samples were fit to a single exponential model, whereas data for singly and fully thiophosphorylated samples were fit to double exponential models.

Open table in a new tab A “no turnover” control experiment was performed to ensure that the change in fluorescence observed was due to the binding and release of FTP/FDP from the active site and to confirm that photolysis was not appreciable under the conditions described above. Here, the HMM in the second syringe was treated with MgATP (200 μm ATP and 400 μm MgCl2), and the nucleotide was allowed to bind for 3 min, prior to adding MgFTP as before. Under the data collection procedure described above, the change in fluorescence over a 50 min time course for the no turnover experiment was <5% of the expected amplitude for a turnover experiment (data not shown). This result shows that the fluorescence changes observed in the turnover experiment were due to binding and release of FTP/FDP from the active site. All data were analyzed with Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Data for thiophosphorylated samples were fit to a double exponential model because a single exponential model consistently missed a fast phase for all data sets (thiophosphorylated control, 2P (thiophosphorylated 0P), and 2P (purified from the column)). Data for HMM-1P(a and b) were fit to a weighted double or triple exponential model. The weighting factor for the data in the first 50 s was 1.28, where the factor for the hand-collected data from 50 s to 50 min was 1.0. This means that each data point in the first 50 s had less weight than the hand-collected data. The weighting factors were determined independently from an analysis of the variance of a no turnover data set (see above). Only the relative values of the weighting factors are impor"
https://openalex.org/W2159893989,"Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase is a flavoprotein containing a covalent flavin that catalyzes the oxidation of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The reaction proceeds through the formation of a p-quinone methide intermediate, after which, water addition takes place. Asp-170, located near the N5-atom of the flavin, has been proposed to act as an active site base. To test this hypothesis, we have addressed the properties of D170E, D170S, D170A, and D170N variants. Spectral and fluorescence analysis, together with the crystal structure of D170S, suggests that the Asp-170 replacements do not induce major structural changes. However, in D170A and D170N, 50 and 100%, respectively, of the flavin is non-covalently bound. Kinetic characterization of the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase variants revealed that Asp-170 is required for catalysis. D170E is 50-fold less active, and the other Asp-170 variants are about 103-fold less active than wild type enzyme. Impaired catalysis of the Asp-170 variants is caused by slow flavin reduction. Furthermore, the mutant proteins have lost the capability of forming a stable complex between reduced enzyme and the p-quinone methide intermediate. The redox midpoint potentials in D170E (+6 mV) and D170S (–91 mV) are considerably decreased compared with wild type vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (+55 mV). This supports the idea that Asp-170 interacts with the protonated N5-atom of the reduced cofactor, thus increasing the FAD redox potential. Taken together, we conclude that Asp-170 is involved in the process of autocatalytic flavinylation and is crucial for efficient redox catalysis.

Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is the prototype of a novel family of structurally related oxidoreductases sharing a conserved FAD-binding domain (2.Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). VAO oxidizes its physiological substrate 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with the concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (3.Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4.Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction is initiated by the transfer of a hydride equivalent from the Cα-atom of the substrate to flavin N5. The resulting binary complex between the reduced enzyme and the p-quinone methide intermediate then reacts with molecular oxygen, reoxidizing the FAD. The p-quinone methide product subsequently reacts with water in the enzyme active site to generate the final products 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and methanol (4.Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). A similar reaction mechanism has been proposed for the structurally related flavocytochromep-cresol methylhydroxylase (5.Hopper D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6.McIntire W.S. Hopper D.J. Craig J.C. Everthart E.T. Webster R.V. Causer M.J. Singer T.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, we determined the three-dimensional structures of native VAO and several enzyme-ligand complexes (7.Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Each VAO 64-kDa monomer consists of two domains: the cap domain covers the active site, whereas the larger domain creates a binding site for the ADP-ribityl part of the FAD cofactor. The C8α-atom of the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD is covalently linked to the Nε3-atom of His-422 of the cap domain. A detailed study toward the non-covalent H422A mutant has shown that the covalent flavin linkage is not essential for tight binding of the flavin cofactor (8.Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the covalent bond raises the redox potential of the flavin, thereby increasing the rate of substrate oxidation. The structure of VAO in complex with 4-(1-heptenyl)phenol has revealed that the shape of the active site cavity controls the substrate specificity by providing a size-exclusion mechanism. Inside the cavity, the aromatic substrate is ideally positioned for hydride transfer to flavin N5. Substrate oxidation is facilitated by ionization of the phenol, as induced by hydrogen bonding with the side chains of Tyr-108, Tyr-503, and Arg-504. Another interesting residue in the VAO active site is Asp-170. The carboxylic moiety of this residue is close to flavin N5 (3.5 Å) and Arg-398 (3.1 Å) and likely to be deprotonated. The presence of an acidic residue in the vicinity of flavin N5 is intriguing, because in most flavin-dependent oxidoreductases of known structure the N5-atom contacts a hydrogen bond donor rather than an acceptor (9.Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The side chain of Asp-170 is positioned in a way that, during catalysis, it might interact with the protonated N5-atom of the reduced cofactor. Moreover, we have proposed that Asp-170 might act as an active site base, activating the water involved in substrate conversion (7.Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have addressed the functional importance of Asp-170 in VAO through the kinetic, spectroscopic and crystallographic analysis of D170E, D170S, D170A, and D170N. It is shown that the Asp-170 replacements do not introduce major structural changes but have a profound effect on the redox properties of the enzyme. In addition, our studies indicate that Asp-170 is involved in covalently tethering the flavin prosthetic group. Escherichia coli strain DH5αF′ (10.Woodcock D.M. Crowther P.J. Doherty J. Jefferson S.

The polymerase chain reaction was performed with the oligonucleotide 5′-CAAGCCGTCGACATTATTCGTCC-3′, where C denotes the mutated base. The mutated NcoI-NsiI fragment was ligated into pIM3972, yielding pBC11. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by plasmid sequencing.

After phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, the enzyme was transferred into 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After washing, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 20–1000 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Next, the enzyme was transferred into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration. To obtain highly pure Asp-170 variants, a Superdex 200 PG 50/1000 gel filtration column running in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was introduced as final chromatography step. Enzyme purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by analytical gel filtration using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. All experiments were performed in air-saturated 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. Molar absorption coefficients for protein bound flavin were determined in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by unfolding the enzyme with 0.5% (w/v) SDS or 5 m guanidinium/HCl (13.De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded using a Hewlett Packard HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer or an Aminco DW-2000 double beam spectrophotometer. The fraction of covalently bound FAD in the VAO variants was determined by the following procedure: first, the protein was treated with 5% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the protein precipitate was dissolved in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 6 m guanidinium/HCl. Next, the absorption spectral properties of supernatant and redissolved precipitate were compared with that of native enzyme. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in 12.5% slab gels as described (14.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was used for protein staining. Before protein staining, gels were incubated in 5% (v/v) acetic acid for fluorescence detection of covalently bound FAD in VAO (1.Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation constants of enzyme-inhibitor complexes were determined from flavin absorption perturbation spectra by titration of the enzyme with a known concentration of inhibitor (3.Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants of enzyme-sulfite complexes were determined from recording optical spectra as a function of sulfite concentration. Circular dichroism spectra were measured at 20 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in a 1 cm path length cuvette. High performance liquid chromatography experiments were performed with an Applied Biosystems pump equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector and a 3.9 × 100-mm Waters Novapak C18 column, essentially as described earlier (15.Van den Heuvel R.H.H. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The redox potentials of the VAO variants were determined in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase method of Massey (16.Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zannetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990. Walter De Gruyter & Co, New York1991: 59-66Crossref Google Scholar), essentially as described before (8.Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Equal concentrations of VAO and reference dye (7–10 μm), benzyl viologen or methyl viologen (2 μm), and xanthine (400 μm) were made anaerobic by flushing with oxygen-free argon. The reduction of VAO and reference dye was initiated by adding a catalytic amount of xanthine oxidase. To ensure equilibration between the oxidized and reduced species of enzyme and reference dye, the concentration of xanthine oxidase must be sufficiently low. Typically, the reduction of VAO and dye lasted 1–2 h. The dyes used were thionin (E m = +60 mV), methylene blue (E m= +11 mV), FAD (E m = –219 mV), phenosafranin (E m = –266 mV), and safranin O (E m = –280 mV). The oxidation-reduction potentials of the VAO variants were calculated according to the method of Clark (17.Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1960: 184-203Google Scholar).Eh(dye)=Em(dye)+(59/ndye)·log(dyeox/dyered)Eh(E)=Em(E)+(59/nE)·log(Eox/Ered)At equilibrium, Eh(dye)=Eh(E)Equation 1 All kinetic experiments were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. VAO activity was routinely determined by following absorption spectral changes of aromatic substrates or by oxygen consumption experiments using a Clark electrode (15.Van den Heuvel R.H.H. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For enzyme-monitored-turnover experiments, air-saturated enzyme and substrate were mixed, and the redox state of the FAD cofactor was measured (18.Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped-flow kinetics were performed essentially as described (4.Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All concentrations mentioned in the context of stopped-flow experiments are those after mixing. In anaerobic reduction experiments, glucose-containing enzyme solutions were flushed with oxygen-free argon. Glucose oxidase was added to eliminate final traces of oxygen. Reductive half-reactions were followed with a Hi-Tech M300 monochromator diode array detector (Salisbury, United Kingdom). Deconvolution of spectral data was done with the Specfit Global Analysis program version 2.10 (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC). Rate constants of single wavelength kinetic traces were recorded using a Hi-Tech SU-40 spectrophotometer. The detection wavelength differed depending on the VAO mutant examined. For the generation of two-electron reduced enzyme, argon-flushed oxidized enzyme was treated with a small excess of argon-flushed dithionite. Reoxidation was measured by monitoring the redox state of the flavin after mixing the reduced enzyme with varying concentrations of molecular oxygen. Crystals of D170S VAO were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, in conditions essentially identical to those for wild type VAO (7.Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein solutions containing 10 mg of protein/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, were equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 50 mm sodium acetate/hydrochloride, pH 5.1, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. For data collection, the crystals were soaked in a solution containing 1 mm isoeugenol for 12 h. Diffraction data were measured from a single crystal at the ID14-EH3 beam line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using a MarCCD detector at 100 K. Prior to data collection, the crystal was exposed for a few seconds to a cryoprotecting solution containing 20% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 10 mm isoeugenol, and 50 mm sodium acetate/hydrochloride, pH 5.1. The data were processed using MOSFLM (19.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) and programs of the CCP4 package (20.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). The mutant crystals belong to space group I4 with unit cell parameters a =b = 131.33, c = 134.66 Å and are isomorphous to the wild type crystals. The mutant structure was refined using the maximum likelihood refinement program REFMAC (21.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13815) Google Scholar). A bulk solvent correction was applied using the programs of the CCP4 package, whereas the positions of ordered solvent molecules were located using ARP (22.Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The progress of the refinement was monitored by means ofR free. Electron density maps were visually inspected using the program O (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The isoeugenol atoms were well defined in the electron density map, except for the terminal carbon atom of the propenyl substituent. This probably reflects the presence in the soaking solution of a mixture of cis- andtrans-isomers, which both bind to the enzyme. Analysis of the refined structure revealed that 85.1% of the amino acid residues of the isoeugenol complexed D170S structure fall in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, whereas none fall in the disallowed regions as defined by PROCHECK (24.Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The Asp-170 variants D170E, D170S, D170A, and D170N were purified from E. coli in about the same yield as wild type VAO (12.Benen J.A.E. Sánchez-Torres P. Wagemaker M. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Visser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7865-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration revealed that all VAO variants were mainly present in the octameric form. This hydrodynamic behavior is similar to that of wild type enzyme (25.Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Wild type VAO binds the FAD cofactor covalently via His-422 (7.Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When D170E was precipitated with 5% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, no flavin was present in the supernatant, indicating that all FAD is covalently bound. With D170S, only a trace amount (3%) of free FAD was found. However, trichloroacetic acid precipitation of D170A and D170N showed that in these mutants, 50 and 100%, respectively, of the flavin cofactor was non-covalently bound. These data were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using fluorescence analysis. The unstained SDS gel in 5% (v/v) acetic acid showed that D170E and D170S were as fluorescent as wild type enzyme. However, the fluorescent band of D170A was less intense, and D170N was not fluorescent. The flavin spectral properties of the oxidized VAO variants are summarized in TableII. The absorption characteristics of wild type enzyme and D170E are similar. However, D170S, D170A, and D170N display significantly different spectral properties (Fig.2 A). Unfolding the D170S mutant with 0.5% (w/v) SDS or 5 m guanidinium/HCl changed the absorbance spectrum of the covalently bound flavin to that of oxidized FAD (13.De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Upon this treatment, the absorbance at 450 nm remained nearly constant, revealing that the enzyme was isolated in the oxidized form. In agreement with this, native D170S displayed no fluorescence upon excitation at 360 nm, indicating that the enzyme was not isolated as a flavin N5 adduct (26.Ghisla S. Massey V. Choong Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10662-10669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Roelofs J.C.A.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The flavin in D170S was not present in the flavin iminoquinone methide form, as the cofactor was covalently attached to the enzyme. Moreover, the absorption characteristics of native D170S did not change after a single turnover experiment or after incubation with the substrate analog isoeugenol and subsequent elution over Biogel P6. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the unusual spectral features of D170S, D170A, and D170N are an intrinsic property of the mutant protein and the result of a changed flavin microenvironment.Table IIFlavin spectral properties of wild type VAO and Asp-170 variants in the oxidized form in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °CVAOλmaxɛoxnmmm −1 cm −1IIIɛIɛIIɛI/ɛIIWild type35643913.612.51.09D170E35143713.912.71.09D170S34544319.711.91.66D170A34844116.613.31.25D170N34444127.313.12.08 Open table in a new tab Circular dichroism spectra can yield valuable information about the flavin microenvironment (28.Visser A.J.W.G. van Berkel W.J.H. de Kok A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 381-385Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The flavin circular dichroism spectra of the four VAO variants were mirror images of the absorbance spectra (Fig. 2 B). Thus, wild type VAO and D170E showed similar circular dichroism spectra, whereas D170S, D170A, and D170N displayed strong negative peaks in the near-UV region. These results corroborate that the Asp-170 replacements introduce a change in the flavin microenvironment. Flavoprotein oxidases generally form flavin N5 adducts with sulfite (29.Massey V. Müller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L.G. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance spectra of these complexes resemble those of the reduced enzymes. However, wild type VAO does not react with sulfite (13.De Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and we have suggested that this is due to the presence of Asp-170 in the active site (7.Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Binding studies with D170E and D170S showed that only the latter enzyme interacts with sulfite. In the presence of 20 mm sulfite, bleaching of the flavin in D170S was completed after 60 min, and the reactivity did not significantly change with pH. From titration experiments, a dissociation constant for the D170S-sulfite complex, K d = 3 ± 1 mm at pH 7.5 was estimated. These results are in line with the proposal that a negatively charged residue at position 170 in VAO prohibits the reaction between flavin N5 and sulfite through electrostatic repulsion. Replacement of Asp-170 by Glu, Ser, and Ala did not strongly affect the binding of the competitive inhibitor isoeugenol. The dissociation constants of the isoeugenol-enzyme complexes were 13 ± 4, 18 ± 5, 15 ± 10, and 6 ± 2 μm for wild type VAO, D170E, D170S, and D170A, respectively, as determined by flavin perturbation difference spectroscopy (3.Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At pH 7.5, binding of isoeugenol to the VAO variants resulted in a strong increase in absorbance at 320 nm. This absorbance increase is due to the formation of the phenolate form of the inhibitor (3.Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As the pK a of isoeugenol free in solution is 9.8, binding to wild type VAO, D170S, D170E, and D170A decreases the pK a value of isoeugenol significantly. These data indicate that Asp-170 is not directly involved in substrate activation. D170N does not strongly interact with isoeugenol. This is concluded from the fa"

In eubacteria, the assembly of integral membrane proteins is a co-translational process that operates by a signal recognition particle (SRP)1-dependent mechanism (1Bibi E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 51-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2Zelazny A. Seluanov A. Cooper A. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In some cases, however, membrane proteins have been shown to be assembled into the membrane by a SRP-independent process (4Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 5de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Saaf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this latter process is largely unknown. In eukaryotes, insertion of membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum is also mediated mainly by SRP and occurs co-translationally (6Brodsky J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 277-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In contrast, membrane proteins in yeast do not require SRP in order to be targeted to the membrane and can be translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum post-translationally (8Rothe C. Lehle L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Remarkably, SRP is not essential for the survival of the yeast cell (10Ogg S.C. Poritz M.A. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite the accumulating knowledge regarding the mechanism of insertion of integral membrane proteins in eukaryotes and bacteria, virtually nothing is known about this process in archaea. Recently, several genes that code for putative components of the secretion/translocation machinery in archaea were identified by searching the sequences of complete archaeal genomes for genes homologous to those known to be involved in secretion (11Pohlschroder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these studies are still incomplete, and there are, to date, no genetic and biochemical data to confirm them. The biogenesis of bacteriorhodopsin is an excellent model system to analyze the assembly of polytopic membrane proteins. Bacterioopsin (Bop) is an integral membrane protein composed of seven transmembrane helices and is produced by the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum (12Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2853-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) and by some other halobacterial species (13Oesterhelt D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 489-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The complex of Bop with the chromophore, all-trans-retinal, forms bacteriorhodopsin, which is organized in clusters that are termed “purple membranes.” Bacteriorhodopsin functions as a light-driven proton pump that upon illumination generates a proton gradient that is used to produce ATP. The photoreaction cycle of bacteriorhodopsin in the purple membrane has been extensively characterized (14Mathies R.A. Lin S.W. Ames J.B. Pollard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and the structure of bacteriorhodopsin in the purple membrane has been determined to high resolution (15Luecke H. Richter H.T. Lanyi J.K. Science. 1998; 280: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 16Pebay-Peyroula E. Rummel G. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In addition to bacteriorhodopsin, H. salinarum produces three retinal binding proteins: sensory rhodopsin I and II (SopI and SopII, respectively), which serve as light-sensing molecules (17Krebs M.P. Spudich E.N. Khorana H.G. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3486-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and halorhodopsin (Hop) (18Lanyi J.K. Oesterhelt D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2674-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which serves as a Cl− pump (19Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10306-10313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although SopI, SopII, and Hop have the same topology as bacteriorhodopsin, amino acid sequence relatedness between the four species is limited. Despite the considerable knowledge of the biophysical properties of bacteriorhodopsin, relatively little is known about the biogenesis of the purple membrane. It has been shown that halobacterial 7 S RNA sediments with the ribosomal fraction that translates the bacterioopsin mRNA (20Gropp R. Groop F. Betlach M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1204-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since 7 S RNA is an integral part of the SRP complex, it was suggested that Bop is inserted into the membrane co-translationally. In agreement with this hypothesis, Heather and Krebs (21Dale H. Krebs M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22693-22698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the N terminus of Bop is inserted into the membrane of H. salinarum co-translationally. This report describes the heterologous expression of the H. salinarum bop gene in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii, which lacks the genetic capacity to produce bacterioopsin. We present evidence that in H. volcaniibacterioopsin is incorporated into the membrane post-translationally and that the seventh transmembrane helix of the protein plays a critical role in this process. H. volcanii white mutant (SX) (kindly obtained from Dr. Robert Charlebois, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada), H. volcanii methionine/cysteine auxotrophic strain (WR341), H. salinarum S9-Bop constitutively expressing strain, and H. salinarum L33-Bop deficient strain were used in the present work. Rich medium (H) and agar plates were prepared as described previously (22Mevarech M. Werczberger R. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 461-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with one modification (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, was used as the buffer). For selection of transformants, the medium was supplemented with 1 μg/ml novobiocin (Nov) (Sigma). Trimethoprim (Sigma) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml and all-trans-retinal (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 μm were added to the medium when required.Escherichia coli strain TG1 was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. When needed, ampicillin (Sigma) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Restriction endonuclease digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, and molecular cloning were performed according to standard procedures described by Maniatis et al. (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). PCR amplification was carried out with a 200 nm concentration of each primer, a 200 μm concentration of each dNTP, 10–50 ng of plasmid template DNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) in a final volume of 100 μl. Thirty amplification cycles were performed (30 s at 94 °C (denaturation step), 30 s at 55 °C (primer annealing), and 30 s at 72 °C (polymerization step)). The PCR products were purified by the High PureTM PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the supplier. Transformation of halobacteria was carried out as described previously (24Cline S.W. Lam W.L. Charlebois R.L. Schalkwyk L.C. Doolittle W.F. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). E. coli TG1 was transformed according to the CaCl2protocol (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Halobacterial strains were grown for 3 days to early stationary phase. The cell suspension (50 ml) was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The cells in the pellet were lysed by resuspension in 5 ml of H2O in the presence of DNase I (Sigma) at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. The membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g (18,500 rpm) for 1 h in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was recentrifuged twice and analyzed as a cytoplasmic fraction in further experiments. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of distilled water, recentrifuged twice, and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of distilled water for further analysis as a membrane fraction. When purification of the cellulose-binding proteins from the cytoplasmic fraction was required, 50 μl of a 10% (w/v) cellulose suspension (Sigma) was added to 1 ml of the cytoplasmic fraction, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature while continuously inverting the tube. After incubation, the cellulose suspension was washed twice with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 solution. Recovery of the cellulose-bound proteins was performed by boiling the cellulose pellet in 50 μl of the SDS gel loading buffer. Halobacterial strains were grown for 3 days to early stationary phase. The cell suspension (50 ml) was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of the high salt concentration solution (3 m KCl, 100 mm MgAc, 10 mm Hepes) in the presence of DNase I (Sigma) at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml and sonicated. The membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g (35,000 rpm) for 1 h in a SW 50.1Ti rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was recentrifuged and served as the cytoplasmic fraction in further experiments. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of distilled water, recentrifuged, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of distilled water for further analysis as the membrane fraction. When purification of the cellulose-binding proteins from the cytoplasmic fraction was required, 50 μl of a 10% (w/v) cellulose suspension was added to 1 ml of the cytoplasmic fraction, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature while continuously inverting the tube. After incubation, the cellulose suspensions were washed twice with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 solution. Recovery of the cellulose bound proteins was performed by boiling of the cellulose pellet in 50 μl of SDS gel loading buffer. Samples of protein extracts were electrophoresed in standard SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% (w/v) or 12% (w/v)). The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters and treated with antibodies against hDHFR or cellulose binding domain (CBD), followed by exposure with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase. The bound antibody was detected by the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Flotation gradient analysis was performed as described (3Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G.

A. 1995; 92: 9435-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The membrane fraction from H. volcanii cells were prepared at low salt concentration as described above with the following modification. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer I (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 7.5% (w/v) sucrose). 40 μl of the membrane suspension was mixed with 400 μl of buffer III (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 58% (w/v) sucrose) and transferred to the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube for the TLS 55 swing-out rotor (Beckman). The sample was overlaid with 680 μl of buffer II (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 52% (w/v) sucrose) and 270 μl of buffer I. After ultracentrifugation for 4 h at 250,000 × g(54,000 rpm), 200 μl were removed from the top of the gradient, and the flotation gradient was collected in three fractions (400, 300, and 490 μl), designated as the top, middle, and bottom fractions. The fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by Western blot. The optical densities of the ECL bands were quantified using TINA software. Membrane fractions were prepared from the H. volcaniiSX/38CBD and SX strains and from the H. salinarum S9 and L33 strains prepared at low salt concentration as described above. The optical absorbance spectra (450–700 nm) of total membrane proteins prepared from the SX/38CBD and S9 strains was obtained employing an Ultrospec III spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using the membrane fractions prepared from the SX and L33 strains as the corresponding references. A 200-ml culture of the H. volcanii methionine auxotrophic strain WR341 expressing the Bop-CBD fusion protein was grown in rich medium to an A 600 of 0.5, centrifuged, and resuspended in 10 ml of minimal medium containing 4m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 150 mmMgSO4, Tris, 50 mm, pH 7.2, 0.05% (w/v) CaCl2, 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.05% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) sodium succinate and a mixture containing all of the standard amino acids except methionine and cysteine at a final concentration of 40 μg/ml each. The culture was shaken for 30 min at 37 °C, and then 300 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) was added. Incubation was continued, and aliquots of 1 ml were removed every 20 min and centrifuged immediately at 3000 × g for 3 min. In pulse-chase experiments, after an incubation of 1.5 h with the labeled methionine, 1 ml was removed (time 0), and unlabeledl-methionine was added to a final concentration of 40 μg/ml. Samples of 1 ml were removed every 20 min. Aliquots were immediately centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min. The cells were lysed by resuspension in 2 ml of H2O in the presence of 25 μg/ml DNase I. The membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was analyzed as the cytoplasmic fraction. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 10% (v/v) Tween 20, and 900 μl of H2O was added. To each of the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, 50 μl of a 10% (w/v) cellulose suspension (Sigma) was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the cellulose suspensions were washed twice with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 solution. Recovery of the Bop-CBD was performed by boiling of the cellulose pellet in 40 μl of SDS gel loading buffer. Samples of 20 μl were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%, w/v). The gel was dried and exposed to a phospho-image screen (Fuji) for 4–12 h. The screen was scanned in a phospho-image reader (BAS 1000, Fuji) and analyzed using TINA software. Recombinant plasmids for expression of the differentbop gene fusions were constructed as follows (see Fig. 1). The gene coding for the H. salinarum bacterioopsin (bop) was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pEF1100 (26Ferrando E. Schweiger U. Oesterhelt D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) while generating an NcoI site at the 5′-end and a BglII site at the 3′-end. The 5′-end of the bop gene was fused to the synthetic H. volcanii constitutive promoter PrR16 (27Patenge N. Soppa J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 171: 27-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the bop gene was fused in frame to the H. volcanii gene coding for hDHFR (28Zusman T. Rosenshine I. Boehm G. Jaenicke R. Leskiw B. Mevarech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18878-18883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) via a linker consisting of the nucleotide sequence coding for the first 33 codons of the H. salinarum ferredoxin gene (29Pfeifer F. Griffig J. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The entire construct was cloned into the pWL-Nov shuttle vector, which contains E. coli and H. volcanii replication origins and an ampicillin resistance gene for selection of transformants in E. coli and a novobiocin resistance gene (30Holmes M.L. Nuttall S.D. Dyall-Smith M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3807-3813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for selection of transformants in H. volcanii. The final construct was named pNBLD38. The cbd gene (coding for Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome cellulose binding domain) was amplified by PCR using primers that introduce the BglII and XbaI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively. The part of the bop-hdrA gene containing the linker-hDHFR fusion in pNBLD38 plasmid was replaced with the cbd gene using the BglII and XbaI restriction sites to yield the plasmid pNB38CBD. Plasmid pHE1, which contains the gene coding for hDHFR, fused directly to the strong promoter PrR16 via the same linker as used in pNBLD38 and was used as a control plasmid. Five Bop mutants containing deletions within the protein were created using the bop-hdrA construction as follows (see Fig.5). The bop gene was deleted for the domain encoding the seventh transmembrane helix and the intracellular C terminus (the polypeptide fragment corresponding to amino acids from position 212 to 262); the linker-DHFR fragment was fused to the extracellular loop flanking the sixth helix through a BglII site introduced by PCR at position 633 of the gene. The pNB46 plasmid carries the same deletion in the bop gene as pNBLD46; however, the region encoding the linker and the hDHFR has been removed and a stop codon introduced at position 633 of the gene. The bop gene was deleted for the domains encoding the last two transmembrane helices (the polypeptide fragment corresponding to amino acids from position 179 to 262), and the linker-DHFR fragment was fused to the intracellular loop flanking the fifth transmembrane helix through a BglII site introduced by PCR at position 536 of the gene. The bop gene was deleted for the domains encoding transmembrane helices four and five (the polypeptide fragment corresponding to amino acids from position 121 to 174) and was constructed by PCR by introducing BglII and BamHI sites after the third helix at position 361 of the gene and before the sixth helix at position 521 of the gene, respectively, following digestion with these two enzymes and self-ligation. The bop gene was deleted for the domains encoding the first two transmembrane helices (the polypeptide fragment corresponding to amino acids from position 22 to 85) and was constructed by removal of the region between the AatIIrestriction site at position 56 of the gene and a new AatII site introduced by PCR before the third helix at position 257 of the gene. The bop gene is deleted for the domains encoding transmembrane helices one to six (the polypeptide fragment corresponding to amino acids from position 22 to 212) and was constructed by removal of the region between the AatII restriction site at position 56 of the gene and a new AatII site introduced by PCR before the seventh helix at position 633 of the gene. Plasmid vectors constructed in this work for the expression of the H. salinarum bop gene in H. volcanii are shown in Fig.1. The fused hDHFR gene provides a positive selection for the Bop-hDHFR chimera in H. volcaniias hDHFR confers resistance to the anti-folate drug trimethoprim. It also enables the detection of the fused protein by antibodies raised against hDHFR. The pNB38CBD plasmid contains a fusion of the bop gene to the gene coding for the CBD of the C. thermocellum cellulosome (31Morag E. Lapidot A. Govorko D. Lamed R. Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Shoham Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1980-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion enables an easy affinity purification of the Bop-CBD chimera by binding to cellulose. The plasmid pHE1, which contains the hDHFR gene fused directly to the strong promoter PrR16, was constructed to serve as a control plasmid. All three plasmids contain replication origins for propagation in E. coli and H. volcanii, an ampicillin resistance gene for selection of E. coli transformants, and a novobiocin resistance gene (30Holmes M.L. Nuttall S.D. Dyall-Smith M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3807-3813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for selection of H. volcaniitransformants. The recombinant plasmids pNBLD38, pNB38CBD, and pHE1 were introduced into H. volcanii SX (white mutant), and transformants were selected for on novobiocin plates. Cells bearing pNBLD38 (SX/38) were found to be resistant to 2 μg/ml trimethoprim, as were cells containing pHE1 (SX/1), whereas growth of untransformed cells and cells containing pNB38CBD (SX/38CBD) was completely inhibited by 2 μg/ml trimethoprim (MICTmp for SX cells is 0.25 μg/ml). The ability of transformants containing pNBLD38 and pNB38CBD to produce bacteriorhodopsin was examined after growth in the presence of 10 μm retinal. Cultures of both SX/38 and SX/38CBD strains became purple (data not shown), whereas cultures of untransformed cells as well as of SX/1 cells grown in the presence of the same concentration of retinal remained white. To analyze the synthesis and cellular localization of Bop in H. volcanii, membrane and cytoplasmic fractions from transformants containing pNB38CBD and from control cells lacking the plasmid were prepared at the low and high salt concentration conditions (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2shows that the Bop-CBD fusion protein occurs both in the cytoplasmic and in the membrane fractions. Membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from equivalent amounts of cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A) and by Western blot analysis using antibodies against CBD (Fig. 2 B). It was found that the amounts of the Bop-CBD fusion protein obtained in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were similar in the samples prepared either at low or high salt concentration and separated by centrifugation at 40,000 or 100,000 × g, respectively. Similar results were obtained when cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, prepared from cells expressing the Bop-hDHFR chimera, were analyzed by Western analysis using antibodies against hDHFR (data not shown). Flotation gradient analysis was carried out to verify that the Bop-CBD protein found in the membrane fraction was inserted into the membrane. Most of the Bop-CBD fusion protein was detected in the top (about 68%) and in the middle (about 23%) layers of the step gradient (Fig.3). In these experiments, proteins will normally float from the loading zone at the bottom of the gradient to the top and middle fractions only if they are integrated into the membrane. The results obtained here suggest that the Bop-CBD fusion protein is stably integrated into the membrane. In order to address the question of whether the membrane-bound Bop-CBD fusion protein is properly folded, membrane fractions were prepared from cells of the SX/38CBD strain grown in the presence of retinal and from the H. salinarum S9 (Bop constitutively expressing strain), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The membrane preparations were diluted to the same optical density at 568 nm (the absorption maximum of bacteriorhodopsin (12Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2853-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar)). Equivalent samples from both suspensions were electrophoresed on a 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and photographed, and the absorption profiles of the protein bands were determined by TINA software. The absorption profiles of the corresponding bands of native Bop, prepared from the H. salinarum S9 strain, and Bop-CBD, prepared from the H. volcanii SX/38CBD, were very similar, implying that the Bop-CBD chimeric protein is correctly folded in the membrane (data not shown). Pulse-chase experiments were performed to follow the kinetics of Bop biogenesis in H. volcanii. Plasmid pNB38CBD containing the bop-cbd fusion was transformed into H. volcaniiWR341(Met−) strain to yield the WR341/38 strain. Pulse labeling was carried out by the addition of [35S]methionine to a mid-log phase culture of the WR341/38 strain, and samples were removed every 20 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.4 A shows the amount of labeled Bop-CBD protein present in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions prepared from these samples at different times. Labeled Bop-CBD fusion protein occurs first in the cytoplasmic fraction and only later can be detected in the membrane fraction. When the pulsed labeled cells were subjected to a large excess of nonlabeled methionine, the radioactivity in the Bop-CBD fusion protein in the cytoplasmic fraction decreased with time, whereas the amount of radioactivity in the membrane fraction increased (Fig. 4 B). These two processes occurred at similar rates, indicating that the cytoplasmic form of the Bop-CBD fusion protein is a precursor of the membrane form of this protein. Bop deletion mutants were created to help identification of the region(s) within the protein involved in membrane targeting. Fig.5 A shows the size and location of the various deletions made in the bop gene. Each of the recombinant plasmids pNBLD46, pNBLD48, pNBLD52, and pNBLD54, which carry a deletion in the bop gene fused to the hdrA gene, were introduced into H. volcanii SX cells, and transformants were selected for on novobiocin plates. The ability of the transformants to grow in the presence of trimethoprim was determined in liquid culture. All of the transformants were resistant to 2 μg/ml trimethoprim. None of the cultures bearing plasmids with a deletion in the bop gene produced a purple color when grown in the presence of all-trans-retinal. Membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from cells harboring each of the above plasmids with different mutant bop genes and from cells that harbor pNBLD38 (containing the wild typebop gene) and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against hDHFR. Fig. 5 B shows that the fusion protein derived from BopΔ7 that lacks the polypeptide domain containing the seventh transmembrane helix together with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail and the protein from BopΔ6–7 that lacks both the seventh and sixth transmembrane helices both occur only in the cytoplasmic fraction. In contrast, the wild type Bop and the fusion proteins derived from Bop mutants that lack the first two helices, BopΔ1–2, or the fourth and fifth helices, BopΔ4–5, occur in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. In all cases, the cytoplasmic forms of the Bop fusion protein were unstable, and degradation products were detected as bands with lower molecular weight. According to the results described above, the seventh transmembrane helix of"

This is a specific example of a common situation in biochemistry where a single protein domain can interact with multiple partners. Are these different interactions related chemically? To probe this point, phage display was employed to isolate peptides from a library based solely on their ability to bind Gal80 protein in vitro. Peptide-Gal80 protein association is shown to be highly specific and of moderate affinity.

It was then asked if these peptides could function as activation domains in yeast when tethered to a DNA binding domain. Indeed, this is the case. Furthermore, one of the Gal80-binding peptides binds directly to a domain of the Gal11 protein, a known coactivator. The fact that Gal80-binding peptides are functional activation domains argues that repressor binding and activation/coactivator binding are intimately related properties.

Although the mechanism of action of activators is not understood in detail, these AD-protein contacts are thought to be involved in recruitment of the holoenzyme or remodeling machines to the promoter targeted by the activator (9.Barberis A.

Most activators do not function constitutively but instead respond to changes in cellular conditions. In some cases, the activator is repressed under noninducing conditions by a protein that binds tightly to the AD and blocks its interaction with the transcription machinery. Well known examples of this type include the p53·MDM2 (13.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Paveltich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar) and Gal4p·Gal80p (14.Johnston S.A. Salmeron Jr., J.M. Dincher S.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15.Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 50: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) complexes. The chemistry of these competitive protein-protein interactions is poorly understood. Two limiting models can be considered. One is that the repressor and coactivator(s) would have more or less common AD binding surfaces, and the AD-repressor and AD-coactivator complexes would be structurally and chemically similar. The other is that completely different binding modes are employed to recognize the repressor and other transcription factors. For example, different regions of the AD could be employed for repressor and coactivator binding; or different faces of a single structure, such as a β-sheet (16.Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), could be utilized for the different binding events. Several studies have addressed this question for the Gal4 AD, but they have provided mixed results. Mutagenesis studies (16.Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17.Ansari A.Z. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) seem more consistent with different modes of binding. For instance, Gal4 AD binding to Gal80p is compromised severely by single point mutations in the AD, whereas activation is unaffected by these substitutions. Although no single substitution appears to affect the activation potential of the Gal4 AD greatly, multiple point mutants have been found which have a significant effect on activation (both up and down) but do not impair Gal80p binding. On the other hand, chemical cross-linking and “label transfer” experiments using Gal4 AD chemically modified at specific positions indicate that the same residues are in close proximity to Gal80 and to TATA-binding protein in the respective AD complexes (17.Ansari A.Z.

This peptide was then fused to a sequence-specific DNA binding domain and expressed in yeast to determine if it could function as an AD in vivo. It is shown here that the Gal80-binding peptides indeed act as potent ADs. Furthermore, in vitro binding studies reveal that they also bind the Gal11 protein, a coactivator. These data argue that Gal80p binding and activation are fundamentally linked activities and in turn argue that Gal80p and certain coactivators have similar binding surfaces. The Escherichia coli expression vectors for His6-Gal80, pProEX-1/Gal80, and the yeast expression vector for multicopy Gal80, YEp351Gal80, which has a native Gal80 promoter were kindly provided by Prof. Stephen Johnston (University of Texas, Southwestern). pGBT9 was purchased fromCLONTECH. The expression plasmid encoding the GST-G80BP-A fusion was constructed by annealing the oligonucleotides (5′-CGC GGA TCC TAT GAT CAG GAT ATG CAG AAT AAT ACT TTT GAT GAT TTG TTT TGG AAG GAG GGG CAT CGG TAA GCT TGA ATT CCG G-3′ and 5′-CCG GAA TTC AAG CTT ACC GAT GCC CCT CCT TCC AAA ACA AAT CAT CAA AAG TAT TAT TCT GCA TAT CCT GAT CAT AGG ATC CGC G-3′), digesting the resultant duplex withBamHI/EcoRI, and then inserting the fragment intoBamHI/EcoRI-cleaved pGEX-2T vector. The resultant plasmid was named pGEX-2T-G80BP-A. The same procedure was employed to construct the expression vector for GST-G80BP-B, except that the appropriate oligonucleotides to encode this peptide were used (5′-CGC GGA TCC AAT GAG GAT TGG GAG CGG GAT GAT CAG AAT CCT TGG GAT AAG TTG TGG ATG AAT CGT GCG TAA GCT TGA ATT CCG G-3′ and 5′-CCG GAA TTC AAG CTT ACG CAC GAT TCA TCC ACA ACT TAT CCC AAG GAT TCT GAT CAT CAT CCC GCT CCC AAT CCT CAT TGG ATC CGC G-3′). The resultant plasmid was named pGEX-2T-G80BP-B. To make the yeast Gal41–147-AD fusion expression plasmid, a pair of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the core Gal4 AD (34-mer) (5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG GAC CAA ACT GCG TAT AAC GCG TTT GGA ATC ACT ACA GGG ATG TTT AAT ACC ACT ACA ATG GAT GAT GTA TAT AAC TAT CTA TTC GAT GAT GAA GAT ACC TAA GGA TCC GCGC-3′ and 5′-GCG CGG ATC CTT AGG TAT CTT CAT CAT CGA ATA GAT AGT TAT ATA CAT CAT CCA TTG TAG TGG TAT TAA ACA TC CTG TAG TGA TTC CAA ACG CGT TAT ACG CAG TTT GGT CCA TGA ATT CCG G-3′) was annealed, digested with EcoRI/BamHI, and then inserted into EcoRI/BamHI-cleaved pGBT9. The resultant plasmid was named pGBT9-34. For the analogous plasmids encoding Gal41–147-peptide fusions, the same procedure was employed using duplex oligonucleotides encoding the desired peptide. For the yeast expression plasmids encoding Gal41–147 fused to two copies of a peptide, the following protocol was employed (the example of G80BP-A is given). A pair of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding one copy of the 20-mer peptide G80BP-A (5′-GCC GGA ATT CTA TGA TCA GGA TAT GCA GAA TAA TAC TTT TGA TGA TTT GTT TTG GAA GGA GGG GCA TCG GGT CGA CGG GAT CCG CGG-3′ and 5′-CCG CGG ATC CCG TCG ACC CGA TGC CCC TCC TTC CAA AAC AAA TCA AAA GTA TTA TTC TGC ATA TCC TGA TCA TAG AAT TCC GGC-3′) was annealed, digested with EcoRI/BamHI, then inserted into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGBT9.

The resultant plasmid was named pGBT9-(G80BP-A)2. His6-Gal80 (a His6 tag at the NH2 terminus of Gal80), GST-Gal80 (fusion of the Gal80 to the COOH terminus of glutathione S-transferase), GST-Gal4 AD (fusion of the Gal4 AD (residues 847–881) to the COOH terminus of GST), His6-Gal4 AD (a His6 tag at the NH2 terminus of the Gal4 AD 34-mer), GST-G80BP-A (fusion of the peptide G80BP-A to the COOH terminus of GST), GST-G80BP-B (fusion of the peptide G80BP-B to the COOH terminus of GST) were purified from overexpressing E. coli cells. The standard protocol for the purification of His6- or GST-tagged proteins was employed in each case. Details are available upon request. The polypeptide containing the native Gal4 AD which was employed for fluorescence polarization experiments was reported previously (27.Fancy D. Kodadek T. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11953-11960Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of Gal11(1–350) will be reported elsewhere. In the meantime, details are available upon request. The in vivo experiments were performed in the yeast strain Y190: MAT a, ura3-52,his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101,trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ,gal80Δ, cyh r 2,LYS2:: GAL1UAS-HIS3TATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL4UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ. The M13 phage library ON543 was provided by Prof. Stephen Johnston (University of Texas, Southwestern) and was obtained originally from Affymax. It contained approximately 108 different 20-mer peptides expressed at the NH2-terminal pIII of M13 phage. Affinity panning was performed with purified His6-Gal80 immobilized on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates and GST-TEV-Gal80 immobilized on glutathione beads. After six rounds of panning, isolated colonies were chosen for sequencing. A detailed panning protocol is available upon request. To measure theKD of the Gal80-peptide G80BP-A complex, peptide G80BP-A (20-mer) was synthesized using standard solid phase methods and labeled with the NHS ester of carboxyfluorescein on resin. The indicated amount of His6-Gal80 and either 10 nmor 2 nm labeled peptide were mixed in 200 μl of buffer (PBS with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the solution was allowed to come to equilibrium by incubating at room temperature for 20 min. The sample was then placed into the cavity of a fluorescence spectrometer equipped to measure anisotropy (PanVera Beacon 2000). The polarization of the emitted light was recorded. A similar procedure was employed for the experiment using fluorescein-labeled native Gal4 AD, which was produced as recombinant polypeptide in E. coli and labeled at its NH2 terminus using the NHS ester of carboxyfluorescein. To determine whether the Gal80-binding peptides and the native Gal4 AD compete for Gal80p, 2.5 μm His6-Gal80, about 10 nm labeled peptide, and the indicated amount of GST-34 were mixed in 200 μl of buffer (PBS with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The polarization values were measured. The GST protein was used as negative control. An identical protocol was employed to see if the two selected peptides competed with one another for Gal80p, except that an unlabeled peptide was substituted for the native AD as the competitor. E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells transformed with pProEX-1/Gal80 were grown at 37 °C to O.D. 0.8 and then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The harvested cells were lysed by sonication in PBS. After sonication, Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant was used in the pull-down experiment. Purified GST, GST-G80BP-A, GST-G80BP-B, or GST-Gal4 AD was incubated with glutathione beads in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell extract was then added and incubated for 30 min. The beads were then washed four times with excess buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, PBS, plus 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C for 15 min each time and once with PBS. The protein retained on the beads was eluted with reduced glutathione and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. β-Galactosidase assays were conducted as suggested by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). As mentioned above, the central question that we wished to address was whether peptides selected solely on their ability to bind the Gal80 repressor would function as ADs in yeast when tethered to a sequence-specific DNA binding domain. To identify Gal80p-binding peptides, phage display was employed. An M13 phage library of approximately 109 20-mer peptides was panned against two different Gal80 fusion proteins, GST-Gal80 and His6-Gal80, adsorbed on different solid phases. Six rounds of panning were carried out. In various rounds, different Gal80p fusion proteins and different solid supports were employed. By changing the “background” throughout the course of the screen it was hoped that phage that bound to beads or linker arms, etc. could be reduced or eliminated from the final population. Furthermore, high ionic strength washes were employed in the last two rounds to attempt to eliminate weakly bound phage from the population. After the final round, nine phage-infected colonies were selected, and the phage DNA in these colonies was sequenced. Two unique peptides were identified, one of which was found six times and the other three. These will be referred to as Gal80-binding peptides (G80BPs) A and B, respectively. The peptide sequences deduced from the DNA sequences are shown in TableI, as is that of the native core Gal4 AD for comparison. There may be some sequence similarity between the isolated peptides and the Gal4 AD; for example, each contains DD pairs, but no obvious extended consensus sequence is apparent. The affinities of G80BP-A and G80BP-B for bead-bound Gal80p were estimated to be about 2,000 times higher than that of a phage picked randomly from library based on the ratio of phage bound to the number input (data not shown).Table IPeptides employed in this studyNameSequenceG80BP-AYDQDMQNNTFDDLFWKEGHRG80BP-BNEDWERDDQNPWDKLWMNRAGal4 ADMDQTAYNAFGITTGMFNTTTMDDVYNYLFDDEDT20unLFMGAGMEVGLGGAPLKSQTJZ15KARKEAELAAATAEQ Open table in a new tab Because G80BP-A was the most abundant peptide in the final selected population, it was chosen for detailed study. To address whether G80BP-A binds Gal80p outside of the context of the phage, it was synthesized using standard solid phase techniques and end labeled with fluorescein. The affinity of the peptide for purified Gal80p was determined using fluorescence polarization. In this technique, the labeled peptide is irradiated with polarized light of the appropriate wavelength to excite the fluorescein moiety. Because of the relatively small size of the peptide, the emitted photon loses most of this polarization because of rapid tumbling in solution. However, if the peptide associates with a large protein, the rate of tumbling is reduced, and the emitted light will retain a greater degree of polarization (28.Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Method. Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the results of an experiment in which a small amount of fluorescein-labeled G80BP-A (≈2 nm) was titrated with increasing amounts of purified Gal80p. As expected, a smooth increase in the polarization of the emitted light was observed. Half-saturation was achieved at a Gal80p concentration of approximately 300 nm. When this experiment was repeated at a peptide concentration of 10 nm, a similar result was obtained (half-saturation at approximately 270 nm), indicating that the system is at equilibrium. Furthermore, a double reciprocal plot (1/mA versus1/[Gal80]) of these data was linear (data not shown). When the labeled peptide was titrated with a GST fusion protein unrelated to Gal80p, little binding was observed even at high protein concentrations (Fig. 1 A). We conclude that the G80BP-A peptide binds Gal80p specifically with a KD of approximately 3 × 10−7m. For comparative purposes, the same experiment was repeated with a fluorescein-labeled 54 amino acid peptide (≈20 nm) that contains the native Gal4 AD (27.Fancy D. Kodadek T. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11953-11960Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). In this case, apparently stoichiometric binding to Gal80p was observed, as evidenced by the sharp saturation of binding. Thus, the trueKD of the Gal4 AD·Gal80p complex must be significantly lower than the 25 nm value measured in this experiment. Unfortunately it was not possible to carry out binding studies at lower AD concentrations to achieve true equilibrium conditions. The AD-containing peptide did not label efficiently with fluorescein, and further reduction of the AD concentration exceeded the sensitivity of the instrument. The alternative strategy of competing the Gal80p·AD complex with unlabeled, excess G80BP-A (see below) was precluded by the limited solubility of the peptide. Therefore, we conclude that the native Gal4 AD binds Gal80p at least 20 times more avidly than G80BP-A under identical conditions, but the difference could be even larger. To address the specificity of binding of G80BP-A to Gal80p further, pull-down experiments were conducted (Fig.2 A). Gal80p with an NH2-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli, and a cleared extract was incubated with glutathione agarose-bound GST-G80BP-A. His6-Gal80p comprised about 1% of the total soluble protein in the extract. The column was washed thoroughly, and the bound proteins were then eluted with glutathione. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in lane 7 of Fig.2 A, the G80BP-A-containing fusion protein retained only two proteins out of this mixture. One had an electrophoretic mobility identical to purified His6-Gal80p, and the other was of slightly lower apparent molecular mass. Subsequent characterization revealed that the lower band is a proteolysis product of His6-Gal80 lacking the NH2-terminal tag (data not shown). No other significant bands were observed in the eluted fraction, indicating highly specific binding to Gal80p. An identical experiment using GST (lane 5, Fig. 2 A) or other GST-peptide fusions not selected to bind Gal80p (data not shown) did not result in retention of Gal80p. The result of the pull-down experiment using G80BP-A was very similar to those obtained using a GST fusion protein containing the native Gal4 AD (lane 9, Fig.2 A). In this case as well, only the two forms of Gal80p were retained from the crude extract. A similar set of experiments carried out with G80BP-B provided results essentially identical to those obtained with G80BP-A (Fig. 2 B). These data demonstrate that the selected peptides bind Gal80p with excellent specificity, apparently rivaling that of the native Gal4 AD. To determine if G80BP-A and the native AD bind Gal80p in a similar fashion, a competitive binding experiment was carried out using fluorescence polarization in which fluorescein-labeled G80BP-A was saturated with Gal80p, and then this solution was titrated with unlabeled GST-Gal4 AD fusion protein. If binding is competitive, a reduction in the polarization of the emitted light would be expected as the AD concentration is increased, reflecting dissociation of the bound peptide. As shown in Fig. 3, this was exactly the result obtained. When the G80BP-A·Gal80p complex was challenged with GST alone, no dissociation was observed. This finding of competitive binding was not unexpected. It is often the case that phage display or other selection protocols yield peptides that recognize a surface of the target protein that interacts with native partners (see Ref. 29.Fairbrother W.J. Christinger H.W. Cochran A.G. Fuh G. Keenan C.J. Quan C. Shriver S.K. Tom J.Y.K. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17754-17764Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and references therein). This is probably because these surfaces are more “bindable” than other regions of the protein and represent hotspots for interactions. In any case, these data suggest that the selected peptide and the Gal4 AD bind the same or overlapping sites on Gal80p, although an allosteric model cannot be ruled out. The same type of competition experiment was also done using unlabeled G80BP-B. As seen in Fig. 3, this also resulted in competition of labeled G80BP-A from Gal80p, indicating that the two selected peptides bind the same, or overlapping, sites on the repressor, as expected. The less efficient competition compared with the native AD reflects the lower affinity of the peptide for Gal80p. The experiments presented above indicate that G80BP-A and G80BP-B mimic the properties of the native Gal4 AD with respect to binding Gal80p in vitro, although their affinity for the repressor is much lower. Having established this fact, we then proceeded to address the central point of this study, which was to determine if these peptides, selected solely on the basis of binding to Gal80p, can activate transcription in vivo when fused to a sequence-specific DNA binding domain. DNA encoding G80BP-A or G80BP-B was inserted into the yeast expression vector pGBT9. The final construct encodes a fusion of the Gal4 DNA binding and dimerization domains (residues 1–147) (30.Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) to the selected peptide. Expression was driven by the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. The resultant plasmid was transformed into thegal4/gal80 yeast strain Y190, which contains an integrated Gal4-responsive lacZ reporter gene. The activity of Gal4(1–147)-G80BP-A and some control constructs was assessed qualitatively by blue/white screening of colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside plates (Table II).Table IIResults of a blue/white screening assay to determine the activation potential of the Gal80p-binding peptides in yeastPolypeptide expressedColorGal4(1–147)WhiteGal4(1–147)-G80BP-ABlueGal4(1–147)-(G80BP-A)2BlueGal4(1–147)-(G80BP-B)2BlueGal4(1–147)-Gal4 ADBlueGal4(1–147)-(20un)2WhiteGal4(1–147)-(JZ15)2WhiteIn each case, Y190 cells (gal4, gal80) which contain a lacZ gene under the control of the GAL1protmoter, were transformed with a high copy number plasmid expressing the polypeptide indicated under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter.

A colony lift followed by a filter assay were employed to determine the color of the colonies in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. Open table in a new tab In each case, Y190 cells (gal4, gal80) which contain a lacZ gene under the control of the GAL1protmoter, were transformed with a high copy number plasmid expressing the polypeptide indicated under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. For each transformation, 8–10 colonies were transferred to fresh SC-Trp-glucose plates and grown overnight. A colony lift followed by a filter assay were employed to determine the color of the colonies in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells transformed with plasmids expressing Gal4(1–147) fused to G80BP-A formed blue colonies, indicating that this peptide can indeed function as an AD in vivo. A positive control in which the native Gal4 AD was fused to Gal4(1–147) also formed blue colonies, whereas a negative control in which only Gal4(1–147) was expressed formed white colonies, as expected. We also constructed plasmids that expressed fusions of Gal4(1–147) to two other peptides (“20un” and JZ15, see Table I), which were selected by phage display to bind proteins other than Gal80 (Gal4p and human interleukin 1β, respectively). 2Y. Han and T. Kodadek, unpublished results. These peptides did not support detectable activation, as evidenced by the formation of white colonies. This demonstrates that not any protein-binding peptide can function as an AD. To obtain a more quantitative feeling more the potency of the Gal80-binding peptides as ADs, several Gal4(1–147) fusion constructs were made, expressed in yeast, and their activity was measured using liquid β-galactosidase assays. These are shown in Fig.4A. lacZ expression in cells containing Gal4(1–147) was barely detectable (0.06 unit/min), whereas cells containing Gal4(1–147) fused to the native Gal4 AD exhibited robust lacZ expression (45 units). lacZexpression mediated by Gal4(1–147)-G80BP-A was much weaker (1 unit) than that supported by the native AD. But this activity was well above the background level exhibited by Gal4(1–147) alone (≈17-fold increase in lacZ expression over the basal level), consistent with the plate assay results. Gal4(1–147)-G80BP-B had an activity about half that of Gal4(1–147)-G80BP-A. Addition of one or two copies of the control peptide 20un to the COOH terminus of Gal4(1–147) did not result in any detectable activation of transcription. It is often the case that the activity of weak ADs can be increased by fusing multiple copies to a DNA binding domain. This may reflect their ability to interact with more than one target in the holoenzyme and/or chromatin remodeling machines (31.Lin Y.S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine if this is the case for the selected peptides, two copies of G80BP-A or G80BP-B were fused to Gal4(1–147), and the activities of these fusions was determined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the direct repeat was a much more potent activator, exhibiting about one-third the activity of a single native Gal4 AD and driving transcription to levels about 200-fold higher than the basal rate. However, analysis of another two peptide-containing activators revealed that what appeared to be a synergistic effect instead seems to be the result of steric/spacing issues in these fusion proteins. For example, although two copies of 20un do not activate transcription, Gal4(1–147)-20un-G80BP-A is much more active than the analogous construct lacking the control peptide (10-fold difference; Fig. 4 A). However, reversing the order of 20un and G80BP-A resulted in an activity slightly lower than that of Gal4(1–147)-G80BP-A. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the data using various G80BP-B-containing constructs (Fig. 4 A). Thus, when the Gal80p-binding peptides are separated from Gal4(1–147) appropriately, they can act as quite potent activators, increasinglacZ expression 100–150-fold above the basal level. This argues strongly that binding to Gal80p and the ability to activate transcription are closely linked properties. To test the ability of the selected peptides to interact with Gal80in vivo the yeast expression vector YEp351Gal80 (containing a native GAL80 promoter) was also transformed into Y190 cells. YEp351Gal80 is a multicopy plasmid. Fig. 4 B shows that activation mediated by G80BP-A or G80BP-B in a number of different fusion protein contexts was repressed significantly when Gal80p was expressed, although for the single case of Gal4(1–147)-20un-G80BP-B, the effect was marginal. The level of Gal80p-repressed transcription supported by the selected peptides and the native Gal4 AD was similar. This result demonstrates that G80BP-A and G80BP-B are able to interact with Gal80p in vivo and that this interaction can inhibit transactivation. The fact that the G80p-binding peptides function as ADs in vivo implies that they can bind coactivators. To test this directly, we used fluorescence polarization to see if an association between G80BP-A and the NH2-terminal domain of Gal11 protein (Gal11p) could be detected. Gal11p is a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (32.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and is required for the full expression of a large number of yeast genes (33.Suzuki Y. Nogi Y. Abe A. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34.Long R.M. Mylin L.M. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2311-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), including the GAL genes. Kim and co-workers have recently published evidence implicating Gal11p as the prime target of the yeast GCN4 transactivator (35.Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and we have evidence that this may also be the case for Gal4p, with the NH2-terminal region of Gal11p being the specific site of contact. 3S. Yang, C.-J. Jeong, S. A. Johnston, and T. Kodadek, in preparation. As shown in Fig. 5 A, when fluoresceinated G80BP-A was titrated with recombinant Gal11(1–350), a strong increase in polarization was observed. Half-saturation occurred at approximately 1.2 μm Gal11(1–350), and the fact that a double reciprocal plot of these titration data was linear (Fig.5 B) suggested that this value is an accurate representation of the KD of this complex under these conditions. It is important to note that under these conditions G80BP-A does not bind any protein in a promiscuous fashion, as evidenced by the highly selective retention of Gal80p out of an E. coliextract (Fig. 2 A) and the lack of binding to GST in a fluorescence polarization experiment (Fig. 1 A). We therefore conclude that G80BP-A has a specific affinity for a coactivator. Although we cannot say that Gal11p is the target of G80BP-A in vivo, the important conclusion is that a peptide selected solely on the basis of Gal80p binding interacts directly with a known coactivator, suggesting that Gal80p and Gal11p have chemically related binding surfaces. The central result of this study is that two peptides, selected solely for their ability to bind the Gal80 repressor in vitro, are able to function as potent AD mimics in yeast. Thus, we conclude that the ability of a molecule to bind Gal80p and its ability to act as an AD are fundamentally related. It seems extremely unlikely that this concordance between Gal80p binding and activation potential is a coincidence, particularly because at least two other peptides selected to bind proteins other than Gal80p have no activation potential at all. Of course, these experiments do not strictly speak to whether the native Gal4 AD uses similar chemistry to bind Gal80p and coactivators. It remains possible that the protein binding properties of the selected peptides and the native AD are distinct. This seems unlikely however, because G80BP-A binds a coactivator implicated in mediating transcription by Gal4p (Fig. 5), and both peptides appear to bind the same site on Gal80p recognized by the Gal4 AD. Nonetheless, an unequivocal resolution of this issue will require structural data on repressor and coactivator complexes of the native AD. This study focused on using peptide library-based methods to probe the chemical relationship of the binding sites of particular coactivators and repressors, i.e. is it likely that the Gal4 AD employs similar chemistry to bind both kinds of partners? However, the same method could be applied in any case where a single domain of a polypeptide is known to interact with more than one other protein. In general, if a peptide selected to bind one protein binds others or exhibits an activity not obviously tied to its method of isolation, this provides strong preliminary evidence that these different binding events are related. Because the phage display-based technique is very rapid, it could be used as an initial screen prior to carrying out more time-consuming mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking or label transfer studies to probe the native system in more detail.

https://openalex.org/W2054647522,"The depressant actions of ethanol on central nervous system activity appear to be mediated by its actions on a number of important membrane associated ion channels including theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor. Although no specific site of action for ethanol on the NMDA receptor has been found, previous studies suggest that the ethanol sensitivity of the receptor may be affected by intracellular C-terminal domains of the receptor that regulate the calcium-dependent inactivation of the receptor. In the present study, co-expression of the NR2A subunit and an NR1 subunit that lacks the alternatively spliced intracellular C1 cassette did not reduce the effects of ethanol on channel function as measured by patch-clamp electrophysiology. Full inhibition was also observed in cells expressing an NR1 subunit truncated at the end of the C0 domain (NR1863stop). However, the inhibitory effects of ethanol were reduced by expression of an NR1 C0 domain deletion mutant (NR1Δ839–863), truncation mutant (NR1858stop), or a triple-point mutant (Arg to Ala, Lys to Ala, and Asn to Ala at 859–861) previously shown to significantly reduce calcium-dependent inactivation. A similar reduction in the effects of ethanol on wild-type NR1/2A but not NR1/2B or NR1/2C receptors was observed after co-expression of full-length or truncated human skeletal muscle α-actinin-2 proteins that produce a functional knockout of the C0 domain. The effects of ethanol on hippocampal and cortical NMDA-induced currents were similarly attenuated in low calcium recording conditions, suggesting that a C0 domain-dependent process may confer additional ethanol sensitivity to NMDA receptors.

Chandler L.J. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2345-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ethanol sensitivity of native neuronal NMDA receptors also varies with age and with the brain region studied, suggesting that differences in the subunit expression pattern of NMDA subunits may be an important determinant of ethanol sensitivity (8.Simson P.E. Criswell H.E. Breese G.R. Brain Res. 1993; 607: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9.Lovinger D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 164-172PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by findings from several studies with recombinant NMDA receptors that show that receptors composed of NR1/2A or NR1/2B subunits are more sensitive to ethanol than those composed of NR1/2C or NR1/2D subunits (3.Masood K. Wu C. Brauneis U. Weight F.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6.Chu B. Anantharam V. Treistman S.N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the ethanol sensitivity of NMDA receptors may be determined in part by the subunit makeup of the receptor, there is also evidence that posttranslational processes may influence the overall sensitivity of these receptors to ethanol. Previous studies in this laboratory showed that the inhibition by ethanol of recombinant NR1/2A receptors can be modulated by a calcium-dependent process involving the C terminus of the NR1 subunit (10.Mirshahi T. Anders D.L. Ronald K.M. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In oocytes, the ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors composed of NR1/2A subunits was dramatically enhanced when recordings were performed in extracellular medium containing elevated concentrations of calcium. This effect was observed in receptors expressing the NR1-1a splice variant, which contains both the C1 and C2 cassettes, as well as with those receptors containing the NR1-4a splice variant, which lacks these domains. In contrast, deletion of the entire intracellular C terminus of the NR1-1a subunit or injection of oocytes with the fast calcium chelator BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid) abolished the enhanced ethanol inhibition of NMDA responses observed under high (10 mm) calcium recording conditions and significantly reduced the degree of ethanol inhibition observed in normal (1.8 mm) calcium containing solution. A similar reduction in ethanol sensitivity was observed in HEK 293 cells expressing an NR1 subunit lacking the C0 domain. Taken together, these results suggested that a portion of the ethanol sensitivity of NMDA receptors is calcium-dependent and involves amino acids contained between the fourth transmembrane region of the receptor and the alternatively spliced C1 cassette of the NR1 subunit. This 30 amino acid region of the NR1 subunit has been termed the C0 domain and is conserved among all NR1 splice variants. It has been shown to bind cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as α-actinin-2, in a calcium-dependent manner, suggesting that it is important for communication between the receptor and the actin cytoskeleton. Displacement of α-actinin-2 binding to the NR1 subunit by calmodulin during receptor activation has recently been suggested to underlie the calcium-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptor currents observed in both neurons and transfected cells (11.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S.

In the present study, we have further investigated the role of the C0 domain in regulating the ethanol inhibition of recombinant NMDA receptors using whole cell patch clamp analysis of transfected HEK 293 cells. This approach was selected because HEK 293 cells display no noticeable endogenous calcium-activated currents that can interfere with the analysis of calcium-permeable recombinant ion channels such as NMDA receptors. This is especially important with respect to the study of the mechanisms of action of ethanol because oocytes express calcium-dependent chloride channels that can be inhibited by ethanol under certain conditions (16.Clayton R. Woodward J.J. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 36: 67-74Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Fetal-Clone II; Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cells were harvested from feeder flasks 24–48 h prior to transfection and plated onto sterile 35 mm culture dishes for whole-cell patch clamp analysis. Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared exactly according to Smothers et al. (17.Smothers C.T. Mrotek J.J. Lovinger D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1214-1222PubMed Google Scholar). The rat NR1 (NR1a), NR2A, and NR2C cDNA clones contained in the pBluescript vector were generous gifts of Dr. S. Nakanishi, and the rat NR1-2a splice variant cDNA was obtained from Dr. S. Heinemann. These cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). The C0 deletion mutant (NR1Δ839–863) generated from the NR1-2a splice variant was a gift from Dr. R. Huganir. The NR1863stop and NR1-PM1 (Arg to Ala, Lys to Ala, and Asn to Ala at 859–861) mutants were kindly provided by Dr. B. Vissel and Dr. J. J. Krupp. The NR1 C-terminal deletion mutant NR1858stop was constructed by replacing the indicated amino acid on the full-length NR1-1a subunit with a stop codon using site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (10.Mirshahi T. Anders D.L. Ronald K.M. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The human skeletal muscle α-actinin-2 cDNA in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. A. Beggs. This cDNA was used as a polymerase chain reaction template to construct a green fluorescent protein (GFP)1-tagged fusion protein in the pGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH). The fusion protein consisted of the central rod domain of α-actinin-2 (amino acids 344–745) followed in-frame by the coding sequence of the GFP. The pGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH) had been previously altered by site-directed mutagenesis (S65T; iGFP) to intensify and red-shift the fluorescent signal (18.Anders D.L. Blevins T. Sutton G. Chandler L.J. Woodward J.J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For transfections, HEK 293 cells grown to approximately 50% confluency were incubated with 1 μg each of the desired cDNAs for 6 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Except in those studies with the truncated α-actinin-2/GFP fusion protein, the iGFP vector was co-transfected with the other subunits in order to easily identify transfected cells. Following transfections, cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in serum-containing minimal essential medium for 24–48 h prior to analysis. The minimal essential medium was supplemented with ketamine (0.5 mm; Fort Dodge Laboratories, Inc.; Fort Dodge, IA) to prevent excitotoxicity due to expression of functional NMDA receptors (19.Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The ketamine solution was removed by extensive washing prior to electrophysiological analysis. Transfected HEK 293 cells or neurons were bathed in extracellular medium at room temperature containing the following: NaCl, 135 mm; KCl, 5.4 mm; CaCl2, 1.8 mm; HEPES, 5 mm; glucose, 10 mm, pH 7.2, adjusted to 325 mosm with sucrose. In experiments with cultured neurons, tetrodotoxin (100 nm) was included in the external solution to block spontaneous activity. For HEK 293 cells, patch electrodes (2–6 MΩ) were filled with recording solution containing the following: CsCl, 140 mm;MgCl2, 1 mm; EGTA, 0.1 mm; HEPES, 10 mm, pH 7.25. In some experiments, an ATP-regenerating system was included in the internal solution (20.Rosenmund C. Westbrook G.L. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 705-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For neurons, the internal solution contained the following:N-methyl-glucamine, 100 mm; CsCl, 40 mm; MgCl2, 2 mm; EGTA, 10 mm; HEPES, 10 mm; Mg-ATP, 2 mm, pH 7.3. A rapid perfusion system (Warner Instruments, SF-77A) was used to switch between control solution and solutions containing NMDA (10–100 μm) in the absence or presence of ethanol. Glycine (10–50 μm) was added to all solutions to prevent glycine-dependent desensitization, and recordings were generally completed within 5–10 min of seal formation, which reduced the extent of glycine-independent desensitization. Ethanol was applied to cells 30–45 s prior to co-application with agonist. The time required for solution exchange was measured using the change in electrode tip potential when stepping between extracellular solutions of different ionic strength. The 10%:90% rise time in currents recorded when switching between these different solutions was approximately 8 ms. Currents were obtained using Pulse Control software running under the IgorPro graphics platform on a Macintosh G3 computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) in combination with an Axon 200 B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Whole-cell currents were filtered at 5 kHz, low pass-filtered at 0.2 kHz, and digitized at 1 kHz. Currents were measured using Axograph 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were analyzed for statistical significance using one-way analysis of variance with post hoc testing at a significance level of 0.05. As shown in Fig. 1 A, HEK 293 cells transfected with NMDA subunits produce functional receptors that are activated by the agonists NMDA and glycine. Wild-type NR1-1a/2A receptors show desensitizing responses during agonist application (steady state to peak ratio, 0.56 ± 0.03; n = 33). Under the recording conditions used in this study, the majority of this desensitization is due to calcium-dependent inactivation (15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1680-1688PubMed Google Scholar) because it is largely lost in cells transfected with NR1 subunits that lack a functional C0 domain (Fig.1 A, NR1Δ839–863, NR1858stop, and NR1-PM1) or under conditions of reduced extracellular calcium (data not shown). Fig. 1 A also shows that ethanol inhibits peak and steady state NMDA-mediated currents and that this inhibition is readily reversed upon washout. NMDA currents displayed a modest rundown because the amplitude of the washout current was usually slightly less than that of the first control current. The extent of this rundown for wild-type NR1-1a/2A receptors averaged 5% over the three stimulation protocol used (S.E. = 0.03; range, 0–25%;n = 23). To account for this rundown, amplitudes of control and washout currents were averaged and used to determine the percentage of inhibition produced by ethanol. As shown in Fig. 1 B, steady state inhibition of NMDA-induced currents by 100 mm ethanol was approximately 44% in cells expressing wild-type NR1-1a/2A subunits. Ethanol (100 mm) inhibited NR1-1a/2A receptors to a similar degree (42.3 ± 2.3%;n = 14; steady state to peak ratio, 0.61 ± 0.04;n = 14; mean ± S.E.) when currents were activated by 10 μm NMDA and 10 μm glycine. Under these conditions, current inactivation is mediated almost entirely by calcium-dependent inactivation (21.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1680-1688PubMed Google Scholar). The NR1-1a splice variant used in these experiments contains all three domains of the C terminus and is expressed in most brain neurons. The NR1-2a splice variant lacks the C1 cassette that has been shown to contain consensus phosphorylation sites for both protein kinase C and protein kinase A, as well as a binding site for calmodulin (11.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 22.Tingley W.G. Ehlers M.D. Kameyama K. Doherty C. Ptak J.B. Riley C.T. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5157-5166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Bshows that expression of NR1-2a/2A subunits that lack this domain did not significantly alter the inhibitory effect of 100 mmethanol on steady state NMDA currents. The extent of current desensitization of NR1-2a/2A receptors was also not significantly different from that obtained with NR1-1a subunits (steady state to peak ratio, 0.59 ± 0.04; n = 15; mean ± S.E.). Our previous study showed that that truncation of the entire C terminus of the NR1 subunit significantly reduced the inhibition of NMDA-activated currents by 100 mm ethanol (10.Mirshahi T. Anders D.L. Ronald K.M. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the calcium-dependent inactivation of NR1/2A receptors is abolished by deletion of just the last five residues (859–863) of the NR1 C0 domain (15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of 100 mm ethanol was tested on cells expressing NR2A and an NR1 subunit truncated just prior to this five-amino acid stretch (NR1858stop). These receptors also displayed little current inactivation (steady state to peak ratio, 0.95 ± 0.02;n = 11; mean ± S.E.), as well as a reduced inhibition by 100 mm ethanol (31.6 ± 2.3%;n = 11; mean ± S.E.) as compared with wild-type receptors. The reduction in the ethanol sensitivity of NMDA receptors expressing a C-terminal truncated NR1 subunit was also observed at lower ethanol concentrations. For example, wild-type NR1/2A receptors were inhibited by 25 and 50 mm ethanol by 22.2 ± 2.8% (mean ± S.E.; n = 9) and 29.6 ± 4.5% (mean ± S.E.;n = 8); respectively. This inhibition was reduced to 10.9 ± 2.3% (mean ± S.E.; n = 10) and 19.9 ± 1.6% (mean ± S.E.; n = 11) for 25 and 50 mm ethanol in cells expressing NR1858stop/2A receptors. In order to verify that the decrease in ethanol inhibition was specifically associated with loss of the C0 domain, a deletion mutant lacking the entire C0 domain but containing the C2 domain (NR1Δ839–863) was expressed with the NR2A. As with other NR1 subunits lacking a functional C0 domain, these receptors also showed no appreciable current decay during agonist application (Fig.1 B). In addition, currents carried by this C0 deletion mutant were significantly less sensitive to 100 mm ethanol as compared with the NR1-2a splice variant that contains the C0 and C2 domains. Overall, there was no significant difference in ethanol inhibition between the C0 domain truncation (NR1858stop) or deletion (NR1Δ839–863) mutants. To further explore the requirement for a functional C0 domain, a triple-point NR1 C0 mutant (NR1-PM1) was expressed with the NR2A subunit and tested for ethanol sensitivity. This mutant contains alanines at positions 859, 860, and 861 of the NR1 C0 domain (Fig.1 A, top panel). These substitutions have been shown to substantially reduce both calmodulin binding and calcium-dependent inactivation (15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, NR1-PM1/2A receptors also displayed reduced current decay (steady state to peak ratio, 0.78 ± 0.02; n = 8; mean ± S.E.), as well as a reduced sensitivity to ethanol (Fig.1 B). Finally, to demonstrate that a functional C0 domain alone is sufficient to confer high ethanol sensitivity, a truncation mutant containing just the C0 domain (NR1863stop) was co-expressed with the NR2A subunit. As shown in Fig. 1, this mutant displayed wild-type current inactivation (steady state to peak ratio, 0.51 ± 0.05; n = 8) and full sensitivity to ethanol. These results suggest that a functional C0 domain of the NR1 subunit is important in mediating a significant fraction of the ethanol inhibition of steady state NMDA currents under conditions of normal extracellular calcium. Co-expression of α-actinin-2 has previously been shown to significantly reduce or eliminate the degree of calcium-dependent inactivation of NR1/2A receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells (14.Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells transfected with the full-length α-actinin-2 and probed with a monoclonal antibody directed against α-actinin-2 (EA-53; Sigma) showed robust expression of this protein, whereas nontransfected cells displayed little to no staining. 2J. J. Woodward, unpublished observation. As previously reported (15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the degree of NMDA current inactivation was significantly attenuated in cells expressing the full-length or truncated forms of the α-actinin-2 protein, as shown by the tracings in Fig. 2. The degree of ethanol inhibition of NMDA currents in these cells was also reduced as compared with non-actinin-transfected cells and resembled that for NR1 subunits lacking a functional C0 domain (Fig. 2 and Fig. 1 B). The effect of ethanol on NR1/2B and NR1/2C receptors expressed with and without the α-actinin-2/GFP fusion protein was determined to assess the role of the NR2 subunit in mediating this effect. Note that 200 μm glutamate (with 50 μm glycine) was used to activate currents in cells expressing NR1/2C subunits because those elicited by 100 μm NMDA were sometimes small and variable. As shown in Fig. 3, ethanol (100 mm) inhibited NR1/2B receptors by approximately 34% and those composed of NR1/2C subunits by approximately 20%. Co-expression of the α-actinin-2/GFP fusion protein did not significantly alter the ethanol inhibition of either NR1/2B or NR1/2C receptors. Finally, we investigated whether the ethanol inhibition of native NMDA receptors expressed in cultured neurons would be altered under conditions designed to reduce the extent of calcium-dependent inactivation. As shown in Fig. 4, pyramidal neurons in hippocampal cultures were exposed to a 5-s stimulation with NMDA (100 μm) and glycine (10 μm) in the absence or presence of 100 mm ethanol. In extracellular media containing 2 mm calcium, NMDA stimulation induced a significant degree of current desensitization. This desensitization was significantly reduced when the extracellular solution was switched to one containing 0.2 mm calcium, suggesting that it was due primarily to calcium-dependent inactivation. In normal (2 mm) calcium-containing extracellular media, ethanol (100 mm) inhibited steady state NMDA currents in hippocampal neurons by approximately 35%. This was reduced to approximately 22% when neurons were recorded in solutions containing 0.2 mmcalcium. A similar reduction in ethanol sensitivity was observed when HEK 293 cells expressing NR1-1a/2A subunits were tested under conditions of reduced extracellular calcium (Fig. 4, shaded bars). Previous studies from this laboratory showed that the effect of ethanol on NR1/2A receptors expressed in oocytes was attenuated under conditions that prevented or reduced increases in intracellular calcium upon activation of the NMDA receptor (4.Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10.Mirshahi T. Anders D.L. Ronald K.M. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of calcium-impermeable NR1 mutants (NR1616R), recording with a divalent cation-free extracellular solution or co-injection of oocytes with BAPTA all significantly reduced the inhibition of NMDA-mediated currents by ethanol. These treatments did not alter the ethanol sensitivity of NR2C containing receptors that show appreciably less inhibition to ethanol than NR2A containing receptors under normal recording conditions (4.Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6.Chu B. Anantharam V. Treistman S.N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The results from these studies suggested that a calcium-dependent process involving an intracellular domain of an NMDA subunit was required for the expression of the full ethanol sensitivity of NR1/2A receptors. This hypothesis was strengthened by the observation that NMDA receptors composed of NR2A and a C-terminal truncated NR1 receptor (NR1838stop) showed reduced inhibition to ethanol in either oocytes or HEK cells under conditions of normal or elevated extracellular calcium (10.Mirshahi T. Anders D.L. Ronald K.M. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The intracellular C terminus of the NR1 subunit is characterized by several domains that appear to play an important role in receptor localization and function of the NMDA receptor. The C1 cassette, which is the product of the alternatively spliced exon 21, contains consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and protein kinase A, as well as a binding site for calmodulin. The C0 domain also contains a site that is competed for by calmodulin and the actin binding protein α-actinin-2. Recent studies in HEK 293 cells have suggested that a calcium-dependent displacement of α-actinin-2 by calmodulin underlies the calcium-dependent inactivation of NR1/2A receptors that occurs during agonist stimulation (14.Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inactivation, which is also observed in neurons, is distinct from other forms of NMDA receptor regulation, such as glycine-dependent and glycine-independent desensitization. Calcium-dependent inactivation in HEK 293 cells expressing NR1/2A subunits was reduced or eliminated by co-expression of increasing amounts of human skeletal muscle α-actinin-2 (14.Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that receptor activity may be dynamically controlled via calcium-dependent interactions with the C0 domain of the NR1 subunit. In combination with previous findings from this laboratory, these findings also indicate that this domain may be an important determinant of the overall ethanol sensitivity of specific subtypes of NMDA receptors. This hypothesis is further supported by the results of the present study that examined the specific involvement of the C0 domain in determining the ethanol sensitivity of NMDA receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. The effects of ethanol on steady state NMDA currents were significantly reduced in recombinant receptors containing NR1 subunits with a truncated or altered C0 domain or when recordings were carried out in low extracellular calcium. The effect observed in low extracellular calcium was also observed for NMDA responses in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that native NMDA receptors are subject to this calcium-dependent modulation of ethanol sensitivity as well. The effect of C-terminal truncation in the HEK cells was C0-domain-dependent because the ethanol sensitivity was not altered by expression of receptors lacking just the C1 domain that has also been shown to contain a high affinity calmodulin binding site (11.Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Interestingly, truncation of the NR1 subunit just past the last transmembrane domain did not completely abolish the inhibitory effect of ethanol, suggesting additional sites of action for ethanol on the receptor. Results from mutagenesis studies have identified several amino acids located in transmembrane domains 2 and 3 of γ-aminobutyric acid, type a and glycine receptors that regulate the alcohol and anesthetic sensitivity of those receptors (23.Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.A. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Although the overall amino acid similarity between γ-aminobutyric acid, type A/glycine receptors and NMDA receptors is small, it is possible that similar transmembrane sites are important in defining an additional site of action for ethanol on ionotropic glutamate receptors. The reduction in the ethanol sensitivity of NR1 containing NMDA receptors was correlated with the loss of amino acids previously shown to be required for both calmodulin and α-actinin-2 binding to the C0 domain. A previous study showed that residues 859–863 of the NR1 subunit were essential for both calmodulin and α-actinin-2 binding to the C0 domain (15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants lacking these amino acids or those containing alanine substitutions in this region (NR1-PM1) also showed a loss of calcium-dependent inactivation. In the present study, deletion or substitution of these C0 domain amino acids by alanine also reduced the inhibitory effects of ethanol on NMDA-mediated currents. Importantly, expression of NR1 subunits truncated at the end of the C0 domain showed full inactivation as well as high ethanol sensitivity, supporting the hypothesis that the C0 domain is both necessary and sufficient to confer additional ethanol sensitivity to NR1/2A receptors. Single channel studies have shown that the effects of ethanol on wild-type NMDA receptors are due primarily to decreases in open probability (P o) and mean open time of the channel (24.Wright J.M. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Brain Res. 1996; 738: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The estimated open probability of a series of C0 truncation mutants varied up to 2-fold depending on the length of the C0 domain that remained (15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high range ofP o was found for wild-type NR1 subunits and those truncated just past the C0 domain (NR1868 stop). Those lacking amino acids required for calmodulin and α-actinin-2 binding (amino acids 859–863) had a lower P oand were suggested to be permanently inactivated. Paradoxically, deletion of the entire C0 domain (NR1838stop) resulted in receptors that did not exhibit calcium-dependent inactivation but had a P o similar to that of the wild-type NR1. In this and our previous study, the reduction in the effects of ethanol on NMDA currents was similar for NMDA receptors truncated either near the last membrane spanning region (NR1838stop) or those that were truncated just prior to the last five amino acids of the C0 domain (NR1858stop). These results suggest that the reduction in ethanol sensitivity of mutant NR1 subunits is correlated with loss of the ability of the receptor to inactivate rather than a result of the receptor being permanently inactivated. The requirement for a functional C0 domain to confer high ethanol sensitivity in wild-type NR1/2A receptors is also suggested from the results of studies involving co-expression of α-actinin-2 proteins. In those studies, the effects of ethanol on HEK cells expressing wild-type NR1/2A NMDA receptors and full-length or truncated α-actinin-2 proteins was similar to that produced by deletion or truncation of the NR1 C0 domain. These results suggest that overexpression of α-actinin-2 in these cells may have produced a functional block of the C0 domain and reduced ethanol inhibition by interfering with the calcium-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors. The loss of high ethanol sensitivity in cells co-transfected with full-length or truncated α-actinin-2 proteins was associated with a partial reversal of the inactivation of the current, as measured by the steady state to peak ratio. The magnitude of the effect of α-actinin-2 co-expression on NMDA receptor inactivation was nearly identical to that reported in two studies (14.Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15.Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that both used the same α-actinin-2 proteins as in the present study. These results indicate that the ethanol sensitivity of NR1/2A receptors may be significantly affected by the ability of α-actinin-2 to interfere with the calcium-mediated inactivation of the NR1 subunit. Interestingly, α-actinin-2 protein is highly expressed in dendritic spines of brain neurons and is localized in the postsynaptic density of glutamate containing synapses but not to those containing γ-aminobutyric acid (25.Wyszynski M. Kharazia V. Shanghvi R. Rao A. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Weinberg R. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1383-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal expression of the α-actinin-2 protein also shows significant regional variability and is high in pyramidal neurons of the dentate gyrus but low in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and the granule cells of the cerebellum. Previous electrophysiological and biochemical studies have demonstrated considerable variability in the ethanol sensitivity of NMDA-mediated responses in neurons from different brain regions (8.Simson P.E. Criswell H.E. Breese G.R. Brain Res. 1993; 607: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26.Yang X.H. Criswell H.E. Simson P. Moy S. Breese G.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 114-124PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these differences may be explained by differences in the subunit composition of the NMDA receptors, particularly those that contain the NR2C subunit, because NMDA receptors containing this subunit generally show less sensitivity to ethanol than those containing either NR2A or NR2B subunits (3.Masood K. Wu C. Brauneis U. Weight F.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5.Buller A.L. Larson H.C. Morrisett R.A. Monaghan D.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 717-723PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Chu B. Anantharam V. Treistman S.N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, in addition to variations in subunit-composition, the results from the present study suggest that differences in α-actinin-2 expression may also influence the ethanol sensitivity of neuronal receptors containing NR1 and NR2A subunits. In summary, results from the present study demonstrate that a portion of the ethanol sensitivity of NR1/2A receptors involves a calcium-dependent interaction with the C0 domain of the NR1 subunit. It is not clear at this point how this effect is produced, although one simple possibility is that ethanol potentiates the degree of calcium-dependent inactivation of the receptor via a direct enhancement of calmodulin binding to the C0 domain. It is also possible that ethanol does not directly alter the degree of inactivation of the receptor but rather has more pronounced effects on receptors that are capable of inactivating. This seems consistent with the reduced ethanol sensitivity observed for NR1/2B or NR1/2C receptors that do not show appreciable calcium-dependent inactivation and by the lack of effect of the α-actinin-2 protein on these receptors. If the enhanced sensitivity of NR1/2A receptors to ethanol requires a functional calmodulin binding site on the NR1 subunit, it can be hypothesized that other proteins that are also regulated by calmodulin may show sensitivity to ethanol. A recent study found that the ethanol sensitivity of various isoforms of plasma membrane calcium ATPases was positively correlated with their affinity for calmodulin which acts to regulate enzyme activity (27.Cervino V. Benaim G. Carafoli E. Guerini D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29811-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of ethanol to enhance calcium ATPase activity in one isoform was lost after deletion of the calmodulin binding domain of the enzyme. It is of interest to note that many ion channels that appear particularly sensitive to ethanol, including NMDA receptors, calcium-activated potassium channels (28.Dopico A.M. Chu B. Lemos J.R. Treistman S.N. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 35: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and voltage-gated l-type calcium channels (29.Walter H.J. Messing R.O. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 35: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), may also be regulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner (30.Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 645-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Based on the results of the present study, it can be speculated that these calmodulin-dependent processes may confer an additional degree of ethanol sensitivity to these proteins. We thank Dr. J. J. Krupp for useful discussions regarding the data presented in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W1966227162,"Pinin is a cell adhesion-associated and nuclear protein that has been shown to localize in the vicinity of intermediate filament (IF) convergence upon the cytoplasmic face of the desmosomal plaque as well as in the nucleus. The localization of pinin to the desmosomes has been correlated with the reinforcement of intercellular adhesion and increased IF organization. In this study, keratins 18, 8, and 19 were identified to interact with the amino end domain of pinin in a two-hybrid screening. Further truncation analyses indicated that the 2B domain of keratin contains the sequence responsible for interacting with pinin. The amino end of pinin (residues 1–98) is sufficient to bind to keratin. Point mutation analyses revealed two essential residues within the pinin fragment 1–98, leucine 8 and leucine 19, for the interaction with keratin. Finally, in vitro protein overlay binding assays confirmed the direct interaction of the amino end domain of pinin with keratins, while pinin mutant L8P GST fusion protein failed to bind to keratins in the overlay assay. Coupled with our previous morphological observations and transfection studies, these data suggest that pinin may play a role in epithelial cell adhesion and the IF complex through a direct interaction with the keratin filaments.

Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and immuno-EM studies have shown pinin decorating keratin filaments near the cytoplasmic face of the desmosomal plaque in the vicinity of keratin filament convergence upon the desmosome. Our previous studies have revealed a correlation between the placement of pinin at the desmosome and an increase in the organization/stabilization of desmosome-IF1 complex (1.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Presumably, one of the functions of pinin is related to the desmosome-IF complex.The expression level of pinin has been correlated with the overall epithelial phenotype. HEK-293 cells, when transfected with pinin full-length cDNA, exhibited a striking phenotype change from a fibroblast-like spindle shape to cells with extensive cell-cell contact growing in culture as islands (2.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, EM analysis of these transfected cells revealed that the array of epithelial cell junctions was enhanced. In addition, carcinoma-derived cells, when transfected with pinin cDNA, exhibited inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Furthermore, pinin's gene locus and dysregulation of pinin expression in primary tumor tissues suggest that pinin may function as a tumor suppressor in certain types of cancer (3.Degen W.G. Agterbos M.A. Muyrers J.P. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Pinin has also been localized in the nucleus in various tissues as well as in cultured cell lines (5.Brandner J.M. Reidenbach S. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1997; 62: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6.Brandner J.M. Reidenbach S. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7.Ouyang P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Brandner et al. (6.Brandner J.M. Reidenbach S. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has proposed an involvement of pinin in spliceosomal function. The dual location of pinin may be indicative of the involvement of pinin in multiple cellular activities, both at the desmosome and in the nucleus; however, it is not yet clear whether or not the function of pinin in cell-cell adhesion is coordinated with its function in the nucleus. As a step toward understanding the functions of pinin, we sought to identify proteins that interact with pinin. In this study, we focus on the ability of pinin to bind keratin.Keratin filaments are anchored to the lateral plasma membrane at desmosomes. These intercellular junctions reinforce epithelial adhesion as well as integrate the IF network across the entire epithelium. Numerous structure-function studies of desmosomal proteins have revealed details pertaining to the molecular organization of desmosome-IF complex. The relationships among the desmosomal components have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (8.Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 237-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Troyanovsky S.M. Leube R.E. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 263-289PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Fuchs E. Yang Y. Dowling J. Kouklis P. Smith E.

The constitutive components of the desmosome include desmosomal cadherins (desmogleins and desmocollins) and plaque proteins, plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and plakophilin. Among these proteins, desmoplakin (12.Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13.Meng J.J. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Steinert P.M. Ip W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21495-21503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and plakophilin (11.Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14.Hatzfeld M. Kristjansson G.I. Plessmann U. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2259-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to bind directly to keratins. In addition, other peripherally associated desmosome proteins such as plectin (15.Foisner R. Leichtfried F.E. Herrmann H. Small J.V. Lawson D. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,16.Wiche G. Gromov D. Donovan A. Castanon M.J. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), envoplakin/periplakin (17.Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Simon M. Dooley T.P. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18.Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and pinin (1.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are also thought to interact, directly or indirectly, with keratin. Significant questions pertaining to the molecular associations and specific roles of these accessory proteins of the desmosome remain.To identify potential protein-protein interactions of pinin, a two-hybrid screening was performed with either the amino portion or the carboxyl portion of pinin as bait. In this study, we presented a detailed analysis on the binding of the amino end domain of pinin to one group of the identified proteins, the keratins. Keratin 18 (K18), keratin 8 (K8), and keratin 19 (K19) were shown to interact with the amino portion of pinin in the two-hybrid screen. Further truncation analyses defined the specific domain of keratin that mediates the interaction. In addition, the specific domain of pinin molecule sufficient for the interaction was characterized, and through site-directed mutagenesis, the essential residues within this particular domain were investigated. In vitro blot overlay assays were performed to confirm the interaction between the amino end domain of pinin and the keratins. Overall, our data strongly suggest that pinin is capable of binding directly to the intermediate filament proteins, specifically the keratins. These data provide important information on eventual understanding of mechanism by which pinin may affect the assembly/stabilization of epithelial cell adhesion.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present data demonstrating the direct interaction of the amino end domain of pinin with the 2B domain of keratin from simple epithelial cells. These data are not only consistent with our previous morphological observations but provide biochemical support of pinin-IF association.There are four distinct coiled-coil stretches, 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B in the central rod domain of a keratin molecule. Our data indicate that pinin binds to the sequence within the 2B domain of keratin. Coil 1 of keratin exhibited no binding to pinin, strongly supporting the conclusion that the interaction between the 2B domain of keratin and pinin amino-terminal domain is indeed specific and not due to nonspecific interaction with coiled-coil-containing proteins. Direct binding to the rod 2B domain of keratin 18 has been reported for BPAG 2, a hemidesmosome-associated protein (33.Aho S. Uitto J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While desmoplakin has been shown to bind to the head domain of epidermal keratins, such as keratin 1/keratin 10 and keratin 5/keratin 14 (11.Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it has also been shown to be capable of binding to the rod domain of simple epithelial keratin K8/K18 heterodimer (13.Meng J.J. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Steinert P.M. Ip W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21495-21503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The truncation analyses suggested the amino end of pinin (residues 1–98) contained the sequence responsible for binding to keratin. Although short coiled-coils composed of four to five heptad repeats have been reported (31.Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the four and a half heptad repeats at the amino end of pinin are actually sufficient to form a coiled-coil structure in vivo. The amino end of pinin does not contain a “trigger sequence” (34.Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), so it may not participate in the formation of a coiled-coil. However, data derived from point mutation analyses of the amino-terminal domain of pinin suggest the sequence within the heptad repeats is indeed essential for the interaction with keratin. N′ L8P and N′ L19P completely abolished the binding of pinin to K18, whereas N′ L29P did not, suggesting that the heptad repeats located nearer the amino end of pinin may play a more significant role in pinin-keratin interaction.We have suggested that pinin may function as a tumor suppressor based on chromosomal location of pinin and tumor biological analyses (4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of pinin was absent or greatly reduced in certain carcinomas, including renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma. On the other hand, pinin expression was up-regulated in a subset of melanoma tissues (3.Degen W.G. Agterbos M.A. Muyrers J.P. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and a subset of renal cell carcinoma (4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of pinin was correlated with loss of epithelial cell-cell adhesion, while increasing pinin expression by transfection of pinin cDNA was shown to enhance cell-cell adhesion (4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35.Shi Y. Tabesh M. Sugrue S.P. Ivest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, K18 and K8 have long been considered as cytological markers for carcinomas due to their persistent expression in tumor cells derived from simple epithelia and their aberrant expression in malignant progression of nonepithelial cells (36.Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar, 37.Hendrix M.J. Seftor E.A. Chu Y.W. Seftor R.E. Nagle R.B.

Zajchowski D.A. Yaswen P. Suh T. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2319-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies suggested that K18/K8 filaments have a role in the tumorigenicity. For example, in K8-deficient mice, adult animals developed pronounced colorectal hyperplasia (40.Baribault H. Penner J. Iozzo R.V. Wilson-Heiner M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2964-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and the expression of K8 and K18 in human melanoma cell lines resulted in increased invasive and metastatic properties of the cells (37.Hendrix M.J. Seftor E.A. Chu Y.W. Seftor R.E. Nagle R.B. McDaniel K.M. Leong S.P. Yohem K.H. Leibovitz A.M. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Conaway D.H. Welch D.R. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Steveson W. J. Natl. Cancer.

It is tempting to speculate that the tumor suppressor function of pinin is related to the interaction of pinin with keratin.This study did not address the important issue regarding the relationship between the desmosome and pinin. Our initial two-hybrid screens identified other, as of yet uncharacterized, proteins interacting with pinin N′ bait 1–480. 2J. Shi and S. P. Sugrue, unpublished data. One of these clones coded for a protein containing motifs highly homologous to periplakin (18.Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a desmosome-IF-associated protein forming cornified envelope in the stratified epithelial cells. The possibility of pinin connecting to desmosome through this periplakin-like protein is currently being addressed.In summary, we have demonstrated that pinin can bind to keratin 18, keratin 8, and keratin 19. The 2B domain of keratin contains the sequence mediating the interaction with pinin, and the amino end (residues 1–98) of pinin was sufficient to bind keratin. Identification of specific binding sites within pinin for keratin and for other proteins will be an integral step for future studies. We believe that investigation of the function(s) of pinin in cell adhesion and IF organization will greatly contribute to our current knowledge of epithelial cell-cell adhesion. Pinin was first identified to be a protein associated with the desmosome, which was recruited to the preformed desmosomes of the epithelia but absent at nascent desmosomes (1.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and immuno-EM studies have shown pinin decorating keratin filaments near the cytoplasmic face of the desmosomal plaque in the vicinity of keratin filament convergence upon the desmosome. Our previous studies have revealed a correlation between the placement of pinin at the desmosome and an increase in the organization/stabilization of desmosome-IF1 complex (1.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Presumably, one of the functions of pinin is related to the desmosome-IF complex. The expression level of pinin has been correlated with the overall epithelial phenotype. HEK-293 cells, when transfected with pinin full-length cDNA, exhibited a striking phenotype change from a fibroblast-like spindle shape to cells with extensive cell-cell contact growing in culture as islands (2.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1027-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, EM analysis of these transfected cells revealed that the array of epithelial cell junctions was enhanced. In addition, carcinoma-derived cells, when transfected with pinin cDNA, exhibited inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Furthermore, pinin's gene locus and dysregulation of pinin expression in primary tumor tissues suggest that pinin may function as a tumor suppressor in certain types of cancer (3.Degen W.G. Agterbos M.A. Muyrers J.P. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Pinin has also been localized in the nucleus in various tissues as well as in cultured cell lines (5.Brandner J.M. Reidenbach S. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1997; 62: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6.Brandner J.M. Reidenbach S. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7.Ouyang P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Brandner et al. (6.Brandner J.M. Reidenbach S. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has proposed an involvement of pinin in spliceosomal function. The dual location of pinin may be indicative of the involvement of pinin in multiple cellular activities, both at the desmosome and in the nucleus; however, it is not yet clear whether or not the function of pinin in cell-cell adhesion is coordinated with its function in the nucleus. As a step toward understanding the functions of pinin, we sought to identify proteins that interact with pinin. In this study, we focus on the ability of pinin to bind keratin. Keratin filaments are anchored to the lateral plasma membrane at desmosomes. These intercellular junctions reinforce epithelial adhesion as well as integrate the IF network across the entire epithelium. Numerous structure-function studies of desmosomal proteins have revealed details pertaining to the molecular organization of desmosome-IF complex. The relationships among the desmosomal components have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (8.Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 237-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Troyanovsky S.M. Leube R.E. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 263-289PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Fuchs E. Yang Y. Dowling J. Kouklis P. Smith E.

The constitutive components of the desmosome include desmosomal cadherins (desmogleins and desmocollins) and plaque proteins, plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and plakophilin. Among these proteins, desmoplakin (12.Kouklis P.D. Hutton E. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13.Meng J.J. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14.Hatzfeld M. Kristjansson G.I. Plessmann U. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2259-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to bind directly to keratins. In addition, other peripherally associated desmosome proteins such as plectin (15.Foisner R. Leichtfried F.E. Herrmann H. Small J.V. Lawson D. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,16.Wiche G. Gromov D. Donovan A. Castanon M.J. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), envoplakin/periplakin (17.Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Simon M. Dooley T.P. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18.Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and pinin (1.Ouyang P. Sugrue S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are also thought to interact, directly or indirectly, with keratin. Significant questions pertaining to the molecular associations and specific roles of these accessory proteins of the desmosome remain. To identify potential protein-protein interactions of pinin, a two-hybrid screening was performed with either the amino portion or the carboxyl portion of pinin as bait. In this study, we presented a detailed analysis on the binding of the amino end domain of pinin to one group of the identified proteins, the keratins. Keratin 18 (K18), keratin 8 (K8), and keratin 19 (K19) were shown to interact with the amino portion of pinin in the two-hybrid screen. Further truncation analyses defined the specific domain of keratin that mediates the interaction. In addition, the specific domain of pinin molecule sufficient for the interaction was characterized, and through site-directed mutagenesis, the essential residues within this particular domain were investigated. In vitro blot overlay assays were performed to confirm the interaction between the amino end domain of pinin and the keratins. Overall, our data strongly suggest that pinin is capable of binding directly to the intermediate filament proteins, specifically the keratins. These data provide important information on eventual understanding of mechanism by which pinin may affect the assembly/stabilization of epithelial cell adhesion. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present data demonstrating the direct interaction of the amino end domain of pinin with the 2B domain of keratin from simple epithelial cells. These data are not only consistent with our previous morphological observations but provide biochemical support of pinin-IF association.There are four distinct coiled-coil stretches, 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B in the central rod domain of a keratin molecule. Our data indicate that pinin binds to the sequence within the 2B domain of keratin. Coil 1 of keratin exhibited no binding to pinin, strongly supporting the conclusion that the interaction between the 2B domain of keratin and pinin amino-terminal domain is indeed specific and not due to nonspecific interaction with coiled-coil-containing proteins. Direct binding to the rod 2B domain of keratin 18 has been reported for BPAG 2, a hemidesmosome-associated protein (33.Aho S. Uitto J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While desmoplakin has been shown to bind to the head domain of epidermal keratins, such as keratin 1/keratin 10 and keratin 5/keratin 14 (11.Smith E.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it has also been shown to be capable of binding to the rod domain of simple epithelial keratin K8/K18 heterodimer (13.Meng J.J. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Steinert P.M. Ip W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21495-21503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The truncation analyses suggested the amino end of pinin (residues 1–98) contained the sequence responsible for binding to keratin. Although short coiled-coils composed of four to five heptad repeats have been reported (31.Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the four and a half heptad repeats at the amino end of pinin are actually sufficient to form a coiled-coil structure in vivo. The amino end of pinin does not contain a “trigger sequence” (34.Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), so it may not participate in the formation of a coiled-coil. However, data derived from point mutation analyses of the amino-terminal domain of pinin suggest the sequence within the heptad repeats is indeed essential for the interaction with keratin. N′ L8P and N′ L19P completely abolished the binding of pinin to K18, whereas N′ L29P did not, suggesting that the heptad repeats located nearer the amino end of pinin may play a more significant role in pinin-keratin interaction.We have suggested that pinin may function as a tumor suppressor based on chromosomal location of pinin and tumor biological analyses (4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of pinin was absent or greatly reduced in certain carcinomas, including renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma. On the other hand, pinin expression was up-regulated in a subset of melanoma tissues (3.Degen W.G. Agterbos M.A. Muyrers J.P. Bloemers H.P. Swart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and a subset of renal cell carcinoma (4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of pinin was correlated with loss of epithelial cell-cell adhesion, while increasing pinin expression by transfection of pinin cDNA was shown to enhance cell-cell adhesion (4.Shi Y. Sugrue S.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35.Shi Y. Tabesh M. Sugrue S.P. Ivest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, K18 and K8 have long been considered as cytological markers for carcinomas due to their persistent expression in tumor cells derived from simple epithelia and their aberrant expression in malignant progression of nonepithelial cells (36.Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar, 37.Hendrix M.J. Seftor E.A. Chu Y.W. Seftor R.E. Nagle R.B.

Zajchowski D.A. Yaswen P. Suh T. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2319-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies suggested that K18/K8 filaments have a role in the tumorigenicity. For example, in K8-deficient mice, adult animals developed pronounced colorectal hyperplasia (40.Baribault H. Penner J. Iozzo R.V. Wilson-Heiner M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2964-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and the expression of K8 and K18 in human melanoma cell lines resulted in increased invasive and metastatic properties of the cells (37.Hendrix M.J. Seftor E.A. Chu Y.W. Seftor R.E. Nagle R.B. McDaniel K.M. Leong S.P. Yohem K.H. Leibovitz A.M. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Conaway D.H. Welch D.R. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Steveson W. J. Natl. Cancer.

It is tempting to speculate that the tumor suppressor function of pinin is related to the interaction of pinin with keratin.This study did not address the important issue regarding the relationship between the desmosome and pinin. Our initial two-hybrid screens identified other, as of yet uncharacterized, proteins interacting with pinin N′ bait 1–480. 2J. Shi and S. P. Sugrue, unpublished data. One of these clones coded for a protein containing motifs highly homologous to periplakin (18.Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a desmosome-IF-associated protein forming cornified envelope in the stratified epithelial cells. The possibility of pinin connecting to desmosome through this periplakin-like protein is currently being addressed.In summary, we have demonstrated that pinin can bind to keratin 18, keratin 8, and keratin 19. The 2B domain of keratin contains the sequence mediating the interaction with pinin, and the amino end (residues 1–98) of pinin was sufficient to bind keratin. Identification of specific binding sites within pinin for keratin and for other proteins will be an integral step for future studies.

https://openalex.org/W2094940061,"The phosphorylation state of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase (RNAP) II subunit plays an important role in the regulation of transcript elongation. This report examines the sensitivity of RNAP II to dephosphorylation by CTD phosphatase (CTDP) and addresses factors that regulate its sensitivity. The CTDP sensitivity of RNAP IIO in paused elongation complexes on a dC-tailed template does not significantly differ from that of free RNAP IIO. RNAP IIO contained in elongation complexes that initiate transcription from the adenovirus-2 major late promoter in the presence of a nuclear extract is relatively resistant to dephosphorylation. Complexes treated with 1% Sarkosyl remain elongation-competent but demonstrate a 5-fold increase in CTDP sensitivity. Furthermore, the sensitivity of RNAP IIO in both control and Sarkosyl-treated elongation complexes is dependent on their position relative to the start site of transcription. Elongation complexes 11–24 nucleotides downstream are more sensitive to dephosphorylation than complexes 50–150 nucleotides downstream. The incubation of Sarkosyl-treated elongation complexes with nuclear extract restores the original resistance to dephosphorylation. These results suggest that a conformational change occurs in RNAP II as it clears the promoter, which results in an increased resistance to dephosphorylation. Furthermore, the sensitivity to dephosphorylation can be modulated by a factor(s) present in the nuclear extract."
https://openalex.org/W2171109464,"We have discovered a role for coactivators binding to the AF-2 surface of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in its negative effects on gene transcription. We tested nine amino acid residues (Ser235, Ile242, Lys246, Asp253, Ile260, Leu263, Leu417, Leu419, and Glu420) in human VDR which, based on homology to the human thyroid hormone receptor, would be predicted to lie in or near the coactivator-binding site. Mutation of six of these residues in VDR resulted in loss of both the activation (assessed with a transfected DR3 TK luciferase reporter) and inhibition (assessed with an hANPCAT reporter) functions of the receptor when tested in cultured neonatal rat atrial myocytes and HeLa cells. Collectively, these mutations also suppressed association of VDR with the coactivators GRIP1 and steroid receptor coactivator 1 in vitro but had little or no effect on ligand binding, heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor, or association with a VDR-specific DNA recognition element. Co-transfection with GRIP1 or steroid receptor coactivator 1 amplified both the positive and negative responses to wild type VDR but had little or no effect on the functionally impaired mutants described above. The interaction between VDR and GRIP1 proved to be heavily dependent upon the integrity of nuclear box III in the latter protein. Mutations in this region of GRIP1 impaired its ability to associate with VDR in vitro and to amplify VDR activity in intact cells.

The vitamin D-dependent reduction in gene expression is accompanied by a decrease in cell size and protein synthesis. By inference, vitamin D or vitamin D analogues might have utility as therapeutic agents in the management of disorders associated with myocardial hypertrophy. In addition, a better understanding of this inhibitory effect could provide important insights into the basic pathophysiological mechanism(s) which are activated with hypertrophy. The VDR is a member of a family of nuclear receptors each of which have three discrete structural domains. The amino-terminal domain is not conserved among the nuclear receptors and its function is poorly understood, although in certain instances it harbors an activation domain, termed AF-1 (6.Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain, which lies next to the amino-terminal domain, is highly conserved across different receptor species. The carboxyl-terminal domain is the ligand-binding domain (LBD). It also contains the hormone-dependent transcriptional activation function, termed AF-2. In genes which are stimulated by vitamin D3, for example, the osteocalcin gene, the VDR associates through its DNA-binding domain with specific DNA recognition elements in or close to the promoters of the target genes. The canonical sequence preferred by the VDR is composed of a direct repeat of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by three nucleotides (DR3) (7.Umesono K. Murakami K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), which the VDR occupies as a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). In genes which are repressed by vitamin D3 the essential DNA elements are less well defined. There is evidence suggesting that VDR-dependent inhibition of the parathyroid hormone gene promoter is dependent upon two imperfect direct repeats separated by a three-nucleotide spacer (8.Liu S.M. Koszewski N. Lupez M. Malluche H.H. Olivera A. Russell J. Mol. Endo. 1996; 10: 206-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, precise details of the mechanism(s) linking these repeats to the regulation of transcription are lacking. Considerable attention has been devoted to elucidation of the mechanisms governing hormone-dependent transcriptional activation through the AF-2 of the nuclear receptor LBD. While the process remains incompletely understood, an evolving picture suggests that liganded receptors are linked to the transcriptional activation process by a growing number of accessory molecules, termed coactivators which, in many cases, physically contact the receptors and transmit the ligand-dependent signal to the core transcriptional machinery (9.McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 10.Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). GRIP 1 and SRC-1a comprise one class of coactivators. The recently described DRIPs (11.Rachez C. Suldan Z.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which appear to participate in both VDR and TR signal transduction, represent a second class of coactivators that may provide direct contacts with the RNA polymerase II complex (10.Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, Feng et al. (12.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J.

Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) to define the surface residues of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) LBD that are required for association with coactivator proteins and for the hormone-dependent stimulation of transcription. They identified a collection of 6 amino acid residues on the surface which are essential for both coactivator binding and the activation function (12.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Mutation of homologous residues in the estrogen receptor (ER) effected similar reductions in coactivator binding and activation function (12.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These residues form a small surface on each receptor, encircling a hydrophobic cleft thought to serve as the coactivator docking site. Subsequent studies of Darimontet al. (14.Darimont B.D.

The regions of the hTRβ1, ER, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ sequences which give rise to residues residing in the hydrophobic cleft are well conserved within the NR family (17.Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Thus, based on homology to the hTRβ1 primary amino acid sequence, as well as direct modeling of the VDR LBD (18.Norman A.W. Adams D. Collins E.D. Okamura W.H. Fletterick R.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is possible to identify the residues which are likely to form the equivalent surface in the hVDR. Targeted mutations of three residues within this AF-2 surface (two from the putative helix 12, Leu417 and Glu420, and one from the putative helix 3, Lys246) have been reported to reduce VDR-dependent activation of a conventional VDRE-driven reporter (11.Rachez C.

Although these data suggest that the AF-2 of the VDR may be structurally similar to those for other nuclear receptors, limited information exists regarding the direct participation of these three residues or other residues positioned nearby in receptor-coactivator interactions (11.Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P.B. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 20.Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M.

The structural basis of hormone-dependent inhibition by nuclear receptors is less well understood. In the case of hANP promoter repression by liganded VDR, preservation of the activation function of the receptor appears to be important (4.Chen S. Wu J. Hsieh J.C. Whitfield G.K. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 1338-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but the specific surface involved remains unexplored. As a first step in defining a mechanism for this repression, we wished to establish more definitively the AF-2 surface associated with activation and to investigate whether this surface plays any role in the repression function of the receptor. Therefore, we have introduced nine separate mutations into the background of the wild type VDR that are predicted to cluster on the VDR surface within or near to the putative coactivator-binding cleft. We have investigated the ability of each mutant to stimulate or inhibit promoter activity of co-transfected reporters. We have, in addition, examined the capacity of each of these mutant receptors to interact with known VDR coactivators (i.e. GRIP1 and SRC-1a) in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that the homologous cleft surface does play a critical role in the hormone-dependent activation of target gene promoter activity. Surprisingly, the correlations between coactivator recruitment and the hormone-dependent inhibition of hANP promoter activity are the same as those for the hormone-dependent activation of the VDRE in every aspect tested, including the functional effects of each VDR mutation, the effects of coactivator overexpression, and the relative importance of the different NR boxes within the coactivator for conservation of functional activity. These results establish a critical role for coactivators and the VDR AF-2 surface in the inhibition of the ANP gene in cardiac cells. This finding is likely to be of more universal importance in defining the mechanism(s) underlying the repressive activities of other hormone-bound nuclear receptors. pSG5 hVDR has been described previously (24.Baker A.R.

Mutations in VDR (S235R, I242R, K246E, D253R, I260R, L263R, L417R, L419R, and E420K) were created by site-directed mutagenesis using a commercial kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

RSV-β-galactosidase (β-gal) and NRBox II and NRBox III peptides were kindly provided by P. J. Kushner. Wild type and mutant VDR proteins, GRIP1 and the GRIP1 NRBox mutant proteins were translated in vitro using [35S]methionine and the TNT-Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI). GST-hRXRα, GST-GRIP1, GST-SRC-1a, GST-TBP, GST-TFIIB, and GST-hVDR were prepared as described previously (28.Sadovsky Y. Webb P. Lopez G. Baxter J.D. Fitzpatrick P.M. Ginsberg E.G. Cavailles V. Parker M.G. Kushner P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sonicated extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The concentrations of GST fusion protein bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were measured using the Coomassie protein reagent. The binding assay was performed using 15 μg of GST protein and 3 μl of35S-labeled soluble protein in 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 50 nm1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 where indicated. In selected experiments peptides encoding the nuclear receptor box II (KHKILHRLLQDSS) or box III (ENALLRYLLDKDD) were included in the incubations. The samples were incubated for 2 h with mild agitation at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged and washed three times using 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Samples bound to the beads were recovered by boiling 3 min in SDS sample buffer, size fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Signals were quantified by PhosphorImaging with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Assays were performed using 35S-labeled proteins and nonradioactive DNA as described previously (5.Chen S. Costa C.H.R.M. Nakamura K. Ribeiro R.C.J. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11260-11266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of 35S-labeled VDR (either wild type or mutant) was incubated, in the presence or absence of 2 μl of unlabeled hRXRα, with 10 ng of double-stranded DR3 oligonucleotide and 50 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Reactions were carried out in binding buffer (10 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.6, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) for 20 min at 23 °C. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run in TEA buffer (67 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 33 mm sodium acetate) at 240 V for 3 h at 4 °C. The gel was washed (3 times) with 30% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid, amplified for 30 min (Amplifier, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and subjected to autoradiography overnight with an intensification screen. The results were also quantified by PhosphorImaging analysis as described above. Atrial myocytes from 1–2-day-old neonatal rat hearts were separated by alternate cycles of trypsin digestion and mechanical disruption (31.Wu J.P. LaPointe M.C. West B.L. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6472-6479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myocytes were transfected by electroporation (280 V and 250 microfarads), using plasmids indicated. All transfections were normalized for equivalent DNA content with pUC18. Transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H21 (DME-H21) containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) for 24 h before switching to serum-substitute medium (32.Bauer R.F. Arthur L.O. Fine D.L. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cultures were then treated with 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or vehicle for 48 h. HeLa cells were maintained in DME-H21 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarads) and immediately exposed to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or vehicle for 48 h. CAT assay was carried out on cellular lysates as described previously (33.Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized for β-galactosidase activity in the individual cultures. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the the Galacto-light Plus chemiluminescence assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA). To assess efficacy of cycloheximide treatment, myocytes were cultured in 24-well dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in DME-H21 containing 10% bovine calf serum for 24 h. Medium was changed to DME-H21/serum substitute at that point and cultures were continued for an additional 40 h. Cells were treated with different concentrations of cycloheximide for 1–2 h, then pulsed with 2 μCi/ml [3H]leucine in leucine-free medium containing the same concentration of cycloheximide for 4 h. Culture media was removed, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. Cellular residues were rinsed with 95% ethanol, solubilized in 0.25n NaOH at 4 °C for 2 h, and neutralized with 2.5m HCl, 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Radioactivity was then measured in a liquid scintillation counter. hVDR and its mutant proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT-Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) and unlabeled methionine. Increasing concentrations of 1,25(OH)2-23,24-[3H]vitamin D3 (98 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in the presence or absence of unlabeled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(100-fold molar excess), were incubated with the individual translation products (10 μl) in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin-A) at 4 °C overnight. Bound and free ligand were separated with dextran-coated charcoal (Sigma) using the method of Dokoh et al. (34.Dokoh S. Pike J.W. Chandler J.S. Mancini J.M. Haussler M.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). For primer extension, −466 hANPCAT and RSV-CAT were co-transfected, in the presence or absence of VDR or RXR expression vectors into neonatal atrial myocytes. Cells were cultured in DME-H21, 10% bovine calf serum for 24 h before switching to DME-H21, 10% serum substitute for 40 h. At that point cells were pretreated with cycloheximide, at a concentration (10 μg/ml) which provided >95% reduction in [3H]leucine incorporation into protein in the experiments described above (see “Cell Culture and Transfection”), or vehicle alone for 1 h, then treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or vehicle for 6 h. Total RNA was extracted using QIAshredder and the RNeasy Mini-Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA). A cDNA oligonucleotide primer encoding sequence from the 5′ end of the CAT coding sequence (5′-TATCAACGGTGGTATATCC-3′) was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and separated from free nucleotide using the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). Primer extension was carried out using the Primer Extension-AMV Reverse Transcriptase System according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Promega). DNA products were heated for 10 min at 90 °C and run at 250 volts in 0.5 × TBE on 8% acrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film with intensification for 2–3 days. Radiographic signals were also quantified by PhosphorImaging with ImageQuant. We carried out a sequence alignment (hTRβ1 versushVDR) to identify probable homologues of those residues recently identified in hTRβ1 (12.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) as being critically involved in the activation function of that receptor (Fig.1). We identified Ile242, Lys246, Ile260, Leu417, and Glu420 in hVDR which, based on homology to Val284, Lys288, Ile302, Leu454, and Glu457 in hTRβ1, would be predicted to cluster on the surface of hVDR in the region believed to participate in coactivator interactions. Residue Leu263 was also identified as a likely participant in forming the hVDR coactivator-binding surface because the equivalent residue in the hTRβ (L305), although it was not tested directly in the study of Feng et al. (12.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), is positioned within the center of the coactivator-binding hydrophobic cleft. Mutations were created in each of these sites to examine their effects on the functional properties of the resultant receptors. Residues Ser235, Asp253, and Leu419 in hVDR (homologues of Thr277, Glu295, and Leu456 in hTRβ) are predicted to lie on the surface adjacent to, but outside, the coactivator-binding site (based on the hTRβ1 analysis). Mutations in these sites were created as comparative controls. We began by examining the ability of each of the mutants described to increase transcriptional activity from a conventional DR3-luciferase reporter in cultured HeLa cells and atrial myocytes. Liganded wild type hVDR effected a 2–3-fold (Fig. 2A) or 3–4-fold (Fig. 2 B) increase in reporter activity in HeLa cells or atrial myocytes, respectively. This was increased modestly by co-transfection with unliganded hRXRα in HeLa cells, while co-transfection with hRXRα had a more dramatic effect in amplifying wild type VDR activity in atrial myocytes, implying lower levels of endogenous RXR in the myocytes versus HeLa cells (Fig. 2,A and B). Each of the candidate mutations with predicted impairment of the receptor-coactivator interaction (i.e. I242R, K246E, I260R, L263R, L417R, and E420K) demonstrated reduced stimulation of reporter activity relative to that seen with the wild type hVDR in HeLa cells or atrial myocytes (Fig. 2,A and B). In fact, in no instance (even in the presence of co-transfected hRXRα) did the response appear to exceed that seen in cells lacking exogenous hVDR (endogenous VDR effected an ∼2-fold increment in reporter activity in the presence of transfected hRXRα). The negative controls D253R and L419R behaved like wild type VDR suggesting that these are truly “neutral” mutations. S235R, however, displayed a phenotype intermediate between the impaired mutants and wild type receptor, implying that it may play a limited role in coactivator binding and subsequent transcriptional activation. We were particularly interested in examining the effects of these mutations on the transcriptional inhibitory activity of the liganded VDR. As noted previously (2.Li Q. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4934-4939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Wu J. Garami M. Cheng T. Gardner D.G. J. Clin.

The neutral mutations, D253R and L419R, demonstrated inhibitory activity which was close to that seen with the wild type receptor. Candidate functional mutations, on the other hand, were almost devoid of inhibitory activity when transfected alone.

https://openalex.org/W2089610982,"The synthesis and antiviral properties of pyridinioalkanoyl thioester (PATE) compounds that target nucleocapsid p7 protein (NCp7) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been described previously (Turpin, J. A., Song, Y., Inman, J. K., Huang, M., Wallqvist, A., Maynard, A., Covell, D. G., Rice, W. G., and Appella, E. (1999) J. Med. Chem. 42, 67–86). In the present study, fluorescence and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry were employed to determine the mechanism of modification of NCp7 by two lead compounds,N-[2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoyl]sulfacetamide bromide andN-[2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoyl]-4-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyl)aniline bromide (compounds 45 and 47, respectively). Although both compounds exhibit antiviral activity in cell-based assays, we failed to detect appreciable ejection of zinc from NCp7 under conditions in which previously described NCp7-active disulfides readily eject zinc. However, upon “activation” by Ag+, compound 45 reacted with NCp7 resulting in the zinc ejection from both zinc fingers. The reaction followed a two-step mechanism in which zinc was ejected from the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger faster than from the amino-terminal zinc finger. Both compounds covalently modified the protein with pyridinioalkanoyl groups. Compound 45 modified cysteines 36 and 49 of the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger. The results obtained herein demonstrate that PATE compounds can be constructed that selectively target only one of the two zinc fingers of NCp7, thus providing an impetus to pursue development of highly selective zinc finger inhibitors.

The involvement of HIV-1 NCp7 zinc fingers in multiple phases of the HIV-1 replication cycle and their mutationally non-permissive nature has provided incentives for choosing this protein as a target for antiretroviral therapy. Moreover, mutations or modifications of either the conserved zinc chelating or non-chelating residues have resulted in loss of NCp7-mediated activities, including rendering the HIV non-infectious (6.Aldovini A.

These observations gave impetus to explore several types of organic compounds that selectively target NCp7 protein. First among them being 3-nitrosobenzamide (9.Rice W.G. Schaeffer C.A. Graham L. Bu M. McDougal J.S. Orloff S.L. Villinger F. Young M. Oroszlan S. Fesen M.R. Pommier Y. Mendeleyev J. Kun E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clanton D. Bu M. Graham L. Schaeffer C.A. Turpin J.A. Domagala J. Gogliotti R. Bader J.P. Halliday S.M. Coren L. Sowder R.C. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E.

Even though 2,2′-dithiobis(benzamide) disulfides represent a new class of highly specific antiretroviral agents, the disulfide bond is susceptible to reduction in vivo, resulting in the loss of antiviral activity. To circumvent this problem, we synthesized novel pyridinioalkanoyl thioester (PATE) derivatives (12.Turpin J.A. Song Y. Inman J.K. Huang M. Wallqvist A. Maynard A. Covell D.G. Rice W.G. Appella E. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Of various such compounds synthesized, two of them, compounds 45 and 47 (Fig.1), showed superior antiviral activity. Both compounds were specific for NCp7, demonstrated antiviral activity in the presence of reduced glutathione, and showed minimal cytotoxicity. A close examination of their antiviral activities suggested that they act at different stages of viral replication. Compound 47 penetrated tumor necrosis factor-α induced U1 cells where it initiated Gag precursor cross-linking and inhibition of precursor processing. However, this compound was unable to initiate cross-linking of NCp7 protein within cell-free virions. In contrast, compound 45 did not inhibit the Gag precursor processing, and its anti-viral activity was ascribed to its ability to produce extensive cross-linking of NCp7 protein in cell-free virions (12.Turpin J.A. Song Y. Inman J.K. Huang M. Wallqvist A. Maynard A. Covell D.G. Rice W.G. Appella E. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The purpose of the current study was to determine the mechanism of action of PATEs and to determine the sites of modification on the NCp7 protein. For this purpose, a fluorescence-based assay using a zinc-specific fluorophore, Newport Green (NPG), and mass spectrometry were used to follow the kinetics of zinc ejection and to determine the site(s) of covalent modification on the target protein. Recombinant NCp7 was purified using a pET3A-expressing NCp7 plasmid propagated inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysE. Briefly, the cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (13.Lee B.M. De Guzman R.N. Turner B.G. Tjandra N. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 633-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), lysed with buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After clearing the debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was acidified with acetic acid (to a final 10% v/v), centrifuged again, and loaded onto a reverse phase C8 HPLC column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The chromatogram was developed using a linear gradient of 0–55% acetonitrile, 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid. NCp7 eluted at about 25% acetonitrile. The purity and integrity of the protein was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Finnigan MAT SSQ 7000 (San Jose, CA) mass analyzer. The apoprotein had a molecular mass of 6369 ± 1 Da (calculated mass is 6369.4 Da). Lyophilized NCp7 was reconstituted with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. Excess zinc was removed using a Centricon-3 ultrafiltration unit (M r cut-off 3000 Da, Amicon), and the resulting reconstituted NCp7 was used in all the studies. Peptides corresponding to amino-(13–30) and carboxyl-(32–52) terminal zinc fingers were synthesized by the solid phase method with Fmoc chemistry using an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peptides were cleaved from the resin, and side chain protecting groups were removed by incubating in reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/thioanisole/H2O/EDT, 82.5:5:5:5:2.5) for 3 h at room temperature. The peptides were purified by HPLC on a pH-stable C-8 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The masses of the peptides were confirmed using Finnigan MAT SSQ 7000 mass analyzer. The zinc ejection assay buffer consisted of 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Zinc ejection was monitored by following the increase in the fluorescence of a zinc selective fluorophore, Newport Green (10 μm) (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR), in the assay buffer at room temperature. Under these conditions, NPG fluorescence increases linearly with increasing zinc concentration over the range 0.1 to 2 μmZnCl2. The effect of zinc concentration on NPG fluorescence was essentially unchanged upon increasing NPG to 20 μm, while it decreased 10% upon increasing the phosphate concentration to 30 mm. Lowering the phosphate concentration to 10 mm did not significantly affect NPG fluorescence. Therefore, 10 μm NPG and 20 mm phosphate were used as the standard condition. Zinc ejection was initiated by the addition of PATEs in dimethyl sulfoxide (5–80 μm final concentration) to NCp7 (1 μm) in assay buffer containing 10 μm NPG at room temperature (24 ± 1 °C). The increase in fluorescence at 540 nm (λex = 490 nm) was monitored as a function of time using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer. In experiments in which silver nitrate (20 μm) was used, it was added prior to the addition of the PATEs, and the nonspecific increase in fluorescence was recorded. NCp7 (1–2 μm) treated with the PATEs was separated on a reverse phase C-18 column using a linear gradient (5–50%) of solvent B (90% acetonitrile containing 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid). In most cases, the modified protein eluted as two poorly separated peaks. Each peak was collected separately, lyophilized, and redissolved in 50% methanol containing 1% acetic acid for mass analysis on a Mass Analyzer SSQ 7000 (Finnigan). For ESI-MS studies, the above peaks were redissolved in a minimal volume of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Clostripain (Promega) was added (1:20) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Mass spectrometric data for the clostripain peptides were obtained from collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra using a Finnigan-MAT LCQ ion trap instrument equipped with electrospray interface (ESI) after introduction via a polyimide-coated fused silica microcapillary reverse phase-HPLC system (14.Hunt D.F. Henderson R.A. Shabanowitz J. Sakaguchi K. Michel H. Sevilir N. Cox A.L. Appella E. Engelhard V.H. Science. 1992; 255: 1261-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer was set for analyzing the positive ions and was operated on either double or triple play mode in which the instrument was set up to automatically acquire: 1) a full scan, 2) a ZoomScan of the (M+nH)n+ ion above a preset threshold, and 3) a tandem MS/MS spectrum (relative collision energy = 30%) from that ion. ZoomScan was not monitored during the double play mode. The observed masses resulting from CID were compared with the predicted pattern of NCp7 fragmentation generated by the program Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Since the PATEs analyzed in this study had a very high absorbance at 280 nm, the commonly used method of monitoring the rate of zinc ejection by following the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence (excitation at 280 nm) was not feasible (12.Turpin J.A. Song Y. Inman J.K. Huang M. Wallqvist A. Maynard A. Covell D.G. Rice W.G. Appella E. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15.Tummino P.J. Scholten J.D.

Instead, a method of monitoring zinc ejection directly using NPG was adopted. NPG exhibits an increase in fluorescence upon binding to Zn2+. Upon the addition of NCp7, there was a small but definite increase in the NPG fluorescence, which remained constant over the monitored time course. Addition of either compound 45 or 47 (5–80 μm) (N-[2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoyl]sulfacetamide bromide andN-[2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoyl]-4-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyl)aniline bromide, compounds 45 and 47, respectively) did not result in any apparent release of zinc from NCp7. Even after prolonged incubation (18 h) in the presence of these compounds, zinc remained bound to NCp7 as demonstrated by the subsequent rapid ejection of zinc upon addition of dithiane 1,1-dioxide (16.Rice W.G. Baker D.C. Schaeffer C.A. Graham L. Bu M. Terpening S. Clanton D. Schultz R. Bader J.P. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Field L. Singh P.K. Turpin J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 419-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a previously established NCp7 inhibitor (Fig. 2). This result suggested that the PATEs alone may be considerably less reactive than the disulfides and may require “activation” in vitro. Thioesters are selectively activated by silver ions, a method routinely employed in large segment condensation in peptide synthesis (17.Blake J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1981; 17: 273-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18.Sakamoto H. Kodama H. Higashimoto Y. Kondo M. Lewis M.S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 48: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of silver and other metal ions to “activate” the PATEs. Zinc ejection was initiated by the addition of compound 45 (5–80 μm) to NCp7 (1 μm) in zinc ejection assay buffer containing 10 μm NPG and 20 μmAgNO3. The zinc ejection was rapid and appeared to be complete by 5 min. Silver ions alone were unable to eject zinc during the time course employed. Interestingly, no zinc ejection was measurable with compound 47 even after a 1-h incubation, indicating a much slower process than with compound 45. Time-dependent zinc ejection was monitored at different concentrations of compound 45. Representative curves for three concentrations are shown in Fig.3 A. The data fit well to a double exponential curve with well separated time constants. The dependence of the observed rate constants on the concentration of compound 45 is shown in Fig. 3 B. The observed rate constant for the faster phase, k f,obs, increases with increasing concentration of compound 45. The observed rate constant for the slower phase is independent of the concentration of compound 45, within experimental error, and can be expressed ask s,obs = 4.1 ± 1.2 × 10−3 s−1. The kinetic data were fit to a two-step mechanism, in which the first step consisted of a reversible, bimolecular reaction between the protein and the PATE compound, followed by covalent modification of the protein and ejection of 1 eq of zinc. In the second step, a conformational change or rearrangement in the protein is rate-limiting and results in the release of a second equivalent of zinc, independent of the concentration of compound 45. This mechanism can be expressed as,NCp7+D ⇌k−1k1 I →k2 P+Zn2+Equation 1 P →k3 P′+Zn2+Equation 2 The large separation in the time constants of the initial fit to the zinc release data suggested that the two phases were largely distinct and could be considered separately. Applying a standard steady-state assumption for the intermediate I results in,kss−1=k−1+k2k1k2·1[D]+1k2Equation 3 in which [D] is the concentration of compound 45. The inverse of the observed rate constant is indeed linear with the inverse of the concentration of compound 45 for the five highest concentrations and exhibits a distinctly non-zero intercept (not shown). From this analysis, k 2 = 0.125 s−1 andk 1/(k −1 +k 2) = 2.2 × 104m−1 for the faster phase of zinc ejection. The expected dependence of the rate constant k ss on the concentration of compound 45 is shown in Fig. 3 B as asolid line and gives a good fit to the observed rate constants for the faster phase. The observed rate constants are somewhat faster than expected for the two lowest concentrations of compound 45, the sort of deviation expected when pseudo-first order conditions are not strictly met. The value of k 3is determined from the average value of ks,obs and is shown in Fig. 3 B as a dashed line, indicating the lack of dependence of the observed rate constant on the concentration of compound 45. Application of the kinetic model described by Equations 1 and 2 without assuming a steady state did not lead to a significantly improved fit to the data. The overall yield of the reaction, as indicated by the plateau value of the relative fluorescence shown in Fig. 3 A, is distinctly lower at the lowest concentration of compound 45 and increases with increasing concentration to a limiting value. The kinetic model described by Equations 1 and 2 contains sequential irreversible reactions preceded by a reversible binding step. For reactions containing limiting amounts of NCp7, this model predicts that the eventual extent of the reaction should be the same, regardless of the concentration of compound 45, although the rate of the reaction is dependent on compound 45 concentration. The low amount of relative fluorescence initially established in a reaction containing 5 μm compound 45 increases rapidly to the limiting plateau value upon subsequent addition of compound 45 to a final concentration of 60 μm (data not shown). This result indicates that the limiting plateau values obtained at low compound concentration do not result from irreversible adsorption of the protein or precipitation of silver ion. The lower plateau values obtained at low compound concentration may be the consequence of the requirement for activation of the compound, which for unknown reasons is less efficient at low concentrations. We note, however, that similarly reduced plateau values have been reported for inactivation of NCp7 by lower concentrations of the unrelated disulfide benzamides, which do not require activation (15.Tummino P.J. Scholten J.D. Harvey P.J. Holler T.P. Maloney L. Gogliotti R. Domagala J. Hupe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To identify which zinc finger of NCp7 reacted rapidly with compound 45, peptides corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers (residues 13–30 and 32–52, respectively) were synthesized. Previously, it has been shown that the isolated zinc fingers of NCp7 bind zinc with affinities similar to that of the whole protein (19.Mely Y. De Rocquigny H. Morellet N. Roques B.P. Gerad D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5175-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The zinc ejection from both fingers by compound 45 was monitored as described for the whole protein. Interestingly, compound 45 was unable to eject zinc from the amino-terminal finger (Fig.4 A). The fact that the amino-terminal zinc finger was indeed coordinated with zinc was demonstrated by addition of dithiane 1,1-dioxide, which ejected zinc as expected. Compound 45 caused ejection of zinc from the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger as shown in Fig. 4 B. The data are well described as a single exponential curve. The observed rate constant for zinc ejection from the isolated carboxyl-terminal zinc finger peptide increases with the concentration of compound 45 over the range 5 to 60 μm, with no further increase at 80 μm, as shown in Fig. 4 C. Following the same course of analysis as was used for the intact protein, a steady state assumption was applied. The double reciprocal plot for the five highest concentrations is linear, suggesting that a steady state analysis provide a good description at the higher concentrations (not shown). The value of k 2 = 0.95 s−1 is obtained from the intercept and the value ofk 1/(k −1 +k 2) = 5.6 × 104m−1 from the ratio of the slope and the intercept. The dependence of the steady state rate constant on the concentration of compound 45 is shown in Fig. 4 C as asolid line and provides a good fit to the observed rate constants. Furthermore, the qualitative agreement of the parameters obtained for intact NCp7 and the isolated carboxyl-terminal zinc finger peptide indicates that the faster phase of zinc release from the intact protein can be ascribed to the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger. To determine whether the zinc ejection is accompanied by covalent modification of the protein, the products of the reaction of NCp7 (2 μm) and a PATE (40 μm) in the presence of AgNO3 (10 μm) were separated on reverse phase C18 column using a water/acetonitrile gradient system. The protein eluted in 2 fractions, which were collected separately, and the mass of the protein products was determined on an SSQ 7000 (Finnigan) mass analyzer. The results are tabulated in Table I. In the absence of any modification, NCp7 had an apparent molecular mass of 6369 ± 1 Da, corresponding to the apoprotein (zinc is lost from the protein under conditions used to separate species by HPLC). When silver ion was added to NCp7, the hydrophobicity of NCp7 decreased, as indicated by its earlier elution on a reverse phase C18 column, and the molecular mass increased to 6906 ± 1 Da, corresponding to apo-NCp7 with 5 bound silver ions. Since there are 4 dicarboxylic amino acids (three Glu and one Asp) plus the carboxyl terminus of the protein, it is expected that the silver ions form a salt with NCp7. Upon addition of a PATE, a new, slightly more hydrophobic peak was observed containing a mixture of modified peptides with molecular masses of 7066 ± 1 Da and 7026 ± 1 Da corresponding to apo-NCp7 with 5 silver atoms plus one or two pyridinioalkanoyl groups (Δm = 162 ± 1 Da per group), respectively. Interestingly, although no appreciable zinc ejection was observed with compound 47 even after a 1-h incubation, a minor amount of NCp7 modified with one or two pyridinioalkanoyl groups was detected (Table I).Table IModification of NCp7 by PATE compounds 45 and 47ReactionTimeZinc ejectionMassMassMassminP76369 ± 1P7 + compound 4515−6368 ± 1P7 + Ag15−6369 ± 16905 ± 1P7 + Ag + compound 4515+6905 ± 17065 ± 17226 ± 1P7 + Ag + compound 4715−6368 ± 16904 ± 1P7 + Ag + compound 4760NOaNO, not observed.6368 ± 16905 ± 17065 ± 1P7 + Ag + compound 4775NO6906 ± 17065 ± 17227 ± 1P7 + Fe2+ (40 μm)240NDbND, not determined.6369 ± 1P7 + Fe2+ + compound 45240ND6369 ± 16531 ± 1P7 + Fe2+ + compound 47240ND6369 ± 16531 ± 1NCp7 (1 μm) was incubated alone or with silver nitrate (10 μm) or iron (II) bromide (40 μm) and drug (40 μm) for various times in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and separated on a RP C-18 column.

The fractions were lyophilized and the mass was determined using a Finnigan MAT SSQ-7000 Mass Analyzer. Other metals were tested for their ability to promote zinc ejection and covalent modification of NCp7 by compound 45. Only Fe2+ (40 μm) was able to do so after 4 h of incubation, while Fe3+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ showed no effect. Ferrous ions, unlike silver, did not form a stable complex with NCp7 that was detected by MS and the resulting modified protein had a mass of 6531 ± 1 Da, corresponding to the addition of a single pyridinioalkanoyl group. In addition, the yield of the modified protein was much lower than that obtained when silver ions were used as the activator. The NCp7 product produced by reaction with compound 45 was subjected to proteolytic digestion with clostripain, and the digest was analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Clostripain, which cleaves on the carboxyl side of arginine, is expected to cleave the protein into three large and three small peptides. Table IIlists the ions and sequence positions obtained. The mass of the fragment corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger, amino acids 32–52, indicated addition of two pyridinioalkanoyl groups per fragment (Δm = 162 ± 1 per group).

The mass of the modified ions is either increased by 162 mass units (b 4*,b 5*), indicating the presence of a pyridinioakanoyl group, or decreased by 34 mass units (b 4m*), indicating conversion of the modified cysteine to dehydroalanine during CID. Similarly, the series of carboxyl-terminal ions (y ions) exhibit evidence for modification of Cys49. The corresponding unmodified ions (b 4+1,y 4+1, etc.) are also observed. Similarly, a peptide with a mass of 2782.92 Da showed a deviation of 431 Da from the parent peptide, indicating the presence of 2 pyridinioalkanoyl groups and 1 silver atom. The presence of five ions,b 4+1,b 5+1,b 6+1,b 7+1,b 8+1, each exhibiting a shift of +162 ± 1 mass units, is consistent with the modification of Cys36. Additionally, the detection ofy 4+1,y 5+1 ions, exhibiting a mass shift of 268 Da mass units, is consistent with the peptide being modified at Cys49 by one pyridinioalkanoyl group and one silver atom at Glu51 (Fig. 5, panel B). Two other intense ions (m/z of 656.9 and 676.7) correspond to doubly charged internal fragments of modified b 10 andy 10-NH3, respectively. Collectively, these data demonstrate the modification of NCp7 by two pyridinioalkanoyl groups, one at each of Cys36 and Cys49. The covalent modification of the zinc finger peptides by compound 45 was confirmed by HPLC followed by mass analysis. The observed masses of the apopeptides of 1976.94 and 2352.8 Da agree well with the calculated values of 1977.5 (amino-terminal peptide) and 2352.04 Da (carboxyl-terminal peptide) in the absence of silver. As expected, the observed masses shift to 2191.3 and 2672 Da in the presence of silver corresponding to the addition of two and three silver atoms to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptides, respectively. Upon addition of compound 45 (40 μm), the mass of carboxyl-terminal peptide increased, corresponding to various modifications listed in Table III. In accord with results presented above, the amino-terminal zinc finger peptide did not show evidence of any covalent modification. The modified peptides were analyzed by CID, yielding a spectrum dominated by the +3 and +4 charged internal peptides (data not shown). As with the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger fragment from the intact protein, we observed bseries ions indicating modification of Cys36 andy series ions indicating modification of Cys49with pyridinoalkanoyl groups.Table IIIThe observed parent ions and the possible modifications for compound 45-modified amino- and carboxyl-terminal zinc finger peptides in presence of silver (10 μm)Mass observedm/zMass cal"

JNK can be activated by the tumor promoting agent, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in normal human oral keratinocytes but not in human keratinocytes that have been immortalized (HOK-16B and HaCaT) or transformed (HOK-16B-Bap-T) nor in a cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa). The refractory JNK activation response to TPA is not due a defect in the JNK pathway, because JNK can be activated by other stimuli, e.g. UV irradiation and an alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine in these immortalized or transformed cells. More importantly, the refractory JNK and JNKK activation response to TPA can be restored by treatment of the cells with a combination of TPA and a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with TPA partially inhibited UV- orN-methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine-induced JNK activity. These results suggest that a TPA-inducible, orthovanadate-sensitive protein-tyrosine phosphatase may specifically down-regulate JNK signaling pathway in these immortalized/transformed epithelial cells. In contrast, ERK and p38/Mpk2 are not regulated by this TPA-induced phosphatase.

They consist of three major subfamilies: MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), and p38/Mpk2. MAPK/ERK is activated mainly by growth factors and phorbol esters and is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation (1Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem.

This has been confirmed recently using specific chemical inhibitors or by expressing mutant versions of different MAPKs or their upstream activators. These studies show that ERKs play a pivotal role in mediating neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells, as well as growth factor-stimulated proliferation and oncogenic transformation in fibroblasts (13Cowley S.

Once activated, MAPKs phosphorylate and regulate several cellular proteins, including other protein kinases, cytoskeletal elements, stathmin, phospholipase A2, and transcription factors, notably Myc, Elk-1, Jun, and ATF-2 (12Karin M.

The broad range of substrates indicates a pivotal role for MAPKs in cellular signal transduction, suggesting that the extent and duration of their activation play a key role in controlling cell function.A precise balance of the activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (PPs) plays a major role in receptor-mediated signaling pathways and cell cycle control. Several components of the ERK1/ERK2 pathway are subjected to regulation by PPs such as PP1 and PP2A. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) also play an important role in the attenuation of signals generated by protein-tyrosine kinases involved in mitogenesis. The extent and duration of protein-tyrosine kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation can be greatly enhanced by treatment with the PTP inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, or its peroxy derivatives (21Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 22Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. J. Biol.

It has also been shown that overexpression of dual specificity MAPK-phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) inhibits ERK2 activity and relieves the inhibitory effects of mitogens on muscle-specific gene expression (23Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).It is clear that PPs and PTPs play crucial roles in controlling cellular activities. MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, and p38/Mpk2 are regulated by dual phosphorylation and dephosphorylation within the motifs TEY, TPY, and TGY, respectively, by several upstream dual specificity kinases (MAPK kinases) and several types of phosphatases (1Cano E.

Although they share sequence homology, each has distinct properties concerning substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and inducibility by extracellular stimuli. These phosphatases all posses a characteristic extended active site motif, VXVHCXXGXSRSXTXXXAYLM (where X is any amino acid) and two N-terminal CH2 domains displaying homology to the cell cycle regulator Cdc25 phosphatase.We report here that activation of JNKs by TPA is repressed in the human papilloma virus-immortalized keratinocytes or their tumorigenic derivatives, cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, and spontaneously immortalized keratinocyte, HaCaT. This repression can be restored by treatment of these cells with a combination of TPA and sodium orthovanadate. We provide evidence that there may well be a TPA-inducible dual specificity phosphatase involved in the refractory effect of the TPA-induced JNK activity. This TPA-inducible phosphatase is specific in inactivating kinase activities in the JNK pathway and associates only with immortalized or transformed epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONIt has been reported previously that the tumor promoter agent, TPA, is able to strongly induce ERK activity (49De Vries-smits A. Burgering B. Leevers S. Marshall C. Bos J. Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 50Robbins D.J. Cheng M. Zhen E. Vanderbilt C.A. Feig L.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and had little effect on JNK activity in fibroblasts and epithelial cells (4Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 51Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). However, JNK activity can be rapidly stimulated by UV irradiation, but not by TPA, in human 293 (transformed primary embryonal kidney cells) and HeLa (cervical carcinoma) cells (5Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar, 52van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Similarly, JNK is activated in NIH3T3 and CCD-18Co colon fibroblasts by cellular stress and tumor necrosis factor-α but is poorly activated by TPA (6Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). It was speculated that the difference in JNK activation resulted from the differences in cell types. Recently, it was reported that retinoic acid inhibited serum-induced JNK activity by increasing the activity of dual specificity phosphatase in human bronchial epithelial cell (53Lee H.Y. Sueoka N. Hong W.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Claret F.X. Kurie J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Other studies also demonstrated that intestinal trefoil factor decreases ERK activity by activating the dual specificity phosphatase in intestinal epithelial cell (54Kanai M. Mullen C. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intestinal trefoil factor also blocked activation of ERK activity induced by transforming growth factor-α or TPA (54Kanai M. Mullen C. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).In this study, we found that TPA induced JNK activity only in NHOK and not in the immortalized and transformed epithelial cells. This refractory JNK activation response to TPA treatment was not due to a defect in the JNK pathway, because JNK activity and NFκB binding activity were strongly activated by UV irradiation or MNNG treatment and TPA treatment, respectively, in all cell types examined. In contrast, ERK activity was weakly induced by TPA in NHOK, whereas refractory to TPA treatment in transformed/immortalized cells, except in HeLa and HaCaT cells. The p38/Mpk2 pathway was also refractory to TPA treatment (data not shown). Although all three MAPKs were refractory to TPA treatment in certain immortalized/transformed cells, only JNK activation could be restored by a combination of TPA and OV treatment. These results suggest that a TPA-induced, OV-sensitive protein phosphatase specifically down-regulates JNK activity in response to TPA treatment in certain immortalized/transformed epithelial cells. In addition, TPA may also induce different protein phosphatases that down-regulate ERK or p38 activity.One possible explanation for the refractory JNK activation response to TPA in certain immortalized and transformed epithelial cells is that these cells may have delayed kinetics of JNK activation. To test this possibility, we measured JNK activity after exposure of HOK-16B cells to TPA, UV irradiation, or MNNG at different time points. Both UV irradiation and MNNG significantly activated JNK, with the peak at 1 h and a return to the background level after three hours (data not shown). In contrast, TPA did not activate JNK even at a much longer time period or higher TPA concentration of exposure (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained when HeLa or HaCaT cells were used. These results suggested that repression of JNK activation by TPA in these cell lines is not due to delayed kinetics of activation or insufficiency of TPA required for JNK activation.The finding that JNK activation by TPA can be restored in the immortalized/transformed cells by a combination of sodium OV and TPA provides an explanation, for the first time, for the differential regulation of JNK activity by TPA in different cell types. Our results suggest that TPA may induce an OV-sensitive phosphatase, which is a negative regulator of JNK, and is able to override activation of JNK by TPA in certain immortalized/transformed cells. It appears that the TPA-induced, OV-sensitive JNK phosphatase is a dual specificity phosphatase. First, the phosphatase activity can be induced by TPA, while most members of the MKP group are inducible (29Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 33Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Second, OV, but not okadaic acid, can inhibit the phosphatase activity, consistent with the sensitivity of the dual specificity phosphatases to the low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Third, other tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors such as benzylphosphonic acid-(AM)2 and l-p-bromotetramisole oxalate (BIOMOL Research Lab., Plymouth Meeting, PA) have no inhibitory effect on TPA-induced phosphatase. 2S. Chen and R. Chiu, unpublished results. Therefore, this putative TPA-induced, dual specificity phosphatase may play a critical role in suppressing TPA-induced JNK activity in immortalized and transformed epithelial cells.MKPs such as MKP-1, MKP-2, MKP-5, and M3/6 are able to target JNK. Our data showed that JNK activity was strongly induced in NHOK, very weakly in the HaCaT, and not at all in the HOK-16B or HeLa cells in response to TPA treatment (Fig. 1). Moreover, OV alone or a combination of TPA and OV neither affected the basal level of MKP-1 nor induced MKP-1 in NHOK. These data clearly demonstrated that MKP-1 may not be involved in the suppression of JNK activity in NHOK, although MKP-1 level was increased in response to TPA treatment. On the other hand, MKP-2 was not induced in any of the epithelial cells tested. Collectively, our results suggest that this TPA-induced phosphatase is neither MKP-1 nor MKP-2. The most recently cloned dual specificity phosphatase, MKP-5, was able to inactivate p38/Mpk2 and SAPK/JNK, but not ERK. In addition, inactivation of p38/Mpk2 was greater than that of JNK/SAPK (44Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the dual specificity phosphatase M3/6, which is expressed predominantly in the adult brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, is highly selective for inactivation of both JNK/SAPK and p38/Mpk2 and is induced by nerve growth factor and insulin in PC12 cells (41Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TPA-inducible phosphatase in the immortalized and transformed epithelial cells does not affect ERK and p38/Mpk2 activity. Based on these characteristics, the TPA-inducible phosphatase described in this report is not likely to be any one of above MKPs.Other dual specificity phosphatases may also contribute to the refractory JNK activation response to TPA treatment. TPA may increase the activity of MKPs through mechanisms other than an increase of their expression, such as post-translational modification by protein phosphorylation or farnesylation, which are important regulators of phosphatase activity (55De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10419-10424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 56Shifrin V.I. Davis R.J. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2957-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This is unlikely, because treatment with cyclohexamide, protein synthesis inhibitor, results in the reduction or elimination of the synergistic activation of JNK by TPA or a combination of OV and TPA, respectively. 3H. Zhou and R. Chiu, unpublished results. These results suggested that de novo protein synthesis is required to inhibit TPA-induced JNK activity, as well as the synergistic activation of JNK by the combination of OV and TPA.The TPA-induced JNK phosphatase seems to be a TPA-induced immediate early gene as pretreatment of cells with TPA for 15–30 min led to partial inhibition of UV- or MNNG-induced JNK activity. Similarly, it has been reported that pretreatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor blunted JNK activation by UV irradiation (31Hirsch D.D. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4568-4575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our results further demonstrated that TPA-induced phosphatase is a JNK-specific phosphatase. However, we also observed a similar effect on the JNKK activity in HOK-16B, HeLa, and HaCaT cells, but not in NHOK with a combination of OV and TPA. At the present time, we do not know that both JNK and JNKK activities were inhibited by a single or by two different TPA-induced phosphatases. MEKK (JNKKK) activity was also reduced by ectopic expressing ΔMEKK in HeLa cells in the presence of TPA (data not shown). This suggests that TPA-induced phosphatase(s) can override or down-modulate the JNK signaling pathway at different levels along the pathway.Most members of the MKP group of dual specificity phosphatases, if not all, are nuclear proteins (29Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), whereas MKP-3, MKP-4, and M3/6 are localized in cytoplasm. Our data suggested that the TPA-inducible phosphatase is a cytoplasmic protein because this phosphatase can target MAPK at different levels. The specific subcellular localization of this TPA-induced phosphatase remains to be elucidated. The mechanisms for inactivation of MAK kinases by MAPK phosphatases are highly conserved in species ranging from yeast to humans. However, specific questions such as the function of MAPK phosphatases in a pathological state remain to be answered. To answer these important questions, purification and cloning of this TPA-inducible phosphatase is essential, and the process has been undertaken. Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 superfamily are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases that play pivotal roles in transducing various extracellular signals to the nucleus. They consist of three major subfamilies: MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), and p38/Mpk2. MAPK/ERK is activated mainly by growth factors and phorbol esters and is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation (1Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem.

JNK/SAPK and p38/Mpk2 are activated by various extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, phorbol esters, UV irradiation and ionizing radiation, heat shock, hyperosmolarity, and cytotoxic drugs (3Raingeaud J.

https://openalex.org/W2087867557,"The lactose permease is an integral membrane protein that cotransports H+ and lactose into the bacterial cytoplasm. Previous work has shown that bulky substitutions at glycine 64, which is found on the cytoplasmic edge of transmembrane segment 2 (TMS-2), cause a substantial decrease in the maximal velocity of lactose uptake without significantly affecting the Km values (Jessen-Marshall, A. E., Parker, N. J., and Brooker, R. J. (1997) J. Bacteriol.179, 2616–2622). In the current study, mutagenesis was conducted along the face of TMS-2 that contains glycine-64. Single amino acid substitutions that substantially changed side-chain volume at codons 52, 57, 59, 63, and 66 had little or no effect on transport activity, whereas substitutions at codons 49, 53, 56, and 60 were markedly defective and/or had lower levels of expression. According to helical wheel plots, Phe-49, Ser-53, Ser-56, Gln-60, and Gly-64 form a continuous stripe along one face of TMS-2. Several of the TMS-2 mutants (S56Y, S56L, S56Q, Q60A, and Q60V) were used as parental strains to isolate mutants that restore transport activity. These mutations were either first-site mutations or second-site suppressors in TMS-1, TMS-2, TMS-7 or TMS-11. A kinetic analysis showed that the suppressors had a higher rate of lactose transport compared with the corresponding parental strains. Overall, the results of this study are consistent with the notion that a face on TMS-2, containing Phe-49, Ser-53, Ser-56, Gln-60, and Gly-64, plays a critical role in conformational changes associated with lactose transport. We hypothesize that TMS-2 slides across TMS-7 and TMS-11 when the lactose permease interconverts between the C1 and C2 conformations. This idea is discussed within the context of a revised model for the structure of the lactose permease."

Its C-terminal two-thirds encompasses an RNA helicase, thought to be involved in the separation of RNA double strand structures that transiently form during the replication of the viral genome (1.Kim D.W.

This requirement for rather large substrate molecules stems from the peculiar architecture of the substrate binding site that lacks all major loops that form the S2 or S3 binding pockets in other enzymes of this family. Specific binding is accomplished through a series of weak interactions that are distributed along an extended recognition surface. The driving forces for enzyme-substrate complex formation include, among others, 1) electrostatic interactions between the conserved negatively charged residue in the P6 position of substrates and a cluster of positively charged residues of the enzyme, 2) main chain interactions involving the substrate peptide backbone that forms an antiparallel β-sheet with strand E2 of the enzyme, 3) interactions between the preferred P1 cysteine residue and the S1 pocket of the enzyme that is characterized by the presence of a phenylalanine residue at its entrance, and 4) hydrophobic interactions between the P4′ residue and a small pocket formed also by residues of the NS4A cofactor (22.Landro J.

We have recently shown that the NS3 protease undergoes a remarkable inhibition by its N-terminal cleavage products (23.Steinkühler C. Biasiol G. Brunetti M. Urbani A. Koch U. Cortese R. Pessi A.

Two major acidic “anchoring” points have been identified in those studies: an interaction involving an acidic function in P6/P5 and another electrostatic interaction involving the P1 α-carboxylic acid generated upon cleavage of the parent substrate peptide. This carboxylate group was proposed to engage in hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone amides of the oxyanion hole, the protonated ε-N of the catalytic histidine, and the γ-amino group of lysine 136 (23.Steinkühler C.

In the present study, we have generated a dansyl-labeled hexapeptide acid inhibitor of the NS3 protease, termed compound P, in an attempt to probe the active site of the enzyme and to further characterize its interactions with inhibitors. Binding of this compound to the active site of the protease could be directly monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residues of the protein and the fluorescent group in the bound inhibitor. This technique allowed us to gain insight into the dynamics of enzyme-inhibitor complex formation and to study the influence of the cofactor on the binding reaction. Furthermore, we show that, using the fluorescence energy transfer signal, the contribution of single residues to formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex can be dissected by site-directed mutagenesis even if such mutations abolish the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The dansyl-amino acid derivative used in the synthesis, Fmoc-Dap(dansyl)-OH was prepared from commercially available materials, as detailed below. N-α-Fmoc-l-diaminopropionic acid (5.00 g, 15 mmol) and DIEA (5.2 ml, 30 mmol) were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (100 ml). A solution of dansyl chloride (4.60 g, 15 mmol) in 100 ml was added dropwise under stirring at room temperature. Stirring was continued until the acid was consumed (1 h). The mixture was then diluted with CH2Cl2, washed with 1 n HCl and brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a yellow foam. Chromatographic purification (silica, CH2Cl2/MeOH (9:1)) afforded 6.50 g of yellow solid (77%), which was used for peptide synthesis without further purification. Purification to produce an analytical sample was achieved through preparative HPLC on a Nucleosyl C-18 column (250 × 100 mm, 15 μm) using as eluents water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (B). The gradient used was 20% B isocratic for 5 min and then 20–80% over 20 min, flow rate 30 ml/min; the fractions containing the pure material were pooled and lyophilized.

The peptide was assembled by machine-assisted solid phase synthesis using the continuous flow Fmoc-polyamide method (27.Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The resin used was Tentagel® (0.19 mm eq/g) derivatized with a hydroxymethylphenoxyacetic acid linker. All of the couplings were performed with a 5-fold excess of activated amino acid over the resin free amino groups, using Fmoc-amino acid/PyBOP/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1:1:1:2) activation; the synthesis was interrupted after 4 cycles to allow manual incorporation of Dap(Dansyl) (PyBOP activation, 4-fold excess); coupling completion was checked by the ninhydrin test before resuming the machine assembly. At the end of the synthesis, the dry peptide-resin was treated with reagent B (28.Sole N.A. Barany G. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 5399-5403Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/water/triisopropylsilane (88:5:5:2)) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The resin was filtered out, and the peptide was precipitated with cold methyl-t-butyl ether. The precipitate was redissolved in 1:1 water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. Purification to >98% homogeneity was achieved through preparative HPLC on a Waters C-18 column (250 × 100 mm, 15 μm) using as eluents water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (B), and a linear gradient of 35–60% B over 30 min. The fractions corresponding to the pure peptide were pooled and lyophilized. MS (calculated) 1087.27; (found) 1087.4. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with plasmids containing the cDNA coding for the serine protease domain of the HCV J strain NS3 protein (amino acids 1027–1206, followed by the sequence ASKKKK) under the control of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 promoter in a pT7–7 vector. The catalytic serine to alanine mutation was introduced in the context of the NS3 protease domain spanning residues 1027–1206 of the HCV Bk strain by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis. Clones were fully sequenced on both strands to exclude the introduction of additional mutations by polymerase chain reaction. Experiments using this enzyme were performed in parallel with the wild type Bk enzyme. All enzymes were purified as described previously (29.De Francesco R. Urbani A. Nardi M.C. Tomei L.

Enzyme preparations were routinely checked by mass spectrometry done on HPLC-purified samples using a Perkin-Elmer API 100 instrument and by N-terminal sequence analysis carried out using Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase sequencer. Enzyme stocks were quantified by amino acid analysis, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept in aliquots at −80 °C until use.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7890-7897Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) and analyzed by HPLC as described previously (20.Urbani A. Bianchi E. Narjes F. Tramontano A. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Pessi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9204-9209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cleavage products were quantified by integration of chromatograms with respect to appropriate standards. Kinetic parameters were calculated from nonlinear least squares fit of initial rates as a function of substrate concentration with the help of Kaleidagraph software, assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. TheK i value of compound P was determined from substrate titration experiments performed at different concentrations of probe. At least four titration curves were simultaneously fitted to Equation 1using Sigmaplot software.V=Vmax S/(Km(1+([P]/Ki))+S)Equation 1 Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS50B instrument with a cuvette holder thermostatted at 23 °C. 200 nm protease added to 2.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, 1% CHAPS containing 80 μm Pep4AK. Increasing concentrations of compound P were added, and emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 550 nm at a scan speed of 60 nm/min upon excitation at 280 nm. Emission and excitation slits were opened to 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively. Spectra were routinely corrected for the background signal of buffer and for dilution effects. The fluorescence intensity, F, is related to the concentration of enzyme-probe complex according to Equation 2,F=F0+f [EP]Equation 2 where F 0 indicates the fluorescence intensity in the absence of probe, f represents the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme-probe complex, and [EP] represents its concentration. Since enzyme and probe concentrations were similar in the titration experiments, it could no longer be assumed that the free ligand was equal to the total added ligand. Under these conditions, the concentration of EP is related to the total concentrations of enzyme and probe according to Equation 3,[EP]=(([P]+[E]+Kp)/2)−0.5(([P]+[E]+Kp) 2−4[E][P]) 0.5Equation 3 where K P is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the enzyme-probe complex. Substitution of [EP] in Equation 2 with Equation 3 yields an equation that directly relates the fluorescence intensity with K P. To obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant of the enzyme-probe complex, this equation was fitted to the experimental titration data with the help of Kaleidagraph software. Equilibrium dissociation constants of nonfluorescent ligands were obtained from probe displacement experiments performed using 100 nm protease in 2.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, 1% CHAPS containing 80 μm Pep4AK and 500 nm compound P. Under these conditions, depletion of probe by enzyme-probe complex formation was considered to be negligible. The equilibria involved in the competition of compound P and a nonfluorescent ligand (L) for the active site of the enzyme are outlined in Equation 4,EL ⇌+LKL E ⇋+PKP EPEquation 4 where K P and KL are the equilibrium dissociation constants of the EP and EL complexes, respectively. It can be shown that in the presence of the competing ligand L, the concentration of EP is a function of both the concentration of ligand and its equilibrium dissociation constant K L according to Equation 5,[EP]=([Etot][P])/([P]+KP(1+([L]/KL)))Equation 5 where [E tot] is the total enzyme concentration equal to [E] + [EL] + [EP]. Among the three enzyme species, only EP is fluorescent. Hence, the measured fluorescence intensity Fis only a function of the concentration of EP according to Equation 2. At an infinite concentration of compound P, the enzyme will be saturated with the probe, and the fluorescence will approach the its maximum value, F max. The relative fluorescence intensity, F r, is defined as the ratioF/F max and corresponds to the fractional occupancy of the active site by the probe. Equation 5 can therefore be rewritten as follows.Fr=[P]/([P]+KP(1+([L]/KL)))Equation 6 This equation directly relates fluorescence to the concentration of competing nonfluorescent ligand L and allows the determination of its equilibrium dissociation constant from nonlinear regression analysis of titration data. Association rate constants were determined on an SX-MV18 Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument equipped with a fluorescence detector and interfaced with a Risc computer. The samples and the flow cell were thermostatted at 23 °C. To 70–200 nm protease in 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, 1% CHAPS containing 160 μm NS4A cofactor peptide (final concentrations), increasing concentrations of compound P were added. Under these conditions, we measured a dead time of 1.8 ms with a standard reference reaction (reduction of 2,6-dichlorindophenol by ascorbic acid; Ref. 30.Hiromi I. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 99-101Google Scholar). Protein fluorescence was excited at 280 nm, and a 400-nm cut-off filter was used to suppress both the excitation wavelength and the tryptophan emission band. Time-dependent fluorescence changes upon the addition of compound P to the NS3 protease were recorded under pseudo-first order conditions for at least 5 × t 12 and could be best fitted with a single exponential equation. k obs values derived from this fitting procedure were determined at different concentrations of compound P and used to calculate association rate constants according to Equation 7.kobs=koff+kon[P]Equation 7 The dissociation rate constant k off was estimated from the y axis intercept ofk obs versus [P] plots. Association rate constants of inhibitors were determined by following the kinetics of probe displacement upon addition of the inhibitor to a solution containing 100 nm protease in 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, 1% CHAPS, 80 μm NS4A, and 10 μm compound P (final concentrations). Observed rate constants were obtained by fitting experimental data with a single exponential equation by least squares nonlinear regression analysis. Association rate constants were obtained from these data following the procedure described under “Results.” Competitive inhibitors containing fluorescent groups have been widely used to probe the active site of proteolytic enzymes (31.Sachdev G.P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the enzyme, the fluorescent moiety may enter into a region of lower polarity, which usually results in a blue shift of emission maxima and in an increased fluorescence yield. The active site of the NS3 protease is peculiarly flat and solvent-exposed, suggesting that fluorescent groups attached to an active site binder of this enzyme will experience only minor changes in hydrophobicity once complexed with the enzyme. In such a case, active site binding may still be monitored if the fluorescent group will be positioned in the vicinity of protein tryptophan residues, thus enabling the fluorophore to accept excitation energy from these residues. The dansyl group, attached to an active site binder has spectroscopic properties that are suitable for this purpose (32.Epps D.E. Schostarez H. Argoudelis C.V. Poorman R. Hinzmann J. Sawyer T.K. Mandel F. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the light of these considerations, we attempted to develop a dansylated active site probe for the NS3 protease. We took advantage of our finding that hexamer N-terminal cleavage products of NS3 substrate peptides, spanning residues P6–P1, bind to the enzyme's active site with higher affinity than the corresponding substrates (23.Steinkühler C. Biasiol G. Brunetti M. Urbani A. Koch U. Cortese R. Pessi A. De Francesco R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8899-8905Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We also considered the structure-activity relationship of these product inhibitors (24.Ingallinella P. Altamura S. Bianchi E. Taliani M. Ingenito R. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Pessi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8906-8914Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Starting from the product of the NS4A/NS4B cleavage site with the sequence DEMEEC-OH, we substituted the P2 glutamic acid with a cyclohexylalanine (Cha) to improve affinity and introduced the dansyl group, linked to diaminopropionic acid, in the P4 position. This choice was again guided by the product inhibitor structure-activity relationship, showing that aromatic residues like diphenylalanine are well accepted in this position (24.Ingallinella P. Altamura S. Bianchi E. Taliani M. Ingenito R. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Pessi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8906-8914Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling has shown that in the complex of the resulting hexapeptide, having the sequence Ac-D-E-Dap(N-β-Dansyl)-E-Cha-C-OH (compound P), and the NS3-Pep4AK protease complex, the dansyl moiety will be located at a distance <20 Å from both Trp85 and Trp53 (data not shown). This distance is compatible with a transfer of excitation energy between either tryptophan residue and the fluorescent group in the probe. Compound P was synthesized and characterized by steady-state kinetics, demonstrating that the compound reversibly inhibited the NS3 protease and was competitive with a peptide substrate (Fig.1). From the substrate competition experiment, K i = 200 nm could be calculated. We next explored whether binding of P to the active site of the NS3-Pep4AK protease complex went along with changes in dansyl fluorescence. The fluorescence spectrum of the compound alone showed excitation and emission maxima at 330 and 510 nm, respectively. The addition of NS3 protease, together with its cofactor peptide Pep4AK, resulted in a weak increase in intensity, consistent with the dansyl group experiencing a slightly more hydrophobic environment upon binding to the enzyme's active site (data not shown). In addition, compound P decreased the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the NS3-Pep4AK protease complex at 330 nm and concomitantly gave rise, upon excitation at 280 nm, to an emission band centered at 510 nm (Fig.2). This additional band must result from emission of the dansyl moiety upon energy transfer from the NS3 tryptophan residue(s), which emit at 330 nm (15.Bianchi E. Urbani A. Biasiol G. Brunetti M. Pessi A. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7890-7897Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Unbound compound P showed no significant fluorescence at 510 nm if excited at 280 nm in the absence of NS3 (not shown). Due to this marked difference, we decided to take advantage of the phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer to characterize ligand binding to the active site of the protease in more detail. We first investigated the dependence of the fluorescence emission at 510 nm on the concentration of compound P. Fig. 2 shows that the fluorescence increase was saturable at probe concentrations above 800 nm. Titration data were fitted to Equations 2 and 3 (see “Materials and Methods”), yielding an equilibrium dissociation constant of 180 nm, which is in close agreement with the K i value of 200 nm reported above. Monitoring the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence as a function of added probe (Fig. 2 A), we obtained a dissociation constant of 190 nm, which again is in good agreement with both the K i value and the equilibrium dissociation constant obtained monitoring fluorescence emission at 510 nm. This analysis is based on the assumption of a 1:1 stoichiometry"

Farnesylated proteins include yeast mating factors, nuclear lamins, the retinal heterotrimeric G protein transducin, the retinal rhodopsin kinase, and Ras proteins (1.Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 2.Rando R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3.Parish C.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Geranylgeranylation occurs in all of the remaining heterotrimeric G proteins and small G proteins (2.Rando R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Isoprenylation is particularly interesting with respect to the small G proteins involved in signal transduction because different families undergo specific modifications. For instance, Ras proteins are farnesylated, Rab proteins terminate with CC or CXC, and both cysteine residues are geranylgeranylated, whereas Rho proteins are singly geranylgeranylated with the exception of RhoB and RhoE, which can be farnesylated (4.Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Following prenylation of Rho proteins at cysteine residues in the C-terminal sequence motif CXXX, proteolytic removal of the last three amino acid residues occurs, and subsequently the free α-carboxyl group of the cysteine residue undergoes carboxyl methylation (5.Newman C.M.H. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 79-96PubMed Google Scholar). Prenylation and methylation of the C-terminal cysteine residues of small G proteins increase their attachment to cell membranes (5.Newman C.M.H. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 79-96PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several Rho- and Ras-related proteins also contain a number of basic residues arranged in a combination of lysine and arginine residues adjacent to the C terminus (5.Newman C.M.H. Magee A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 79-96PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ghomashchi F. Zhang X. Liu L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11910-11918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The increased hydrophobicity resulting from the lipidation and methylation of C-terminal cysteine residues and the neutralization of the negative carboxyl charge in the methylated cysteine of small G proteins are critically important in the targeting and anchoring of these proteins to plasma membranes and so to the normal functioning of such proteins. The Rho family of proteins in mammals comprises several members including RhoA, RhoB, and Cdc42 (7.Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Rho proteins transduce signals from plasma membrane receptors and control many cell functions requiring the assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton such as those involved in cell polarity (8.Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 22: 1235-1244Crossref Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), motility (9.Aepfelbacher M. Essler M. Huber E. Czech A. Weber P.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5070-5075PubMed Google Scholar), adhesion (10.Michiels F. Collard J.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 125-146PubMed Google Scholar), cellular transformation (11.Zohar M. Teramoto H. Katz B.-Z. Yamada K.M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (12.Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Oncogene. 1999; 14: 407-415Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although considerable progress has been made recently in identifying the regulators and effectors of Rho proteins (7.Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13.Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1996; 7: 699-706Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the means by which prenylation affects interaction with membrane targets and/or regulatory proteins remains largely unknown. A possible mechanism for prenyl-mediated Rho protein targeting is association with cell membranes by interaction between the prenyl groups and membrane lipids (16.Hori Y. Kikuchi A. Isomura M. Katayama M. Miura Y. Fujioka H. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the translocation of activated Rho proteins from the cytosol to specific membranes in polarized epithelial cells (17.Boivin D. Béliveau R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F180-F189PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that receptors could be involved in the targeting process. In addition, Gβγ dimers of heterotrimeric G proteins bind to GST1·Rho fusion proteinsin vitro (18.Harhammer R. Gohla A. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 399: 211-214Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggesting that Gβγ dimers facilitate the association of Rho proteins to plasma membranes and possibly with other membrane proteins as well. The shuttling of many isoprenylated Rho proteins between the cytoplasmic and membrane compartments appears to be as an essential aspect of their function. This cycling is mainly dependent on the regulatory protein GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and its homologs (19.Adra C.N. Manor D. Ko J.L. Zhu S. Horiuchi T. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. Lim B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4279-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibiting the exchange of guanine nucleotides bound to Rho proteins by forming complexes with them in the cytosol, GDI stimulates the extraction of Rho proteins from membranes and blocks their association with membranes (20.Isomura M. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These GDI activities arise from its ability to bind to the C-terminal isoprenoid of Rho proteins. Thus the prenyl group of Rho proteins is crucial for their interaction with regulatory proteins as well as for their correct targeting to membranes. Previous reports from our laboratory have shown that renal epithelial cells, because of their marked polarization, represent an excellent model for studying the role of small G proteins in cell polarity (17.Boivin D. Béliveau R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F180-F189PubMed Google Scholar,22.Desrosiers R.R. Gauthier F. Lin W. Béliveau R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Membranes isolated from kidney cortex, especially the brush border membranes (BBM), have high levels of Cdc42 and RhoA (17.Boivin D. Béliveau R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F180-F189PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins have the ability to translocate from a soluble to a membrane-bound form when incubated with kidney BBM (17.Boivin D. Béliveau R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F180-F189PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand how Rho proteins exert their biological functions, it is important to identify the mechanisms involved in their membrane binding. Therefore we used the synthetic analogsN-acetyl-S-all-trans,trans-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC) andN-acetyl-S-all-trans-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine (AGGC), which correspond to the C-terminal ends of Rho proteins, to analyze the role of prenylation in their association to BBM in rat kidney. The prenylcysteine analogs AFC,N-acetyl-S-all-trans-geranyl-l-cysteine (AGC), and AGGC were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Leucine p-nitroanilide and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were from Sigma. Affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 120–150 of human RhoA (26C4) and four affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 119–132 of RhoB (119), amino acid residues 182–197 of Rab1 (C-19), amino acid residues 178–198 of GDI, and amino acid residues 166–182 of Cdc42 (P1) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies directed against synthetic peptides corresponding to the 14-amino acid C-terminal portion of the rat sodium/phosphate symporter NaPi-2 were raised in rabbits and affinity-purified on a HiTrap protein A column and then on a peptide-Sepharose column as described (23.Boyer C.J.C. Xiao Y. Dugré A. Vincent E. Delisle M.-C. Béliveau R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1281: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody C219 against the membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was obtained from ID Labs (London, Ontario), anti-β-actin was from Sigma, pan-ras (Ab-3) antibodies (clone 10) were from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), and anti-α-tubulin (AB-1) was from Calbiochem. Donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g of body weight) were obtained from Charles River (Saint-Constant, Quebec). Animals were sacrificed by lethal exposure to carbon dioxide followed by decapitation. The kidneys were quickly removed and chilled in an ice-cold 0.85% NaCl solution. Slices of outer cortex were cut, and BBM was isolated with an Mg2+ precipitation method (24.Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The pellet containing the BBM was resuspended in 50 mmmannitol, 2 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5, to a concentration of about 10 mg of protein/ml and stored at −80 °C. To determine the purity of the membrane preparations, alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in homogenates and BBM as described below. The specific activity was enriched 10–12-fold over that of cortex homogenate, depending on the preparation. To isolate a crude membrane fraction, various tissues were removed into an ice-cold 0.85% NaCl solution, then minced in 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5, and homogenized with a tight-fitting glass Teflon motorized homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min to sediment the membranes. The pellets were resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5. Protein concentration was measured with the method of Bradford (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Alkaline phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase activities were assayed by spectrophotometrically measuring, at 410 nm, the formation ofp-nitrophenol using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (25.Kelly M.H. Hamilton J.R. Clin. Biochem. 1970; 3: 33-43PubMed Google Scholar) and leucine-p-nitroanilide (26.George S.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as substrates. Expression of the recombinant protein GST·GDI in E. coli was carried out as described elsewhere (27.Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). GST·GDI was isolated by affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose beads obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the purity of the fusion protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. Protein concentration was measured as described above. Membranes (20 μg protein), in a final volume of 30 μl, were incubated in 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0, in the presence of prenylcysteine analogs dissolved in a final concentration of 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or, alternatively, with 0.36 μm GST or GST·GDI at 25 or 37 °C for various periods of time. Soluble proteins were separated from membranes by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants and membrane pellets were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Irradiation was carried out at −78 °C in a Gammacell Model 220 60Co irradiator at a dose rate of ∼10 kilograys/h as described previously (29.Beauregard G. Giroux S. Potier M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The target size of Rho proteins in BBM was calculated from the rate of disappearance of immunodetected RhoA and Cdc42 as a function of irradiation dose using the following empirical equation (30.le Maire M. Thauvette L. de Foresta B. Viel A. Beauregard G. Poitier M. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar),Target size=1.29×107/D37Equation 1 where D37 was the irradiation dose (kilogray) at which the measured immunodetected band has been decreased to 37% of its initial value. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) with a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were heated at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min before loading onto 12% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm pore diameter polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) in transfer buffer (96 mm glycine, 10 mm Tris, and 10% methanol) at 80 mA/gel for 1–1.5 h. The blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk (Carnation). Usually, blots were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of different antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 1-h incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween. Immunoreactive bands were detected with the ECL Western blotting kit as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were exposed to Fuji film, and the autoradiograms were scanned with a Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of AGGC was measured by a colorimetric method, which solubilized a blue hydrophobic dye from stained beads as described in the manufacturer's instructions (ProChem, Rockford, IL). Initial experiments were performed to investigate the effects of different prenylcysteine analogs mimicking the C-terminal ends of prenylated Rho proteins on the release of Cdc42 from cell membranes. Incubation of kidney BBM with increasing concentrations of AGGC progressively promoted the extraction of Cdc42, whereas AGC and AFC were ineffective at concentrations up to 250 μm (Fig.1). Thus the prenylcysteine analogs AGC and AFC, which possess aliphatic chains shorter than that of AGGC, were unable to dissociate Cdc42 from BBM. The specificity of AGGC on the release of Cdc42 is of interest because this protein, as the majority of small GTP-binding proteins, is geranylgeranylated (2.Rando R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequently, AGGC was used to characterize the effect of prenylcysteine analogs on the attachment of Rho proteins to membranes. We next measured the ability of AGGC to solubilize various Rho proteins from kidney BBM. A concentration of 200 μm AGGC completely extracted Cdc42 (Fig. 2). Membrane dissociation of RhoA by AGGC was much lower and reached a plateau of 28% extraction at 200 μm AGGC (Fig. 2). In the case of RhoB, less than 10% of this protein was extracted by 250 μm AGGC (Fig. 2). Thus, the solubilization activity was very different for the three Rho proteins at AGGC concentrations greater than 100 μm. Because only a fraction of the RhoA and very little RhoB were released by AGGC treatment, these results show that only a subset of the Rho proteins is sensitive to the extraction activity of AGGC. We subsequently determined the specificity of the solubilizing effect of AGGC on BBM-bound proteins. The extracted proteins by AGGC were separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by silver staining, and then analyzed by densitometry (Fig.3). In untreated (control) and Me2SO-treated BBM, the patterns of released proteins were similar. Interestingly, upon incubation of BBM with AGGC, only a few proteins were recovered into supernatants. In order of abundance, the three major polypeptides were found to migrate at about 46, 20, and 60 kDa. Thus, AGGC was able to solubilize only particular BBM proteins. The effects of AGGC on the activity and dissociation of specific enzyme markers were also measured in BBM. Alkaline phosphatase activity in pelleted membranes and in solubilized material was slightly reduced when BBMs were treated with AGGC compared with those observed in control or Me2SO-treated membranes, whereas the activity of leucine aminopeptidase was similar under all conditions (TableI). Both enzyme activities were similar whether or not AGGC was present in the assay mixtures (Table I). Because the proportions of both alkaline phosphatase (13–15%) and leucine aminopeptidase (10–12%) activities, which were found in supernatants, were similar for both untreated and AGGC-treated BBM, these two enzyme markers were not solubilized by AGGC. Thus, AGGC appeared to have a minor perturbing affect on the binding of proteins to membranes because only a small number of membrane proteins was released (Fig. 3). Furthermore, two BBM markers remained attached to membranes during AGGC treatment, whereas their specific activities were weakly or not affected by the prenylcysteine analog (Table I).Table IEffect of AGGC on total protein extraction and activities of BBM marker enzymesConditionsAlkaline phosphataseLeucine aminopeptidasenmol/minnmol/minControlaThe enzyme activities were measured in the absence of 250 μm AGGC in assay mixtures.

We tested the ability of AGGC to solubilize small G proteins that are isoprenylated differently than are Rho proteins at their C-terminal ends. Cdc42 and RhoA are singly geranylgeranylated, and Rab1, which is doubly geranylgeranylated, was also easily solubilized by AGGC (Fig.4). Interestingly, Ras, which is farnesylated, was not extracted from BBM by AGGC (Fig. 4). Because Rho proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of various cell functions through the dynamic organization of actin microfilaments (7.Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13.Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1996; 7: 699-706Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the major extracted protein showed an apparent molecular weight similar to that of actin, we examined whether AGGC could modulate the interaction of cytoskeletal proteins to membranes. Interestingly, the addition of AGGC to BBM totally solubilized both actin and tubulin (Fig. 4). On the other hand, integral membrane proteins such as P-gp, which causes resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs (31.Demeule M. Wenger R.M. Béliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6647-6652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the sodium/phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2 (23.Boyer C.J.C. Xiao Y. Dugré A. Vincent E. Delisle M.-C. Béliveau R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1281: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) remained membrane-bound in BBM incubated with AGGC (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results suggest that AGGC acts preferentially on the membrane attachment of geranylgeranylated proteins of the Rho and Rab families and certain cytoskeletal proteins. Kidney epithelial cells possess highly polarized apical and basolateral membranes that show typical lipid and protein compositions (32.Leiser J. Molitoris B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether the ability of AGGC to release RhoA and Cdc42 was a general phenomenon, we analyzed its effect on crude membranes from different rat tissues. AGGC extracted nearly all membrane-bound Cdc42 from kidney, liver, testis, and brain (Fig. 5). In the presence of AGGC, proteolytic fragments of Cdc42 were detected in pelleted membranes from kidney and testis and in the soluble fraction from kidney (Fig. 5). The proportion of RhoA extracted by AGGC was more variable. Thus, RhoA was easily solubilized from liver and testis membranes but to a lesser extent from kidney and brain membranes (Fig.5). In addition, membrane-bound actin was almost completely extracted by AGGC in all tissues tested (Fig. 5). Tubulin was easily immunodetected in testis and brain but not in liver and kidney membranes. Once again AGGC solubilized a good fraction of membrane-bound tubulin in testis and brain (Fig. 5). These results show that the ability of AGGC to extract Rho and cytoskeletal proteins from membranes is not limited to kidney BBM but reflects a general process observed in other tissues. First, the ability of a variety of chaotropic reagents to release Rho proteins from kidney BBM was investigated and compared with AGGC. Denaturing reagents such as urea (6 m) and guanidine-HCl (6 m), which unfold proteins, did not extract Cdc42 and RhoA (Fig.6). Similarly, benzyl alcohol (40 mm), known to increase membrane fluidity, did not solubilize these proteins (Fig. 6). Cdc42 and RhoA did not appear to behave as peripheral proteins because a high salt concentration (1m KCl) was unable to extract them (Fig. 6). Thus, various compounds known to extract membrane proteins did not solubilize Cdc42 and RhoA from BBM whereas AGGC partially released RhoA and released Cdc42 in near quantitative amounts. Second, we analyzed the effects of these different chaotropic reagents on the membrane release of Rho proteins by AGGC. Urea and benzyl alcohol did not increase the proportions of Cdc42 and RhoA extracted by AGGC, whereas KCl (1m) totally abolished the Rho protein extraction mediated by AGGC (Fig. 6). Because AGGC released actin and tubulin from kidney BBM (Fig. 4), we also studied the effect of the chaotropic reagents on the extraction of these proteins. In the absence of AGGC, the releasing patterns of actin and tubulin were identical to those of Cdc42 and RhoA. For example, urea and benzyl alcohol released very little actin and tubulin, whereas KCl did not extract these proteins from BBM (Fig. 6). When AGGC was added to BBM, the release of actin and tubulin in the presence of urea and benzyl alcohol was highly effective and similar to that obtained by AGGC alone, but AGGC-mediated release was again abolished by KCl (Fig.6). Together, these results show that the extraction of actin and tubulin parallels that of Cdc42 and RhoA for all conditions tested with chaotropic reagents in the absence as well as in the presence of AGGC. In the absence of AGGC, treatment of BBM with guanidine-HCl strongly decreased the amounts of RhoA and Cdc42 recovered in both the soluble and membrane fractions (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the total amounts of RhoA and Cdc42 detected in soluble and membrane fractions from BBM treated with AGGC plus urea or guanidine-HCl were lower than those observed in control BBM (Fig. 6). A degradation product was also recognized by antibodies directed against Cdc42 in both fractions from BBM treated with urea, which became predominant when AGGC was included (Fig. 6). Some proteolysis of RhoA and Cdc42 also occurred in BBM treated with AGGC because the immunodetected amo"

The protein has proven to be very difficult to refold without assistance to prevent oxidation and aggregation. For this study, the active site cysteine 247, near the interdomain region, was modified with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe, 2-(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (IAANS), to yield a derivative that reversibly unfolds. Structural transitions during urea unfolding/refolding were complex and multiphasic. Increasing urea concentrations increased the IAANS fluorescence intensity and polarization. Both values reached maxima at ≈4m urea, where there is a concomitant large exposure of hydrophobic sites as reported by both IAANS and the noncovalent fluorescent probe, bis-ANS. The exposure of the hydrophobic sites arises from the decrease in strong interaction between the domain interfaces, which lead to their partial separation. This correlates with the loss of activity of the unlabeled enzyme. Above 4.5m urea, there is progressive loss of rigid, hydrophobic surfaces, and both fluorescence and polarization of IAANS decrease, with accompanying loss of secondary structure. These results are consistent with a folding model in which there is an initial, rapid hydrophobic collapse of the denatured form to an intermediate with native like secondary structure, with exposed interdomain, hydrophobic surfaces. This step is followed by adjustment of the domain-domain interactions and the proper positioning of reduced cysteine 247 at the active site.

FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), that catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide. It is a monomeric protein having a molecular mass of 33 kDa containing 293 amino acids (3.Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is folded into two independent, equal-size domains, and its crystal structure is available (3.Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The domains are tightly associated, and the interdomain interface is highly hydrophobic. The active form of rhodanese contains four cysteine residues (63, 247, 254, and 263) that are all reduced. The cysteine 247 is at the active site of rhodanese and it forms a persulfide linkage with the sulfur transferred from thiosulfate (3.Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4.Hol W.G. Lijk L.J. Kalk K.H. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1983; 3: 370-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the crystal structure, it is evident that none of the cysteine residues are in the position to form disulfide linkages easily. The crystal structures of sulfur substituted (ES),1 sulfur depleted (E), and carboxymethylated (CMR), in which active site cysteine is modified by iodoacetic acid, are virtually identical (3.Ploegman J.H.

Int. 1986; 12: 733-740PubMed Google Scholar). Refolding of the denatured protein is difficult because of the competition from aggregation and sulfhydryl oxidation (6.Horowitz P.M. Simon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13887-13891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site sulfhydryl is always involved in the formation of disulfide bond formation during refolding (7.Weng L. Heinrikson R.L. Westley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8109-8119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the carboxymethylated rhodanese (CMR), the active site cysteine is blocked by chemical modification, and it shows highly reversible refolding from the urea denatured state, 2M. Panda and P. M. Horowitz, manuscript in preparation. as it prohibits the sulfhydryl oxidation. Urea induced unfolding of rhodanese has been suggested to occur in at least two stages. The first stage is associated with the loss of activity, and extensive exposure of hydrophobic surfaces (9.Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transition increases the proteolytic susceptibility of the tether region, residues 143–158, which the x-ray results show are tightly bound to the surface of the protein (10.Shibatani T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33795-33799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This region is not susceptible to trypsin up to 3 m urea. At 4.25 m urea, tether region becomes loose and can be cleaved by trypsin producing the two globular N- and C-terminal domains (10.Shibatani T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Commun. 1974; 57: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The second stage of denaturation involves unfolding of this intermediate state. In the present paper, we have studied the conformational change in and around the active site of the enzyme during urea induced unfolding and its implication for the folding of rhodanese. This is the first time that the vicinity of the active site has been directly probed during reversible folding. We have modified the active site cysteine with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe, IAANS. The results are consistent with a model, which involves initial collapse of the unfolded protein to give folded domains followed by their association to yield the native, active conformation. Urea was of electrophoresis purity, purchased from Bio-Rad. All other reagents used were of analytical grade. IAANS and bis-ANS were purchased from Molecular Probe Inc. (Eugene, OR). Recombinant bovine liver rhodanese was purified as described previously and stored at −70 °C, as a crystalline suspension in 1.8 m ammonium sulfate. It was desalted on Sephadex G-50 column before use (14.Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodanese concentration was determined by using a value of A280 nm0.1% = 1.75 (15.Sorbo B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1123-1127Crossref Google Scholar). Rhodanese activity was measured by a colorimetric method based on the absorbance at 460 nm of the complex formed between ferric ion and reaction product thiocyanate (3.Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The assay was initiated by adding microgram quantities of rhodanese, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of formaldehyde. 25-Fold molar excess of IAANS in N,N-dimethylformamide was added to 2 mg/ml rhodanese in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. A 20-fold molar excess of KCN over rhodanese was added to this solution and incubated at room temperature in the dark. The buffer was flushed with nitrogen to remove oxygen, as sulfhydryl oxidation involving the active site cysteine was a major reaction (5.Berni R. Cannella C. Monaco H.L. Rossi G.L. Biochem. Int. 1986; 12: 733-740PubMed Google Scholar), which could compete with the active site cysteine modification. The reaction was monitored by following the loss of activity of the protein. When the enzyme lost ≈50% activity, the reaction mixture was chromatographed on Sephadex G-50 to remove excess IAANS and KCN and eluted with 0.2 msodium phosphate, pH 7.6. The incorporation ratio was in the range of 0.6–0.7. The position of RHAANS both by fluorescence and Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was identical to rhodanese. Both rhodanese and RHAANS were denatured in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing different concentrations of urea, at a protein concentration of 1 μm. For equilibrium denaturation, protein samples were incubated at room temperature, for 18 h. All the reaction mixtures except those used for CD measurements contained 1 mm dithiothreitol. All fluorescence measurements were made on Fluorolog-3 (Jobin Yvon-Spex) spectrofluorometer. Buffer used in all experiments was 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. The temperature was always maintained at 23 °C. In all experiments, the protein concentration was maintained at 1 μm, unless mentioned otherwise. The excitation and emission bandwidths were always 1 nm. For measurements of fluorescence and polarization of bound IAANS in RHAANS, excitation was at 327 nm and emission was monitored at 440 nm. For bis-ANS binding studies, the excitation was maintained at 425 nm, where bound IAANS had no absorption, and emission was followed at 500 nm, where bound IAANS did not have any fluorescence. For studies with the noncovalent probe bis-ANS, the protein (both rhodanese and RHAANS):bis-ANS was always maintained at 50:1 molar ratio. CD spectral scans were performed using an OLIS instrument (Cary-16, Spectrophotometer, On Line Instrument Systems, Inc.). A 0.01-cm path length cuvette was used in spectral scans in the 200–260 nm range. Typically, 5 μmprotein samples were used for CD measurements, and the buffer was 0.2m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. For equilibrium urea denaturation, the profile was generated using the equation,Y app = Y obs −Y u/Y n − Y u, where Y obs were the observed ellipticities at 222 nm at different urea concentrations, Y n andY u were those in the native and denatured state. For quenching, a stock 1 m acrylamide solution was made in 0.2 msodium phosphate, pH 7.6. The absorbance at 327 and 440 nm were measured for each data point and used to correct the fluorescence for the inner filter effect. The Stern-Volmer equation,F 0/F = 1 +K SV [Q], was used for analysis. In this equation, F 0 was the fluorescence in the absence of quencher, F was that in the presence of quencher, [Q] was the quencher concentration, andK SV was the Stern-Volmer constant, which indicates the accessibility of the fluorescence for quenching. The light scattering of 1 μm RHAANS was monitored immediately after addition of protein to different urea concentrations. Both excitation and emission were at 340 nm with 0.5 nm band pass. Buffer used was 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. Buffer and urea were Millipore filtered before using. Fig.1shows the unfolding and refolding of RHAANS in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol. The fluorescence of the active site-labeled enzyme is used to monitor the local structure of rhodanese. The data were recorded 18 h after preparing the samples. The fluorescence of the bound probe changes in a complex transition. As the urea concentration increases, there is little change in the intensity up to 2 m urea. Then, there is a steep rise in intensity up to 4.5 m urea, beyond which there is a steep fall. This rise in fluorescence intensity correlates with the loss of activity of rhodanese from unlabeled enzyme (9.Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in fluorescence intensity is due to an increase in accessible hydrophobicity around the active site, where the environmentally sensitive probe is covalently bound. Since this method modifies cysteine 247, which is at the interdomain interface, the result reflects that the two-domain structure of rhodanese is stabilized by strong hydrophobic interface that can be exposed by perturbation with urea. A similar complex transition is observed when bis-ANS binding to rhodanese is monitored at different urea concentrations (9.Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transition is completely reversible (Fig. 1). Thus, this profile suggests that there are two transitions during urea induced unfolding of rhodanese. The first transition involves the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces around the active site cysteine (247), so that the environmentally sensitive probe attached to it is in more hydrophobic environment and hence shows fluorescence enhancement. Since the structural perturbations occur around the active site, it also accounts the loss in activity associated with this step. The second transition is the global melting of the protein, which destroys all the hydrophobic structures, and there is a decrease in fluorescence with the increase of urea concentration beyond 4.5 m urea. The complete reversibility indicates that the involvement of active site cysteine in the sulfhydryl oxidation has a major role in nonreversibility of refolding that is normally observed with rhodanese. Fig. 2 shows the polarization of the bound probe in RHAANS during unfolding and refolding transitions, at different urea concentrations. The profile shows a complex transition like that monitored by fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1). There is only a modest change in polarization of bound IAANS up to ≈2 m urea. Beyond this, there is a sharp rise in polarization up to ≈3.5 urea. At higher concentrations of urea, polarization values fall sharply and become limiting above ≈6.5 m urea. This transition is completely reversible (Fig. 2). The increase in polarization values indicates that the fluorophore attached to active site cysteine (247) is in more rigid environment at around 3.5 m urea. There are two possibilities, which can account for the enhanced hydrophobic (increase in fluorescence of the covalently bound probe) and rigid environment (increase in polarization of the bound probe) in 3.5 murea. One is at 3.5 m urea, rhodanese may form a sticky intermediate that can associate, giving rise to aggregated product. The other possibility is that 3.5 m urea may loosen up the interdomain interactions, exposing the hydrophobic interface allowing the fluorescent probe attached to active site cysteine to enter into the hydrophobic interdomain interface. The interdomain space may impose restriction on the mobility of the bound probe. The visible light scattering experiments do not show any associated species up to 5m urea (data not shown), which rules out the first possibility. Recent studies have been shown that the interdomain interaction can be perturbed at 4.25 m urea, making the hinge region susceptible to tryptic digestion (9.Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Shibatani T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33795-33799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Both rhodanese and RHAANS respond similarly when structural changes are followed by monitoring ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of urea concentrations. Fig. 3 shows that there is no change in ellipticity of rhodanese or RHAANS up to 4.5m urea. This result clearly indicates that there is no global change in the structure of the protein. Beyond this urea concentration, there is steep fall in ellipticity, which accounts for complete loss of secondary structure between 4.5 and 7 murea. Fig. 4,A and B, show the CD spectra of rhodanese and RHAANS in 0, 4.5 and 8 m urea, respectively. There are no differences in the spectra of either rhodanese or RHAANS in 0 and 4.5m urea, which indicates that there is no global change in the structure up to 4.5 m urea. In 8 m urea, there is substantial decrease in CD signal, which accounts for the global melting of the protein, producing random coil structure. Fig. 5 shows the Stern-Volmer plot of quenching by acrylamide of IAANS bound to rhodanese in 0, 4.5, and 8 m urea. In 8 m urea, all the fluorescence is available for solvent quenching, as it produces a straight line with virtually zero slope. The values ofK SV in 0 and 4.5 m urea are 6.9 ± 0.18 and 5.79 ± 0.04, respectively. TheK SV values are very similar. The slight additional protection of bound fluorophore in 4.5 m urea (slightly lower K SV value) may be due to shielding of the active site cysteine within the interdomain interface, which correlates with the higher fluorescence and polarization of IAANS bound to that cysteine residue, as seen above. TableI shows the fluorescence intensities, emission maxima, and polarizations of bis-ANS bound to rhodanese and RHAANS, in 0, 4.5, and 8 m urea. Protein is used in large excess over bis-ANS (50:1) to minimize the effect of free bis-ANS in solution. As the urea concentration increases from 0 to 4.5m urea, relative fluorescence of the bound bis-ANS increases from 800 to 1600 (in arbitrary unit) with rhodanese, and 900 to 1900 (in arbitrary unit) with RHAANS. The enhancement in fluorescence is accompanied by the increase in polarization values from 0.21 to 0.33 (in case of rhodanese) and from 0.22 to 0.39 (in case of RHAANS). There is also a concomitant blue shift in the bis-ANS emission maxima from 483 to 478 for rhodanese and from 486 to 478 for RHAANS. As the urea concentration is increased to 8 m urea, there is drop in fluorescence and polarization, and the emission maxima shift toward the red. These data support the idea that 4.5 m urea opens the hydrophobic interdomain interface, and the binding of a hydrophobic probe like bis-ANS to this site decreases its mobility.Table IPolarization at 500 nm (P500), fluorescence at 500 nm (F 500), and emission maxima (λmax) of bis-ANS bound to rhodanese and RHAANS in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 0, 4.5, and 8 m ureaSampleParameter0m4.5 m8 mRhodaneseP500.21.33.07RHAANSP 500.22.39.08Rhodaneseλmax483478510RHAANSλmax486478505RhodaneseF 5008001600400RHAANSF 5009001900450The protein (both rhodanese and RHAANS) concentration was 50-fold molar excess over bis-ANS, to minimize the effect of free bis-ANS in the solution.

Urea denatured rhodanese does not undergo unassisted refolding, because of the competition among refolding, aggregation, and formation of disulfide linkages (16.Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9859-9866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are present. Mutational studies show that cysteine 247 is the only cysteine residue responsible for the activity of the enzyme (23.Miller-Martini D.M. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Miller-Martini D.M. Hua S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12414-12418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cysteine is located near the cleft formed by the juxtaposition of the two domains. During oxidation, this cysteine 247 is most reactive, and always involved in the formation of intramolecular disulfides (23.Miller-Martini D.M. Chirgwin J.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine 247 can be modified exclusively, and x-ray crystallographic data reveal that its chemical modification, e.g. by iodoacetic acid to form CMR, does not significantly alter the protein structure. This derivative has a virtually identical structure compared with sulfur free (E) and sulfur substituted (ES) forms of the enzyme both in solution and in the crystal (5.Berni R. Cannella C. Monaco H.L. Rossi G.L. Biochem. Int. 1986; 12: 733-740PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, in CMR, cysteine 247 loses its ability to form disulfide linkages with other cysteine residues during refolding. As expected, it shows excellent reversibility during refolding from urea, in the absence of any assistance (8.Betton J.-M. Desmadril M. Mitraki A. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6654-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These observations, along with the position of the highly reactive active site cysteine at the cleft formed by two globular domains, make rhodanese a good model system to study the conformational change around the active site during folding of the protein. Multiphasic transitions are observed for “hinge-bending” type proteins such as T4 lysozyme (25.Desmadril M. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and phosphoglycerate kinase (8.Betton J.-M. Desmadril M. Mitraki A. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6654-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rhodanese, whose two globular domains are linked by a connecting region consisting of a single strand of polypeptide chain also shows at least a two-step unfolding transition. The first step of urea induced unfolding involves local change in the structure as the secondary structures are similar in 0 and 4.5 m urea (Fig. 4). Major changes involved in this stage are around tether region and interdomain interface affecting the environment of the active site. In the absence of perturbation, the tether region is tightly bound to the surface of the two domains and completely inaccessible to proteolytic cleavage in the native protein. At 4.25 m urea, this interaction becomes weak, and the tether becomes susceptible to trypsin, yielding two globular domains (10.Shibatani T. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33795-33799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic interaction between two domains also decreases, resulting in opening up of interdomain interface. This in turn exposes the available hydrophobic sites, as evident from higher bis-ANS binding (Table I). The exposed hydrophobic sites are close to the active site cysteine, as there is increase in fluorescence of bound IAANS in 4.5 m urea (Fig. 1). IAANS is an environmentally sensitive probe and it is covalently linked to the active site cysteine residue, so fluorescence enhancement is solely due to increase in hydrophobicity of its environment. The loss of strong interaction between two domains, perturbed by urea, may help the reactive cysteine residue to enter into the interdomain interface. High polarization values and protection against collisional quenching (Figs.2 and 4) at 4.5 m urea, support the idea that the probe (and the active site cysteine) can slip into the interdomain space, where it is more protected and less mobile. This accounts for the loss of activity of unlabeled rhodanese associated with the first step. Based on the observations reported here, a model is supported in which urea perturbation weakens the strong interdomain interaction in the native enzyme, and there is a partial separation between them. The active site cysteine residue can enter into this space, which is hydrophobic and rigid. This step is associated with inactivation of the unlabeled enzyme. As urea concentrations are increased further, global melting of the protein would occur. This suggestion is consistent with a model, according to which the first step in rhodanese folding involves the rapid formation of native-like domains, with exposed hydrophobic patches, separated by a flexible tether region. This would be followed by a second step that includes slow adjustment of the domain interactions, which would foster proper alignment of cysteine 247 at the active site."

When treated with chemotherapeutic drugs, many cancer cells develop resistance to a variety of structurally and functionally unrelated compounds (for review, see Ref. 1.Simon S.M. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3497-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In most cases, MDR is mediated by an increased expression of the integral membrane multidrug transporters (reviewed in Refs. 2.Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 3.Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

These membrane proteins, known as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, function in an ATP-dependent way probably by increasing drug efflux and consequently lowering their intracellular accumulation. In a similar manner, many pathogenic microorganisms such as Candida albicans and Plasmodium falciparum can use the ABC transporter-mediated drug efflux mechanism to evade chemotherapy (5.Cowman A.F. Foote S.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1990; 20: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6.Foote S.J. Thompson J.K. Cowman A.F. Kemp D.J.

However, despite the rapidly growing number of ABC transporters identified in various organisms, little is known about how activities of the drug transporters are modulated and how aberrant regulation of the expression of ABC transporter genes contributes to the acquisition of MDR in vivo.The ABC transporter-mediated drug efflux mechanism is evolutionarily conserved and occurs in a variety of living organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. An example is a recent work demonstrating that theLactococcus lactis ABC transporter LmrA is able to confer MDR in human cells (9.Van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Soceneantu L. Sardini A. Konings W.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1998; 291: 291-295Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The recently completed genome sequencing project of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed the presence of as many as 29 proteins belonging to the ubiquitous ABC superfamily (10.Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) that transport a wide range of chemical compounds (11.Kolaczkowski M. Kolaczowska A. Luczynski J. Witek S.

The yeast ABC proteins so far characterized, such as Pdr5, Snq2, Ycf1 and Yor1, confer MDR with physiological and biochemical properties very similar to the human MDR1-encoded P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and to Mrp1, which is known as a multidrug resistance associated protein (13.Balzi E.

These observations suggest the presence of a signaling pathway upstream of Pdr1 and Pdr3 in the cellular response to drug stress.At a post-translational level, attention has been directed to a possible role of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in the modulation of ABC transporter activity. Because the human P-gp is phosphorylated in vivo, an approach is to develop chemosensitizers that inhibit P-gp function at the level of phosphorylation and reverse the MDR phenotype in tumor cells. Early studies have demonstrated that a change in the state of phosphorylation of P-gp has been associated with differences in relative drug resistance of mammalian cells, suggesting that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of the efflux activity of the drug transporter (40.Center M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41.Hamada H. Hagiwara K.I. Nakajima T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2860-2865PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, similar results were obtained with the human Mrp1 transporter. By using protein kinase inhibitors, it has been shown that phosphorylation of the serine residues of Mrp1, probably by protein kinase C, plays an important role in modulating drug accumulation in resistant cells (42.Gekeler V. Boer R. Ise W. Sanders K.H. Schachtele C. Beck J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43.Ma L.-D. Krishnamachary N. Center M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3338-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies identified four serine residues in a basic domain of the linker region of the human P-gp that are accessible and recognized as major targets for phosphorylation by protein kinase C or protein kinase A. However, recent mutational analysis showed that a mutant P-gp, with the putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C within the linker region changed to non-phosphorylatable alanine residues, or to aspartic acid residues to mimic permanently dephosphorylated serine residues, is still functionally active to diminish drug accumulation within cells (44.Germann U.A.

This suggests that phosphorylation by protein kinase C may not play a role in regulating drug transport of P-gp. Whether the phosphorylation of an acidic domain of the linker region is involved in the modulation of drug transport activity remains to be established (46.Glavy J.S. Horwitz S.B. Orr G.A. J. Biol.

With Ycf1, substitution of a serine to alanine residue in the potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site in a central region of Ycf1 renders the protein non-functional.In this study we identified nuclear mutations conferring MDR in the budding yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. We find that the gene defined by the mutations encodes a protein phosphatase belonging to the Sit4/PPV/PP6 family. It was found that the Sit4 protein has a broad role in regulating MDR by altering the expression or activity of different membrane drug transporters. To our knowledge this is the first protein phosphatase genetically identified that is involved in modulation of multidrug resistance.DISCUSSIONThe Sit4 protein is a type 2A-related protein phosphatase (75.Stark M.J.R. Black S. Sneddon A.A. Andrews P.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that has been originally identified in S. cerevisiae. Specific mutations in the ScSIT4 gene restore transcription of the HIS4 gene in the absence of thetrans-acting DNA binding factors GCN4, BAS1, and BAS2 that are normally required for HIS4 expression (66.Arndt K.T. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Loss of theSIT4 gene product was proposed to cause aberrant transcriptional activity of the RNA polymerase II because of accumulation of the phosphorylated form of an unknown transcription factor. Subsequent studies have shown that the Sit4 protein phosphatase is involved in cell cycle progression and bud formation (72.Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 76.Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Sutton A. Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2417-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), in control of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase activities (77.Posas F. Clotet J. Arino J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and in the ceramide-induced and Tor-signaling pathways (78.Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 79.Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 80.Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The Sit4 function is evolutionarily conserved as S. cerevisiae sit4mutants can be complemented by the SIT4 homologues fromD. melanogaster and human cells (70.Mann D.J. Dombrádi V. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4833-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 71.Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Reported in this study is the isolation of a SIT4 homologue from the budding yeast K. lactis. Several novel functional aspects of the Sit4 protein phosphatase in K. lactis are described. First, K. lactis SIT4 is not essential as disruption of the gene in several strains did not cause non-viability. In S. cerevisiae, null mutants are viable only in a genetic background with the SSD-v1 version of the polymorphicSSD1 gene (72.Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Second, K. lactis sit4 mutants are clearly impaired in respiratory function. Respiratory growth ofsit4 mutants can be totally abolished when cells are grown at 37 or 19 °C. Although a growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources was observed in the S. cerevisiae transcriptional suppressor sit4 mutants (66.Arndt K.T. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a SIT4-disrupted strain with a SSD1-v1 background is respiratory-competent (72.Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Third, we find that sit4 mutants of K. lactis have an increased formation of specific nuclear mutations on exposure to ethidium bromide that permits the recovery of cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, suggesting that Sit4p may affect susceptibility to a mutagenic agent such as ethidium bromide. 5G. D. Clark-Walker, unpublished data. Finally, Sit4p has an important role in regulating MDR.In S. cerevisiae, two classes of multidrug resistance genes have been genetically identified. The first class of genes are ones encoding membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such asPDR5/STS1/YDR1, SNQ2, YCF1, YOR1, andPDR12 that mediate drug efflux out of cells (13.Balzi E.

Among the well characterized transcriptional regulators are PDR1 and PDR3, which control the transcriptional levels of PDR5,YOR1, PDR10, and PDR15 (28.Balzi E. Chen W. Ulaszewski S. Capieaux E.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the simplest interpretation for the MDR phenotype associated with K. lactis sit4 mutants is that the Sit4 protein phosphatase has a regulatory role on either of the two types of genes mentioned above, which ultimately modify the drug efflux capacity of the membrane ABC transporters.K. lactis sit4 mutants display altered sensitivity to a wide range of mechanistically unrelated drugs. These drugs include the mitochondrial inhibitors oligomycin, antimycin A, and paromomycin that target to the ATP synthase, the bc 1 complex of the respiratory chain, and mitochondrial ribosomes, respectively, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and econazole, the antimicrobial preservative sorbic acid, and the mutagen 4-NQO. Efflux of most of these compounds has been shown to require specific ABC transporters in yeast. In S. cerevisiae, efflux of the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and econazole4 is mediated by the Pdr5 transporter (8.Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Ischer F. Pagani J.L. Monod M. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2378-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 73.Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); oligomycin is transported by Yor1 (17.Katzmann D.J. Hallström T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); the detoxification of sorbic acid requires the Pdr12 pump (47.Piper P. Mahé Y. Thompson S. Pandjaitan R. Holyoak C. Egner R. Mühlbauer M. Coote P. Kuchler K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4257-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas 4-NQO is a specific substrate for the ABC protein Snq2 (20.Servos J. Haase E. Brendel M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Transporters for antimycin A and paromomycin have not yet been assigned.In K. lactis sit4 mutants, at least four distinct types of transporters appear to be affected. Recent studies have revealed that a single pump is responsible for transport of ketoconazole, econazole, oligomycin, and antimycin.2 This transporter, most likely corresponding to the Pdr5 homologue in K. lactis, is negatively regulated by Sit4p. Rhodamine 6G could also be transported by the same protein. In contrast, a membrane transporter, responsible for detoxification of paromomycin, is positively regulated by Sit4p.sit4 mutants are hypersensitive to paromomycin, and overexpression of SIT4 causes a drastic elevation of resistance to the antibiotic. In addition, two other transporters, required for resistance to sorbic acid and 4-NQO, are also positively regulated by Sit4p. Based on the differential responses to overexpression of SIT4, these two transporters, together with that for paromomycin, are functionally distinct. In contrast to the paromomycin transporter, the function of the pump for sorbic acid is only slightly augmented in cells overexpressing SIT4,whereas the detoxifying capacity of the pump for 4-NQO is not affected by increasing SIT4 dosage. By analogy to S. cerevisiae, the pumps responsible for sorbic acid and 4-NQO might be related to the Pdr12 and Snq2 transporters of S. cerevisiae (20.Servos J. Haase E. Brendel M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 47.Piper P. Mahé Y. Thompson S. Pandjaitan R. Holyoak C. Egner R. Mühlbauer M. Coote P. Kuchler K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4257-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).Strong support for a role of Sit4p in modulating MDR by altering the function of membrane transporters and ultimately the intracellular drug accumulation comes from the drug efflux assay using the fluorescent dye rhodamine 6G. In K. lactis, we have shown that an ABC transporter, likely to be of the Pdr5-type, promotes the efflux of rhodamine 6G in an energy-dependent and FK506-sensitive manner. When sit4 mutants were examined, accumulation of rhodamine 6G was indeed significantly decreased compared with wild-type cells. As the strong rhodamine 6G efflux in sit4 cells is sensitive to inhibition by the Pdr5-specific drug FK506, we can conclude that the function of a Pdr5-type pump is up-regulated. These results are in accord with the elevated resistance of sit4mutants to the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and econazole, which share the same transporter with rhodamine 6G in S. cerevisiae. Another line of evidence supporting the involvement of Sit4p in regulating expression/activity of membrane ABC transporters is our preliminary study showing altered protein levels of ABC transporters insit4 mutants. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies againstS. cerevisiae proteins has revealed that the accumulation of Pdr12- and Snq2-like transporters in K. lactis is in fact decreased by severalfold in sit4 cells,4 which is in agreement with the down-regulation pattern of resistance for sorbic acid and 4-NQO in sit4 mutants.As discussed above, the Sit4 phosphatase is involved in the regulation of different types of membrane transporters in both a positive and a negative manner. Mechanistically, control by the Sit4 phosphatase can intervene at different levels as follows: 1) Sit4p could modulate the function of the transcriptional factors that activate expression of particular ABC transporter genes; 2) Sit4p may control membrane targeting and turnover of the drug transporters; and 3) Sit4p could also directly regulate the drug pumping activity or substrate specificity of the membrane transporters by dephosphorylating a phospho-Ser/Thr residue(s). In S. cerevisiae, although most multidrug-resistant mutants are confined to mutations in transcriptional factors, some ABC transporters such as Pdr5 are ubiquitinated (82.Egner R. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and subjected to vacuolar degradation (83.Egner R. Mahé Y. Pandjaitan R. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has also been documented that phosphorylation in a hypothetical modular domain of the yeast Ycf1 transporter is important for drug resistance (21.Szczpka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each type of ABC transporter may thus adopt a different regulatory pattern. In K. lactis, because both positive and negative regulation are observed in sit4 mutants, it can be imagined that more than one pathway operates to achieve the regulation of individual transporters by Sit4p. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms would first require the isolation and characterization ofK. lactis ABC transporter genes, which is currently underway in our laboratories. The occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR)1 is one of the main obstacles to the successful treatment of cancer. When treated with chemotherapeutic drugs, many cancer cells develop resistance to a variety of structurally and functionally unrelated compounds (for review, see Ref. 1.Simon S.M. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3497-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In most cases, MDR is mediated by an increased expression of the integral membrane multidrug transporters (reviewed in Refs. 2.Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 3.Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

These membrane proteins, known as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, function in an ATP-dependent way probably by increasing drug efflux and consequently lowering their intracellular accumulation. In a similar manner, many pathogenic microorganisms such as Candida albicans and Plasmodium falciparum can use the ABC transporter-mediated drug efflux"

The prescient term “integrin” reflects their role in integrating cell adhesion and migration with the cytoskeleton (1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar). Their biological and medical importance is underscored by inherited diseases causing bleeding (Glanzmann's thromasthenia) and infection (leukocyte adhesion deficiency). Additional important roles for integrins in immune, inflammatory and infectious disease have been revealed by in vitro and gene ablation studies. The minireviews in this and following issues update our understanding of integrins in four general areas: structure and ligand binding (by Edward F. Plow, Thomas A. Haas, Li Zhang, Joseph Loftus, and Jeffrey W. Smith), interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and regulation of ligand binding (by David A. Calderwood, Sanford J. Shattil, and Mark H. Ginsberg), leukocyte integrins (by Estelle S. Harris, Thomas M. McIntyre, Stephen M. Prescott, and Guy A. Zimmerman), and modulation of integrin function by lateral associations with other plasma membrane-spanning molecules (by Anne Woods and John R. Couchman).Early on, it was noted that integrins isolated from cells solubilized with detergents often bound poorly to immobilized ligands. Now, it is clear that binding of integrins to ligands is regulated by intracellular signaling, so-called “inside-out” signaling. This provides a dynamic mechanism for regulating cell adhesion,e.g. during cell adhesion, migration, or platelet aggregation. Ligand binding by integrins is modulated by changes in avidity, e.g. by clustering integrins and increasing interactions with multivalent ligands or by increasing binding affinity by conformational changes as reviewed by Calderwood et al.in the second minireview in this series. Calderwood et al.also provide a comprehensive overview of known interactions between integrin cytoplasmic domains and molecules associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Ligand binding triggers intracellular signaling cascades. Intriguingly, ligand engagement also regulates the response of attached cells to growth factors, a relationship anticipated by Paul Bornstein's concept of “dynamic reciprocity” between cells and the extracellular matrix (2.Bornstein P. McPherson J. Sage H. Nossell H.L. Vogel H.J. Pathobiology of the Endothelial Cell. 6. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1982: 215-228Crossref Google Scholar). In this context, integrins sample the extracellular microenvironment, reporting via intracellular signaling and regulating responses including growth, cellular differentiation, and even death.Integrins do not act alone; indeed, they lack catalytic activity and depend upon an extensive array of extracellular and intracellular partners to localize to membrane microdomains, recruit signaling molecules, and trigger intracellular signaling. The fourth minireview in this series by Woods and Couchman focuses primarily on two classes of membrane-spanning molecules implicated in modulation of integrins, tetraspans, and syndecans, although many other molecules have been implicated. The medical importance of leukocyte integrins and platelet integrins has led to important insights into their chemistry and biology. The development of pharmaceuticals targeting integrins is an important part of many drug discovery portfolios aimed at allergy and inflammatory disease, atherosclerosis, and clotting. In the third minireview of this series Zimmerman and co-workers enlarge on the general theme of integrin structure, ligand binding, and regulation focusing on leukocyte integrins.
