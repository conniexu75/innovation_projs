https://openalex.org/W2156880688,"Thousands of long intervening noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in mammals. To better understand the evolution and functions of these enigmatic RNAs, we used chromatin marks, poly(A)-site mapping and RNA-Seq data to identify more than 550 distinct lincRNAs in zebrafish. Although these shared many characteristics with mammalian lincRNAs, only 29 had detectable sequence similarity with putative mammalian orthologs, typically restricted to a single short region of high conservation. Other lincRNAs had conserved genomic locations without detectable sequence conservation. Antisense reagents targeting conserved regions of two zebrafish lincRNAs caused developmental defects. Reagents targeting splice sites caused the same defects and were rescued by adding either the mature lincRNA or its human or mouse ortholog. Our study provides a roadmap for identification and analysis of lincRNAs in model organisms and shows that lincRNAs play crucial biological roles during embryonic development with functionality conserved despite limited sequence conservation.

The zebrafish genome encodes hundreds of long intervening noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) Only 29 of 567 lincRNAs have detectable sequence homology with mammalian lincRNAs Two lincRNAs, cyrano and megamind, are required for proper embryonic development The functionality of these two lincRNAs is retained in their human/mouse orthologs The availability of sequenced genomes for many species has shifted the focus from determining the genetic makeup of organisms to the delineation of the functional elements they encode. These analyses have revealed that, in addition to loci generating known genes, many other loci are transcribed, often in a regulated and tissue-specific fashion (Bertone et al., 2004Bertone P.

In the human and mouse genomes, thousands of loci produce RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) that are capped, polyadenylated and often spliced, yet do not overlap protein-coding genes or previously characterized classes of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); these have been called long intervening ncRNAs (lincRNAs) (Guttman et al., 2009Guttman M.

Comparative sequence analysis and functional studies in nonmammalian species have greatly advanced the understanding of protein-coding genes as well as microRNAs and other ncRNAs. However, these approaches were not immediately applied to lincRNAs because of their more limited sequence conservation (Ponjavic et al., 2007Ponjavic J. Ponting C.P. Lunter G.

Thousands of lincRNAs have been reported in human and mouse, some of which have recognizable sequence homology in the other species (Ponjavic et al., 2007Ponjavic J. Ponting C.P. Lunter G.

However, there have been only a few hints that orthologs of mammalian lincRNAs exist outside of mammals (Chodroff et al., 2010Chodroff R.A. Goodstadt L. Sirey T.M. Oliver P.L. Davies K.E. Green E.D.

Therefore, the promise of model organisms for providing insight into mammalian lincRNA genomics, evolution, and function has awaited accurate experimental identification of lincRNAs in a nonmammalian model organism. Although high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides information useful for lincRNA identification (Guttman et al., 2010Guttman M. Garber M. Levin J.Z. Donaghey J. Robinson J. Adiconis X. Fan L. Koziol M.J. Gnirke A. Nusbaum C. et al.Ab initio reconstruction of cell type-specific transcriptomes in mouse reveals the conserved multi-exonic structure of lincRNAs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), the short reads of current technologies limit the ability to accurately delineate full-length transcriptional units, especially those of lincRNAs, which typically are expressed at low levels (Guttman et al., 2009Guttman M. Amit I. Garber M. French C. Lin M.F. Feldser D. Huarte M. Zuk O. Carey B.W.

USA. 2009; 106: 11667-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar). Therefore, to build a robust pipeline for lincRNA discovery, complementary datasets augmenting RNA-Seq–based reconstruction must be acquired and integrated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) generates genome-wide chromatin-state maps (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E.

Amit I. Garber M. French C. Lin M.F. Feldser D. Huarte M. Zuk O. Carey B.W. Cassady J.P. et al.Chromatin signature reveals over a thousand highly conserved large non-coding RNAs in mammals.Nature. 2009; 458: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar, Khalil et al., 2009Khalil A.M.

USA. 2009; 106: 11667-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar). Particularly informative have been the maps of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), which marks promoters of genes actively transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and maps of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), which marks the bodies of these genes (Schubeler et al., 2004Schubeler D.

Newman J. et al.Connecting microRNA genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 134: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Another approach that provides important information for defining boundaries of transcriptional units is poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq) (Jan et al., 2011Jan C.H. Friedman R.C. Ruby J.G. Bartel D.P. Formation, regulation and evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans 3′UTRs.Nature. 2011; 469: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This method isolates distal segments of polyadenylated transcripts and identifies them by high-throughput sequencing. Although the initial description and application of 3P-Seq focused on protein-coding genes (Jan et al., 2011Jan C.H. Friedman R.C. Ruby J.G. Bartel D.P. Formation, regulation and evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans 3′UTRs.Nature. 2011; 469: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the method defines 3′ termini of all polyadenylated transcripts, including lincRNAs. To identify lincRNAs of zebrafish (Danio rerio), we acquired chromatin maps and poly(A) sites from three developmental stages and developed a framework for lincRNA discovery that integrates these new datasets with transcriptome datasets, which included RNA-Seq reads, annotated ESTs and full-length cDNAs. We report more than 550 distinct lincRNAs in zebrafish and analyze their sequence and genomic properties, temporal and spatial expression, and conservation. For functional studies, we examined two lincRNAs with short stretches of deep conservation across vertebrates and found that these lincRNAs play important roles in brain morphogenesis and eye development, and that these functions are retained in their mammalian orthologs. To allow a systematic overview of actively transcribed regions, we generated genome-wide chromatin maps of histone H3 modifications with ChIP-Seq, focusing on zebrafish embryos at 24 and 72 hr postfertilization (hpf) and mixed-gender adults (Table S1 available online). As in other species (Barski et al., 2007Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K.

Genet. 2009; 41: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), H3K4me3 marks were strongly enriched around transcription start sites, H3K36me3 levels were higher in gene bodies, and the amplitudes of both marks reflected gene expression levels (Figures S1A and S1B ). At each stage, between 16,171 and 19,557 H3K4me3 peaks were identified (Figure 1A and Table S2), most of which were present in all three stages (Figure S1C). We also applied 3P-Seq to poly(A)-selected RNA from the same three stages and identified 66,895 poly(A) sites (Figure 1B and Table S1 and Table S2).Figure 1Identification of Zebrafish lincRNA GenesShow full caption(A) Positions of H3K4me3 peaks from 24-hpf embryos with respect to annotations of known protein-coding genes and genes of small ncRNAs (<200 nt) annotated in Ensembl or RefSeq.(B) Positions of poly(A) sites with respect to annotated protein-coding and small ncRNA genes.(C) Pipeline for identification of lincRNAs.

See text and extended experimental procedures for description. See also Figure S1 and Table S2. Although the majority of H3K4me3 peaks and poly(A) sites could be assigned to known genes, a significant fraction occurred in regions without transcript annotation (Figures 1A and 1B). Poly(A) sites that could not be assigned to protein-coding or microRNA genes were used as seeds for identification of lincRNAs (Figure 1C), because sites identified by 3P-Seq unambiguously determine the strand of the transcript and one of its termini, which substantially constrained the subsequent search space. For each of these poly(A) sites, the closest upstream H3K4me3 peaks were identified, and putative lincRNA domains were defined as regions spanning from an H3K4me3 peak to a poly(A) site. After filtering out domains overlapping exons of protein-coding genes or small RNAs in the sense orientation, or coding exons in the antisense orientation, the remaining domains were significantly enriched for H3K36me3, indicating that they were enriched in bona fide transcriptional units (Figure S1D). Using publicly available RNA-Seq data (SRA accession ERP000016) and cDNAs and ESTs deposited in GenBank, transcript models of long RNA molecules were generated, which were then extensively filtered to exclude those with predicted coding potential or insufficient transcription from the predicted strand. This procedure yielded 567 lincRNA gene annotations giving rise to 691 isoforms (Table S2). Of those, 27 genes (4.8%) were contained within introns of protein-coding genes (14 in the sense and 13 the antisense orientation). Hand curation of a subset of the 567 genes confirmed the specificity of our pipeline, uncovering only a few false-positives resulting from either gaps in the genome assembly or short unannotated coding regions (Table S2). As in mammals (Guttman et al., 2009Guttman M. Amit I. Garber M. French C. Lin M.F. Feldser D. Huarte M. Zuk O. Carey B.W.

USA. 2009; 106: 11667-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar), lincRNA genes were assigned provisional names based on the closest annotated protein-coding gene (Table S2), except for cases in which vertebrate synteny that involved another nearby gene suggested a more suitable name (e.g., linc-plcb2). For comparison to the zebrafish lincRNAs, we filtered human and mouse lincRNA annotations to remove those overlapping protein-coding genes, pseudogenes or small ncRNA genes, such as microRNA genes (Table S3). Despite this filtering, our curated sets of mammalian lincRNA genes, numbering 2,458 in human and 3,345 in mouse, were larger than our set of zebrafish lincRNA genes, in part because our pipeline for lincRNA discovery was more stringent than those used previously (Ponjavic et al., 2007Ponjavic J.

In analyzing whole animals our analysis also might have missed many lincRNAs with very restricted expression patterns. Our set of zebrafish lincRNAs shared many characteristics with mammalian lincRNAs. Most (61.7%) were spliced. They averaged 1,951 nt spanning an average of 2.3 exons, were more A/U-rich than coding sequences and 5′UTRs, but less so than 3′UTRs, and resembled 5′UTRs in prevalence of short homopolymers (Figures S1E–S1H). lincRNAs from zebrafish, mouse and human are more likely than protein-coding genes to overlap with repetitive elements, but compared with mammalian lincRNAs, a smaller portion of zebrafish lincRNA sequence was repetitive (Figure S1I). Mammalian lincRNA genes tend to be within < 10 kb of protein-coding genes (Bertone et al., 2004Bertone P. Stolc V. Royce T.E. Rozowsky J.S. Urban A.E. Zhu X. Rinn J.L. Tongprasit W. Samanta M.

Lipovich L. Genome-wide computational identification and manual annotation of human long noncoding RNA genes.RNA. 2010; 16: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although zebrafish lincRNA genes also tended to reside near protein-coding genes (empirical p < 0.001 compared to random intergenic regions; Figure S1J), the distances between lincRNA genes and the closest protein-coding genes were similar to the distances between adjacent protein-coding genes (Figure S1J). The closest neighboring protein-coding gene was most likely to appear in a divergent orientation with respect to the lincRNA (Figure S1K). Mammalian lincRNAs have also been reported to be enriched near genes encoding transcription factors and genes involved in nervous system development (Mercer et al., 2008Mercer T.R. Dinger M.E.

The closest neighbors of zebrafish lincRNAs were significantly more likely to function in transcription-related processes (2.85-fold enrichment, hypergeometric test false-discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05), an enrichment that could not be explained by the larger intergenic regions flanking those genes (empirical p < 0.001). Enrichment for developmental genes was not significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing or for the sizes of the intergenic regions, with similar trends observed in mouse and human (Figure S1L). We selected a subset of lincRNAs with relatively high expression or conservation and determined their spatial-temporal expression by in situ hybridization at two developmental stages in zebrafish embryos (Table S4). Most tested lincRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner (Figure 2A and Figure S2), predominantly in different parts of the central nervous system, although some were expressed in nonneural tissues and cell types, such as the pronephros (linc-cldn7a) and notochord (linc-trpc7). Although our pipeline was expected to miss lincRNAs expressed in very few cells (because their ChIP-Seq signal from entire embryos might not have exceeded background), it did identify many lincRNAs with tissue-specific expression, suggesting diverse and specific roles for these noncoding RNAs.Figure S2Whole-Mount In Situ Hybridizations Using Sense Probes for Selected lincRNAs, Related to Figure 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used RNA-Seq data from ten developmental stages and tissues (SRA study ERP000016) to characterize lincRNA expression across zebrafish development.

The capture and utilization of light is an exquisitely evolved process. The single-component microbial opsins, although more limited than multicomponent cascades in processing, display unparalleled compactness and speed. Recent advances in understanding microbial opsins have been driven by molecular engineering for optogenetics and by comparative genomics. Here we provide a Primer on these light-activated ion channels and pumps, describe a group of opsins bridging prior categories, and explore the convergence of molecular engineering and genomic discovery for the utilization and understanding of these remarkable molecular machines. Diverse and elegant mechanisms have evolved to enable organisms to harvest light for a variety of survival functions, including energy generation and the identification of suitable environments. A major class of light-sensitive protein consists of 7-transmembrane (TM) rhodopsins that can be found across all kingdoms of life and serve a diverse range of functions (Figure 1). Many prokaryotes employ these proteins to control proton gradients and to maintain membrane potential and ionic homeostasis, and many motile microorganisms have evolved opsin-based photoreceptors to modulate flagellar beating or flagellar motor rotation and thereby direct phototaxis toward environments with optimal light intensities for photosynthesis. Owing to their structural simplicity (both light-sensing and effector domains are encoded within a single gene) and fast kinetics, microbial opsins can be treated as precise and modular photosensitization components for introduction into non-light-sensitive cells to enable rapid optical control of specific cellular processes. In recent years, the development of cellular perturbation tools based on these and other light-sensitive proteins has resulted in a technology called optogenetics (Deisseroth, 2011Deisseroth K. Optogenetics.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, Deisseroth et al., 2006Deisseroth K. Feng G. Majewska A.K. Miesenböck G. Ting A. Schnitzer M.J. Next-generation optical technologies for illuminating genetically targeted brain circuits.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10380-10386Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), which refers to the integration of genetic and optical control to achieve gain or loss of function of precisely defined events within specified cells of living tissue. Details of practical application for neuroscience have been recently summarized elsewhere (Yizhar et al., 2011aYizhar O. Fenno L.E. Davidson T.J. Mogri M. Deisseroth K. Optogenetics in neural systems.Neuron. 2011; 71: 9-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2010Zhang F. Gradinaru V. Adamantidis A.R. Durand R.

Protoc. 2010; 5: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The experimental potential of optogenetics has triggered a surge of genome prospecting and molecular engineering to expand the repertoire of tools and generate new classes of functionality, all of which have catalyzed further mechanistic studies of microbial proteins such as channelrhodopsins (ChRs). Here we provide a Primer on the structural and functional diversity of the microbial opsins, introduce an array of new sequences that inform mechanistic understanding of function, and explore resulting inferences into the principles of operation of this widespread and remarkably evolved class of proteins. Each opsin protein requires the incorporation of retinal, a vitamin A-related organic photon-absorbing cofactor, to enable light sensitivity; this opsin-retinal complex is referred to as rhodopsin. The retinal molecule is covalently fixed in the binding pocket within the 7-TM helices and forms a protonated retinal Schiff base (RSBH+; Figure 2A ) with a conserved lysine residue located on TM helix seven (TM7). The ionic environment of the RSBH+, heavily influenced by the residues lining the binding pocket, dictates the spectral characteristics of each individual protein; upon absorption of a photon, the retinal chromophore isomerizes and triggers a series of structural changes leading to ion transport, channel opening, or interaction with signaling transducer proteins (discussed below). Opsin genes are divided into two distinct superfamilies: microbial opsins (type I) and animal opsins (type II) (Spudich et al., 2000Spudich J.L. Yang C.S. Jung K.H. Spudich E.N. Retinylidene proteins: structures and functions from archaea to humans.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Although both opsin families encode 7-TM structures (Luecke et al., 1999Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.T. Cartailler J.P. Lanyi J.K. Structure of bacteriorhodopsin at 1.55 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar, Palczewski et al., 2000Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin: A G protein-coupled receptor.Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar), sequence homology between the two families is practically nonexistent; homology within families, however, is high (25%–80% sequence similarity; Man et al., 2003Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. Diversification and spectral tuning in marine proteorhodopsins.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Type I opsin genes are found in prokaryotes, algae, and fungi and control diverse functions including phototaxis, energy storage, development, and retinal biosynthesis (Spudich, 2006Spudich J.L. The multitalented microbial sensory rhodopsins.Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 480-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Type I opsins utilize the all-trans isomer of retinal, which isomerizes to the 13-cis configuration upon photon absorption (Figure 2A, top). The activated retinal molecule in type I rhodopsins remains associated with its opsin protein partner and thermally reverts to the all-trans state while maintaining a covalent bond to its protein partner (Haupts et al., 1997Haupts U. Tittor J. Bamberg E. Oesterhelt D. General concept for ion translocation by halobacterial retinal proteins: the isomerization/switch/transfer (IST) model.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This reversible reaction occurs rapidly and is critical for allowing microbial rhodopsins to modulate neuronal activity at high frequencies when used as optogenetic tools (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S. Zhang F. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Deisseroth K. Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity.Nat.

Kakuda M. Araki R. Yawo H. Kinetic evaluation of photosensitivity in genetically engineered neurons expressing green algae light-gated channels.Neurosci. Res. 2006; 54: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); fortuitously, mammalian brains, and indeed the vertebrate tissues thus far examined, contain sufficient levels of retinal so that additional retinal does not need to be supplemented to achieve optical control (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang F. Wang L.P. Boyden E.S. Deisseroth K. Channelrhodopsin-2 and optical control of excitable cells.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In contrast, type II opsin genes are present only in higher eukaryotes and are mainly responsible for vision (Sakmar, 2002Sakmar T.P. Structure of rhodopsin and the superfamily of seven-helical receptors: the same and not the same.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A small fraction of type II opsins also play roles in circadian rhythm and pigment regulation (Sakmar, 2002Sakmar T.P. Structure of rhodopsin and the superfamily of seven-helical receptors: the same and not the same.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Shichida and Yamashita, 2003Shichida Y. Yamashita T. Diversity of visual pigments from the viewpoint of G protein activation—comparison with other G protein-coupled receptors.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2003; 2: 1237-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Type II opsins primarily function as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and appear to all use the 11-cis isomer of retinal (or derivatives) for photon absorption (Figure 2A, bottom). Upon illumination, 11-cis retinal isomerizes into the all-trans configuration and initiates protein-protein interactions (not ion flux) that trigger the visual phototransduction second messenger cascade. Unlike the situation in type I rhodopsins, here the retinal dissociates from its opsin partner after isomerization into the all-trans configuration, and a new 11-cis retinal must be recruited. Due to these chromophore turnover reactions and the requirement for interaction with downstream biochemical signal transduction partners, type II opsins effect cellular changes with slower kinetics compared to type I opsins. The power of using microbial opsins to modulate neuronal electrical activity has also stimulated strong interest in using light to control biochemical events in cells. Although not the focus here, it is worth noting that structure-function work in type II vertebrate opsins from many laboratories (such as Kim et al., 2005Kim J.M. Hwa J. Garriga P. Reeves P.J. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana H.G. Light-driven activation of beta 2-adrenergic receptor signaling by a chimeric rhodopsin containing the beta 2-adrenergic receptor cytoplasmic loops.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2284-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) inspired the design of synthetic opsins for controlling specific biochemical events in freely moving mammals. By replacing the intracellular loops of bovine rhodopsin with the intracellular loops from GPCRs, an expanding family of synthetic rhodopsins called optoXRs has enabled optical control of Gs, Gq, or Gi signaling in neuronal settings (Airan et al., 2009Airan R.D. Thompson K.R. Fenno L.E. Bernstein H. Deisseroth K. Temporally precise in vivo control of intracellular signalling.Nature. 2009; 458: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, Oh et al., 2010Oh E. Maejima T. Liu C. Deneris E. Herlitze S. Substitution of 5-HT1A receptor signaling by a light-activated G protein-coupled receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30825-30836Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that several groups have expanded control of intracellular signaling by engineering non-opsin-based light-regulated proteins to modulate general second messengers such as cAMP and cGMP (Schröder-Lang et al., 2007Schröder-Lang S. Schwärzel M. Seifert R. Strünker T. Kateriya S. Looser J. Watanabe M. Kaupp U.B. Hegemann P. Nagel G. Fast manipulation of cellular cAMP level by light in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For example, the photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) can be so employed and use the ubiquitous FAD as a cofactor for photoactivation, although early efforts using PACs from Euglena gracilis were hampered by a combination of high levels of basal activity in the dark, poor protein solubility, and large (∼3 kbp) transgene size (Schröder-Lang et al., 2007Schröder-Lang S. Schwärzel M. Seifert R. Strünker T. Kateriya S. Looser J. Watanabe M. Kaupp U.B. Hegemann P. Nagel G. Fast manipulation of cellular cAMP level by light in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). More recently, a smaller PAC derivative with lower dark activity from the soil bacterium Beggiatoa has been shown in neurons and Drosophila to alter membrane currents and influence behavior (Stierl et al., 2011Stierl M. Stumpf P. Udwari D. Gueta R. Hagedorn R. Losi A. Gärtner W. Petereit L. Efetova M. Schwarzel M. et al.Light modulation of cellular cAMP by a small bacterial photoactivated adenylyl cyclase, bPAC, of the soil bacterium Beggiatoa.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Yet the microbial opsins remain remarkable for both (1) unitary encoding of light sensation and final effector capability by a single compact gene and (2) virtually zero dark activity, along with millisecond-scale response to well-tolerated wavelengths and intensities of light. These core properties have provided a foundation for, and motivated, further investigation and engineering. Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) was first described as a single-component TM protein capable of translocating protons from the intracellular to the extracellular space (Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius, 1971Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Rhodopsin-like protein from the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium.Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). Haloarchaea express BR at high levels under low-oxygen conditions to maintain a proton gradient across the cellular membrane to drive ATP synthesis and maintain cellular energetics in the absence of respiration (Michel and Oesterhelt, 1976Michel H. Oesterhelt D. Light-induced changes of the pH gradient and the membrane potential in H. halobium.FEBS Lett. 1976; 65: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Racker and Stoeckenius, 1974Racker E. Stoeckenius W. Reconstitution of purple membrane vesicles catalyzing light-driven proton uptake and adenosine triphosphate formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 662-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the proton translocation process, BR undergoes a cascade of photointermediate states, and each state can be identified by a distinct spectral signature (Lanyi, 2004Lanyi J.K. Bacteriorhodopsin.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 665-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Photon absorption by BR first initiates the isomerization of the bound retinal from the all-trans to the 13-cis configuration (Figures 2A and 2B), thereby triggering a series of proton-transfer reactions that constitute the proton translocation mechanism (Figure 2C). This proton transport process, like chloride transport in halorhodopsins, is elegantly evolved to be (necessarily) spatially discontinuous to prevent passive back-diffusion of the ion down the gradient. Internal proton translocation begins when retinal isomerization triggers a conformational change in the protein and shifts the dipole of the RSBH+. This dipole shift raises the pKa of the RSB, thereby resulting in the release of the proton to its nearby acceptor D85 (Figure 2D), and proton movement triggers additional changes in the protein. In the BR pump, the proton is released to the extracellular milieu via a proton release site defined by two surface glutamates. The RSB then indirectly absorbs a second proton from the cytoplasm, such that the photocycle can repeat with absorption of another photon. In sensory rhodopsins (SRs) the internal proton transfer and subsequent structural changes trigger conformational changes in the transducer molecule (Htr) interacting with the rhodopsin. Certain aspects of the internal proton translocation process are conserved across many type I opsins; for example, locations of the carboxylate Schiff base proton acceptor and donor on the third TM helix are conserved across type I proton pumps. BR-type proton-pumping opsins have been found across other kingdoms of life; for example, proteorhodopsins (PRs) have been found in marine proteobacteria with photocycles similar to that of BR (Váró et al., 2003Váró G. Brown L.S. Lakatos M. Lanyi J.K. Characterization of the photochemical reaction cycle of proteorhodopsin.Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1202-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because marine PRs share a high degree of sequence similarity across species and have action spectra that are tuned according to the ocean depth and latitude of their origin, several groups have explored genomic approaches to understand opsin spectral tuning (Man et al., 2003Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. Diversification and spectral tuning in marine proteorhodopsins.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Interestingly, absorption variance between blue and green wavelengths can depend on a single amino acid residue (Béjà et al., 2001Béjà O. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Leclerc M. DeLong E.F. Proteorhodopsin phototrophy in the ocean.Nature. 2001; 411: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, Man et al., 2003Man D. Wang W. Sabehi G. Aravind L. Post A.F. Massana R. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Béjà O. Diversification and spectral tuning in marine proteorhodopsins.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), but attempts to transfer mutations conferring spectral tuning from PR to other microbial opsins have met with limited success (Yoshitsugu et al., 2009Yoshitsugu M. Yamada J. Kandori H. Color-changing mutation in the E-F loop of proteorhodopsin.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4324-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More extensive high-resolution crystal structures and molecular dynamics/molecular modeling of PRs, fungal opsins, and BRs may provide an opportunity to deepen understanding and extend functionality. A BR-type proton pump called Archaerhodopsin-3 (initially identified by Ihara et al., 1999Ihara K. Umemura T. Katagiri I. Kitajima-Ihara T. Sugiyama Y. Kimura Y. Mukohata Y. Evolution of the archaeal rhodopsins: evolution rate changes by gene duplication and functional differentiation.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) has been shown to allow detection of voltage transients in neurons through generation of a voltage-dependent optical signal (Kralj et al., 2011Kralj J.M. Douglass A.D. Hochbaum D.R. Maclaurin D. Cohen A.E. Optical recording of action potentials in mammalian neurons using a microbial rhodopsin.Nat. Methods. 2011; (Published online November 27, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar); although it remains to be seen whether this functionality will be of utility in vivo, this class of experiment represents a potentially interesting value for the microbial opsins in neuroscience. The same protein (Archaerhodopsin-3) is also capable of generating hyperpolarizing currents that can be used to inhibit neural activity (Chow et al., 2010Chow B.Y. Han X. Dobry A.S. Qian X. Chuong A.S. Li M. Henninger M.A. Belfort G.M. Lin Y. Monahan P.E. Boyden E.S. High-performance genetically targetable optical neural silencing by light-driven proton pumps.Nature. 2010; 463: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), as with other BR-type proton pumps (and indeed BR itself, optimized for mammalian expression; Gradinaru et al., 2010Gradinaru V. Zhang F. Ramakrishnan C. Mattis J. Prakash R. Diester I. Goshen I. Thompson K.R. Deisseroth K. Molecular and cellular approaches for diversifying and extending optogenetics.Cell. 2010; 141: 154-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar); however, the efflux of protons elicited by all of these proton pumps under typical steady-illumination experimental conditions will result in decreased extracellular pH. A distinct class of outward current-generating archaeal opsins known as halorhodopsins (HRs) (Matsuno-Yagi and Mukohata, 1977Matsuno-Yagi A. Mukohata Y. Two possible roles of bacteriorhodopsin; a comparative study of strains of Halobacterium halobium differing in pigmentation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) instead use chloride as the charge carrier. HRs control gradients across the cell membrane by transporting chloride ions from the extracellular medium into the cell (Bamberg et al., 1984Bamberg E. Hegemann P. Oesterhelt D. Reconstitution of halorhodopsin in black lipid membranes.Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1984; 164: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar, Schobert and Lanyi, 1982Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven chloride pump.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10306-10313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary photocycle, although qualitatively similar to that of BR, does not show RSBH+ deprotonation (Essen, 2002Essen L.O. Halorhodopsin: light-driven ion pumping made simple?.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Oesterhelt et al., 1985Oesterhelt D. Hegemann P. Tittor J. The photocycle of the chloride pump halorhodopsin. II: Quantum yields and a kinetic model.EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2351-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) due to a single amino acid substitution of the Asp acceptor with Thr. Therefore after the light-induced retinal isomerization and RSBH+ dipole switch, the proton cannot be released due to the absence of an appropriate acceptor. Instead, a Cl− ion already present in the HR protein is transported from the external side of the RSBH+ chromophore to the internal side (Figure 2D) and is subsequently released into the intracellular space (Kolbe et al., 2000Kolbe M. Besir H. Essen L.O. Oesterhelt D. Structure of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin at 1.8 A resolution.Science. 2000; 288: 1390-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). An experimental screen (Zhang et al., 2007bZhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K.

Blue halorhodopsin from Natronobacterium pharaonis: wavelength regulation by anions.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was capable of blocking animal (C. elegans) behavior by hyperpolarizing neurons with electrogenic inward Cl− currents. Pump desensitization is modest, allowing stable, step-like currents over many tens of minutes in response to steady yellow light, but due to the stoichiometry of only one transported ion per photocycle (true for all light-driven pumps), robust expression and fast photocycles are required. Increased heterologous membrane expression can be achieved with addition of trafficking signals from mammalian membrane proteins (Gradinaru et al., 2008Gradinaru V. Thompson K.R. Deisseroth K. eNpHR: a Natronomonas halorhodopsin enhanced for optogenetic applications.Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and ultimately this version allowed the first optogenetic inhibition of behavior in mammals (Witten et al., 2010Witten I.B.

Moreover, by significantly increasing the number of HR molecules on the neuronal membrane, NpHR (in this case, eNpHR3.0)-expressing neurons can even be inhibited by 680 nm far-red light, which is far from the action spectrum peak (Gradinaru et al., 2010Gradinaru V.

Here, we examine the roles of several chromatin regulators whose loss affects the pluripotent state of ES cells. We find that Mbd3 and Brg1 antagonistically regulate a common set of genes by regulating promoter nucleosome occupancy. Furthermore, both Mbd3 and Brg1 play key roles in the biology of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC): Mbd3 colocalizes with Tet1 and 5hmC in vivo, Mbd3 knockdown preferentially affects expression of 5hmC-marked genes, Mbd3 localization is Tet1-dependent, and Mbd3 preferentially binds to 5hmC relative to 5-methylcytosine in vitro. Finally, both Mbd3 and Brg1 are themselves required for normal levels of 5hmC in vivo. Together, our results identify an effector for 5hmC, and reveal that control of gene expression by antagonistic chromatin regulators is a surprisingly common regulatory strategy in ES cells."

The mechanistic details vary, but the salient point is that allostery involves cooperative interactions between a subset of spatially distributed amino acids. One approach for understanding the structural basis of functional properties like allostery is the analysis of amino acid coevolution using methods such as statistical coupling analysis (SCA) (Halabi et al., 2009Halabi N. Rivoire O. Leibler S. Ranganathan R. Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure.Cell. 2009; 138: 774-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999Lockless S.W.

Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The basic premise of SCA is that functionally relevant coupling between amino acids should, regardless of underlying mechanism, drive coevolution of those residues. In principle the global pattern of coupling between amino acids can be estimated from multiple sequence alignments that represent the long-term evolutionary record of a protein family. This approach reveals two general findings about proteins. First, the majority of amino acids in proteins evolve nearly independently, implying weak or idiosyncratic physical coupling to other residues. This result is nontrivial; many of these weak interactions constitute direct contacts in the tertiary structure, suggesting extensive decoupling even within local environments. Second, a small fraction of amino acids (typically 10%–30%) show strong mutual coevolution and comprise spatially distributed but structurally contiguous subnetworks within the tertiary structure. These coevolving networks are termed “sectors,” and experiments in several protein families confirm that sectors are associated with conserved functional properties, including signal transmission, allosteric regulation, and catalysis (Ferguson et al., 2007Ferguson A.D. Amezcua C.A. Halabi N.M. Chelliah Y. Rosen M.K. Ranganathan R. Deisenhofer J. Signal transduction pathway of TonB-dependent transporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In addition for a small protein interaction module, computational design of synthetic proteins based on the pattern of evolutionary couplings between amino acids was shown sufficient to recapitulate the structure and function of their natural counterparts (Russ et al., 2005Russ W.P. Lowery D.M. Mishra P. Yaffe M.B. Ranganathan R. Natural-like function in artificial WW domains.Nature. 2005; 437: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Socolich et al., 2005Socolich M. Lockless S.W. Russ W.P. Lee H. Gardner K.H. Ranganathan R. Evolutionary information for specifying a protein fold.Nature. 2005; 437: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Multiple sectors are possible in a single protein (Halabi et al., 2009Halabi N. Rivoire O. Leibler S. Ranganathan R. Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure.Cell. 2009; 138: 774-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), arguing that this architecture permits the independent variation of different phenotypes that comprise overall fitness. Thus, sectors are proposed to represent the fundamental structural units that underlie the conserved structure and functions of natural proteins. In addition to folding and function, natural proteins display the capacity for evolving novel allosteric regulation and communication (Kuriyan and Eisenberg, 2007Kuriyan J. Eisenberg D. The origin of protein interactions and allostery in colocalization.Nature. 2007; 450: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The origin of such regulatory mechanisms is not obvious given the complexity of building cooperative interactions between amino acids that can functionally couple distant sites. Interestingly, the sector architecture suggests a simple potential solution. Sectors have a distributed spatial organization that “wires” the active site to multiple distant surface positions. This architecture provides constraints for structure and function (Russ et al., 2005Russ W.P. Lowery D.M. Mishra P. Yaffe M.B. Ranganathan R. Natural-like function in artificial WW domains.Nature. 2005; 437: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Socolich et al., 2005Socolich M. Lockless S.W. Russ W.P. Lee H. Gardner K.H. Ranganathan R. Evolutionary information for specifying a protein fold.Nature. 2005; 437: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) but, as a consequence, might also provide a structural basis for the gain of novel allosteric regulation through initiation of molecular interactions at sector-connected surface sites. In other words, sector-connected surface sites might represent “hot spots” for the emergence of allosteric control in proteins. Here, we experimentally test this hypothesis using the metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and a protein interaction module (the PDZ domain) as model systems. We show that DHFR contains a sparse, distributed, and physically contiguous protein sector that is strongly correlated to the dynamic motions associated with catalysis. By carrying out a comprehensive domain insertion scan in E. coli DHFR and applying a new assay system, we show that sector-connected surface sites are indeed hot spots for the emergence of allosteric control. We recapitulate this finding in a second experimental system, the PDZ domain. Interestingly, initiation of molecular interactions at these sector-connected sites can produce allosteric regulation in a single step that is detectable in vivo, without directed optimization or design. These results show that sectors can provide a statistically preferable route for the initiation of allosteric control and suggest that they can enable the evolution of allosteric communication between proteins. DHFR is an essential enzyme in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that is necessary for the biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids. The enzyme catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor and has served as an excellent system for understanding catalysis and the relationship between conformational dynamics and enzyme activity (Schnell et al., 2004Schnell J.R.

Specifically, the E. coli DHFR reaction cycle involves five biochemically characterized catalytic intermediates that comprise two major conformational states, termed closed and occluded (Figure 1A ) (Fierke et al., 1987Fierke C.A.

NMR-based relaxation dispersion experiments show that a distributed pattern of motion on a millisecond timescale plays a crucial role in mediating the conformational transitions between the various states that mediate substrate and cofactor binding/release and the chemical step in catalysis (Bhabha et al., 2011Bhabha G.

Defining the role of active-site loop fluctuations in dihydrofolate reductase catalysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5032-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Considered collectively, the set of DHFR residues engaged in millisecond scale dynamics encompasses the active site, substrate and cofactor binding sites, and some distant regions (Figure 1B). Thus, the catalytic mechanism in DHFR involves millisecond dynamics within a distributed network of amino acid residues. SCA for an alignment of 418 phylogenetically diverse DHFR sequences defines a system of coevolving amino acid positions (a sector) that depending on statistical cutoffs, comprises between 14% and 31% of the protein (see Table S1 available online and Experimental Procedures). Consistent with prior descriptions, the sector forms a physically contiguous network of atoms that connects the DHFR active site with the substrate and cofactor binding pockets, and with several distantly positioned surface regions (Figures 1C and 2) (Chen et al., 2007Chen J. Dima R.I. Thirumalai D. Allosteric communication in dihydrofolate reductase: signaling network and pathways for closed to occluded transition and back.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 250-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2008Lee J. Natarajan M. Nashine V.C. Socolich M. Vo T. Russ W.P. Benkovic S.J. Ranganathan R. Surface sites for engineering allosteric control in proteins.Science. 2008; 322: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, despite no known allosteric function, DHFR contains the same sparse and distributed sector architecture as other proteins. Comparison of the SCA sector with those residues undergoing millisecond timescale dynamics in DHFR shows a strong coincidence of the two; nearly 75% of sector positions overlap with those showing motions related to the catalytic cycle (Figure 1C; and for a full list of sector positions, see Table S1). This corresponds to a strong statistical correlation between sector positions and those residues involved in millisecond dynamics (p < 0.006 by Fisher's exact test), a result that is robust to perturbations in the cutoffs used for sector identification (Table S2). These data suggest that (1) the sector in DHFR represents an evolutionary-conserved distributed architecture involved in the catalytic reaction cycle; and (2) the sector mechanistically operates through dynamic fluctuations that connect the active site with several distant surface sites. What does the sector architecture in DHFR mean for the capacity of surface positions to initiate functional control over catalytic function? The finding that the sector connects the active site to a number of surface positions suggests the idea that by virtue of distributed constraints on catalysis, the sector provides a preorganized path for coupling between these distantly positioned sites (Figure 2). If true, initiation of new molecular interactions at sector-connected surface sites should preferentially trigger the emergence of allosteric regulation. The initial magnitude of regulation might be weak given no optimization or intelligent engineering, but to be evolutionarily significant, need only be sufficient to provide a basis for selection in vivo. To examine this, we carried out a test for the emergence of allosteric control at all surface-exposed sites in E. coli DHFR (Figure 3A ) using a technique we term “domain insertion scanning.” The strategy is to create a library of chimeric DHFRs in which an unrelated allosteric signaling module (a light-sensitive PAS domain [LOV2] from A. sativa; Salomon et al., 2001Salomon M. Eisenreich W. Dürr H. Schleicher E. Knieb E. Massey V. Rüdiger W. Müller F. Bacher A. Richter G. An optomechanical transducer in the blue light receptor phototropin from Avena sativa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) is inserted into the peptide bond preceding every solvent-exposed residue in DHFR (70 total, Figure 3A; see Experimental Procedures). The N- and C-terminal regions of the LOV2 domain are known to receive an allosteric conformational change upon photon absorption by the bound flavin mononucleotide chromophore (Halavaty and Moffat, 2007Halavaty A.S. Moffat K. N- and C-terminal flanking regions modulate light-induced signal transduction in the LOV2 domain of the blue light sensor phototropin 1 from Avena sativa.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 14001-14009Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Harper et al., 2003Harper S.M. Neil L.C. Gardner K.H. Structural basis of a phototropin light switch.Science. 2003; 301: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). More specifically, a C-terminal helix (referred to as the Jα helix) detaches from the core of the LOV2 domain in response to light. Thus, inserting the LOV2 domain at each DHFR surface site and assaying for the emergence of light-dependent DHFR activity represent a test for the initiation of allosteric regulation. A previous proof-of-principle experiment establishes this experimental approach; insertion of LOV2 at one sector-connected surface site (120–121, here called DL121) results in weakly light-dependent DHFR activity in vitro (Lee et al., 2008Lee J. Natarajan M. Nashine V.C. Socolich M. Vo T. Russ W.P. Benkovic S.J. Ranganathan R. Surface sites for engineering allosteric control in proteins.Science. 2008; 322: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To assay light-dependent DHFR activity of all 70 DHFR-LOV2 chimeras in vivo and in parallel, we developed a folate auxotroph rescue assay coupled with measurement of growth rates by Solexa-based high-throughput sequencing. THF, the product of DHFR catalysis, is needed for a number of critical metabolic processes, including the synthesis of thymidine and amino acids. As a result, DHFR catalysis is necessary for growth of E. coli (Rajagopalan and Benkovic, 2002Rajagopalan P.T. Benkovic S.J. Preorganization and protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis.Chem. Rec. 2002; 2: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For example the E. coli folate auxotroph (ER2566 ΔfolA ΔthyA, which contains deletions of both DHFR [folA] and thymidylate synthetase [thyA]) fails to grow in minimal media conditions but can be rescued with basal expression of both the folA and thyA genes from a plasmid. To test if the insertion of LOV2 abrogated DHFR catalytic activity for any of the fusions, we screened the library of DHFR-LOV2 chimeras for those that provide measurable rescue of auxotroph growth. We find that 67 of the 70 chimeric fusions can complement, indicating the presence of a functional DHFR (Figure S1). The three insertions lacking DHFR activity (DL17, DL23, and DL108) were omitted from further analysis. A study of a few known mutants of DHFR shows that the growth rate is a monotonic function of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) in the conditions of our experiment (Figure S2). How can we make accurate and systematically controlled measurements of light-dependent growth rate for all chimeras with reasonable experimental speed? Previous work has demonstrated that even small differences in growth rates of two variants can be measured through pairwise competition of fluorescently labeled strains (Breslow et al., 2008Breslow D.K.

Here, we introduce a new method for monitoring relative fitness by measuring individual variant frequencies over time in a mixed population of growing cells using the technology of massively parallel sequencing (Metzker, 2010Metzker M.L.

Briefly, ER2566 ΔfolA ΔthyA cells expressing all 70 DHFR-LOV2 chimeras, as well as the wild-type (WT) DHFR, a set of 11 DHFR mutants, and 2 additional DHFR-LOV2 control constructs (described in detail later) were mixed in equivalent ratios (84 variants total), grown in a single flask under either dark or lit conditions, and sampled at 5 time points. To identify the individual variants, we incorporated a five-nucleotide barcode at the 3′ untranslated region downstream of the folA gene (Figure 3B). In addition during sample preparation for Solexa sequencing, we added a second five-nucleotide barcode encoding the experimental condition (lit or dark, and each time point) to the 5′ end of the sequenced region by PCR (Figure 3B). Multiplexing all samples and sequencing a 36 bp fragment containing both barcodes permit reconstruction of the growth rate divergence of every variant over time with excellent counting statistics (Figure 3C). This experiment enables simultaneous growth rate determinations for a very large number of variants in a single internally controlled experiment without the need for external labeling of individual strains (Figure 3D). To establish the growth-based sequencing assay as a quantitative reporter of DHFR activity, we expressed and purified the 11 DHFR mutants to near homogeneity and measured catalytic power in vitro using standard protocols (Figure S3 and Table S3) (Rajagopalan et al., 2002Rajagopalan P.T.

Coupling interactions of distal residues enhance dihydrofolate reductase catalysis: mutational effects on hydride transfer rates.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12618-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Consistent with the conventional growth rate measurements by optical density (Figure S2), there is a monotonic and sensitive relationship between DHFR catalytic activity in vitro and growth rate of E. coli (Figure 3D). Indeed, DHFR mutants L54I and W22H differ only 2-fold in in vitro activity (as assessed by kcat/Km), but this results in an approximately 12% growth rate advantage for W22H over L54I. As previously shown, the exponential divergence of populations with differences in growth rate makes it so that even small biochemical effects in vitro can be accurately detected in vivo (Breslow et al., 2008Breslow D.K.

The measurements are also highly reproducible; over the large range of catalytic activities sampled by the ten nonlight-dependent DHFR mutants, there is negligible difference in the lit and dark growth rates measured in three independent growth/sequencing experiments. The distribution of differential growth in lit and dark conditions is centered at zero, with a small variance that we attribute to measurement noise (0.0065 ± 0.0047, mean ± SD [σ]; Figures 3D, 4C, 5A, and 5B).Figure 4Light Dependence in Growth Rate for One Chimera, DL121, Previously Shown to Display Weak Light Dependence in Catalytic Rate In VitroShow full caption(A and B) Experiments under dark and lit conditions show that DL121 displays an ∼16% increase in growth rate in response to light, whereas two DL121 variants carrying LOV2 domains defective in allosteric mechanism (121-C450S and 121-noJ) do not show light dependence (Figure S3).(C) Quantitative measurement of light dependence in growth rate in three independent growth/sequencing experiments for ten nonlight-dependent DHFR mutants spanning a broad range of catalytic power, and for DL121, 121-C450S, and 121-noJ.

The data demonstrate good reproducibility in growth rate measurements in independent experiments, and establish a statistical model for measurement noise in this assay based on the behavior of the nonlight-dependent mutants of DHFR (the dashed lines indicate 2σ from the mean).

https://openalex.org/W2095917499,"Gout is a prevalent inflammatory arthritis affecting 1-2% of adults characterized by activation of innate immune cells by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals resulting in the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Since neutrophils play a major role in gout we sought to determine whether their activation may involve the formation of proinflammatory neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in relation to autophagy and IL-1β.Synovial fluid neutrophils from six patients with gout crisis and peripheral blood neutrophils from six patients with acute gout and six control subjects were isolated. MSU crystals, as well as synovial fluid or serum obtained from patients with acute gout, were used for the treatment of control neutrophils. NET formation was assessed using immunofluorescence microscopy. MSU crystals or synovial fluid or serum from patients induced NET formation in control neutrophils. Importantly, NET production was observed in neutrophils isolated from synovial fluid or peripheral blood from patients with acute gout. NETs contained the alarmin high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) supporting their pro-inflammatory potential. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling or phagolysosomal fusion prevented NET formation, implicating autophagy in this process. NET formation was driven at least in part by IL-1β as demonstrated by experiments involving IL-1β and its inhibitor anakinra.These findings document for the first time that activation of neutrophils in gout is associated with the formation of proinflammatory NETs and links this process to both autophagy and IL-1β. Modulation of the autophagic machinery may represent an additional therapeutic study in crystalline arthritides."
https://openalex.org/W1979646592,"Specific chromatin marks keep master regulators of differentiation silent yet poised for activation by extracellular signals. We report that nodal TGF-β signals use the poised histone mark H3K9me3 to trigger differentiation of mammalian embryonic stem cells. Nodal receptors induce the formation of companion Smad4-Smad2/3 and TRIM33-Smad2/3 complexes. The PHD-Bromo cassette of TRIM33 facilitates binding of TRIM33-Smad2/3 to H3K9me3 and H3K18ac on the promoters of mesendoderm regulators Gsc and Mixl1. The crystal structure of this cassette, bound to histone H3 peptides, illustrates that PHD recognizes K9me3, and Bromo binds an adjacent K18ac. The interaction between TRIM33-Smad2/3 and H3K9me3 displaces the chromatin-compacting factor HP1γ, making nodal response elements accessible to Smad4-Smad2/3 for Pol II recruitment. In turn, Smad4 increases K18 acetylation to augment TRIM33-Smad2/3 binding. Thus, nodal effectors use the H3K9me3 mark as a platform to switch master regulators of stem cell differentiation from the poised to the active state."

However, this approach cannot reveal sufficient complexity to provide information on mechanisms that may regulate mRNA degradation, possibly on short timescales.

We found that two genes responsible for mitotic progression, SWI5 and CLB2, exhibit a mitosis-dependent mRNA stability switch. Their transcripts are stable until mitosis, when a precipitous decay eliminates the mRNA complement, preventing carryover into the next cycle. Remarkably, the specificity and timing of decay is entirely regulated by their promoter, independent of specific cis mRNA sequences.

For example, the kinetic behavior of individual RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribing a gene (reviewed in Ardehali and Lis, 2009Ardehali M.B. Lis J.T. Tracking rates of transcription and splicing in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1123-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) provides a precise quantification of the contribution of mRNA synthesis to the cellular pool of transcripts. However, to date, no such approach has been available for measuring mRNA turnover. Traditional techniques have relied on normalization of decay signal and on a large sample of cells, genetically modified or treated with inhibitors, to stop transcription and thus obtain kinetic information of a decaying mRNA species (reviewed in Passos and Parker, 2008Passos D.O. Parker R. Analysis of cytoplasmic mRNA decay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 448: 409-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the accuracy of decay measurement varies with the technique used. For example, in budding yeast, half-lives of an individual mRNA species quantified by different approaches may differ by more than 50 percent (Grigull et al., 2004Grigull J. Mnaimneh S. Pootoolal J. Robinson M.D. Hughes T.R. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA stability using transcription inhibitors and microarrays reveals posttranscriptional control of ribosome biogenesis factors.Mol. Cell.

In turn, the accuracy of the decay curve will influence how precisely it can be modeled. In this work, we use single-molecule counting with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (Zenklusen et al., 2008Zenklusen D. Larson D.R. Singer R.H. Single-RNA counting reveals alternative modes of gene expression in yeast.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) to derive an absolute measure of mRNA synthesis and decay in individual cells. This provided a highly sensitive approach for detecting changes that occur in a fraction of cells and would otherwise have been obscured. We focused on mRNA turnover because it could regulate gene expression during the cell cycle. For instance, entry into mitosis induces a rapid mRNA decay of the mitotic Clb2p cyclin that, if prevented, can cause failure of cells to finish mitosis (Cai et al., 2002Cai T. Aulds J. Gill T. Cerio M. Schmitt M.E.

Biol. 2004; 24: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Entry into G0 causes stabilization of specific G0 mRNAs (Talarek et al., 2010Talarek N. Cameroni E. Jaquenoud M. Luo X. Bontron S. Lippman S. Devgan G. Snyder M. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Initiation of the TORC1-regulated G0 program requires Igo1/2, which license specific mRNAs to evade degradation via the 5′-3′ mRNA decay pathway.Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the stability of the canonical histone mRNAs increases with the onset of S phase, and exit from S phase induces their rapid decay (Marzluff et al., 2008Marzluff W.F.

Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, together with their cyclical transcription, the destabilization of mRNAs can restrict the activity of periodically expressed genes to a particular cell-cycle phase. This modulation of stability is typically achieved through binding of decay regulators to specific sequences located in the mRNA (reviewed in Guhaniyogi and Brewer, 2001Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Regulation of mRNA stability in mammalian cells.Gene. 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). We focused on two cell cycle-regulated genes, SWI5 and CLB2, and measured changes in their mRNA turnover during the cell cycle. Swi5p is a transcription regulator of late mitosis genes, and Clb2p is a G2 phase cyclin that drives the progression of cells towards mitosis. They are coregulated through shared promoter elements (Koranda et al., 2000Koranda M. Schleiffer A. Endler L. Ammerer G.

Two yeast forkhead genes regulate the cell cycle and pseudohyphal growth.Nature. 2000; 406: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) and were measured to degrade with 8 min and 4.5 min half-lives, respectively (Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). We used morphological markers to determine timing of the cell cycle. We counted absolute numbers of cytoplasmic and nascent transcripts (Zenklusen et al., 2008Zenklusen D. Larson D.R. Singer R.H. Single-RNA counting reveals alternative modes of gene expression in yeast.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and analyzed decay rates using a mathematical model without the use of transcriptional inhibitors, genetic mutants, or the need to normalize mRNA signal. The use of a single-molecule mRNA decay measurement enabled identification of a regulatory pathway of mRNA decay that provides an additional level of cell cycle regulation. We determined that the half-life of SWI5 and CLB2 decreases more than 30-fold with the onset of prometaphase/metaphase. Furthermore, regulation of this mRNA decay is coordinated with their transcription and controlled by their promoter sequence, independent of the specific cis sequences located in the mRNA. By using morphological markers, we were able to determine that the cell cycle progression and the prometaphase/metaphase stability switch of SWI5 and CLB2 were coupled and regulated by the mitotic exit network kinases, Dbf2p and Dbf20p. Both kinases bind to SWI5 and CLB2 mRNAs, and Dbf2p is also enriched at their transcription sites. We propose a model whereby Dbf2p is first recruited by the promoter and then cotranscriptionally deposited onto the mRNA. Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA associates with Dbf20p and then waits for the appropriate cellular cues to initiate the decay process. Thus, for a subset of budding yeast mRNAs, promoter-dependent activity directly influences how and when an mRNA will be degraded in the cytoplasm. We measured SWI5 and CLB2 mRNAs decay rates in exponentially growing cells using the common approaches of qRT-PCR coupled with the transcriptional inhibitor thiolutin. A constitutively expressed ACT1 was expected to decay independently of the cell-cycle phase with a single decay rate (t1/2 of 45 min) (Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and was used as a control. Decay curves of SWI5, CLB2, and ACT1 (Figures 1A–1C ) were fitted to both an exponential decay with a single component (green line) and two components (red line) to identify which kinetic model best described their decay curves. A two-component model detected a decay-resistant SWI5 mRNA population (t1/2 > 90 min) and a rapidly decaying SWI5 mRNA population (t1/2 = 3.0 min), whereas a single component model with a t1/2 = 6.9 min showed systematic deviations from the measured data. A two-component model was not able to resolve multiple CLB2 decay populations and, similarly to ACT1 mRNA, fitted the decay data as well as a single component model. Here, CLB2 mRNA decayed with a single t1/2 = 3.7 min, whereas ACT1 mRNA decayed with a single t1/2 = 41.3 min, consistent with previously reported values (Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). To test whether SWI5 and CLB2 mRNAs decayed differently during the cell cycle, we synchronized cells in different cell-cycle phases followed by thiolutin inhibition. In S phase and at G2/M border, SWI5 and CLB2 mRNAs were stable, whereas in mitosis, they decayed rapidly with an estimated t1/2 of ∼3 min (Figures 1D–1G and Figure S1A available online). ACT1 decayed independently of the cell-cycle phase and, similarly to unsynchronized cells, turned over with a single t1/2 of ∼30 min. Kinetics of transcription inhibition by thiolutin was independent of the synchronization protocol (Figure S1B), and thus we could conclude that the stability of SWI5 and CLB2 mRNAs, but not of ACT1 mRNA, changed depending on the cell-cycle phase. Two CLB2 decay populations, however, could only be detected when physically separated in time by cell culture synchronization. Therefore, normalization of mRNA decay signal, inhibition of transcription, and use of population measurements obscured the behavior occurring in a fraction of cells, thus diminishing the sensitivity of the technique. We employed an approach that was both highly quantitative and minimally invasive to the cell's physiology. We modified a FISH-based method that enabled us to quantify mRNA decay rates in individual, minimally perturbed cells with single mRNA sensitivity without the need for transcription inhibition, cell synchronization, or normalization of mRNA signal. We counted single transcripts in the cytoplasm in individual cells using single-cell, single-molecule FISH (Zenklusen et al., 2008Zenklusen D. Larson D.R. Singer R.H. Single-RNA counting reveals alternative modes of gene expression in yeast.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A mix of fluorescently labeled probes hybridizing along an mRNA was used (Figure 2A , red probes, and Table S1), which strongly amplified the signal-to-noise ratio and detection sensitivity. Fluorescent transcripts were detected and counted using the algorithm Localize (Larson et al., 2005Larson D.R. Johnson M.C. Webb W.W. Vogt V.M.

Specific fluorescent signal was only detected in the presence of a target mRNA (Figures S2C and S2D). After cell segmentation, we obtained an absolute number of transcripts per cell, which obviated normalization of mRNA signal required for ensemble measurements and thus the uncertainty associated with them.Figure S2Counting Single mRNAs in Single Cells Using FISH, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) A mix of five, cy3.5 labeled probes was used to count single cytoplasmic CLB2 transcripts.

By fitting a three dimensional Gaussian mask over each fluorescent spot, Localize determines an integral fluorescent brightness (in A.U.) of each spot. The culled distribution of spots detected in images (black circles) was fitted to a Gaussian curve (red line) to calculate an average intensity of a single FISH labeled mRNA or single FISH probe.

An average intensity of a single cy3.5 probe hybridizing to the background was 3.2 +/- 0.05 A.U. (R2=0.99). The fluorescent intensity of a single CLB2 mRNA was five times greater than that of a single probe labeling the background, indicating, that single CLB2 mRNAs were hybridized by all five cy3.5 probes used in a mix.

Lack of SWI5 specific fluorescent signals could not be attributed to diminished ability of probe penetration into the cells because constitutively expressed ILS2 mRNA could easily be detected.

FISH probes also annealed to the nascent chains whenever a cell actively transcribed a gene. We used a single probe targeted to the 5′-most end of the transcript labeled with a spectrally distinct fluorophore (Figures 2A, green probe, and S2B) and quantified the number of these probes annealed at the site of transcription (Femino et al., 1998Femino A.M.

This approach constitutes a direct measure of transcriptional activity in the cell, and the number of nascent chains reflects both the transcript initiation rate and the dwell time of a transcript as determined by all postinitiation processes, including elongation and termination (see below). By directly measuring this transcriptional output, transcription inhibition was no longer needed, which enabled us to measure kinetics of mRNA decay in chemically unperturbed cells. To quantify changes in mRNA stability through mitotic division, we binned cells into cell-cycle phases using morphological markers as indicators of cell-cycle time (Brewer et al., 1984Brewer B.J.

Four morphological markers were used: bud size (DIC), movement of the nucleus detected by DAPI, positioning of the spindle pole body indicated by CFP-tagged Spc42p, and localization of a GFP-tagged Whi5p. Whi5p is nuclear during telophase, cytokinesis, and G1 phase of the cell cycle and is cytoplasmic in all others (Bean et al., 2006Bean J.M. Siggia E.D. Cross F.R. Coherence and timing of cell cycle start examined at single-cell resolution.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 3-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), allowing differentiation between G1 phase and early S phase cells that have not yet formed a bud. Duplication time of the yeast culture was 90 ± 8.5 minutes, and the percent of cells in each phase was directly proportional to its length in minutes. For example, 18.3% of cells were identified as late S phase cells, which converted to 16.5 min (Figure 2B). Cell binning was highly reproducible among experiments using the same strain, with a variability ≤10%. Thus, one can determine the relative time of progression through the cell cycle, allowing one to obtain dynamics of cell-cycle gene expression from a population of fixed cells. As anticipated for coregulated genes, expression of SWI5 and CLB2 was similar and followed four discernable stages (Figures 3A–3D ). The first spanned the entire S phase, when transcription was infrequent and mRNA accumulation modest. The second stage spanned G2 phase and prometaphase/metaphase, when transcription increased sharply and the bulk of mRNA synthesis occurred within 6.7 minutes. The onset of the third phase coincided with the onset of anaphase. Transcription of both genes ceased, and transcripts were degrading rapidly. In the last stage during G1 phase, the probability of expression of either of the genes fell below 5%. Because transcription became inactive during mitosis, mRNA decay rates could be determined directly from their cytoplasmic mRNA profiles (Figures 3C and 3D, blue line). During mitosis, SWI5 and CLB2 mRNAs decayed with a t1/2 of 2.1 ± 0.8 min and a t1/2 of 1.8 ± 0.5 min, respectively, based on the fit to the cellular RNA profiles. This rapid decay prevented carryover of mRNAs into the new cell cycle (demarcated with gray boxes). Decay rates previously observed for SWI5 and CLB2 (Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) were inconsistent with the data obtained by FISH; the slower decay rate would have contaminated the next cycle (Figures 3C and 3D, green line). To quantify CLB2 and SWI5 decay rates in the context of changing transcriptional activity during the cell cycle, we used mathematical modeling. The number of cytoplasmic mRNAs at any point of the cell cycle depends on the rates of their synthesis and decay. By measuring the total transcript level and the synthesis rate, we can determine the decay rate constant according to the differential equation:dNdt=mT−kN(1) where N is the number of transcripts in the cytoplasm (Figure 2A); t is time; m is the transcriptional activity of a gene measured by the number of nascent transcripts at a transcription site (Figure 2A); T is the dwell time of a nascent transcript (s); and k is the degradation rate constant (s-1) (see Experimental Procedures). The solution to this differential equation is:N(t)=mkT(1−e−kt)+N0e−kt(2) where N0 is the initial number of transcripts. The time t is determined from cell-cycle markers as described above (Figure 2B). The measured values are m and N determined as a function of t, and the fit parameters are k and T. For each gene, a global nonlinear least-square fit to the expression profile was determined. This model describes RNA levels as a balance of zero-order RNA synthesis and first-order decay. We assume first-order mRNA decay because it is the simplest model that describes our data and allows us to compare to bulk biochemical measurements of mRNA stability. In the simplest form, with a dwell time and an mRNA half-life that are invariant over the cell cycle, both fit values are < 35 s, resulting in RNA polymerase velocities and RNA lifetimes that are unphysical (Figures S3A–S3G ). However, if we include the possibility of bimodal decay, as experimentally observed in Figure 1, the model captures the essential features of SWI5 and CLB2 regulation over the cell cycle. We kept the mitotic t1/2 fixed at 2.1 min for SWI5 and t1/2 at 1.8 min for CLB2, as determined by the FISH measurements (Figures 3C and 3D and S3C–S3G), and allowed the nascent transcript dwell time and the premitotic decay to float. This fitting regime reached a global minimum with the following parameter values: for SWI5 mRNA, a dwell time of 66 ± 7.0 s and a premitotic t1/2 > 90 min (Figure 3E, solid lines) and for CLB2 mRNA a dwell time of 63 ± 5.5 s and a premitotic t1/2 of 66 min (Figure 3F, solid lines). The dwell times consist of elongation and postelongation processes, and if the termination time is estimated as 30 s (Zenklusen et al., 2008Zenklusen D. Larson D.R. Singer R.H. Single-RNA counting reveals alternative modes of gene expression in yeast.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), the resulting polymerase velocity is ∼50 bp/s, consistent with the polymerase velocity of 46 ± 6.2 bp/s during S/G2/M (Larson et al., 2011Larson D.R. Zenklusen D. Wu B. Chao J.A. Singer R.H. Real-time observation of transcription initiation and elongation on an endogenous yeast gene.Science. 2011; 332: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Additionally, the bimodal decay kinetics is invariant of nascent chain dwell times as long as these remain within the physiological boundaries of T > 18 seconds (Figures S3C–S3G). Lastly, based on the best fit of our model, we determined that the switch in mRNA stability occurred during prometaphase/metaphase, when transcription for both genes was at its peak, even though the rapid decay became apparent only with the onset of anaphase, when transcription was shutting down (Figures 3A–3F). To further address the timing of destabilization, we modeled the data assuming that the switch in mRNA stability occurred with the onset of anaphase. This fitting regime also resulted in bimodal decay kinetics similar to the one described above but with the higher divergence of the mathematical fit from the FISH data (data not shown). Based on the best fit criterion, this anaphase-specific model was thus not considered in the analysis of SWI5 and CLB2 decay kinetics. Several important conclusions are evident: (1) prior to mitosis, SWI5 and CLB2 transcripts were stable, allowing the cell to increase mRNA levels during active transcription; (2) during mitosis, when SWI5 and CLB2 transcription were shutting down, their tra"

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence these genome pathogens, but it is unclear how the piRNA pathway adapts to invasion of new transposons. In Drosophila, piRNAs are encoded by heterochromatic clusters and maternally deposited in the embryo. Paternally inherited P element transposons thus escape silencing and trigger a hybrid sterility syndrome termed P-M hybrid dysgenesis. We show that P-M hybrid dysgenesis activates both P elements and resident transposons and disrupts the piRNA biogenesis machinery. As dysgenic hybrids age, however, fertility is restored, P elements are silenced, and P element piRNAs are produced de novo. In addition, the piRNA biogenesis machinery assembles, and resident elements are silenced. Significantly, resident transposons insert into piRNA clusters, and these new insertions are transmitted to progeny, produce novel piRNAs, and are associated with reduced transposition. P element invasion thus triggers heritable changes in genome structure that appear to enhance transposon silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2007145040,"The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is important for tumor initiation and progression. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is an essential Wnt co-receptor for Wnt/β-catenin signaling and represents a promising anticancer target. Recently, the antihelminthic drug, niclosamide was found to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although the mechanism was not well defined. We found that niclosamide was able to suppress LRP6 expression and phosphorylation, block Wnt3A-induced β-catenin accumulation, and inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on LRP6 expression/phosphorylation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling were conformed in human prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells. Moreover, we showed that the mechanism by which niclosamide suppressed LRP6 resulted from increased degradation as evident by a shorter half-life. Finally, we demonstrated that niclosamide was able to induce cancer cell apoptosis, and displayed excellent anticancer activity with IC50 values less than 1 µM for prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells. The IC50 values are comparable to those shown to suppress the activities of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells. Our data indicate that niclosamide is a unique small molecule Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor targeting the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 on the cell surface, and that niclosamide has a potential to be developed a novel chemopreventive or therapeutic agent for human prostate and breast cancer."

The collective efforts of numerous scientists have revealed that one key function of these elements is to promote the assembly of RNA polymerases in the correct location of the transcription units, at the right time, in a manner compatible with productive transcription (Kornberg, 2007Kornberg R.D. The molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12955-12961Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). More recent work has demonstrated that promoters can affect the entire process of transcription, including capping, splicing, and polyadenylation (see, for example, Komili and Silver, 2008Komili S. Silver P.A. Coupling and coordination in gene expression processes: a systems biology view.Nat. Rev.

A unified theory of gene expression.Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, promoters that drive RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription are highly complex. The yeast promoters are less complex and can be divided into two basic elements: the core promoter and the “upstream activating sequence” (UAS) (Guarente, 1988Guarente L. UASs and enhancers: common mechanism of transcriptional activation in yeast and mammals.Cell. 1988; 52: 303-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The core promoter encompasses the transcription start site and recruits Pol II and the basal transcription apparatus. UASs are analogous to enhancers in higher eukaryotes and basically enhance or repress assembly of competent basal transcription apparatus, thereby regulating transcription (Harbison et al., 2004Harbison C.T. Gordon D.B. Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Macisaac K.D. Danford T.W. Hannett N.M. Tagne J.B. Reynolds D.B. Yoo J. et al.Transcriptional regulatory code of a eukaryotic genome.Nature. 2004; 431: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar and references therein). Usually, UASs contain several cis-acting elements capable of binding trans-acting factors (e.g., chromatin remodelers, transcription activators or repressors, adapters) (Harbison et al., 2004Harbison C.T. Gordon D.B. Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Macisaac K.D. Danford T.W. Hannett N.M. Tagne J.B. Reynolds D.B. Yoo J. et al.Transcriptional regulatory code of a eukaryotic genome.Nature. 2004; 431: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). For historical reasons, mRNA decay has been studied less intensively than transcription (Coller and Parker, 2004Coller J. Parker R. Eukaryotic mRNA decapping.Annu. Rev.

Bringing the role of mRNA decay in the control of gene expression into focus.Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), although RNA turnover is no less complex or important than RNA synthesis. Several mRNA decay mechanisms have been characterized, both in the nucleus (mainly for quality control) and in the cytoplasm (Coller and Parker, 2004Coller J. Parker R. Eukaryotic mRNA decapping.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Garneau et al., 2007Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. The highways and byways of mRNA decay.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Our understanding of mRNA decay in the yeast cytoplasm is based on a few model mRNAs (mainly MFA2 and PGK1 mRNAs). Two major cytoplasmic decay pathways exist. Both are initiated by shortening of the mRNA poly(A) tail. The mRNA can then be exonucleolytically degraded by the exosome from 3′ to 5′ or by the Xrn1p exonuclease from 5′ to 3′. The latter pathway involves removal of the mRNA 5′ cap (m(7)GpppN) (Decker and Parker, 1993Decker C.J. Parker R. A turnover pathway for both stable and unstable mRNAs in yeast: evidence for a requirement for deadenylation.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), which is a prerequisite stage for Xrn1p activity (Coller and Parker, 2004Coller J.

Song H. The enzymes and control of eukaryotic mRNA turnover.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Although most yeast mRNAs are degraded by either or both of these pathways, the half-lives of specific mRNAs vary widely, ranging from 3 min to more than 90 min (Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). What determines the half-life of a specific mRNA? Conventional wisdom holds that mRNAs carry all of the necessary information for this, both in their sequence and structure. This premise is supported by a wealth of data (Clark et al., 2009Clark A. Dean J. Tudor C. Saklatvala J. Post-transcriptional gene regulation by MAP kinases via AU-rich elements.Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 847-871Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, LaGrandeur and Parker, 1999LaGrandeur T. Parker R.

USA. 1990; 87: 2780-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, this notion was challenged by our previous discovery that Pol II can control the fate of its transcripts in the cytoplasm (Goler-Baron et al., 2008Goler-Baron V. Selitrennik M. Barkai O. Haimovich G. Lotan R. Choder M.

RNA polymerase II subunits link transcription and mRNA decay to translation.Cell. 2010; 143: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Provoked by these discoveries, we further tested the notion that other components of the transcription apparatus can affect the decay machineries. Here, we show that the mRNA half-life can be controlled by a UAS within the promoter. The studied promoters affect the major decay pathway, executed by Xrn1p, and seem to affect also an Xrn1p-independent pathway. In the cases presented here, the promoters seem to be the major elements that determine the decay rates of their transcripts. Moreover, a small cis-acting element consisting of two Rap1p-binding sites is required and sufficient to destabilize the transcript. Rap1p is a well-known transcription activator of highly transcribed genes (∼5% of the yeast genes). We found that depletion of Rap1p leads to the stabilization of mRNAs whose synthesis is activated by this protein. Thus, Rap1p plays a dual role in maintaining the level of specific mRNAs. We propose that Rap1p represents a class of factors, synthegradases, whose recruitment to promoters stimulates (or represses) both mRNA synthesis and decay. We conclude that promoters and their trans-acting factors can play more complex roles in gene expression than previously appreciated. Promoters promote mRNA synthesis. To determine whether they can also affect the decay kinetics of their transcripts, we compared half-lives of mRNAs derived from two similar plasmids that were constructed previously (Li et al., 1999Li B. Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. Transcriptional elements involved in the repression of ribosomal protein synthesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5393-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Each construct contains the RPL30 transcription unit, including the 3′ noncoding region. Transcription from both constructs is governed by the ACT1 TATA box (Figure 1A ). One of our constructs (“construct A”) contains the ACT1 UAS, and the other (“construct B”) contains the RPL30 UAS (see Figure 1A). These two UASs were selected because the natural ACT1 and RPL30 mRNAs are degraded with different kinetics (Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The endogenous natural RPL30 was not deleted and served as an internal control. To differentiate between the plasmid-borne and the endogenous RPL30 transcripts, we introduced a tract of oligo(G)18 into the 3′ noncoding sequence of the plasmid-derived RPL30 genes. Because a (G)18 tract serves as a barrier to exonuclease activity (Decker and Parker, 1993Decker C.J. Parker R.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), 5′-to-3′ mRNA degradation generates a degradation intermediate fragment that stretches from the oligo(G)18 tract to the 3′ end (called “Fragment”). Thus, insertion of the oligo(G)18 allowed us to differentiate between the plasmid-borne and the endogenous transcripts, as well as to evaluate the degradation efficiency and the decay pathway involved (Cao and Parker, 2001Cao D. Parker R. Computational modeling of eukaryotic mRNA turnover.RNA. 2001; 7: 1192-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Utilizing the oligo(G)18 as a tag, we used two specific probes and two hybridization programs to detect either the plasmid-derived transcript or the endogenous transcript (Figure S1 available online).Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Probes used in this study. RPL30pG was specifically hybridized with the oligo(C) containing probe at a high temperature (75°C); at this temperature, the endogenous transcript (lacking the (G)18 tract) could not hybridize with the probe (see B). The second 65 b probe cannot hybridize to the (G)18 tract-containing mRNA (see B), because this tract (which probably form a rigid G-quartet structure) interrupts the hybridized region in the middle, leaving 30 or 35 b complementary regions from either end which are too short to form stable hybrid.

The same membrane was sequentially probed with the indicated probes. In order to verify that the two constructs transcribe identical transcripts, we mapped the 5′ and 3′ ends of their mRNAs. To map the 3′ end, we cleaved RPL30pG mRNA around the stop codon by hybridizing it with a specific oligonucleotide followed by digestion with RNase H (Muhlrad and Parker, 1992Muhlrad D. Parker R.

The poly(A) tail was similarly removed by including oligo(dT) in the reaction (Cao and Parker, 2001Cao D. Parker R.

The digests were analyzed by PAGE northern, using “RPL30pG probe” (see Figure S1) to light up the 3′ end of the cleaved mRNAs. As shown in Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 4, the 3′ ends of the studied mRNAs ran as smears due to the heterogeneity of their tails. After removing the poly(A) tail, the 3′ fragments comigrated as bands, indicating that the 3′ ends are identical (Figure 1B, lanes 7 and 8). We used an additional oligonucleotide that hybridizes downstream of the stop codon, immediately upstream of the (G)18 tract. This resulted in shorter 3′ fragments that also comigrated (Figure 1B, lanes 11 and 12). Moreover, polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility of their Fragment at 120 min posttranscriptional arrest, when the poly(A) tail was naturally removed (Cao and Parker, 2001Cao D. Parker R.

Importantly, the poly(A)-containing smears were similar (Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the length of their tails is identical. To map the 5′ end, we deleted the endogenous RPL30, leaving the plasmid as the only source of the essential Rpl30p (normal proliferation of this strain demonstrated that the plasmid-borne transcript encodes a functional protein). mRNA A and mRNA B were cleaved near the 5′ ends and analyzed by northern blotting. As shown in Figure 1C, the 5′ ends of the studied RPL30pG mRNAs are identical. These ends are shorter than that of the endogenous RPL30 mRNA (Figure 1C), indicating that the 5′UTRs of the endogenous and plasmid-borne mRNAs are different. This difference is probably due to the ACT1 TATA box in the core promoter region of the constructs that is absent in the promoter of the endogenous gene. Collectively, the plasmid-borne transcripts have identical 5′ and 3′ ends, most probably because the reporter genes contain identical TATA boxes, ORFs, and 3′ noncoding regions. Hence, the two plasmid-borne mRNAs are identical. We monitored mRNA decay after blocking transcription using two different drugs, 1,10-phenanthroline or thiolutin. The former drug is a metal chelator that most likely inhibits Pol II by sequestering Mg+2. Thiolutin is not a chelator (it can act in the presence of 1 mM Cu+2; see Figures 5 and S5), and it acts by interacting with Pol II (Tipper, 1973Tipper D.J. Inhibition of yeast ribonucleic acid polymerases by thiolutin.J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 245-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the decay of the two identical transcripts exhibited different kinetics (Figures 2A, 2B, 2E , and S2A–S2C). Consistently, accumulation of Fragment—indicative of the decay efficiency (Cao and Parker, 2001Cao D. Parker R.

The accumulation kinetics of Fragment is complex, as it is generated by Xrn1p-mediated 5′-to-3′ degradation and is then further degraded by the exosome from 3′ to 5′ (Anderson and Parker, 1998Anderson J.S. Parker R.P. The 3′ to 5′ degradation of yeast mRNAs is a general mechanism for mRNA turnover that requires the SKI2 DEVH box protein and 3′ to 5′ exonucleases of the exosome complex.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) (for mathematical simulation of Fragment accumulation, see Cao and Parker, 2001Cao D. Parker R. Computational modeling of eukaryotic mRNA turnover.RNA. 2001; 7: 1192-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the different accumulation of Fragment in the two cases clearly illustrates the difference in the rate of mRNA decay. The level of Fragment relative to the full-length mRNA was determined at steady state. The relative level of Fragment was higher in the case of mRNA encoded by construct B (designated herein “mRNA B”) as compared to mRNA encoded by construct A (designated herein “mRNA A”) (Figure 2F). This can also be observed in the “time 0” lanes shown in Figure 2A and S2D. Thus, even in optimally proliferating cells whose transcription proceeds normally, the effect of the studied UASs on mRNA decay is evident.Figure S2Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) Differential decay kinetics of mRNA A and mRNA B is detected after blocking transcription by Thiolutin.

Decay kinetics was performed as in Fig. 2A, B, and E except that Thiolutin (3 μM) was used instead of 1, 10-phenanthroline. (D–F) Disappearance of pre-mRNA following transcription arrest by either 1, 10-phenanthroline (D and E) or Thiolutin (F). Kinetics and statistical analysis of pre-mRNA decline was obtained as described in Figures 2A and 2B. The northern blot membrane was deprobed and then probed with “RPL30 (endogenous)” probe (see Figure S1). Evidently, the endogenous RPL30 mRNA was degraded identically in the cells expressing either of the two plasmids (Figures 2A and 2C). We normalized the decay kinetics of the plasmid-borne mRNA to that of the endogenous mRNA. The results, shown in Figure 2D, clearly show that mRNA A (whose synthesis is driven by ACT1 UAS) was degraded more slowly than endogenous RPL30 mRNA (hence the gradual increase in the ratio between the plasmid-borne and endogenous mRNA). In contrast, mRNA B (whose synthesis is driven by RPL30 UAS) was degraded similarly, albeit not identically, to endogenous RPL30 mRNA. This difference might be due to the different 5′UTRs in mRNA B and endogenous RPL30 mRNA (see Figure 1C) and/or the different context of their promoters. The RPL30 core promoter, which construct B lacks, might also affect the decay of the endogenous RPL30 mRNA. Be that as it may, these results indicate that the RPL30 UAS serves as a major, albeit not necessarily the sole, element that determines RPL30 mRNA degradation. mRNA levels were also normalized to the endogenous ACT1 mRNA, whose decay is slower than that of RPL30 mRNA (Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2E, mRNA A was degraded similarly, albeit not identically, to that of ACT1 mRNA, whereas mRNA B was degraded faster. The RPL30 primary transcript contains an intron (see Figure 1). As shown in Figures S2D–S2F, the stability of the intron-containing transcript is also dependent on the UAS. Specifically, following transcription arrest, transcript B disappears faster than transcript A. Disappearance of the intron-containing transcript might be due to splicing or, as was shown for the ACT1 intron, degradation in the cytoplasm (Hilleren and Parker, 2003Hilleren P.J. Parker R. Cytoplasmic degradation of splice-defective pre-mRNAs and intermediates.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), or a combination of the two. In the case that the disappearance is due to splicing, faster splicing that characterizes transcript B should negatively affect the apparent disappearance of the mature mRNA B (i.e., the actual decay of the mature mRNA is faster than observed). Hence, there are two options; each supports our model whereby the UAS regulates mRNA decay. Either the promoter affects splicing, in which case the difference in the decay rates between mRNA A and B is in fact larger than observed; or the decay of the primary transcript is controlled by the same UAS-dependent mechanism that degrades the mature mRNA. Since the pre-mRNA disappearance is slower in xrn1Δ (results not shown), the pre-mRNA is probably degraded in the cytoplasm; we therefore suspect that the latter possibility is more likely. In yeast, cytoplasmic mRNA decay is executed mainly by two major pathways, one mediated by the 5′-to-3′ exonuclease Xrn1p and the other by 3′-to-5′ exonuclease—the exosome (see Introduction). To determine which of the two major cytoplasmic decay pathways is responsible for the decay of the examined mRNAs, we deleted XRN1 or SKI7, thereby compromising Xrn1p-mediated 5′-to-3′ degradation or exosome-mediated 3′-to-5′ degradation, respectively. Deletion of SKI7, the adaptor that links the SKI complex with the exosome and is required for the exosome activity (Araki et al., 2001Araki Y. Takahashi S. Kobayashi T. Kajiho H. Hoshino S. Katada T. Ski7p G protein interacts with the exosome and the Ski complex for 3′-to-5′ mRNA decay in yeast.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4684-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, van Hoof et al., 2000van Hoof A. Staples R.R. Baker R.E. Parker R. Function of the ski4p (Csl4p) and Ski7p proteins in 3′-to-5′ degradation of mRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8230-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), did not lead to detectable stabilization of either mRNA A or mRNA B (data not shown). In contrast, deletion of XRN1 compromised the decay of both mRNAs (Figure S3), indicating that both mRNAs are substrates of Xrn1p. Nevertheless, deletion of XRN1 affected more substantially the decay of mRNA A than B. Consequently, mRNA B was not completely stable in xrn1Δ cells (Figures 3D , S3A, and S3B), indicating that an Xrn1p-independent mechanism also contributes to its degradation. This suggests that UASs can also affect the 3′-to-5′ decay pathway (or as yet undefined mechanism). It seems that the exosome effect on the decay of these mRNAs is either too weak to be observed or that it does not require Ski7p. Because Xrn1p is mainly a cytoplasmic protein (Johnson, 1997Johnson A.W. Rat1p and Xrn1p are functionally interchangeable exoribonucleases that are restricted to and required in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively.Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2047184358,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway has long been established as playing critical roles in skeletal muscle development. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism is poorly understood. Recently, a large family of small RNAs, named microRNAs (miRNAs), has been identified as key regulators for many developmental processes. Because miRNAs participate in the regulation of various signaling pathways, we hypothesized that miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of IGF signaling in skeletal myogenesis.In the present study, we determined that the cell-surface receptor IGF-1R is directly regulated by a muscle-specific miRNA, microRNA-133 (miR-133). A conserved and functional binding site for miR-133 was identified in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of IGF-1R. During differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, IGF-1R protein, but not messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, was gradually reduced, concurrent with the upregulation of miR-133. Overexpression of miR-133 in C2C12 cells significantly suppressed IGF-1R expression at the posttranscriptional level. We also demonstrated that both overexpression of miR-133 and knockdown of IGF-1R downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt, the central mediator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-133 during C2C12 differentiation was significantly accelerated by the addition of IGF-1. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of myogenin, a myogenic transcription factor reported to transactivate miR-133, was increased by IGF-1 stimulation.Our results elucidate a negative feedback circuit in which IGF-1-stimulated miR-133 in turn represses IGF-1R expression to modulate the IGF-1R signaling pathway during skeletal myogenesis. These findings also suggest that miR-133 may be a potential therapeutic target in muscle diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2039285932,"Visual working memory provides an essential link between past and future events. Despite recent efforts, capacity limits, their genesis and the underlying neural structures of visual working memory remain unclear. Here we show that performance in visual working memory - but not iconic visual memory - can be predicted by the strength of mental imagery as assessed with binocular rivalry in a given individual. In addition, for individuals with strong imagery, modulating the background luminance diminished performance on visual working memory and imagery tasks, but not working memory for number strings. This suggests that luminance signals were disrupting sensory-based imagery mechanisms and not a general working memory system. Individuals with poor imagery still performed above chance in the visual working memory task, but their performance was not affected by the background luminance, suggesting a dichotomy in strategies for visual working memory: individuals with strong mental imagery rely on sensory-based imagery to support mnemonic performance, while those with poor imagery rely on different strategies. These findings could help reconcile current controversy regarding the mechanism and location of visual mnemonic storage."
https://openalex.org/W2139953766,"We recently reported the genetic cause of autosomal dominant chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (AD-CMC) as a mutation in the STAT1 gene. In the present study we show that STAT1 Arg274Trp mutations in the coiled-coil (CC) domain is the genetic cause of AD-CMC in three families of patients. Cloning and transfection experiments demonstrate that mutated STAT1 inhibits IL12R/IL-23R signaling, with hyperphosphorylation of STAT1 as the likely underlying molecular mechanism. Inhibition of signaling through the receptors for IL-12 and IL-23 leads to strongly diminished Th1/Th17 responses and hence to increased susceptibility to fungal infections. The challenge for the future is to translate this knowledge into novel strategies for the treatment of this severe immunodeficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2066847649,"Background Flowering reversion can be induced in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), a typical short-day (SD) dicot, by switching from SD to long-day (LD) photoperiods. This process may involve florigen, putatively encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little is known about the potential function of soybean FT homologs in flowering reversion. Methods A photoperiod-responsive FT homologue GmFT (renamed as GmFT2a hereafter) was cloned from the photoperiod-sensitive cultivar Zigongdongdou. GmFT2a gene expression under different photoperiods was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. In situ hybridization showed direct evidence for its expression during flowering-related processes. GmFT2a was shown to promote flowering using transgenic studies in Arabidopsis and soybean. The effects of photoperiod and temperature on GmFT2a expression were also analyzed in two cultivars with different photoperiod-sensitivities. Results GmFT2a expression is regulated by photoperiod. Analyses of GmFT2a transcripts revealed a strong correlation between GmFT2a expression and flowering maintenance. GmFT2a transcripts were observed continuously within the vascular tissue up to the shoot apex during flowering. By contrast, transcripts decreased to undetectable levels during flowering reversion. In grafting experiments, the early-flowering, photoperiod-insensitive stock Heihe27 promotes the appearance of GmFT2a transcripts in the shoot apex of scion Zigongdongdou under noninductive LD conditions. The photothermal effects of GmFT2a expression diversity in cultivars with different photoperiod-sensitivities and a hypothesis is proposed. Conclusion GmFT2a expression is associated with flowering induction and maintenance. Therefore, GmFT2a is a potential target gene for soybean breeding, with the aim of increasing geographic adaptation of this crop."
https://openalex.org/W2151795920,"Small colony variants (SCVs) are slow-growing bacteria, which often show increased resistance to antibiotics and cause latent or recurrent infections. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms at the basis of this phenotypic switch.One SCV (termed PAO-SCV) was isolated, showing high resistance to gentamicin and to the cephalosporine cefotaxime. PAO-SCV was prone to reversion as evidenced by emergence of large colonies with a frequency of 10(-5) on media without antibiotics while it was stably maintained in presence of gentamicin. PAO-SCV showed a delayed growth, defective motility, and strongly reduced levels of the quorum sensing Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). Whole genome expression analysis further suggested a multi-layered antibiotic resistance mechanism, including simultaneous over-expression of two drug efflux pumps (MexAB-OprM, MexXY-OprM), the LPS modification operon arnBCADTEF, and the PhoP-PhoQ two-component system. Conversely, the genes for the synthesis of PQS were strongly down-regulated in PAO-SCV. Finally, genomic analysis revealed the presence of mutations in phoP and phoQ genes as well as in the mexZ gene encoding a repressor of the mexXY and mexAB-oprM genes. Only one mutation occurred only in REV, at nucleotide 1020 of the tufA gene, a paralog of tufB, both encoding the elongation factor Tu, causing a change of the rarely used aspartic acid codon GAU to the more common GAC, possibly causing an increase of tufA mRNA translation. High expression of phoP and phoQ was confirmed for the SCV variant while the revertant showed expression levels reduced to wild-type levels.By combining data coming from phenotypic, gene expression and proteome analysis, we could demonstrate that resistance to aminoglycosides in one SCV mutant is multifactorial including overexpression of efflux mechanisms, LPS modification and is accompanied by a drastic down-regulation of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal quorum sensing system."
https://openalex.org/W2007643044,"Many common tasks require us to individuate in parallel two or more objects out of a complex scene. Although the mechanisms underlying our abilities to count the number of items, remember the visual properties of objects and to make saccadic eye movements towards targets have been studied separately, each of these tasks require selection of individual objects and shows a capacity limit. Here we show that a common factor—salience—determines the capacity limit in the various tasks. We manipulated bottom-up salience (visual contrast) and top-down salience (task relevance) in enumeration and visual memory tasks. As one item became increasingly salient, the subitizing range was reduced and memory performance for all other less-salient items was decreased. Overall, the pattern of results suggests that our abilities to enumerate and remember small groups of stimuli are grounded in an attentional priority or salience map which represents the location of important items."
https://openalex.org/W2087307714,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator enriched in serum, stimulates cell migration, proliferation and other functions in many cell types. LPA acts on six known G protein-coupled receptors, termed LPA1–6, showing both overlapping and distinct signaling properties. Here we show that, unexpectedly, LPA and serum almost completely inhibit the transwell migration of B16 melanoma cells, with alkyl-LPA(18∶1) being 10-fold more potent than acyl-LPA(18∶1). The anti-migratory response to LPA is highly polarized and dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) but not Rho kinase activity; it is associated with a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP levels and PIP3 depletion from the plasma membrane. B16 cells express LPA2, LPA5 and LPA6 receptors. We show that LPA-induced chemorepulsion is mediated specifically by the alkyl-LPA-preferring LPA5 receptor (GPR92), which raises intracellular cAMP via a noncanonical pathway. Our results define LPA5 as an anti-migratory receptor and they implicate the cAMP-PKA pathway, along with reduced PIP3 signaling, as an effector of chemorepulsion in B16 melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2090573164,"Background Whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are measured in the brain in animal models of stroke, neurotrophin levels in stroke patients are measured in plasma or serum samples. The present study was designed to investigate the meaning of circulating BDNF levels in stroke patients. Methods and Results Unilateral ischemic stroke was induced in rats by the injection of various numbers of microspheres into the carotid circulation in order to mimic the different degrees of stroke severity observed in stroke patients. Blood was serially collected from the jugular vein before and after (4 h, 24 h and 8 d) embolization and the whole brains were collected at 4, 24 h and 8 d post-embolization. Rats were then selected from their degree of embolization, so that the distribution of stroke severity in the rats at the different time points was large but similar. Using ELISA tests, BDNF levels were measured in plasma, serum and brain of selected rats. Whereas plasma and serum BDNF levels were not changed by stroke, stroke induced an increase in brain BDNF levels at 4 h and 24 h post-embolization, which was not correlated with stroke severity. Individual plasma BDNF levels did not correlate with brain levels at any time point after stroke but a positive correlation (r = 0.67) was observed between individual plasma BDNF levels and stroke severity at 4 h post-embolization. Conclusion Circulating BDNF levels do not mirror brain BDNF levels after stroke, and severe stroke is associated with high plasma BDNF in the very acute stage."
https://openalex.org/W2009250708,"Highly porous polypyrrole (PPy)-nanocellulose paper sheets have been evaluated as inexpensive and disposable electrochemically controlled three-dimensional solid phase extraction materials. The composites, which had a total anion exchange capacity of about 1.1 mol kg(-1), were used for extraction and subsequent release of negatively charged fluorophore tagged DNA oligomers via galvanostatic oxidation and reduction of a 30-50 nm conformal PPy layer on the cellulose substrate. The ion exchange capacity, which was, at least, two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reached in electrochemically controlled extraction, originated from the high surface area (i.e. 80 m(2) g(-1)) of the porous composites and the thin PPy layer which ensured excellent access to the ion exchange material. This enabled the extractions to be carried out faster and with better control of the PPy charge than with previously employed approaches. Experiments in equimolar mixtures of (dT)(6), (dT)(20), and (dT)(40) DNA oligomers showed that all oligomers could be extracted, and that the smallest oligomer was preferentially released with an efficiency of up to 40% during the reduction of the PPy layer. These results indicate that the present material is very promising for the development of inexpensive and efficient electrochemically controlled ion-exchange membranes for batch-wise extraction of biomolecules."
https://openalex.org/W2077120542,"Background Cardiac stem cells (CSCs) promote myocardial recovery following ischemia through their regenerative properties. However, little is known regarding the implication of paracrine action by CSCs in the setting of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury although it is well documented that non-cardiac stem cells mediate cardioprotection via the production of paracrine protective factors. Here, we studied whether CSCs could initiate acute protection following global myocardial I/R via paracrine effect and what component from CSCs is critical to this protection. Methodology/Principal Findings A murine model of global myocardial I/R was utilized to investigate paracrine effect of Sca-1+ CSCs on cardiac function. Intracoronary delivery of CSCs or CSC conditioned medium (CSC CM) prior to ischemia significantly improved myocardial function following I/R. siRNA targeting of VEGF in CSCs did not affect CSC-preserved myocardial function in response to I/R injury. However, differentiation of CSCs to cardiomyocytes (DCSCs) abolished this protection. Through direct comparison of the protein expression profiles of CSCs and DCSCs, SDF-1 was identified as one of the dominant paracrine factors secreted by CSCs. Blockade of the SDF-1 receptor by AMD3100 or downregulated SDF-1 expression in CSCs by specific SDF-1 siRNA dramatically impaired CSC-induced improvement in cardiac function and increased myocardial damage following I/R. Of note, CSC treatment increased myocardial STAT3 activation after I/R, whereas downregulation of SDF-1 action by blockade of the SDF-1 receptor or SDF-1 siRNA transfection abolished CSC-induced STAT3 activation. In addition, inhibition of STAT3 activation attenuated CSC-mediated cardioprotection following I/R. Finally, post-ischemic infusion of CSC CM was shown to significantly protect I/R-caused myocardial dysfunction. Conclusions/Significance This study suggests that CSCs acutely improve post-ischemic myocardial function through paracrine factor SDF-1 and up-regulated myocardial STAT3 activation."

In the present study, we investigated the antinociceptive efficacy of the antioxidants vitamin C and vitamin E in mouse models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We show that systemic administration of a combination of vitamins C and E inhibited the early behavioral responses to formalin injection and the neuropathic pain behavior after peripheral nerve injury, but not the inflammatory pain behavior induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant. In contrast, vitamin C or vitamin E given alone failed to affect the nociceptive behavior in all tested models. The attenuated neuropathic pain behavior induced by the vitamin C and E combination was paralleled by a reduced p38 phosphorylation in the spinal cord and in dorsal root ganglia, and was also observed after intrathecal injection of the vitamins. Moreover, the vitamin C and E combination ameliorated the allodynia induced by an intrathecally delivered ROS donor. Our results suggest that administration of vitamins C and E in combination may exert synergistic antinociceptive effects, and further indicate that ROS essentially contribute to nociceptive processing in special pain states."
https://openalex.org/W2168440553,"Protein synthesis in plants is characterized by increase in the translation rates for numerous proteins and central metabolic enzymes during the day phase of the photoperiod. The detailed molecular mechanisms of this diurnal regulation are unknown, while eukaryotic protein translation is mainly controlled at the level of ribosomal initiation complexes, which also involves multiple events of protein phosphorylation. We characterized the extent of protein phosphorylation in cytosolic ribosomes isolated from leaves of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana harvested during day or night. Proteomic analyses of preparations corresponding to both phases of the photoperiod detected phosphorylation at eight serine residues in the C-termini of six ribosomal proteins: S2-3, S6-1, S6-2, P0-2, P1 and L29-1. This included previously unknown phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 at Ser-231. Relative quantification of the phosphorylated peptides using stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry revealed a 2.2 times increase in the day/night phosphorylation ratio at this site. Phosphorylation of the S6-1 and S6-2 variants of the same protein at Ser-240 increased by the factors of 4.2 and 1.8, respectively. The 1.6 increase in phosphorylation during the day was also found at Ser-58 of the 60S ribosomal protein L29-1. It is suggested that differential phosphorylation of the ribosomal proteins S6-1, S6-2 and L29-1 may contribute to modulation of the diurnal protein synthesis in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1968932495,"Background Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide and metastatic breast cancer has very poor prognosis. Inflammation has been implicated in migration and metastasis of breast cancer, although the exact molecular mechanism remains elusive. Principal Findings We show that the pro-inflammatory endotoxin Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) upregulates the expression of Metadherin (MTDH), a recently identified oncogene, in a number of breast cancer lines. Stable knockdown of MTDH by shRNA in human breast MDA-MB-231 cells abolishes LPS-induced cell migration and invasion as determined by several in vitro assays. In addition, knockdown of MTDH diminishes Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation by LPS and inhibited LPS-induced IL-8 and MMP-9 production. Conclusions These results strongly suggest that MTDH is a pivotal molecule in inflammation-mediated tumor metastasis. Since NF-κB, IL-8 and MMP-9 play roles in LPS-induced invasion or metastasis, the mechanism of MTDH-promoted invasion and metastasis may be through the activation of NF-κB, IL-8 and MMP-9, also suggesting a role of MTDH in regulating both inflammatory responses and inflammation-associated tumor invasion. These findings indicate that MTDH is involved in inflammation-induced tumor progression, and support that MTDH targeting therapy may hold promising prospects in treating breast cancer."

Here, we aim to study paleo-climatic effects on an East Asian bird, two subspecies of black-throated tit (A. c. talifuensis-concinnus) with the combined analysis of phylogeography and Ecological Niche Models (ENMs). We sequenced three mitochondrial DNA markers from 32 populations (203 individuals) and used phylogenetic inferences to reconstruct the intra-specific relationships among haplotypes. Population genetic analyses were undertaken to gain insight into the demographic history of these populations. We used ENMs to predict the distribution of target species during three periods; last inter-glacial (LIG), last glacial maximum (LGM) and present. We found three highly supported, monophyletic MtDNA lineages and different historical demography among lineages in A. c. talifuensis-concinnus. These lineages formed a narrowly circumscribed intra-specific contact zone. The estimated times of lineage divergences were about 2.4 Ma and 0.32 Ma respectively. ENMs predictions were similar between present and LGM but substantially reduced during LIG. ENMs reconstructions and molecular dating suggest that Pleistocene climate changes had triggered and shaped the genetic structure of black-throated tit. Interestingly, in contrast to profound impacts of other glacial cycles, ENMs and phylogeographic analysis suggest that LGM had limited effect on these two subspecies. ENMs also suggest that Pleistocene climatic oscillations enabled the formation of the contact zone and thus support the refuge theory."

In this study, we hypothesized that elevated ALDH levels could identify murine and human muscle derived cell (hMDC) progenitors, endowed with enhanced stress resistance and muscle regeneration capacity.Skeletal muscle progenitors were isolated from murine and human skeletal muscle by a modified preplate technique and unfractionated enzymatic digestion, respectively. ALDH(hi) subpopulations isolated by fluorescence activate cell sorting demonstrated increased proliferation and myogenic differentiation capacities compared to their ALDH(lo) counterparts when cultivated in oxidative and inflammatory stress media conditions. This behavior correlated with increased intracellular levels of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase. ALDH(hi) murine myoblasts were observed to exhibit an increased muscle regenerative potential compared to ALDH(lo) myoblasts, undergo multipotent differentiation (osteogenic and chondrogenic), and were found predominately in the SAC fraction, characteristics that are also observed in murine MDSCs. Likewise, human ALDH(hi) hMDCs demonstrated superior muscle regenerative capacity compared to ALDH(lo) hMDCs.The methodology of isolating myogenic cells on the basis of elevated ALDH activity yielded cells with increased stress resistance, a behavior that conferred increased regenerative capacity of dystrophic murine skeletal muscle. This result demonstrates the critical role of stress resistance in myogenic cell therapy as well as confirms the role of ALDH as a marker for rapid isolation of murine and human myogenic progenitors for cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2134745615,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling plays a key role in vertebrate development, homeostasis, and disease. Nuclear factor I-C (NFI-C) has been implicated in TGF-β1 signaling, extracellular matrix gene transcription, and tooth root development. However, the functional relationship between NFI-C and TGF-β1 signaling remains uncharacterized. The purpose of this study was to identify the molecular interactions between NFI-C and TGF-β1 signaling in mouse odontoblasts. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western analysis demonstrated that NFI-C expression levels were inversely proportional to levels of TGF-β1 signaling molecules during in vitro odontoblast differentiation. Western blot and immunofluorescence results showed that NFI-C was significantly degraded after TGF-β1 addition in odontoblasts, and the formation of the Smad3 complex was essential for NFI-C degradation. Additionally, ubiquitination assay results showed that Smurf1 and Smurf2 induced NFI-C degradation and polyubiquitination in a TGF-β1-dependent manner. Both kinase and in vitro binding assays revealed that the interaction between NFI-C and Smurf1/Smurf2 requires the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by TGF-β1. Moreover, degradation of NFI-C induced by TGF-β1 occurred generally in cell types other than odontoblasts in normal human breast epithelial cells. In contrast, NFI-C induced dephosphorylation of p-Smad2/3. These results show that crosstalk between NFI-C and TGF-β1 signaling regulates cell differentiation and homeostatic processes in odontoblasts, which might constitute a common cellular mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2051681169,"There is increasing evidence that regulation of local chromatin structure is a critical mechanism underlying the consolidation of long-term memory (LTM), however considerably less is understood about the specific mechanisms by which these epigenetic effects are mediated. Furthermore, the importance of histone acetylation in Drosophila memory has not been reported. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3 is abundant in the adult fly brain, suggesting a post-mitotic function. Here, we investigated the role of Rpd3 in long-term courtship memory in Drosophila. We found that while modulation of Rpd3 levels predominantly in the adult mushroom body had no observed impact on immediate recall or one-hour memory, 24-hour LTM was severely impaired. Surprisingly, both overexpression as well as RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rpd3 resulted in impairment of long-term courtship memory, suggesting that the dose of Rpd3 is critical for normal LTM."
https://openalex.org/W2076953438,"Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of craniectomy for the treatment of malignant cerebral edema following ischemic stroke. We sought to determine the prevalence and outcomes related to this by using a national database.Patient discharges with ischemic stroke as the primary diagnosis undergoing craniectomy were queried from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1999 to 2008. A subpopulation of patients was identified that underwent thrombolysis. Two primary end points were examined: in-hospital mortality and discharge to home/routine care. To facilitate interpretations, adjusted prevalence was calculated from the overall prevalence and two age-specific logistic regression models. The predictive margin was then generated using a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate the probability of in-hospital mortality after adjustment for admission type, admission source, length of stay, total hospital charges, chronic comorbidities, and medical complications.After excluding 71,996 patients with the diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage and posterior intracranial circulation occlusion, we identified 4,248,955 adult hospitalizations with ischemic stroke as a primary diagnosis. The estimated rates of hospitalizations in craniectomy per 10,000 hospitalizations with ischemic stroke increased from 3.9 in 1999-2000 to 14.46 in 2007-2008 (p for linear trend<0.001). Patients 60+ years of age had in-hospital mortality of 44% while the 18-59 year old group was found to be 24% (p = 0.14). Outcomes were comparable if recombinant tissue plasminogen activator had been administered.Craniectomy is being increasingly performed for malignant cerebral edema following large territory cerebral ischemia. We suspect that the increase in the annual incidence of DC for malignant cerebral edema is directly related to the expanding collection of evidence in randomized trials that the operation is efficacious when performed in the correct patient population. In hospital mortality is high for all patients undergoing this procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2011493317,"The pronghorn spiny lobster, Panulirus penicillatus, is a circumtropical species which has the widest global distribution among all the species of spiny lobster, ranging throughout the entire Indo-Pacific region. Partial nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial DNA COI (1,142-1,207 bp) and 16S rDNA (535-546 bp) regions were determined for adult and phyllosoma larval samples collected from the Eastern Pacific (EP)(Galápagos Islands and its adjacent water), Central Pacific (CP)(Hawaii and Tuamotu) and the Western Pacific (WP)(Japan, Indonesia, Fiji, New Caledonia and Australia). Phylogenetic analyses revealed two distinct large clades corresponding to the geographic origin of samples (EP and CP+WP). No haplotype was shared between the two regional samples, and average nucleotide sequence divergence (Kimura's two parameter distance) between EP and CP+WP samples was 3.8±0.5% for COI and 1.0±0.4% for 16S rDNA, both of which were much larger than those within samples. The present results indicate that the Pacific population of the pronghorn spiny lobster is subdivided into two distinct populations (Eastern Pacific and Central to Western Pacific), with no gene flow between them. Although the pronghorn spiny lobster have long-lived teleplanic larvae, the vast expanse of Pacific Ocean with no islands and no shallow substrate which is known as the East Pacific Barrier appears to have isolated these two populations for a long time (c.a. 1MY)."
https://openalex.org/W2015577467,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is frequently diagnosed in military personnel returning from deployment. Literature suggests that MDD is associated with a pro-inflammatory state. To the best of our knowledge, no prospective, longitudinal studies on the association between development of depressive symptomatology and cytokine production by peripheral blood leukocytes have been published. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of depressive symptomatology six months after military deployment is associated with the capacity to produce cytokines, as assessed before and after deployment. 1023 military personnel were included before deployment. Depressive symptoms and LPS- and T-cell mitogen-induced production of 16 cytokines and chemokines in whole blood cultures were measured before (T0), 1 (T1), and 6 (T2) months after return from deployment. Exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) was used for data reduction into cytokine patterns. Multiple group latent growth modeling was used to investigate differences in the longitudinal course of cytokine production between individuals with (n = 68) and without (n = 665) depressive symptoms at T2. Individuals with depressive symptoms after deployment showed higher T-cell cytokine production before deployment. Moreover, pre-deployment T-cell cytokine production significantly predicted the presence of depressive symptomatology 6 months after return. There was an increase in T-cell cytokine production over time, but this increase was significantly smaller in individuals developing depressive symptoms. T-cell chemokine and LPS-induced innate cytokine production decreased over time and were not associated with depressive symptoms. These results indicate that increased T-cell mitogen-induced cytokine production before deployment may be a vulnerability factor for development of depressive symptomatology in response to deployment to a combat-zone. In addition, deployment to a combat-zone affects the capacity of T-cells and monocytes to produce cytokines and chemokines until at least 6 months after return."
https://openalex.org/W2100440330,"Background We have previously shown that essential hypertension in humans and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), is associated with increased levels of ceramide and marked alterations in sphingolipid biology. Pharmacological elevation of ceramide in isolated carotid arteries of SHR leads to vasoconstriction via a calcium-independent phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-1 and thromboxane synthase-dependent release of thromboxane A2. This phenomenon is almost absent in vessels from normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Here we investigated whether lowering of blood pressure can reverse elevated ceramide levels and reduce ceramide-mediated contractions in SHR. Methods and Findings For this purpose SHR were treated for 4 weeks with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan or the vasodilator hydralazine. Both drugs decreased blood pressure equally (SBP untreated SHR: 191±7 mmHg, losartan: 125±5 mmHg and hydralazine: 113±14 mmHg). The blood pressure lowering was associated with a 20–25% reduction in vascular ceramide levels and improved endothelial function of isolated carotid arteries in both groups. Interestingly, losartan, but not hydralazine treatment, markedly reduced sphingomyelinase-induced contractions. While both drugs lowered cyclooxygenase-1 expression, only losartan and not hydralazine, reduced the endothelial expression of calcium-independent phospholipase A2. The latter finding may explain the effect of losartan treatment on sphingomyelinase-induced vascular contraction. Conclusion In summary, this study corroborates the importance of sphingolipid biology in blood pressure control and specifically shows that blood pressure lowering reduces vascular ceramide levels in SHR and that losartan treatment, but not blood pressure lowering per se, reduces ceramide-mediated arterial contractions."
https://openalex.org/W2021549670,"Length polymorphisms within the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) have been described as stable genetic markers for studying bacterial phylogenetics. In this study, we used these genetic markers to investigate phylogenetic relationships in Burkholderia pseudomallei and its near-relative species. B. pseudomallei is known as one of the most genetically recombined bacterial species. In silico analysis of multiple B. pseudomallei genomes revealed approximately four homologous rRNA operons and ITS length polymorphisms therein. We characterized ITS distribution using PCR and analyzed via a high-throughput capillary electrophoresis in 1,191 B. pseudomallei strains. Three major ITS types were identified, two of which were commonly found in most B. pseudomallei strains from the endemic areas, whereas the third one was significantly correlated with worldwide sporadic strains. Interestingly, mixtures of the two common ITS types were observed within the same strains, and at a greater incidence in Thailand than Australia suggesting that genetic recombination causes the ITS variation within species, with greater recombination frequency in Thailand. In addition, the B. mallei ITS type was common to B. pseudomallei, providing further support that B. mallei is a clone of B. pseudomallei. Other B. pseudomallei near-neighbors possessed unique and monomorphic ITS types. Our data shed light on evolutionary patterns of B. pseudomallei and its near relative species."
https://openalex.org/W2106474372,"We have developed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) nucleated high-resolution melting (HRM) technique to genotype Enterococcus faecium. Eight SNPs were derived from the E. faecium multilocus sequence typing (MLST) database and amplified fragments containing these SNPs were interrogated by HRM. We tested the HRM genotyping scheme on 85 E. faecium bloodstream isolates and compared the results with MLST, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and an allele specific real-time PCR (AS kinetic PCR) SNP typing method. In silico analysis based on predicted HRM curves according to the G+C content of each fragment for all 567 sequence types (STs) in the MLST database together with empiric data from the 85 isolates demonstrated that HRM analysis resolves E. faecium into 231 “melting types” (MelTs) and provides a Simpson's Index of Diversity (D) of 0.991 with respect to MLST. This is a significant improvement on the AS kinetic PCR SNP typing scheme that resolves 61 SNP types with D of 0.95. The MelTs were concordant with the known ST of the isolates. For the 85 isolates, there were 13 PFGE patterns, 17 STs, 14 MelTs and eight SNP types. There was excellent concordance between PFGE, MLST and MelTs with Adjusted Rand Indices of PFGE to MelT 0.936 and ST to MelT 0.973. In conclusion, this HRM based method appears rapid and reproducible. The results are concordant with MLST and the MLST based population structure."
https://openalex.org/W2155433449,"NIP7 is one of the many trans-acting factors required for eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, which interacts with nascent pre-ribosomal particles and dissociates as they complete maturation and are exported to the cytoplasm. By using conditional knockdown, we have shown previously that yeast Nip7p is required primarily for 60S subunit synthesis while human NIP7 is involved in the biogenesis of 40S subunit. This raised the possibility that human NIP7 interacts with a different set of proteins as compared to the yeast protein. By using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified FTSJ3, a putative ortholog of yeast Spb1p, as a human NIP7-interacting protein. A functional association between NIP7 and FTSJ3 is further supported by colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Conditional knockdown revealed that depletion of FTSJ3 affects cell proliferation and causes pre-rRNA processing defects. The major pre-rRNA processing defect involves accumulation of the 34S pre-rRNA encompassing from site A′ to site 2b. Accumulation of this pre-rRNA indicates that processing of sites A0, 1 and 2 are slower in cells depleted of FTSJ3 and implicates FTSJ3 in the pathway leading to 18S rRNA maturation as observed previously for NIP7. The results presented in this work indicate a close functional interaction between NIP7 and FTSJ3 during pre-rRNA processing and show that FTSJ3 participates in ribosome synthesis in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032910441,"Cell migration is a physiological process that requires endocytic trafficking and polarization of adhesion molecules and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to the leading edge. Many growth factors are able to induce motility by binding to specific RTK on target cells. Among them, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF7) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), members of the FGF family, are motogenic for keratinocytes, and exert their action by binding to the keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), a splicing variant of FGFR2, exclusively expressed on epithelial cells. Here we analyzed the possible role of cortactin, an F-actin binding protein which is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src and is involved in KGFR-mediated cell migration, in the KGFR endocytosis and polarization to the leading edge of migrating cells upon ligand-induced stimulation. Biochemical phosphorylation study revealed that both KGF and FGF10 were able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and in turn of cortactin, as demonstrated by using the specific pharmacological Src-inhibitor SU6656, although FGF10 effect was delayed with respect to that promoted by KGF. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated the polarized localization of KGFR upon ligand stimulation to the leading edge of migrating keratinocytes, process that was regulated by Src. Moreover, we showed that the colocalization of cortactin with KGFR at the plasma membrane protrusions and on early endosomes after KGF and FGF10 treatment was Src-dependent. Further, by using a RNA interference approach through microinjection, we showed that cortactin is required for KGFR endocytosis and that the clathrin-dependent internalization of the receptor is a critical event for its polarization. Finally, KGFR expression and polarization enhanced cell migration in a scratch assay. Our results indicate that both Src and cortactin play a key role in the KGFR endocytosis and polarization at the leading edge of migrating keratinocytes, supporting the crucial involvement of RTK trafficking in cell motility."

Emerging evidence suggests that PAP plays a protective effect in inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we newly identified a 16-amino-acid peptide (named PAPep) derived from C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of human PAP with potent anti-inflammatory activity using both in vivo and in vitro assays.We assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of PAPep on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats and demonstrated that intravitreal pretreatment of PAPep concentration-dependently attenuated clinical manifestation of EIU rats, reduced protein leakage and cell infiltration into the aqueous humor (AqH), suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 production in ocular tissues, and improved histopathologic manifestation of EIU. Furthermore, PAPep suppressed the LPS-induced mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells, inhibited protein expression of ICAM-1 in TNF-α-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as U937 cells adhesion to HUVECs. Western blot analysis in ocular tissues and different cell lines revealed that the possible mechanism for this anti-inflammatory effect of PAPep may depend on its ability to inhibit the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway.Our studies provide the first evidence that the sequence of PAPep is within the critically active region for the anti-inflammatory function of PAP and the peptide may be a promising candidate for the management of ocular inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2064701789,"Background Tissue-engineered nerve scaffolds hold great potential in bridging large peripheral nerve defects. However, insufficient vascularization of nerve scaffolds limited neural tissues survival and regeneration, which hampered the successful implantation and clinical application of nerve scaffolds. The omentum possesses a high vascularization capacity and enhances regeneration and maturation of tissues and constructs to which it is applied. However, combined application of nerve scaffolds and omentum on axonal regeneration and functional recovery in the treatment of large peripheral nerve defects has rarely been investigated thus far. Methods In the present study, an omentum-wrapped collagen-chitosan scaffold was used to bridge a 15-mm-long sciatic nerve defect in rats. Rats that received nerve autografts or scaffolds alone were served as positive control or negative control, respectively. The axonal regeneration and functional recovery were examined by a combination of walking track analysis, electrophysiological assessment, Fluoro-Gold (FG) retrograde tracing, as well as morphometric analyses to both regenerated nerves and target muscles. Findings The results demonstrated that axonal regeneration and functional recovery were in the similar range between the omentum-wrapping group and the autograft group, which were significantly better than those in the scaffold alone group. Further investigation showed that the protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were significantly higher in the omentum-wrapping group than those in the scaffold alone group in the early weeks after surgery. Conclusion These findings indicate that the omentum-wrapped scaffold is capable of enhancing axonal regeneration and functional recovery, which might be served as a potent alternative to nerve autografts. The beneficial effect of omentum-wrapping on nerve regeneration might be related with the proteins produced by omentum."

Here we report on the application of LTS as a novel detection method for species-specific DNA where the presence of one invasive species was differentiated from a closely related invasive sister species. The method employs carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with short DNA fragments that are complimentary to a specific target DNA sequence. In solution, the DNA strands containing targets bind to the tags resulting in a sizable increase in the nanoparticle diameter, which is rapidly and quantitatively measured using LTS. DNA strands that do not contain the target sequence do not bind and produce no size change of the carboxylated beads. The results show that LTS has the potential to become a quantitative and rapid DNA detection method suitable for many real-world applications."
https://openalex.org/W2012730834,"Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging human pathogen responsible for lung infections, skin and soft-tissue infections and disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients. It may exist either as a smooth (S) or rough (R) morphotype, the latter being associated with increased pathogenicity in various models. Genetic tools for homologous recombination and conditional gene expression are desperately needed to allow the study of M. abscessus virulence. However, descriptions of knock-out (KO) mutants in M. abscessus are rare, with only one KO mutant from an S strain described so far. Moreover, of the three major tools developed for homologous recombination in mycobacteria, only the one based on expression of phage recombinases is working. Several conditional gene expression tools have recently been engineered for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, but none have been tested yet in M. abscessus. Based on previous experience with genetic tools allowing homologous recombination and their failure in M. abscessus, we evaluated the potential interest of a conditional gene expression approach using a system derived from the two repressors system, TetR/PipOFF. After several steps necessary to adapt TetR/PipOFF for M. abscessus, we have shown the efficiency of this system for conditional expression of an essential mycobacterial gene, fadD32. Inhibition of fadD32 was demonstrated for both the S and R isotypes, with marginally better efficiency for the R isotype. Conditional gene expression using the dedicated TetR/PipOFF system vectors developed here is effective in S and R M. abscessus, and may constitute an interesting approach for future genetic studies in this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2050193798,"Converging evidence shows that GD3 ganglioside is a critical effector in a number of apoptotic pathways, and GM1 ganglioside has neuroprotective and noötropic properties. Targeted deletion of GD3 synthase (GD3S) eliminates GD3 and increases GM1 levels. Primary neurons from GD3S−/− mice are resistant to neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-β or hyperhomocysteinemia, and when GD3S is eliminated in the APP/PSEN1 double-transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease the plaque-associated oxidative stress and inflammatory response are absent. To date, no small-molecule inhibitor of GD3S exists. In the present study we used sialidase from Vibrio cholerae (VCS) to produce a brain ganglioside profile that approximates that of GD3S deletion. VCS hydrolyzes GD1a and complex b-series gangliosides to GM1, and the apoptogenic GD3 is degraded. VCS was infused by osmotic minipump into the dorsal third ventricle in mice over a 4-week period. Sensorimotor behaviors, anxiety, and cognition were unaffected in VCS-treated mice. To determine whether VCS was neuroprotective in vivo, we injected kainic acid on the 25th day of infusion to induce status epilepticus. Kainic acid induced a robust lesion of the CA3 hippocampal subfield in aCSF-treated controls. In contrast, all hippocampal regions in VCS-treated mice were largely intact. VCS did not protect against seizures. These results demonstrate that strategic degradation of complex gangliosides and GD3 can be used to achieve neuroprotection without adversely affecting behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2075333417,"Although forgetting is often regarded as a deficit that we need to control to optimize cognitive functioning, it can have beneficial effects in a number of contexts. We examined whether disrupting memory for previous numerical responses would attenuate repetition avoidance (the tendency to avoid repeating the same number) during random number generation and thereby improve the randomness of responses. Low suggestible and low dissociative and high dissociative highly suggestible individuals completed a random number generation task in a control condition, following a posthypnotic amnesia suggestion to forget previous numerical responses, and in a second control condition following the cancellation of the suggestion. High dissociative highly suggestible participants displayed a selective increase in repetitions during posthypnotic amnesia, with equivalent repetition frequency to a random system, whereas the other two groups exhibited repetition avoidance across conditions. Our results demonstrate that temporarily disrupting memory for previous numerical responses improves random number generation."
https://openalex.org/W2009988184,"Acoustic stimuli are often represented in the early auditory pathway as patterns of neural activity synchronized to time-varying features. This phase-locking predominates until the level of the medial geniculate body (MGB), where previous studies have identified two main, largely segregated response types: Stimulus-synchronized responses faithfully preserve the temporal coding from its afferent inputs, and Non-synchronized responses, which are not phase locked to the inputs, represent changes in temporal modulation by a rate code. The cellular mechanisms underlying this transformation from phase-locked to rate code are not well understood. We use a computational model of a MGB thalamocortical neuron to test the hypothesis that these response classes arise from inferior colliculus (IC) excitatory afferents with divergent properties similar to those observed in brain slice studies. Large-conductance inputs exhibiting synaptic depression preserved input synchrony as short as 12.5 ms interclick intervals, while maintaining low firing rates and low-pass filtering responses. By contrast, small-conductance inputs with Mixed plasticity (depression of AMPA-receptor component and facilitation of NMDA-receptor component) desynchronized afferent inputs, generated a click-rate dependent increase in firing rate, and high-pass filtered the inputs. Synaptic inputs with facilitation often permitted band-pass synchrony along with band-pass rate tuning. These responses could be tuned by changes in membrane potential, strength of the NMDA component, and characteristics of synaptic plasticity. These results demonstrate how the same synchronized input spike trains from the inferior colliculus can be transformed into different representations of temporal modulation by divergent synaptic properties."

We develop an evolutionary dynamics model to investigate how network homophily influences the evolution of the pay-it-forward reciprocity. Manipulating the extent to which actors carrying the same behavioral trait are linked in networks, the computer simulation model shows that strong network homophily helps consolidate the adaptive advantage of cooperation, yet introducing some heterophily to the formation of network helps advance cooperation's scale further. Our model enriches the literature of inclusive fitness theory by demonstrating the conditions under which cooperation or reciprocity can be selected for in evolution when social interaction is not confined exclusively to relatives."
https://openalex.org/W2083010242,"Numerous studies indicate a role for the actin cytoskeleton in secretion. Here, we have used evanescent wave and widefield fluorescence microscopy to study the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in secretion from PC12 cells. Secretion was assayed as loss of ANF-EmGFP in widefield mode. Under control conditions, depolarization induced secretion showed two phases: an initial rapid rate of loss of vesicular cargo (tau = 1.4 s), followed by a slower, sustained drop in fluorescence (tau = 34.1 s). Pretreatment with Latrunculin A changed the kinetics to a single exponential, slightly faster than the fast component of control cells (1.2 s). Evanescent wave microscopy allowed us to examine this at the level of individual events, and revealed equivalent changes in the rates of vesicular arrival at the plasma membrane immediately following and during the sustained phase of release. Co-transfection of mCherry labeled β-actin and ANF-EmGFP demonstrated that sites of exocytosis had an inverse relationship with sites of actin enrichment. Disruption of visualized actin at the membrane resulted in the loss of specificity of exocytic site."
https://openalex.org/W2101419752,"Several algorithms have been developed that use amino acid sequences to predict whether or not a protein or a region of a protein is disordered. These algorithms make accurate predictions for disordered regions that are 30 amino acids or longer, but it is unclear whether the predictions can be directly related to the backbone dynamics of individual amino acid residues. The nuclear Overhauser effect between the amide nitrogen and hydrogen (NHNOE) provides an unambiguous measure of backbone dynamics at single residue resolution and is an excellent tool for characterizing the dynamic behavior of disordered proteins. In this report, we show that the NHNOE values for several members of a family of disordered proteins are highly correlated with the output from three popular algorithms used to predict disordered regions from amino acid sequence. This is the first test between an experimental measure of residue specific backbone dynamics and disorder predictions. The results suggest that some disorder predictors can accurately estimate the backbone dynamics of individual amino acids in a long disordered region."
https://openalex.org/W2085639857,"The lifespan of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has increased as a result of effective antiretroviral therapy, and the incidences of the AIDS-defining cancers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma, have declined. Even so, HIV-infected individuals are now at greater risk of other cancers, including Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). To identify candidate biomarkers for the early detection of HL, we undertook an accurate mass and elution time tag proteomics analysis of individual plasma samples from either HIV-infected patients without HL (controls; n = 14) and from HIV-infected patient samples with HL (n = 22). This analysis identified 60 proteins that were statistically (p<0.05) altered and at least 1.5-fold different between the two groups. At least three of these proteins have previously been reported to be altered in the blood of HL patients that were not known to be HIV positive, suggesting that these markers may be broadly useful for detecting HL. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software identified ""inflammatory response"" and ""cancer"" as the top two biological functions associated with these proteins. Overall, this study validated three plasma proteins as candidate biomarkers for detecting HL, and identified 57 novel candidate biomarkers that remain to be validated. The relationship of these novel candidate biomarkers with cancer and inflammation suggests that they are truly associated with HL and therefore may be useful for the early detection of this cancer in susceptible populations."

https://openalex.org/W2094273773,"The study of biological systems dynamics requires elucidation of the transitions of steady states. A “small perturbation” approach can provide important information on the “steady state” of a biological system. In our experiments, small perturbations were generated by applying a series of repeating small doses of ultraviolet radiation to a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. The biological response was assessed by monitoring the gene expression profiles using cDNA microarrays. Repeated small doses (10 J/m2) of ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure modulated the expression profiles of two groups of genes in opposite directions. The genes that were up-regulated have functions mainly associated with anti-proliferation/anti-mitogenesis/apoptosis, and the genes that were down-regulated were mainly related to proliferation/mitogenesis/anti-apoptosis. For both groups of genes, repetition of the small doses of UVB caused an immediate response followed by relaxation between successive small perturbations. This cyclic pattern was suppressed when large doses (233 or 582.5 J/m2) of UVB were applied. Our method and results contribute to a foundation for computational systems biology, which implicitly uses the concept of steady state."

The aim of this study was to assess whether visual cues could reduce the subjective difficulty of segregating a melody from interleaved background notes in normally hearing listeners, those using hearing aids, and those using cochlear implants. Methodology/Principal Findings Normally hearing listeners (N = 20), hearing aid users (N = 10), and cochlear implant users (N = 11) were asked to rate the difficulty of segregating a repeating four-note melody from random interleaved distracter notes. The pitch of the background notes was gradually increased or decreased throughout blocks, providing a range of difficulty from easy (with a large pitch separation between melody and distracter) to impossible (with the melody and distracter completely overlapping). Visual cues were provided on half the blocks, and difficulty ratings for blocks with and without visual cues were compared between groups. Visual cues reduced the subjective difficulty of extracting the melody from the distracter notes for normally hearing listeners and cochlear implant users, but not hearing aid users. Conclusion/Significance Simple visual cues may improve the ability of cochlear implant users to segregate lines of music, thus potentially increasing their enjoyment of music. More research is needed to determine what type of acoustic cues to encode visually in order to optimise the benefits they may provide."
