https://openalex.org/W2963287394,"The distribution and diversity of RNA viruses in fungi is incompletely understood due to the often cryptic nature of mycoviral infections and the focused study of primarily pathogenic and/or economically important fungi. As most viruses that are known to infect fungi possess either single-stranded or double-stranded RNA genomes, transcriptomic data provides the opportunity to query for viruses in diverse fungal samples without any a priori knowledge of virus infection. Here we describe a systematic survey of all transcriptomic datasets from fungi belonging to the subphylum Pezizomycotina. Using a simple but effective computational pipeline that uses reads discarded during normal RNA-seq analyses, followed by identification of a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) motif in de novo assembled contigs, 59 viruses from 44 different fungi were identified. Among the viruses identified, 88% were determined to be new species and 68% are, to our knowledge, the first virus described from the fungal species. Comprehensive analyses of both nucleotide and inferred protein sequences characterize the phylogenetic relationships between these viruses and the known set of mycoviral sequences and support the classification of up to four new families and two new genera. Thus the results provide a deeper understanding of the scope of mycoviral diversity while also increasing the distribution of fungal hosts. Further, this study demonstrates the suitability of analyzing RNA-seq data to facilitate rapid discovery of new viruses."

To be successful, conservation strategies now need to account for geographical patterns in traits sensitive to climate change, as well as climate threats to species-level diversity. As part of an effort to provide such information, we conducted a climate vulnerability assessment that included all anadromous Pacific salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus spp.) population units listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Using an expert-based scoring system, we ranked 20 attributes for the 28 listed units and 5 additional units. Attributes captured biological sensitivity, or the strength of linkages between each listing unit and the present climate; climate exposure, or the magnitude of projected change in local environmental conditions; and adaptive capacity, or the ability to modify phenotypes to cope with new climatic conditions. Each listing unit was then assigned one of four vulnerability categories. Units ranked most vulnerable overall were Chinook (O. tshawytscha) in the California Central Valley, coho (O. kisutch) in California and southern Oregon, sockeye (O. nerka) in the Snake River Basin, and spring-run Chinook in the interior Columbia and Willamette River Basins. We identified units with similar vulnerability profiles using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Life history characteristics, especially freshwater and estuary residence times, interplayed with gradations in exposure from south to north and from coastal to interior regions to generate landscape-level patterns within each species. Nearly all listing units faced high exposures to projected increases in stream temperature, sea surface temperature, and ocean acidification, but other aspects of exposure peaked in particular regions. Anthropogenic factors, especially migration barriers, habitat degradation, and hatchery influence, have reduced the adaptive capacity of most steelhead and salmon populations. Enhancing adaptive capacity is essential to mitigate for the increasing threat of climate change. Collectively, these results provide a framework to support recovery planning that considers climate impacts on the majority of West Coast anadromous salmonids."

In humans, loss–of–function mutations in the MAGT1 gene cause X-linked magnesium deficiency with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and neoplasia (XMEN), a disease that has a broad range of clinical and immunological consequences. We have previously shown that EBV susceptibility in XMEN is associated with defective expression of the antiviral natural-killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) protein and abnormal Mg2+ transport. New evidence suggests that MAGT1 is the human homolog of the yeast OST3/OST6 proteins that form an integral part of the N-linked glycosylation complex, although the exact contributions of these perturbations in the glycosylation pathway to disease pathogenesis are still unknown. Using MS-based glycoproteomics, along with CRISPR/Cas9-KO cell lines, natural killer cell-killing assays, and RNA-Seq experiments, we now demonstrate that humans lacking functional MAGT1 have a selective deficiency in both immune and nonimmune glycoproteins, and we identified several critical glycosylation defects in important immune-response proteins and in the expression of genes involved in immunity, particularly CD28. We show that MAGT1 function is partly interchangeable with that of the paralog protein tumor-suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3) but that each protein has a different tissue distribution in humans. We observed that MAGT1-dependent glycosylation is sensitive to Mg2+ levels and that reduced Mg2+ impairs immune-cell function via the loss of specific glycoproteins. Our findings reveal that defects in protein glycosylation and gene expression underlie immune defects in an inherited disease due to MAGT1 deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2963910832,"Purpose The main aim of this investigation was to quantify differences in sprint mechanical variables across sports and within each sport. Secondary aims were to quantify sex differences and relationships among the variables. Methods In this cross-sectional study of elite athletes, 235 women (23 ± 5 y and 65 ± 7 kg) and 431 men (23 ± 4 y and 80 ± 12 kg) from 23 different sports (including 128 medalists from World Championships and/or Olympic Games) were tested in a 40-m sprint at the Norwegian Olympic Training Center between 1995 and 2018. These were pre-existing data from quarterly or semi-annual testing that the athletes performed for training purposes. Anthropometric and speed-time sprint data were used to calculate the theoretical maximal velocity, horizontal force, horizontal power, slope of the force-velocity relationship, maximal ratio of force, and index of force application technique. Results Substantial differences in mechanical profiles were observed across sports. Athletes in sports in which sprinting ability is an important predictor of success (e.g., athletics sprinting, jumping and bobsleigh) produced the highest values for most variables, whereas athletes in sports in which sprinting ability is not as important tended to produce substantially lower values. The sex differences ranged from small to large, depending on variable of interest. Although most of the variables were strongly associated with 10- and 40-m sprint time, considerable individual differences in sprint mechanical variables were observed among equally performing athletes. Conclusions Our data from a large sample of elite athletes tested under identical conditions provides a holistic picture of the force-velocity-power profile continuum in athletes. The data indicate that sprint mechanical variables are more individual than sport specific. The values presented in this study could be used by coaches to develop interventions that optimize the training stimulus to the individual athlete."

We have employed multiplexed stable isotope-resolved metabolomics to track the metabolism of [13C6]glucose, D2-glycine, [13C2]glycine, and D3-serine into purine nucleotides in freshly resected cancerous and matched noncancerous lung tissues from nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and we compared the metabolism with established NSCLC PC9 and A549 cell lines in vitro. Surprisingly, [13C6]glucose was the best carbon source for purine synthesis in human NSCLC tissues, in contrast to the noncancerous lung tissues from the same patient, which showed lower mitotic indices and MYC expression. We also observed that D3-Ser was preferentially incorporated into purine rings over D2-glycine in both tissues and cell lines. MYC suppression attenuated [13C6]glucose, D3-serine, and [13C2]glycine incorporation into purines and reduced proliferation in PC9 but not in A549 cells. Using detailed kinetic modeling, we showed that the preferred use of glucose as a carbon source for purine ring synthesis in NSCLC tissues involves cytoplasmic activation/compartmentation of the glucose–to–serine pathway and enhanced reversed one-carbon fluxes that attenuate exogenous serine incorporation into purines. Our findings also indicate that the substrate for de novo nucleotide synthesis differs profoundly between cancer cell lines and fresh human lung cancer tissues; the latter preferred glucose to exogenous serine or glycine but not the former. This distinction in substrate utilization in purine synthesis in human cancer tissues should be considered when targeting one-carbon metabolism for cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2963887377,"Coffee is a crop of significant importance for Brazilian agrobusiness. There is evidence that both the geographic distribution of coffee production, and the varieties of coffee produced, have changed throughout Brazil over the course of time. Furthermore, it appears that these developments are associated with structural changes resulting from reductions in government intervention and its effects on prices in the coffee market, which has established a new dynamic of coffee production in the country. In this context, this study's objective is to analyze the dynamics of coffee production in Brazil, to identify the Brazilian micro-regions specializing in coffee activities, and to track how the spatial distribution of these micro-regions has varied over time. In so doing, the study aims to identify defining economic characteristics of primary coffee-producing regions. Drawing primarily on data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the study proceeds by applying Pearson correlation, Granger causality test, location quotient, principal components, and clustering analyses to explore how, during the 1984-2015 period, significant changes occurred in the distribution of regions specializing in coffee production. States such as Paraná and São Paulo, historically important coffee producers, declined in importance, leaving only a few micro-regions in these states specialized in coffee production. During the 2014/15 biennium, 80% of the coffee-specialized micro-regions were concentrated in the states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Rondônia, and Espírito Santo. Minas Gerais and Bahia primarily produced arabica coffee, while Rondônia specialized in conilon (robusta) coffee. Overall, coffee produced in Brazil improved in quality and value-added over this period."

Using a large sample of respondents aged 50 and older from 16 European countries, we identify the associations of well-being and mental health with family status. Making use of detailed social network data of the respondents, we also identify how different social support networks correlate with the well-being and health indicators. We observe positive associations for all network types, over and beyond any direct associations of family status with well-being. Results suggest that non-residential children are important providers of social support for their parents at older age."
https://openalex.org/W2963332926,"The human microbiota plays a central role in human physiology. This complex ecosystem is a promising but untapped source of bioactive compounds and antibiotics that are critical for its homeostasis. However, we still have a very limited knowledge of its metabolic and biosynthetic capabilities. Here we investigated an enigmatic biosynthetic gene cluster identified previously in the human gut symbiont Ruminococcus gnavus. This gene cluster which encodes notably for peptide precursors and putative radical SAM enzymes, has been proposed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of ruminococcin C (RumC), a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) with potent activity against the human pathogen Clostridium perfringens. By combining in vivo and in vitro approaches, including recombinant expression and purification of the respective peptides and proteins, enzymatic assays, and LC-MS analyses, we determined that RumC is a sulfur-to–α-carbon thioether-containing peptide (sactipeptide) with an unusual architecture. Moreover, our results support that formation of the thioether bridges follows a processive order, providing mechanistic insights into how radical SAM (AdoMet) enzymes install posttranslational modifications in RiPPs. We also found that the presence of thioether bridges and removal of the leader peptide are required for RumC's antimicrobial activity. In summary, our findings provide evidence that production of the anti-Clostridium peptide RumC depends on an R. gnavus operon encoding five potential RumC precursor peptides and two radical SAM enzymes, uncover key RumC structural features, and delineate the sequence of posttranslational modifications leading to its formation and antimicrobial activity.

Despite its growing importance in biology, study of the human microbiome remains a challenging area of investigation. Recently, it has emerged that environmental rather than genetic factors play a major role in shaping this complex ecosystem, one of the densest on earth (1Rothschild D. Weissbrod O. Barkan E.

Among the molecular determinants underpinning the normal equilibrium within the microbiota (eubiosis), it has been predicted that antimicrobial substances should play a central role (2Balskus E.P.

RumA has been shown to be a RiPP containing three lanthionine bridges (i.e. three β-thioether bonds) and, thus, to belong to the large class of lanthipeptides (13Ongey E.L. Giessmann R.T. Fons M.

Some lanthipeptides, such as nisin, exert their antimicrobial activity by binding to lipid II (15Scherer K.M. Spille J.H. Sahl H.G. Grein F. Kubitscheck U.

However, for the vast majority of them, we still have limited knowledge of their mode of action. Lanthionine bridges are installed by a two-step mechanism involving dehydration of a Ser or Thr residue followed by stereoselective intramolecular Michael addition of the thiol group of a remote Cys residue.

For heterologous expression of RumC, we selected c1 and c2, as these two genes have been shown to be highly induced in R. gnavus when this bacterium colonizes the digestive tract of rats (11Pujol A.

In addition, both genes are cotranscribed with the mc1 and mc2 genes, coding for the respective radical SAM enzymes MC1 and MC2 (Fig. 1A). We expressed C1 and C2 as His tag fusion peptides with a tobacco etch virus cleavage site to perform their expression in E. coli and purification by affinity chromatography. As shown, the C1 peptide had a mass of [M+7H]7+ 915.01, compared with its theoretical mass of [M+7H]7+ 915.58 (Fig. 1C and Table S1). This mass shift of −0.57 Da corresponds, when taking into account the charge of the ion (7+), to a Δm of −4.03 Da, supporting the loss of four H atoms. In addition, the characteristic ions b21, b57 (−4 Da), b58 (−4 Da), and b59 (−4 Da), obtained during LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1E and Table S2), were consistent with the formation of two disulfide bridges between the four cysteine residues present within the peptide sequence. Similarly, after purification, the C2 peptide was mainly under an oxidized form ([M+7H]7+obs 918.59), although low amounts of the linear form ([M+7H]7+obs 919.16) were in evidence (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3 and Table S2). The fragmentation pattern of the C2 peptide was essentially identical to the one of the C1 peptide (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3). In addition, the fragments y44 (−4 Da) and y18 allowed us to precisely pinpoint the mass loss on the region containing the four conserved cysteine residues. Finally, no b or y ions from the cysteine-rich domain were present in the MS spectrum, confirming the formation of internal disulfide bridges. Thus, when expressed in E. coli, both peptides were essentially purified under an oxidized form with two disulfide bridges. When we coexpressed the C1 and C2 peptides with their cognate radical SAM enzymes (MC1 and MC2, respectively), we obtained two novel peptides, hereafter referred to as C1MC1 and C2MC2. After purification by Ni-NTA chromatography and treatment with tobacco etch virus protease, both C1MC1 and C2MC2 were essentially pure and copurified with the radical SAM enzyme MC1 or MC2 (Figs. 1D and 2A). The C1MC1 peptide had a mass of [M+7H]7+obs 914.44 (Fig. 1D and Table S1), indicating a mass loss of Δm = −8.06 Da compared with the expected mass of the C1 peptide. In addition, LC-MS/MS analysis of the C1MC1 peptide revealed a distinct fragmentation pattern compared with the C1 peptide, with many b and y ions scattered in the C1MC1 spectrum (Fig. 1E). Mass shifts of Δm = −2.01 Da, −4.02 Da, −6.04 Da, and −8.06 Da were measured on the fragments y3, b53, y29, and y33, respectively (Fig. 1E and Table S2), pointing to Ala31, Asn35, Arg53, and Lys61 as modified residues. Despite the low amounts obtained, LC-MS/MS analysis of C2MC2 (Fig. 2B) exhibited the same characteristic fragments than those observed for C1MC1. The additional b and y ions b31, b35 (−2 Da), y29 (−6 Da), y28 (−4 Da), y11 (−4 Da), y3 (−2 Da), and y2 allowed us to accurately pinpoint Glu31, Asn35, Arg53, and Arg61 as modified residues in the C2MC2 peptide, (Fig. 2B and Table S2). Cα-thioether bridges are well-known to undergo facile retroelimination and tautomerization during LC-MS/MS analysis, leading to the formation of α,β-dehydro-amino acids, characterized by a mass loss of Δm = −2.01 Da (Fig. 2C). In addition, the new amide bonds formed are extremely labile at low voltage, leading to easy breakage and mapping by LC-MS/MS (26Hudson G.A. Burkhart B.J. DiCaprio A.J. Schwalen C. Kille B.

Collectively, our data thus establish that C1MC1 and C2MC2 contain four α-thioether bridges involving Ala31, Asn35, Arg53, and Lys61 in C1MC1 or Glu31, Asn35, Arg53, and Arg61 in C2MC2. The fact that only a low amount of the C2 peptide was modified when coexpressed with MC2 was intriguing (Fig. 2A), considering that C1 was fully matured when coexpressed with MC1 (Fig. 1D) and the high sequence identity between the two enzymes and peptides. To distinguish between a peptide and an enzyme issue, we coexpressed C1 with MC2 or C2 with MC1 in E. coli (Fig. 2D). As shown, MC1 was not able to modify C2 in vivo, whereas MC2 was active toward C1, albeit with a lower efficiency than MC1 (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the C1MC2 peptide had the same spectroscopic signature than the C1MC1 peptide, supporting that both peptides contain the same posttranslational modifications. Altogether, these data support that both MC1 and MC2 install the same posttranslational modifications and that the low amount of modified C2 peptide produced (i.e. C2MC2 and C2MC1), is mainly due to its sequence. To determine the connectivity between the α-positions of the four target residues (i.e. Ala31, Asn35, Arg53, and Lys61 in C1 or Glu31, Asn35, Arg53, and Arg61 in C2) and the four cysteine residues (i.e. Cys22, Cys24, Cys41, and Cys45), we devised an in vitro strategy. As shown above, C2 was efficiently produced without modification in E. coli and was thus a suitable source of substrate for in vitro experiments. In addition, we generated the three cysteine variants C2A22A24, C2A41A45, and C2A24, in which the corresponding cysteine residues Cys22 and Cys24, Cys41 and Cys45, and Cys24 were replaced with alanine residues, respectively (Fig. 3). As shown, after purification, the C2A22A24 variant had a mass of [M+6H]6+obs 1061.20, indicating the formation of one disulfide bridge (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4). After incubation with MC2, the peptide mass shifted to [M+6H]6+obs 1060.86 (Δm = −4.02 Da), consistent with the formation of two thioether bridges. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that only the residues Arg53 and Arg61 were modified (Fig. 3A, right panel, and Table S3), supporting that both residues are linked to Cys41 and Cys45. Incubation of the C2A41A45 variant with MC2 led to a mass shift from [M+6H]6+obs 1061.20 (oxidized form) to 1060.86 (Δm = −4.02 Da) (Fig. 3B, left panel) consistent with the formation of two thioether bridges. LC-MS/MS analysis located dehydrogenation on Glu31 and Asn35, supporting that both residues were linked to Cys22 and Cys24 (Table S3).

When we assayed the C2A24 variant, its mass shifted from [M+6H]6+obs 1066.53 (oxidized form) to 1065.86, consistent with the formation of three thioether bridges. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that these three thioether bridges involved Arg53, Arg61, and likely Glu31 but not Asn35 (Fig. 3C and Table S4), supporting that Glu31 was connected to Cys22. We failed to express a fourth variant in which Cys22 was replaced with an alanine residue (i.e. the C2A22 peptide). However, we succeeded to obtain small amounts of the corresponding C1 mutant (i.e. the C1A22 peptide) coexpressed with MC1. Surprisingly, with this variant, LC-MS/MS analysis was consistent with the formation of a thioether bridge between Cys24 and Ala31 (Fig. S5 and Table S4). This last result supports that, in the absence of the target cysteine residue, thioether bridges might form with a nearby cysteine residue. To accurately determine the connectivity of the thioether bridges, we designed, based on the C2 sequence, shorter peptide substrates containing either the first (i.e. residues 1–40, C21–40) or the second hairpin domain (i.e. residues 28–63, C228–63) and assayed them with MC2 in vitro. The C21–40 peptide proved to be an extremely poor substrate and was not amenable to LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the C228–63 peptide was efficiently converted by MC2, as shown by disappearance of the linear ([M+4H]4+obs 926.95) and oxidized ([M+4H]4+obs 926.45) forms during reaction and concomitant production of a novel peptide ([M+4H]4+obs 925.95) (Fig. 4A and Table S1). LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the formation of two thioether bridges located on Arg53 and Arg61 (numbered as in the C2 sequence), a result in agreement with the ones obtained with the full-length-peptide (Fig. 2 and Table S5). When we replaced Cys41 with an alanine residue, incubation of the C228–63A41 variant with MC2 led to a product containing a single thioether bridge between Cys45 and Arg53 (Fig. 4B). Intriguingly, the C228–63A45 variant did not lead to formation of any product when incubated with MC2 (Fig. 4C). Similarly, no product was obtained with the double mutant C228–63A41A45. These results support a sequential order for formation of the thioether bridges, with the Cys45-Arg53 bridge being required first before formation of the Cys41-Arg61 bridge could take place. To get better knowledge regarding the sequential formation of the thioether bridges and the structure of RumC2, we performed a kinetics analysis by LC-MS/MS. Using an optimized gradient and short reaction times, we were able to identify and characterize several C2 reaction intermediates (Fig. 5A). As shown, shortly after the reaction was initiated by addition of sodium dithionite, the substrate that existed under two forms, species A (linear form, [M+7H]7+obs 919.16) and A′ (oxidized form, [M+7H]7+obs 918.58), was converted into two novel species: B ([M+7H]7+obs 918.58) and C ([M+7H]7+obs 918.58). Species B and C were characterized as reaction intermediates containing two thioether bridges involving Glu31 and Arg53 (Fig. 5B) and Glu31 and Asn35 (Fig. 5C), respectively. After 60 min, species A and A′ had almost totally disappeared, whereas the main species, E ([M+7H]7+obs 918.01), was identified as the mature C2MC2 with four thioether bridges (Fig. 5D). The transient species D could not be unambiguously assigned, but LC-MS/MS analysis was consistent with a reaction intermediate containing three thioether bridges en route to conversion into species E. Collectively, these experiments allowed us to propose a model for formation of the thioether bridges"
https://openalex.org/W2962801728,"Neointimal lesion and medial wall thickness of pulmonary arteries (PAs) are common pathological findings in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling contribute to intimal and medial vascular remodeling in PAH. Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor whose targets include PDGF and FGF receptors. Although the beneficial effects of nintedanib were demonstrated for human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, its efficacy for PAH is still unclear. Thus, we hypothesized that nintedanib is a novel treatment for PAH to inhibit the progression of vascular remodeling in PAs. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of nintedanib both in endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT)-induced human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) and human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) stimulated by growth factors. We also tested the effect of chronic nintedanib administration on a PAH rat model induced by Sugen5416 (a VEGF receptor inhibitor) combined with chronic hypoxia. Nintedanib was administered from weeks 3 to 5 after Sugen5416 injection, and we evaluated pulmonary hemodynamics and PAs pathology. Nintedanib attenuated the expression of mesenchymal markers in EndMT-induced HPMVECs and HPASMCs proliferation. Phosphorylation of PDGF and FGF receptors was augmented in both intimal and medial lesions of PAs. Nintedanib blocked these phosphorylation, improved hemodynamics and reduced vascular remodeling involving neointimal lesions and medial wall thickening in PAs. Additionally, expressions Twist1, transcription factors associated with EndMT, in lung tissue was significantly reduced by nintedanib. These results suggest that nintedanib may be a novel treatment for PAH with anti-vascular remodeling effects."
https://openalex.org/W2963299042,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus, can regulate the antiviral response of NF-κB signaling, which is critical for cell survival, growth transformation, and virus latency. Here, we showed that tegument protein BGLF2 could inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity. BGLF2 was shown to interplay with the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50, and the Rel homology domain of p65 was the pivotal region to interact with BGLF2. Nonetheless, BGLF2 did not influence the development of p65-p50 dimerization. Yet, overexpression of BGLF2 inhibited the phosphorylation of p65 Ser536 (but not Ser276) and blocked the nuclear translocation of p65. In addition, knockdown of BGLF2 during EBV lytic replication elevated NF-κB activity and the phosphorylation of p65 Ser536. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of NF-κB activation may serve as a strategy to escape the host's antiviral innate immunity to EBV during its lytic infection.-Chen, T., Wang, Y., Xu, Z., Zou, X., Wang, P., Ou, X., Li, Y., Peng, T., Chen, D., Li, M., Cai, M.

https://openalex.org/W2963957653,"Oral and fecal microbial biomarkers have previously been associated with cardiometabolic (CM) risk, however, no comprehensive attempt has been made to explore this association in minority populations or across different geographic regions. We characterized gut- and oral-associated microbiota and CM risk in 655 participants of African-origin, aged 25–45, from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, and the United States (US). CM risk was classified using the CM risk cut-points for elevated waist circumference, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasted blood glucose, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and elevated triglycerides. Gut-associated bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with elevated blood pressure and elevated fasted blood glucose. Similarly, gut bacterial beta diversity was also significantly differentiated by waist circumference, blood pressure, triglyceridemia and HDL-cholesterolemia. Notably, differences in inter- and intra-personal gut microbial diversity were geographic-region specific. Participants meeting the cut-points for 3 out of the 5 CM risk factors were significantly more enriched with Lachnospiraceae, and were significantly depleted of Clostridiaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Prevotella. The predicted relative proportions of the genes involved in the pathways for lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and butyrate synthesis were also significantly differentiated by the CM risk phenotype, whereby genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine, glutarate and 4-aminobutyrate/succinate pathways and LPS synthesis pathway were enriched in participants with greater CM risk. Furthermore, inter-individual oral microbiota diversity was also significantly associated with the CM risk factors, and oral-associated Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella were enriched in participants with 3 out of the 5 CM risk factors. We demonstrate that in a diverse cohort of African-origin adults, CM risk is significantly associated with reduced microbial diversity, and the enrichment of specific bacterial taxa and predicted functional traits in both gut and oral environments. As well as providing new insights into the associations between the gut and oral microbiota and CM risk, this study also highlights the potential for novel therapeutic discoveries which target the oral and gut microbiota in CM risk."

To answer these questions, we conducted a field experiment on employer discrimination in Sweden. Going beyond existing work, we test for a large range of applicant characteristics using a factorial design. We examine whether migrants can affect their employment chances—by adopting citizenship, acquiring work experience, or signaling religious practice—or whether fixed traits such as country of birth or gender are more consequential. We find little systematic evidence that immigrants can do much to reduce discrimination. Rather, ethnic hierarchies are critical: callback rates decline precipitously with the degree of ethno-cultural distance, leaving Iraqis and Somalis, especially if they are male, with much reduced employment chances. These findings highlight that immigrants have few tools at their disposal to escape ethnic penalties and that efforts to reduce discrimination must address employer prejudice."

We assessed the relationship between self-reported visual impairment (VI) and glaucoma versus seniors’ social participation. Methods Data from individuals aged ≥65 years responding to the Canadian Community Health Survey Healthy Aging 2008/2009 (n = 16,369) was analyzed. Participation in eight social activities by seniors with and without self-reported VI or glaucoma was compared. Results Seniors with VI had significantly reduced participation (p<0.05) in sports/physical activities (18.0% vs. 33.6%), family/friendship activities outside the household (39.7% vs. 53.0%), service club/fraternal organization activities (11.4% vs. 18.4%), volunteer/charity work (13.4% vs. 24.9%), educational/cultural activities (16.2% vs. 24.5%), and other social recreational activities (21.6% vs. 31.0%) compared to those without VI. Differences in participation in church/religious activities (40.6% vs. 44.5%) and community/professional association activities (15.3% vs. 18.0%) were non-significant between seniors with and without VI. Seniors with glaucoma versus those without had significantly reduced participation (p<0.05) in family/friendship activities (46.6% vs. 52.9%), sports/physical activities (26.0% vs. 33.6%) and volunteer/charity work (20.4% vs. 24.9%). No participation in any social activity was significantly higher among seniors with VI versus those without (10.1% vs. 2.9%, p<0.05), but was similar among seniors with and without glaucoma (3.9% vs. 3.1%, p>0.05). After adjusting for the effects of age, sex, education, household income, ethnicity, job status and chronic diseases (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 3.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0–5.8), seniors with VI but no glaucoma were more likely not to engage in any social activities compared to seniors without VI and no glaucoma. Seniors with glaucoma but without VI had a similar level of non-participation (aOR = 0.9, 95%% CI 0.5–1.7). Conclusions Significantly reduced social participation was found across six community activities among seniors with self-reported VI and in three activities among those with self-reported glaucoma. Policies and programs that help seniors with VI or glaucoma engage in social activities are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2963956255,"Background Emergency medical service (EMS) can be a burdensome occupational field, and employees can be confronted with traumatizing events. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression rates among paramedics are considered higher than those in the general population. In the German setting of a physician-based EMS system, the literature provides little data on PTSD or non-PTSD-related mental health or on the correlation between PTSD and well-being. Methods The study collected data through a nationwide cross-sectional questionnaire survey of the German EMS. Next to gathering sociodemographic data, it used the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Short Screening Scale for the DSM-IV-PTSD to assess well-being and identify indicators of depression and PTSD. Results A total of 2,731 paramedics and emergency physicians participated in the survey; 2,684 questionnaires were submitted to analysis. The average WHO-5 score was 53.15%. A total of 43.4% of participants screened positive for possible depression, as indicated by a WHO-5 score below 50%. Female gender, older age, higher total years spent working in EMS and increased body mass index were significantly correlated with lower well-being. A total of 5.4% of respondents had a positive PTSD screening result. In particular, older employees were significantly more likely to test positive for PTSD (12.2% of those over 50 years, compared to 2.8% of those under 30 years). Positive PTSD screening results were associated with significantly lower well-being. Over an average period of 1 year, the paramedics reported perceiving a median of 2 emergency missions as mentally distressing. Conclusion Low well-being and PTSD seem to be relevant experiences among German EMS despite their perception of low numbers of emergency responses as mentally distressing. Paramedics who have been diagnosed with PTSD should be investigated for depression and vice versa, as correlations in both directions exist. Special attention should be paid to older employees, who have significantly lower well-being and higher PTSD rates compared to younger employees."
https://openalex.org/W2962899007,"Junctophilins (JPH1–JPH4) are expressed in excitable and nonexcitable cells, where they tether endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) and plasma membranes (PM). These ER/SR–PM junctions bring Ca-release channels in the ER/SR and Ca as well as Ca-activated K channels in the PM to within 10–25 nm. Such proximity is critical for excitation–contraction coupling in muscles, Ca modulation of excitability in neurons, and Ca homeostasis in nonexcitable cells. JPHs are anchored in the ER/SR through the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). Their N-terminal Membrane-Occupation-Recognition-Nexus (MORN) motifs can bind phospholipids. Whether MORN motifs alone are sufficient to stabilize JPH–PM binding is not clear. We investigate whether S-palmitoylation of cysteine (Cys), a critical mechanism controlling peripheral protein binding to PM, occurs in JPHs. We focus on JPH2 that has four Cys residues: three flanking the MORN motifs and one in the TMD. Using palmitate–alkyne labeling, Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction with azide-conjugated biotin, immunoblotting, proximity–ligation–amplification, and various imaging techniques, we show that JPH2 is S-palmitoylatable, and palmitoylation is essential for its ER/SR–PM tether function. Palmitoylated JPH2 binds to lipid–raft domains in PM, whereas palmitoylation of TMD-located Cys stabilizes JPH2's anchor in the ER/SR membrane. Binding to lipid–raft domains protects JPH2 from depalmitoylation. Unpalmitoylated JPH2 is largely excluded from lipid rafts and loses the ability to form stable ER/SR–PM junctions. In adult ventricular myocytes, native JPH2 is S-palmitoylatable, and palmitoylated JPH2 forms distinct PM puncta. Sequence alignment reveals that the palmitoylatable Cys residues in JPH2 are conserved in other JPHs, suggesting that palmitoylation may also enhance ER/SR–PM tethering by these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2962854624,"Oncodriver genes are usually identified when mutations recur in multiple tumours. Different drivers often converge in the activation or repression of key cancer-relevant pathways. However, as many pathways contain multiple members of the same gene family, individual mutations might be overlooked, as each family member would necessarily have a lower mutation frequency and thus not identified as significant in any one-gene-at-a-time analysis. Here, we looked for mutated, functional sequence positions in gene families that were mutually exclusive (in patients) with another gene in the same pathway, which identified both known and new candidate oncodrivers. For instance, many inactivating mutations in multiple G-protein (particularly Gi/o) coupled receptors, are mutually exclusive with Gαs oncogenic activating mutations, both of which ultimately enhance cAMP signalling. By integrating transcriptomics and interaction data, we show that the Gs pathway is upregulated in multiple cancer types, even those lacking known GNAS activating mutations. This suggests that cancer cells may develop alternative strategies to activate adenylate cyclase signalling in multiple cancer types. Our study provides a mechanistic interpretation for several rare somatic mutations in multi-gene oncodrivers, and offers possible explanations for known and potential off-label cancer treatments, suggesting new therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2963549358,"Peri-urban lakes increasingly experience intensified anthropogenic impacts as watershed uses and developments increase. Cultus Lake is an oligo-mesotrophic, peri-urban lake near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada that experiences significant seasonal tourism, anthropogenic nutrient loadings, and associated cultural eutrophication. Left unabated, these cumulative stresses threaten the critical habitat and persistence of two endemic species at risk (Coastrange Sculpin, Cultus population; Cultus Lake sockeye salmon) and diverse lake-derived ecosystem services. We constructed water and nutrient budgets for the Cultus Lake watershed to identify and quantify major sources and loadings of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). A steady-state water quality model, calibrated against current loadings and limnological data, was used to reconstruct the historic lake trophic status and explore limnological changes in response to realistic development and mitigation scenarios. Significant local P loadings to Cultus Lake arise from septic leaching (19%) and migratory gull guano deposition (22%). Watershed runoff contributes the majority of total P (53%) and N (73%) loads to Cultus Lake, with substantial local N contributions arising from the agricultural Columbia Valley (41% of total N load). However, we estimate that up to 66% of N and 70% of P in watershed runoff is ultimately sourced via deposition from the nutrient-contaminated regional airshed, with direct atmospheric deposition on the lake surface contributing an additional 17% of N and 5% of P. Thus, atmospheric deposition is the largest single source of nutrient loading to Cultus Lake, cumulatively responsible for 63% and 42% of total N and P loadings, respectively. Modeled future loading scenarios suggest Cultus Lake could become mesotrophic within the next 25 years, highlighting a heightened need for near-term abatement of P loads. Although mitigating P loads from local watershed sources will slow the rate of eutrophication, management efforts targeting reductions in atmospheric-P within the regional airshed are necessary to halt or reverse lake eutrophication, and conserve both critical habitat for imperiled species at risk and lake-derived ecosystem services."

Using molecular analyses we investigated the species composition, diversity, distribution, and relative frequencies of the genus Ulva along the entire coast of Jeju Island, off the southern tip of Korea. Species identification was performed for 215 samples collected from 23 sites, based on comprehensive phylogenetic and model-based species delimitation analyses using the sequences of two molecular markers, chloroplast elongation factor Tu (tufA) and nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). We identified 193 specimens as nine Ulva species, 14 specimens as Blidingia spp., and eight samples undetermined, based on the combined analysis of tufA and ITS phylogenies. Two model-based approaches generally supported nine groups of Ulva species. Previously documented species complex, such as U. ohnoi-U. spinulosa and U. procera-U. linza showed discordant relationships between the two phylogenies. The occurrence of U. torta on Jeju Island was first observed, despite its existence on the mainland previously reported. Ulva australis [16 of 23 sites; 34.4% (relative frequency)], U. ohnoi (16; 21.9%), and U. procera (11; 14%) were found to be the predominant species. Our study highlights that molecular analysis is critical for species delimitation in the genus Ulva and provides fundamental information for an understanding of green-tide assemblages on the ""biological hotspot"" coastal ecosystem, Jeju Island in Korea. This study will also help to monitor and manage local green tides at the areas that are currently encountering rapid climate changes."
https://openalex.org/W2962733150,"Eukaryotic cells have developed sophisticated mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the genome and prevent the transmission of altered genetic information to daughter cells. If this control system fails, accumulation of mutations would increase risk of diseases such as cancer. Ubiquitylation, an essential process for protein degradation and signal transduction, is critical for ensuring genome integrity as well as almost all cellular functions. Here, we investigated the role of the SKP1-Cullin-1-F-box protein (SCF)-[F-box and tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7)] ubiquitin ligase in cell proliferation by searching for targets implicated in this process. We identified a hitherto-unknown FBXW7-interacting protein, p53, which is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 at serine 33 and then ubiquitylated by SCF(FBXW7) and degraded. This ubiquitylation is carried out in normally growing cells but primarily after DNA damage. Specifically, we found that SCF(FBXW7)-specific targeting of p53 is crucial for the recovery of cell proliferation after UV-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, we observed that amplification of FBXW7 in wild-type p53 tumors reduced the survival of patients with breast cancer. These results provide a rationale for using SCF(FBXW7) inhibitors in the treatment of this subset of tumors.-Galindo-Moreno, M., Giráldez, S., Limón-Mortés, M. C., Belmonte-Fernández, A., Reed, S.

However, there is a lack of studies of the ceRNA network in diabetic nephropathy (DN). In this study, we investigated the effect of lncRNAs on mesangial cell (MC) proliferation in DN-related ceRNA networks. Differences in lncRNA and mRNA expression between DN and normal mouse kidney tissues were detected with RNA-seq, and DN-related lncRNA/mRNA/microRNA (miRNA) ceRNA networks were constructed by R3.4.3. Computational analysis was performed, and expression and interactions between the topological RNAs were detected by bioinformatics methods, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and luciferase assay. Cell proliferation ability was measured by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) in MCs cultured under high- or low-glucose conditions. Moreover, the effect of the topological key lncRNA histocompatibility 2 K region locus 2 (H2k2) H2k2 on MC proliferation via the miRNA (miR)-449a/b/triplet motif 11 (Trim11)/Mek signaling pathway was examined by EdU, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blot. In total, 153 lncRNAs, 428 mRNAs, and 2242 interactions were included in the constructed DN-related ceRNA network. There were 15 RNAs in the top 5% of degree and betweenness. The expression of lncRNA H2k2 and mRNA Trim11 in MCs was increased in DN, which is consistent with the results of RNA-seq and real-time qPCR invivo and in vitro. miR-449a and miR-449b, which were down-regulated in MCs cultured with high glucose, were selected for further analysis. The results of real-time qPCR and luciferase assay revealed the lncRNA H2k2-miR-449a/b-Trim11 interaction in MCs. In addition, the data showed that H2k2 regulates MC proliferation via the miR-449ab/Trim11/Mek signaling pathway. Taken together, these results provide new insight into the association between the topological key lncRNA H2k2 in the DN-related ceRNA network and the miR-449a/b/Trim11/Mek signaling pathway during MC proliferation in DN.-Chen, W., Peng, R., Sun, Y., Liu, H., Zhang, L., Peng, H., Zhang, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2963770509,"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disorder associated with lung microbiome dysbiosis. Although the upper airway microbiome is the source of the lung microbiome, the relationships between the oral, nasal, and sputum microbiota are incompletely understood. Our objective was to determine features that differentiate the oral, nasal, and sputum microbiome among subjects with stable COPD. Methods We recruited 15 current or former smokers to provide oral and sputum samples on day 1. On day 2, another oral sample and a nasal sample were obtained. Each sample and control underwent DNA extraction, 16S V4 rRNA amplification, 16S V4 sequencing, and qPCR of 16S rRNA. Data were analyzed using dada2 and R. Results Most (14 of 15) subjects were male with a mean age of 65.2. One subject had no pulmonary obstruction, while 5 had mild COPD, 7 had moderate COPD, and 2 had severe COPD. Three subjects (20%) were current tobacco users and 2 subjects (13%) used inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Subjects had a mean of 49.1 pack-years of tobacco exposure. Bacterial biomass was associated with anatomic site, but no differences in biomass were observed with age, FEV1 percent predicted (FEV1pp), ICS use, smoking status, or edentulous state. Shannon index was associated with site (lower nasal diversity than oral and sputum diversity, p<0.001), but not age, ICS use, FEV1pp, tobacco use, or edentulous state. β-diversity was illustrated by principal coordinate analysis using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and PERMANOVA analyses, showing sample clustering by anatomic site (p = 0.001) with nasal samples forming a cluster separate from the combined oral wash samples and sputum samples. Clustering was also observed with ICS use (p = 0.029) and edentulous state (p = 0.019), while FEV1pp and current tobacco use were not significant. In an amplicon sequencing variant (ASV)-level analysis of oral samples using a linear regression model with Benjamini-Hochberg correction at an FDR<0.10, 10 ASVs were associated with age while no ASVs were associated with FEV1pp or smoking status. Sputum sample analysis demonstrated that 51 ASVs (25 unique genera) were associated with age, 61 ASVs (32 genera) were associated with FEV1pp, and no ASVs were associated with smoking status. In a combined dataset, the frequent exacerbator phenotype, rather than ICS use, was associated with decreased sputum Shannon diversity. Conclusions Among the upper airway microbiota of COPD subjects, anatomic site was associated with bacterial biomass, Shannon diversity, and β-diversity. ICS use and edentulous state were both associated with β-diversity. Age was associated with taxa relative abundance in oral and sputum samples, while FEV1pp was associated with taxa relative abundance in sputum samples only."
https://openalex.org/W2964136162,"A fraction of sperm deposited at mating or insemination reaches the oviduct isthmus, where sperm are retained and thereby form a reservoir. This reservoir delays capacitation, prevents polyspermy, selects a fertile population of sperm, and, foremost, increases sperm lifespan. The molecular interactions underlying the formation of a sperm reservoir are becoming clearer in mammals. Sperm lectins bind to oviductal glycans to form the reservoir. Herein, we found that the highest percentage of bovine sperm bound to the 3′-O-sulfated form of Lewis A (suLeA) trisaccharide and sialylated Lewis A and that fluoresceinated versions of each localized to receptors on the anterior head of the sperm. Following capacitation, binding to suLeA decreased significantly, a potential explanation for sperm release from the reservoir. MS and immunohistochemistry analyses indicated that suLeA motifs were present predominantly on O-linked glycans initiated by GalNAc residues, but no sialylated Lewis A was detected. To determine whether sperm binding to isolated suLeA in vitro could mimic in vivo sperm binding to oviduct cells and increase sperm longevity, we immobilized suLeA and incubated it with sperm. Using free-swimming sperm and sperm bound to immobilized laminin as controls, we observed that over 96 h, the viability of free-swimming sperm decreased to 10%, and that of sperm bound to immobilized laminin decreased to about 50%, whereas viability of sperm bound to immobilized suLeA was highest throughout the incubation and 60% at 96 h. These results indicate that bovine sperm binding to oviduct suLeA retains sperm for reservoir formation and extends sperm lifespan."

However, a comprehensive understanding of barriers and facilitators to employment from a multidisciplinary perspective is currently lacking. Therefore, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore barriers and facilitators in gaining and maintaining employment in BPD from the perspectives of patients, mental health practitioners (MHPs) and insurance physicians (IPs). Methods Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in patients with BPD and two focus groups were carried out among MHPs (n = 7) and IPs (n = 6) following a thematic content analysis approach. Results All participants described barriers and facilitators relating to three overall themes: characteristics of BPD, stigma, and support to employment. Barriers to employment mainly related to characteristics of BPD, such as low self-image, difficulty posing personal boundaries, difficulty regulating emotions, and lack of structure. MHPs and IPs additionally mentioned externalization and overestimation of competencies on the part of patients. Enhancing emotion regulation and self-reflection by successful treatment was suggested as a facilitator to enhance employment. Increasing collaboration between mental health and vocational rehabilitation services, and increasing knowledge about BPD, were suggested to increase sustainable employment and decrease stigma. Conclusions The present findings revealed that both facilitators and barriers are important in gaining and maintaining employment in BPD in which diminishing symptoms, examining stigma and increasing support to employment are key. As a next step, supported employment strategies that follow patient preferences and integrate employment and mental health services, should be studied in the context of BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2963532555,"Coral reefs of the North Indo-West Pacific provide important ecosystem services to the region but are subjected to multiple local and global threats. Strengthening management measures necessitate understanding the variability of larval connectivity and bridging global connectivity models to local scales. An individual-based Lagrangian biophysical model was used to simulate connectivity between coral reefs for three organisms with different early life history characteristics: a coral (Acropora millepora), a sea urchin (Tripneustes gratilla), and a reef fish (Epinephelus sp). Connectivity metrics and reef clusters were computed from the settlement probability matrices. Fitted power law functions derived from the dispersal kernels provided relative probabilities of connection given only the distance between reefs, and demonstrated that 95% of the larvae across organisms settled within a third of their maximum settlement distances. The magnitude of the connectivity metric values of reef cells were sensitive to differences both in the type of organism and temporal variability. Seasonal variability of connections was more dominant than interannual variability. However, despite these differences, the moderate to high correlation of metrics between organisms and seasonal matrices suggest that the spatial patterns are relatively similar between reefs. A cluster analysis based on the Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity of sink and source connections synthesized the inherent variability of these multiple large connectivity matrices. Through this, similarities in regional connectivity patterns were determined at various cluster sizes depending on the scale of interest. The validity of the model is supported by 1) the simulated dispersal kernels being within the range of reported parentage analysis estimates; and, 2) the clusters that emerged reflect the dispersal barriers implied by previously published population genetics studies. The tools presented here (dispersal kernels, temporal variability maps and reef clustering) can be used to include regional patterns of connectivity into the spatial management of coral reefs."

However, findings across studies are often conflicting in respect to what a movement deficiency is or the magnitude of association to a specific injury. This study tests the information content within movement data using a data driven framework that was taught to classify movement data into the classes: NORM, ACLOP and ACLNO OP, without the input of expert knowledge. The NORM class was presented by 62 subjects (124 NORM limbs), while 156 subjects with ACL reconstruction represented the ACLOP and ACLNO OP class (156 limbs each class). Movement data from jumping, hopping and change of direction exercises were examined, using a variety of machine learning techniques. A stratified shuffle split cross-validation was used to obtain a measure of expected accuracy for each step within the analysis. Classification accuracies (from best performing classifiers) ranged from 52 to 81%, using up to 5 features. The exercise with the highest classification accuracy was the double leg drop jump (DLDJ; 81%), the highest classification accuracy when considering only the NORM class was observed in the single leg hop (81%), while the DLDJ demonstrated the highest classification accuracy when considering only for the ACLOP and ACLNO OP class (84%). These classification accuracies demonstrate that biomechanical data contains valuable information and that it is possible to differentiate normal from rehabilitating movement patterns. Further, findings highlight that a few features contain most of the information, that it is important to seek to understand what a classification model has learned, that symmetry measures are important, that exercises capture different qualities and that not all subjects within a normative cohort utilise 'true' normative movement patterns (only 27 to 71%)."
https://openalex.org/W2962903893,"Members of a large family of Ankyrin Repeat Domain (ANKRD) proteins regulate numerous cellular processes by binding to specific protein targets and modulating their activity, stability, and other properties. The same ANKRD protein may interact with different targets and regulate distinct cellular pathways. The mechanisms responsible for switches in the ANKRDs' behavior are often unknown. We show that cells' metabolic state can markedly alter interactions of an ANKRD protein with its target and the functional outcomes of this interaction. ANKRD9 facilitates degradation of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2), the rate-limiting enzyme in GTP biosynthesis. Under basal conditions ANKRD9 is largely segregated from the cytosolic IMPDH2 in vesicle-like structures. Upon nutrient limitation, ANKRD9 loses its vesicular pattern and assembles with IMPDH2 into rodlike filaments, in which IMPDH2 is stable. Inhibition of IMPDH2 activity with ribavirin favors ANKRD9 binding to IMPDH2 rods. The formation of ANKRD9/IMPDH2 rods is reversed by guanosine, which restores ANKRD9 associations with the vesicle-like structures. The conserved Cys109Cys110 motif in ANKRD9 is required for the vesicle-to-rods transition as well as binding and regulation of IMPDH2. Oppositely to overexpression, ANKRD9 knockdown increases IMPDH2 levels and prevents formation of IMPDH2 rods upon nutrient limitation. Taken together, the results suggest that a guanosine-dependent metabolic switch determines the mode of ANKRD9 action toward IMPDH2."

Here, we genotyped 370 Japanese Thoroughbred horses using the recently developed 670k SNP array and performed various genome-wide analysis also using genotype data of other horse breeds. We identified a number of regions showing interesting patterns of polymorphisms. For instance, the region containing the MC1R locus associated with chestnut coat color may have been targeted by selection for a different mutation much earlier on than the recent selection for chestnut color. We also identified regions that show signatures of selection specific to Thoroughbreds. In addition, we found that intense inbreeding early in the history of the Thoroughbred breed and also before the formation of the breed has a significant impact on the genomic architecture of modern Thoroughbreds. Our study demonstrates that the horse 670k array can be utilized to gain important insight into the domestication process of horses and to understand the genetic basis of the phenotypic diversity in horses."

The complications include Guillain-Barré syndrome, congenital brain and other abnormalities and miscarriage. The serodiagnosis of ZIKV infection is hampered by cross-reactivity with other members of the Flavivirus family, notably dengue (DENV). This report describes a novel serological platform for the diagnosis of ZIKV infection. The approach utilizes time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) elicited by two chromophore-labeled proteins (a ZIKV antigen and a super-antigen) simultaneously binding to a given antibody molecule. The antigen used in the assay is ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the super-antigen is bacterial protein L. Three assay variants were developed: the first measuring all anti-ZIKV-NS1 antibodies (LFRET), the second measuring IgM and IgA (acute-LFRET) and the third measuring IgG (immunity-LFRET). The assays were evaluated with a panel of samples from clinical ZIKV cases in travelers (n = 25) and seronegative (n = 24) samples. DENV (n = 38), yellow fever (n = 16) and tick-borne-encephalitis (n = 20) seropositive samples were examined for assessment of flavivirus cross-reactivity. The diagnostic sensitivities of the respective LFRET assays were 92%, 100% and 83%, and the diagnostic specificities 88%, 95% and 100% for LFRET, acute-LFRET and immunity-LFRET. Furthermore, we evaluated the assays against a widely-used commercial ELISA. In conclusion, the new FRET-based serological approaches based on NS1 protein are applicable to diagnosing zika virus infections in travelers and differentiating them from other flavivirus infections."

Generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression analysis was performed to identify significant associations between parafoveal VD and collaterals. We further compared parafoveal VD between subgroups classified by the presence of specific collateral types based on the results of a clustering algorithm.16 of 25 eyes (64%) developed collaterals. Of the 43 collateral vessels analyzed, 12/19 (63%) true superficial collaterals developed in eyes with central RVO, while all 10 superficial diving collaterals (100%) developed in eyes with branch RVO. Located exclusively in the SCP, true superficial collaterals were all arteriovenous (A-V), while diving collaterals were all veno-venular (V-V). We found a significant negative correlation between SCP VD and the total number of collaterals (P < 0.001) for the entire study cohort. Furthermore, BRVO eyes that developed superficial diving collaterals and CRVO eyes that developed true superficial collaterals demonstrated significantly lower SCP VD (P-value = 0.014) and DCP VD (P-value = 0.030), respectively, as compared to the eyes without collaterals in the respective RVO group.Our data shows that decreased capillary perfusion in RVO is associated with the development of collaterals, while the RVO type largely dictates the type of collateral that ultimately develops."

https://openalex.org/W2963389707,"Vaccine administration via the oral route is preferable to parenteral routes due to ease of administration. To date, most available oral vaccines comprises of live attenuated pathogens as oppose to peptide-based vaccines due to its low bioavailability within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Over the years, probiotic-based peptide delivery vehicles comprising of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis has emerged as an interesting alternative due to its generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, a fully sequenced genome, transient gut colonization time, and is an efficient cellular factory for heterologous protein production. However, its survivability through the GI tract is low, thus better delivery approaches are being explored to improve its bioavailability. In this study, we employ the incorporation of a double coated mucoadhesive film consisting of sodium alginate and Lycoat RS 720 film as the inner coat. The formulated film exhibits good mechanical properties of tensile strength and percent elongation for manipulation and handling with an entrapment yield of 93.14±2.74%. The formulated mucoadhesive film is subsequently loaded into gelatin capsules with an outer enteric Eudragit L100-55 coating capable of a pH-dependent breakdown above pH 5.5 to protect against gastric digestion. The final product and unprotected controls were subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestions to assess its survivability. The product demonstrated enhanced protection with an increase of 69.22±0.67% (gastric) and 40.61±8.23% (intestinal) survivability compared to unprotected controls after 6 hours of sequential digestion. This translates to a 3.5 fold increase in overall survivability. Owing to this, the proposed oral delivery system has shown promising potential as a live gastrointestinal vaccine delivery host. Further studies involving in vivo gastrointestinal survivability and mice immunization tests are currently being carried out to assess the efficacy of this novel oral delivery system in comparison to parenteral routes."
https://openalex.org/W2963882346,"Podoplanin (PDPN) is a glycoprotein that is expressed by various cell types, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and lymphatic endothelial cells. We found that PDPN is expressed in the hair follicle (HF) keratinocyte region and HF stem cell area during the late anagen phase but not during the telogen phase in mice. Importantly, keratinocyte-specific PDPN deletion in mice (K5-Cre;PDPNflox/flox) promoted anagen HF growth after depilation-induced HF regeneration as compared to control mice. RNA sequencing, followed by gene ontology analysis, showed down-regulation of focal adhesion and extracellular matrix interaction pathways in HF stem cells isolated from K5-Cre;PDPNflox/flox mice as compared to control mice. Furthermore, HF keratinocytes isolated from K5-Cre;PDPNflox/flox mice exhibited a decreased ability to interact with collagen type I in cell adhesion assays. Taken together, these results show that PDPN deletion promotes HF cycling, possibly via reduced focal adhesion and concomitantly enhanced migration of HF stem cells towards the bulb region. They also indicate potential new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of conditions associated with hair loss."
https://openalex.org/W2964068335,"Ammonium pulse attributed to runoff of urban surface and agriculture following heavy rain is common in inland aquatic systems and can cause profoundly effects on the growth of macrophytes, especially when combined with low light. In this study, three patterns of NH4-N pulse (differing in magnitude and frequency) were applied to examine their effects on the growth of three submersed macrophytes, namely, Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton maackianus, and Vallisneria natans, in terms of biomass, height, branch/ramet number, root length, leaf number, and total branch length under high and low light. Results showed that NH4-N pulse caused negative effects on the biomass of the submerged macrphytes even on the 13th day after releasing NH4-N pulse. The negative effects on M. spicatum were significantly greater than that on V. natans and P. maackianus. The effects of NH4-N pulse on specific species depended on the ammonium loading patterns. The negative effects of NH4-N pulse on P. maackianus were the strongest at high loading with low frequency, and on V. natans at moderate loading with moderate frequency. For M. spicatum, no significant differences were found among the three NH4-N pulse patterns. Low light availability did not significantly aggregate the negative effects of NH4-N pulse on the growth of the submersed macrophytes. Our study contributes to revealing the roles of NH4-N pulse on the growth of aquatic plants and its species specific effects on the dynamics of submerged macrophytes in lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2963092539,"Background Over 75% of people with mental neurological and substance use disorders (MNSD) live in low and middle-income countries with limited access to specialized care. The World Health Organization’s Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) aims to address the human resource gap but it requires contextualization. Aims We conducted a qualitative study in rural coastal Kenya to explore the local terms, perceived causes and management modalities of priority MNSD listed in the mhGAP, to inform implementation in this setting. Methods We conducted 8 focus group discussions with primary health care providers and traditional health practitioners and used the framework method to conduct thematic analysis. We identified local terms, perceived causes and treatment options for MNSD. We also explored possibilities for collaboration between the traditional health practitioners and primary health care providers. Results We found local terms for depression, psychoses, epilepsy, disorders due to substance use and self-harm/ suicide but none for dementia. Child and adolescent mental and behavioral problems were not regarded as MNSD but consequences of poor parenting. Self-harm/suicide was recognized in the context of other MNSD. Causes of MNSD were broadly either biological or supernatural. Treatment options were dependent on perceived cause of illness. Most traditional health practitioners were willing to collaborate with primary health care providers mainly through referring cases. Primary health care providers were unwilling to collaborate with traditional health practitioners because they perceived them to contribute to worsening of patients’ prognoses. Conclusions Local terms and management modalities are available for some priority MNSD in this setting. Community level case detection and referral may be hindered by lack of collaboration between traditional health practitioners and primary health care providers. There is need for training on the recognition and management of all priority MNSD."
https://openalex.org/W2962919301,"The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies for 16S rRNA gene profiling provides higher quality compositional data for microbe communities. Inferring the direct interaction network under a specific condition and understanding how the network structure changes between two different environmental or genetic conditions are two important topics in biological studies. However, the compositional nature and high dimensionality of the data are challenging in the context of network and differential network recovery. To address this problem in the present paper, we proposed two new loss functions to incorporate the data transformations developed for compositional data analysis into D-trace loss for network and differential network estimation, respectively. The sparse matrix estimators are defined as the minimizer of the corresponding lasso penalized loss. Our method is characterized by its straightforward application based on the ADMM algorithm for numerical solution. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in network and differential network inference under different scenarios. Finally, as an illustration, our method is applied to a mouse skin microbiome data."
https://openalex.org/W2963197079,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a public health problem worldwide. Characterizing its trends over time is a useful tool for decision-makers to assess the efficiency of TB control programs. We aimed to give an update on the current chronological trends of TB in Southern Tunisia from 1995 to 2016 and to estimate future trajectories of TB epidemic by 2030. Methods We retrospectively collected data of all notified TB new cases by the Center of Tuberculosis Control between 1995 and 2016 in South of Tunisia. Joinpoint Regression Analysis was performed to analyze chronological trends and annual percentage changes (APC) were estimated. Results In the past 22 years, a total of 2771 cases of TB were notified in Southern Tunisia. The annual incidence rate of TB was 13.91/100,000 population/year. There was a rise in all forms of TB incidence (APC = 1.63) and in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) (APC = 2.04). The incidence of TB increased in children and adult females between 1995 and 2016 (APC = 4.48 and 2.37, respectively). The annual number of TB declined in urban districts between 2004 and 2016 (APC = -2.85). Lymph node TB cases increased (APC = 4.58), while annual number of urogenital TB decreased between 1995 and 2016 (APC = -3.38). Projected incidence rates would increase to 18.13 and 11.8/100,000 population in 2030 for global TB and EPTB, respectively. Conclusions Our study highlighted a rise in all forms of TB and among high-risk groups, notably children, females and lymph node TB patients in the last two decades and up to the next one."
https://openalex.org/W2963560001,"We previously reported in HEK 293T cells that silencing the mitochondrial peptidyl prolyl isomerase cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) reduces Vo2. We now report that in vivo Cyp-D ablation using constitutive Cyp-D knockout (KO) mice also reduces Vo2 both at rest (∼15%) and during treadmill exercise (∼12%). Yet, despite Vo2 reduction, these Cyp-D KO mice ran longer (1071 ± 77 vs. 785 ± 79 m; P = 0.002), for longer time (43 ± 3 vs. 34 ± 3 min; P = 0.004), and at higher speed (34 ± 1 vs. 29 ± 1 m/s; P ≤ 0.001), resulting in increased work (87 ± 6 vs. 58 ± 6 J; P ≤ 0.001). There were parallel reductions in carbon dioxide production, but of lesser magnitude, yielding a 2.3% increase in the respiratory exchange ratio consistent with increased glucose utilization as respiratory substrate. In addition, primary skeletal muscle cells of Cyp-D KO mice subjected to electrical stimulation exhibited higher glucose uptake (4.4 ± 0.55 vs. 2.6 ± 0.04 pmol/mg/min; P ≤ 0.001) with enhanced AMPK activation (0.58 ± 0.06 vs. 0.38 ± 0.03 pAMPK/β-tubulin ratio; P ≤ 0.01) and TBC1 (Tre-2/USP6, BUB2, Cdcl6) domain family, member 1 (TBC1D1) inactivation. Likewise, pharmacological activation of AMPK also increased glucose uptake (3.2 ± 0.3 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2 pmol/mg/min; P ≤ 0.001). Moreover, lactate and ATP levels were increased in these cells. Taken together, Cyp-D ablation triggered an adaptive response resulting in increased exercise capacity despite less oxygen utilization associated with increased glucose uptake and utilization involving AMPK-TBC1D1 signaling nexus.—Radhakrishnan, J., Baetiong, A., Kaufman, H., Huynh, M., Leschinsky, A., Fresquez, A., White, C., DiMario, J.

https://openalex.org/W2963612094,"Background and purpose The advantage of combined PET-MRI over sequential PET and MRI is the high spatial conformity and the absence of time delay between the examinations. The benefit of this technique for planning of re-irradiation (re-RT) treatment is unkown yet. Imaging data from a phase 1 trial of re-RT for recurrent glioma was analysed to assess whether planning target volumes and treatment margins in glioma re-RT can be adjusted by PET-MRI with rater independent PET based biological tumour volumes (BTVs). Patients and methods Combined PET-MRI with the tracer O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) prior to re-RT was performed in recurrent glioma patients in a phase I trial. GTVs including all regions suspicious of tumour on contrast enhanced MRI were delineated by three experienced radiation oncologists and included into MRI based consensus GTVs (MRGTVs). BTVs were semi-automatically delineated with a fixed threshold of 1.6 x background activity. Corresponding BTVs and MRGTVs were fused into union volume PET-MRGTVs. The Sørensen–Dice coefficient and the conformity index were used to assess the geometric overlap of the BTVs with the MRGTVs. A recurrence pattern analysis was performed based on the original planning target volumes (PTVs = GTV + 10 mm margin or 5 mm in one case) and the PET-MRGTVs with margins of 10, 8, 5 and 3 mm. Results Seven recurrent glioma patients, who received PET-MRI prior to re-RT, were included into the present planning study. At the time of re-RT, patients were in median 54 years old and had a median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of 80. Median post-recurrence survival after the beginning of re-RT was 13 months. Concomitant bevacizumab therapy was applied in six patients and one patient received chemoradiation with temozolomide. Median GTV volumes of the three radiation oncologists were 35.0, 37.5 and 40.5 cubic centimeters (cc) and median MRGTV volume 41.8 cc. Median BTV volume was 36.6 cc and median PET-MRGTV volume 59.3 cc. The median Sørensen–Dice coefficient for the comparison between MRGTV and BTV was 0.61 and the median conformity index 0.44. Recurrence pattern analysis revealed two central, two in-field and one distant recurrence within both, the original PTV, as well as the PET-MRGTV with a reduced margin of 3 mm. Conclusion PET-MRI provides radiation treatment planning imaging with high spatial and timely conformity for high-grade glioma patients treated with re-RT with potential advancements for target volume delineation. Prospective randomised trials are warranted to further investigate the treatment benefits of PET-MRI based re-RT planning."
https://openalex.org/W2962790904,"The present study, for the first time, reported twelve A2M isoforms in Tenualosa ilisha, through SMRT sequencing. Hilsa shad, T. ilisha, an anadromous fish, faces environmental stresses and is thus prone to diseases. Here, expression profiles of different A2M isoforms in four tissues were studied in T. ilisha, for the tissue specific diversity of A2M. Large scale high quality full length transcripts (>0.99% accuracy) were obtained from liver, ovary, testes and gill transcriptomes, through Iso-sequencing on PacBio RSII. A total of 12 isoforms, with complete putatative proteins, were detected in three tissues (7 isoforms in liver, 4 in ovary and 1 in testes). Complete structure of A2M mRNA was predicted from these isoforms, containing 4680 bp sequence, 35 exons and 1508 amino acids. With Homo sapiens A2M as reference, six functional domains (A2M_N,A2M_N2, A2M, Thiol-ester_cl, Complement and Receptor domain), along with a bait region, were predicted in A2M consensus protein. A total of 35 splice sites were identified in T. ilisha A2M consensus transcript, with highest frequency (55.7%) of GT-AG splice sites, as compared to that of Homo sapiens. Liver showed longest isoform (X1) consisting of all domains, while smallest (X10) was found in ovary with one Receptor domain. Present study predicted five putative markers (I-212, I-269, A-472, S-567 and Y-906) for EUS disease resistance in A2M protein, which were present in MG2 domains (A2M_N and A2M_N2), by comparing with that of resistant and susceptible/unknown response species. These markers classified fishes into two groups, resistant and susceptible response. Potential markers, predicted in T. ilisha, placed it to be EUS susceptible category. Putative markers reported in A2M protein may serve as molecular markers in diagnosis of EUS disease resistance/susceptibility in fishes and may have a potential for inclusion in the marker panel for pilot studies. Further, challenging studies are required to confirm the role of particular A2M isoforms and markers identified in immune protection against EUS disease."
https://openalex.org/W2972565282,"The aminoguanidine compound robenidine is widely used as an antibiotic for the control of coccidiosis, a protozoal infection in poultry and rabbits. Interestingly, robenidine is structurally similar to guanabenz (analogs), which are currently undergoing clinical trials as cytoprotective agents for the management of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show that robenidine and guanabenz protect cells from a tunicamycin-induced unfolded protein response to a similar degree. Both compounds also reduced the tumor necrosis factor α–induced activation of NF-κB. The cytoprotective effects of guanabenz (analogs) have been explained previously by their ability to maintain eIF2α phosphorylation by allosterically inhibiting protein phosphatase PP1:PPP1R15A. However, using a novel split-luciferase–based protein–protein interaction assay, we demonstrate here that neither robenidine nor guanabenz disrupt the interaction between PPP1R15A and either PP1 or eIF2α in intact cells. Moreover, both drugs also inhibited the unfolded protein response in cells that expressed a nonphosphorylatable mutant (S51A) of eIF2α.

https://openalex.org/W2962765876,"Vascular tissue in plants provides a resource distribution network for water and nutrients that exhibits remarkable diversity in patterning among different species. In many succulent plants, the vascular network includes longitudinally-oriented supplemental vascular bundles (SVBs) in the central core of the succulent stems and roots in addition to the more typical zone of vascular tissue development (vascular cambium) in a cylinder at the periphery of the succulent organ. Plant SVBs evolved in over 38 plant families often in tandem with evolutionary increases in stem and root parenchyma storage tissue, so it is of interest to understand the evolutionary-developmental processes responsible for their recurrent evolution and patterning. Previous mathematical models have successfully recreated the two-dimensional vascular patterns in stem and root cross sections, but such models have yet to recreate three-dimensional vascular patterning. Here, a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of plant vascular bundle patterning is developed in an effort to highlight a potential mechanism of three dimensional patterning-Turing pattern formation coupled with longitudinal efflux of a regulatory molecule. A relatively simple model of four or five molecules recreated empirical SVB patterns and many other common vascular arrangements. SVBs failed to develop below a threshold width of parenchymatous tissues, suggesting a mechanism of evolutionary character loss due to changes in the spatial context in which development takes place. Altered diffusion rates of the modeled activator and substrate molecules affected the number and size of the simulated SVBs. This work provides a first mathematical model employing a stochastic Turing-type mechanism that recreates three dimensional vascular patterns seen in plant stems. The model offers predictions that can be tested using molecular-genetic approaches. Evolutionary-developmental ramifications concerning evolution of diffusion rates, organ size and geometry are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2962691097,"To elucidate the etiology of a new disease of shallot in France, double-stranded RNAs from asymptomatic and symptomatic shallot plants were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Annotation of contigs, molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence in symptomatic plants of a virus complex consisting of shallot virus X (ShVX, Allexivirus), shallot latent virus (SLV, Carlavirus) and two novel viruses belonging to the genera Carlavirus and Potyvirus, for which the names of shallot virus S (ShVS) and shallot mild yellow stripe associated virus (SMYSaV), are proposed. Complete or near complete genomic sequences were obtained for all these agents, revealing divergent isolates of ShVX and SLV. Trials to fulfill Koch’s postulates were pursued but failed to reproduce the symptoms on inoculated shallots, even though the plants were proved to be infected by the four viruses detected by HTS. Replanting of bulbs from SMYSaV-inoculated shallot plants resulted in infected plants, showing that the virus can perpetuate the infection over seasons. A survey analyzing 351 shallot samples over a four years period strongly suggests an association of SMYSaV with the disease symptoms. An analysis of SMYSaV diversity indicates the existence of two clusters of isolates, one of which is largely predominant in the field over years."

There is an urgent need for highly specific IGF-1 and IGF-2 antibodies, yet only a short sequence element, i.e. the IGF loop, provides enough difference in sequence to discriminate between the two molecules. We sought to address this unmet demand by investigating novel chimeric immunogens as carriers for recombinant peptide motif grafting. We found Thermus thermophilus sensitive to lysis D (SlyD) and Thermococcus gammatolerans SlyD FK-506–binding protein (FKBP) domains suitable for presentation of the predefined epitopes, namely the IGF-1 and IGF-2 loops. Chimeric SlyD-IGF proteins allowed for the development of exceptionally specific IGF-1 and IGF-2 monoclonal antibodies. The selected antibodies bound with high affinity to the distinct IGF epitopes displayed on the protein scaffolds, as well as on the mature human IGF isoforms. The respective SlyD scaffolds display favorable engineering properties in that they are small, monomeric, and cysteine-free and can be produced in high yields in a prokaryotic host, such as Escherichia coli.

Although left-handers become accustomed to using right-handed devices, an underlying preference for objects that afford the dominant hand could remain. We employed eye tracking while left- and right-handed participants viewed advertisements for everyday products. Participants then rated aesthetic appeal, purchase intention, and perceived value. Left-handed participants found advertisements for products that more easily afforded them action to be more aesthetically appealing. They also indicated greater future purchase intention for products that were oriented towards the left hand, and gave these products a higher perceived value. Eye tracking data showed that object handles attracted attention, and were also able to retain participants' attention. Further, across multiple eye movement measures, our data show that participant eye movements were altered by the orientation of the handle, such that this side of the image was examined earlier and for longer, regardless of handedness. Left-handers' preferences might be stronger because they are more aware of object orientation, whereas right-handers do not experience the same difficulties. These findings highlight intrinsic differences in the way in which we perceive objects and our underlying judgments about those products, based on handedness."
https://openalex.org/W2963099172,"Introduction One of the main problems involved in heart transplantation (HT) is antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Many aspects of AMR are still unresolved, including its etiology, diagnosis and treatment. In this project, we hypothesize that variants in genes involved in B-cell biology in HT patients can yield diagnostic and prognostic information about AMR. Methods Genetic variants in 61 genes related to B-cell biology were analyzed by next generation sequencing in 46 HT patients, 23 with and 23 without AMR. Results We identified 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms in ITGA4 gene (c.1845G>A, c.2633A>G, and c.2883C>T) that conformed the haplotype AGT-ITGA4. This haplotype is associated with the development of AMR. Moreover, AMR patients with the haplotype AGT-ITGA4 present lower levels of integrin α-4 in serum samples compared to the reference GAC haplotype in control patients. Conclusion We can conclude that polymorphisms in genes related to the biology of B-cells could have an important role in the development of AMR. In fact, the AGT haplotype in ITGA4 gene could potentially increase the risk of AMR."
