In three of the subjects, who had frequent bronchitis and sinusitis, there was no mucociliary transport, as measured by tracheobronchial clearance. Electron microscopy indicated that cilia from cells of these patients lack dynein arms."

The 122 base pairs comprising this region include the recognition sites for RNA polymerase, the positive regulatory protein, CAP, and the negative regulatory protein, the repressor. Identification of mutant variants of the sequence combined with the in vitro biochemical studies of others has allowed us to tentatively identify the recognition site for each of these proteins, and to suggest how CAP might act at a distance to affect the interaction of RNA polymerase with the promoter."

https://openalex.org/W2028999663,"Frogs maintained on a diurnal light-dark cycle (14 hours light and 10 hours darkness) shed their rod photoreceptor outer segment tips shortly after the onset of light. Shedding is synchronous and occurs in about 25 percent of the rod photoreceptors each day. Prolonged exposure to total darkness decreases the amount of shedding, after which exposure to light results in a large burst of synchronous shedding. Thus, in the frog retina, the synchronous shedding of rod outer segment tips is shown to be directly related to light stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2070098096,"5, 6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; 75 μM) inhibited only 60–75% of nuclear heterogeneous RNA (hnRNA) synthesis in HeLa cells, while the appearance of labeled cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing messenger RNA (mRNA) was reduced by approximately 95%. DRB-sensitive and resistant transcripts spanned the entire size range of hnRNA molecules. The relative poly(A) content of DRB-resistant hnRNA molecules was the same as that of normal hnRNA. In contrast to the effects of 3′deoxyadenosine, DRB appeared to inhibit the initiation of hnRNA chains, but did not directly interfere with labeling of poly(A). We present an interpretation of these results and propose how the results might be used to gain more information about nuclear RNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2081849227,"A competitive binding assay for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH2D] in plasma has been developed in which intestinal cytosol preparations from rachitic chicks are used as the binding protein. A new method of extraction and two new chromatographic procedures are used for this assay. The method is sensitive to as little as 10 picograms of 1,25-(OH)2D, and triplicate assays can be done on 5 milliliters of plasma. This assay shows that in the plasma of normal adult subjects there is a 1,25-(OH)2D concentration of 29 ± 2 picograms per milliliter, while none can be detected in the plasma of nephrectomized subjects and end-stage renal failure patients."

https://openalex.org/W1970142110,"Multiple sclerosis patients were tested for six new antigens present on human B lymphocytes. The group 4 specificity occurred in 83.9% of the 56 patients as compared to 32.5 percent in 72 healthy controls (P less than .003). The antiserums defining the five other B lymphocyte specificities reacted at a lower frequency to B cells from multiple sclerosis patients, showing that increased reactivity to group 4 antiserum was specific. Linkage of a hypothesized multiple sclerosis susceptibility gene with certain haplotypes of HLA-A3, HLA-B7 HLA-DW2, and the new B group 4 can be inferred."

https://openalex.org/W1524424301,"Inhibition of glucose uptake has been proposed as a primary cause of many of the subsequent inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids. This hypothesis has been tested in experiments where adenosine is substituted for glucose. Like glucose, adenosine maximally supports glycolytic and oxidative ATP generation, and by its use the hormonal inhibition of glucose uptake is circumvented. With adenosine, inhibition by cortisol is seen at at least one other metabolic site, respiratory ATP synthesis. This action can be observed by hormone-induced increases in levels of lactate, pyruvate, and AMP that accompany a lowering of ATP. Evidence for this metabolic action is also seen when cells are provided with a limiting amount of glucose; despite inhibition of glucose uptake, a cortisol-induced increase in lactate accompanies the reduction in levels of ATP. Decreased respiratory ATP synthesis is also suggested by a hormonal reduction in the metabolism of labeled exogenous pyruvate to 14CO2. Several experimental approaches suggest that inhibition of oxidative ATP production, rather than of glucose uptake, is the event most responsible for glucocorticoid-induced changes in the balance of adenine nucleotides, which in turn contribute to effects on protein synthesis and uridine uptake. First, the characteristic inhibitory cortisol effects on adenine nucleotides and protein synthesis are undiminished when adenosine is substituted for glucose. Second, in adenosine-supported cells the onset of the hormone-induced increase in levels of lactate corresponds closely to the appearance of measurable reductions in ATP. In contrast, when cells are supported by glucose, the hormonal inhibition of glucose uptake is maximal by 30 to 35 min, nearly an hour before effects on levels of ATP are detectable. Third, when cells are made strongly dependent upon glucose for ATP production by deprivation of exogenous substrate and cortisol is added at 90 min, a characteristic inhibition of the uptake of glucose added 40 min later is seen; nevertheless, this is insufficient to prevent added glucose from immediately and fully restoring ATP, rates of protein synthesis, and uridine uptake. Inhibitory effects on ATP, protein synthesis, and uridine do appear after an additional hour or so, a time commensurate with the development of an inhibition of oxidative metabolism. Fourth, limiting added glucose can reduce uptake more than cortisol, without reducing levels of ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1570464699,"A procedure has been developed for the purification of Z-type alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha-1-AT) which is rapid, gentle, and results in good yields. From 4 units (750 ml) of fresh human plasma, obtained from two individuals possessing the Pizz phenotype, 53 mg of pure Z-type alpha-1-AT was obtained. The preparation was homogeneous by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, both in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and by analytical ultracentrifugation. When compared to pure alpha-1-AT from plasma of individuals possessing the normal PiMM phenotype, the two proteins were indistinguishable with respect to amino acid composition, sedimentation coefficient (s20w of 3.33 for both M and Z), molecular weight (51,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and 47,000 by sedimentation equilibrium for both M and Z), and trypsin-combining ratio (0.91 for Z and 0.99 for M). The only difference which was observed between the variant forms of alpha-1-AT was in the carbohydrate composition. The Z-type alpha1-AT contains between 20 and 25% less carbohydrate than the M-type alpha-1-AT. Specifically, the Z-type alpha-1-AT is deficient in 1 glucosamine residue, 3 neutral sugar residues (1 mannose and 2 galactose), and 2 sialic acid residues. Although the Z-variant is deficient in sialic acid, its survival time in the serum of a rabbit was not significantly different from that of M-type alpha-1-AT."

https://openalex.org/W1523034454,"The rate of production of acid-soluble material during degradation of duplex DNA by Hemophilus influenzae ATP-dependent DNAse (Hind exonuclease V) has been shown to be directly dependent upon the Mg2+ concentration in the reaction mixture. At high concentrations of Mg2+ (5 to 20 mM), DNA degradation to acid-soluble products is rapid and the rate of ATP hydrolysis is slightly depressed. At low concentrations of Mg2+ (0.1 to 0.5 mM), the enzyme rapidly hydrolyzes ATP and converts up to 35% of linear duplex DNA to single-stranded material while degrading less than 0.2% of the DNA to acid-soluble products. We refer to this enzymatic production of single-stranded DNA as the activity. Under the conditions of our assay, the initial melting reaction is processive, lasting about 70s on phage T7 DNA. Using DNAs with several different lengths, we have established that the duration of the initial reaction is dependent upon DNA length, requiring approximately 1 s per 0.18 mum. The products of the initial reaction on phage T7 DNA are somewhat heterogeneous, consisting of short duplex fragments approximately 0.5 mum long, purely single-stranded products up to 7 mum long, and longer duplex fragments 3 to 11 mum in length, some of which have single-stranded tails. Nearly half of the single-stranded material remains linked to a duplex segment of DNA after the inital processive reaction. We propose that Hind exo V initiates attack at the DNA termini and then acts in a processive manner, migrating along the DNA molecule, converting some regions to single-stranded material by the combined action of the melting activity and limited phosphodiester cleavage, while leaving other regions double-stranded. At the completion of its processive movement through a single DNA molecule, it is released and then recycles onto either intact molecules or the partially degraded products, continuing in this manner until the DNA is finally reduced to oligonucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1972313616,"The C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant which binds selectively to T (thymus-derived) lymphocytes, was found to bind to lymphoblasts formed upon stimulation with antigens but not with mitogens. Binding of CRP thus serves as a marker for antigen-reactive (-reacted) as opposed to mitogen-reative (-reacted) T cells, suggesting that these represent separate subpopulations, and supports the developing concept that CRP play an important role in the regulation of responses critical to inflammation, host defense, and tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2086955577,"THE Ly phenotype of T cells which cooperate with B cells in the production of antibody has been described as Ly 1+2− (refs 1 and 2). Helper T cells are distinct from cytotoxic T cells (Ly 1− Ly 2+)1,2 and suppressor T cells (Ly 1−2+)3,4. In tissue culture, helper activity does not depend on the presence of intact T cells but can be mediated by cell-free supernatants from stimulated T cells. Stimulation with antigen induces the release of antigen-specific helper factors5,6 as well as factors which support antibody response against unrelated antigens7. Factors similar or identical to the latter are produced by splenic T cells in response to alloantigens8–10 and concanavalin A11. It is tacitly assumed that the mechanism by which helper T cells collaborate with B cells in the production of antibody is to be attributed to the release of these mediators. We report here that with respect to their Ly phenotypes, T cells which release T-cell replacing factor (TRF)8 in response to alloantigen belong to the same subpopulation of T cells as helper cells."

https://openalex.org/W2054456544,"A method for the continuous culturing of mouse splenic lymphocytes is described. The method utilizes rat-tail collagen-coated glass or plastic surfaces which enhance the adherence and proliferation of B-lymphocytes. The cultured cells are shown to synthesize IgM and putative IgD molecules which are deposited on the cell membrane. The majority of the cells possessed Fc receptors and C′ receptors, while none of them seemed to possess θ-antigen. It is concluded that these cells are functionally active B-lymphoid cells."
