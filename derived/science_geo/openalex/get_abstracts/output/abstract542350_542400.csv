https://openalex.org/W1823361762,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was identified in the United States (U.S.) swine population for the first time in April 2013 and rapidly spread nationwide. However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID50/ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560-0.056 TCID50/ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2-37.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID50/ml (Ct>45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560-5.6 TCID50/ml (Ct 24.2-31.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56-0.0056 TCID50/ml (Ct values 35.3 ->45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms."

While chips featuring single organs can be of great use for both pharmaceutical testing and basic organ-level studies, the huge potential of the organ-on-a-chip technology is revealed by connecting multiple organs on one chip to create a single integrated system for sophisticated fundamental biological studies and devising therapies for disease. Furthermore, since most organ-on-a-chip systems require special protocols with organ-specific media for the differentiation and maturation of the tissues, multi-organ systems will need to be temporally customizable and flexible in terms of the time point of connection of the individual organ units. We present a customizable Lego®-like plug & play system, μOrgano, which enables initial individual culture of single organ-on-a-chip systems and subsequent connection to create integrated multi-organ microphysiological systems. As a proof of concept, the μOrgano system was used to connect multiple heart chips in series with excellent cell viability and spontaneously physiological beat rates."

Drug addiction and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases have all been associated with altered DAT activity. The membrane localization and the activity of DAT are regulated by a number of intracellular proteins. α-Synuclein, a protein partner of DAT, is implicated in neurodegenerative disease and drug addiction. Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of the interaction between DAT and α-synuclein, the cellular location of this interaction, and the functional consequences of this interaction on the basal, amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated dopamine efflux, and membrane microdomain distribution of the transporter. Here, we found that the majority of DAT·α-synuclein protein complexes are found at the plasma membrane of dopaminergic neurons or mammalian cells and that the amphetamine-mediated increase in DAT activity enhances the association of these proteins at the plasma membrane. Further examination of the interaction of DAT and α-synuclein revealed a transient interaction between these two proteins at the plasma membrane. Additionally, we found DAT-induced membrane depolarization enhances plasma membrane localization of α-synuclein, which in turn increases dopamine efflux and enhances DAT localization in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains."
https://openalex.org/W2227653819,"The attachment of dissimilar materials is a major engineering challenge, yet this challenge is seemingly overcome in biology. This study aimed to determine how the transcription factor Scleraxis (Scx) influences the development and maturation of the tendon-to-bone attachment (enthesis). Mice with conditional knockout (cKO) for Scx (Scx(flx/-), Prx1Cre(+)) and wild-type [(WT) Scx(flx/+) or Scx(flx/flx)] littermates were killed at postnatal days 7-56 (P7-P56). Enthesis morphometry, histology, and collagen alignment were investigated throughout postnatal growth. Enthesis tensile mechanical properties were also assessed. Laser microdissection of distinct musculoskeletal tissues was performed at P7 for WT, cKO, and muscle-unloaded (botulinum toxin A treated) attachments for quantitative PCR. cKO mice were smaller, with altered bone shape and impaired enthesis morphology, morphometry, and organization. Structural alterations led to altered mechanical properties; cKO entheses demonstrated reduced strength and stiffness. In P7 attachments, cKO mice had reduced expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily genes in fibrocartilage compared with WT mice. In conclusion, deletion of Scx led to impairments in enthesis structure, which translated into impaired functional (i.e., mechanical) outcomes. These changes may be driven by transient signaling cues from mechanical loading and growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2102549114,"CD24 is associated with unfavourable prognoses in various cancers, but the prevalence of CD24 expression and its influence on clinical outcome in subtypes of breast cancers remain unclear. CD24 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 747 breast cancer tissues, and DNA methylation and histone modification status in the promoter region of CD24 were assessed using bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. 213 (28.5%) samples exhibited high CD24 expression in the membrane and/or cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, and CD24 overexpression was significantly correlated with the presence of lymph node metastasis and more advanced pathological stage. Patients with CD24-high tumours had significantly shorter patient survival than those with CD24-low tumours. Importantly, multivariate analysis that included tumour size, lymph node metastasis and chemotherapy demonstrated that high CD24 expression is independently associated with poorer survival in luminal A and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. Furthermore, CD24 gene expression was associated with histone acetylation independent of DNA methylation, suggesting its epigenetic regulation in breast cancer. Our results suggest that CD24 overexpression is an independent unfavourable prognostic factor in breast cancer, especially for luminal A and TNBC subtypes, and CD24 may be a promising therapeutic target for specific subtypes of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2224835104,"Adequate inflammatory response predominated by macrophage infiltration is essential to acute skeletal muscle injury repair. The majority of intramuscular macrophages express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1. We studied the role of CX3CR1 in regulating intramuscular macrophage number and function in acute injury repair by using a loss-of-function approach. Muscle injury repair was delayed in CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice as compared with wild-type (WT) controls. CX3CR1 was predominantly expressed by macrophages but not by myogenic cells or capillary endothelia cells in injured muscles. Intramuscular macrophage number and subset composition were not altered by CX3CR1 deficiency. Intramuscular macrophage phagocytosis function was impaired by CX3CR1 deficiency as demonstrated by increased number of necrotic fibers (+115%) and percentage of necrotic area (+204%) at 7 d, increased number of intramuscular neutrophils at 3 (+89%) but not 1 d, reduced number of phagocytosing macrophages (-12%) and phagocytosed beads within macrophages (-15%) in CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice as compared with WT controls. The mRNA expression of CD36 (-50%), CD14 (-43%), IGF-1 (-53%), and IL-6 (-40%) was reduced in CX3CR1-deficient macrophages as compared with WT controls. We conclude that CX3CR1 is important to acute skeletal muscle injury repair by regulating macrophage phagocytosis function and trophic growth factor production."
https://openalex.org/W1821104239,"Multidisciplinary team meetings and shared decision-making are potential means of delivering patient-centred care. Not much is known about how those two paradigms fit together in cancer care. This study aimed to investigate how decisions are made in multidisciplinary team meetings and whether patient perspectives are incorporated in these decisions.A qualitative study was conducted using non-participant observation at multidisciplinary team meetings (also called tumor boards) at the University Cancer Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. Two researchers recorded structured field notes from a total of N = 15 multidisciplinary team meetings. Data were analyzed using content analysis and descriptive statistics.Physicians mainly exchanged medical information and based their decision-making on this information. Individual patient characteristics or their treatment preferences were rarely considered or discussed. In the few cases where patient preferences were raised as a topic, this information did not seem to be taken into account in decision-making processes about treatment recommendations.The processes in multidisciplinary team meetings we observed did not exhibit shared decision-making. Patient perspectives were absent. If multidisciplinary team meetings wish to become more patient-centred they will have to modify their processes and find a way to include patient preferences into the decision-making process."
https://openalex.org/W2201095422,"Introduction Preeclampsia is a maternal hypertensive disorder with uncertain etiology and a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality worldwide, causing nearly 40% of premature births delivered before 35 weeks of gestation. The first stage of preeclampsia is characterized by reduction of utero-placental blood flow which is reflected in high blood pressure and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. In human placenta androgens derived from the maternal and fetal adrenal glands are converted into estrogens by the enzymatic action of placental aromatase. This implies that alterations in placental steroidogenesis and, subsequently, in the functionality or bioavailability of placental aromatase may be mechanistically involved in the pathophysiology of PE. Methods Serum samples were collected at 32–36 weeks of gestation and placenta biopsies were collected at time of delivery from PE patients (n = 16) and pregnant controls (n = 32). The effect of oxygen tension on placental cells was assessed by incubation JEG–3 cells under 1% and 8% O2 for different time periods, Timed-mated, pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (n = 6) were used to establish an in vivo model of placental ischemia (achieved by ligature of uteroplacental vessels). Aromatase content and estrogens and androgens concentrations were measured. Results The protein and mRNA content of placental aromatase significantly diminished in placentae obtained from preeclamptic patients compared to controls. Similarly, the circulating concentrations of 17-β-estradiol/testosterone and estrone/androstenedione were reduced in preeclamptic patients vs. controls. These data are consistent with a concomitant decrease in aromatase activity. Aromatase content was reduced in response to low oxygen tension in the choriocarcinoma JEG–3 cell line and in rabbit placentae in response to partial ligation of uterine spiral arteries, suggesting that reduced placental aromatase activity in preeclamptic patients may be associated with chronic placental ischemia and hypoxia later in gestation. Conclusions Placental aromatase expression and functionality are diminished in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia in comparison with healthy pregnant controls."
https://openalex.org/W2273156803,"Endothelial activation is a hallmark of the high-glucose (HG)-induced retinal inflammation associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, precisely how HG induces retinal endothelial activation is not fully understood. We hypothesized that HG-induced upregulation of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a collagen-cross-linking enzyme, in retinal capillary endothelial cells (ECs) enhances subendothelial basement membrane (BM) stiffness, which, in turn, promotes retinal EC activation. Diabetic C57BL/6 mice exhibiting a 70 and 50% increase in retinal intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression and leukocyte accumulation, respectively, demonstrated a 2-fold increase in the levels of BM collagen IV and LOX, key determinants of capillary BM stiffness. Using atomic force microscopy, we confirmed that HG significantly enhances LOX-dependent subendothelial matrix stiffness invitro, which correlated with an ~2.5-fold increase in endothelial ICAM-1 expression, a 4-fold greater monocyte—EC adhesion, and an ~ 2-fold alteration in endothelial NO (decrease) and NF-κB activation (increase). Inhibition of LOX-dependent subendothelial matrix stiffening alone suppressed HG-induced retinal EC activation. Finally, using synthetic matrices of tunable stiffness, we demonstrated that subendothelial matrix stiffening is necessary and sufficient to promote EC activation. These findings implicate BM stiffening as a critical determinant of HG-induced retinal EC activation and provide a rationale for examining BM stiffness and underlying mechanotransduction pathways as therapeutic targets for diabetic retinopathy.—Yang, X., Scott, H.

https://openalex.org/W2294645290,"Cx43 hemichannels serve as a portal for the release of prostaglandins, a critical process in mediating biological responses of mechanical loading on bone formation and remodeling. We have previously observed that fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) opens hemichannels; however, sustained FFSS results in hemichannel closure, as continuous opening of hemichannels is detrimental to cell viability and bone remodeling. However, the mechanism that regulates the closure of the hemichannels is unknown. Here, we show that activation of p44/42 ERK upon continuous FFSS leads to Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser279-Ser282, sites known to be phosphorylated sites by p44/42 MAPK. Incubation of osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells with conditioned media (CM) collected after continuous FFSS increased MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Cx43. CM treatment inhibited hemichannel opening and this inhibition was reversed when cells were pretreated with the MAPK pathway inhibitor. We found that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) accumulates in the CM in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with PGE2 increased phospho-p44/42 ERK levels and also Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser279-Ser282 sites. Depletion of PGE2 from CM, and pre-treatment with a p44/42 ERK pathway-specific inhibitor, resulted in a complete inhibition of ERK-dependent Cx43 phosphorylation and attenuated the inhibition of hemichannels by CM and PGE2. Consistently, the opening of hemichannels by FFSS was blocked by PGE2 and CM and this blockage was reversed by U0126 and the CM depleted of PGE2. A similar observation was also obtained in isolated primary osteocytes. Together, results from this study suggest that extracellular PGE2 accumulated after continuous FFSS is responsible for activation of p44/42 ERK signaling and subsequently, direct Cx43 phosphorylation by activated ERK leads to hemichannel closure.

https://openalex.org/W2152104032,"Nearly a century of paleontological excavation and analysis from the cave deposits of the Cradle of Humankind UNESCO World Heritage Site in northeastern South Africa underlies much of our understanding of the evolutionary history of hominins, other primates and other mammal lineages in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene of Africa. As one of few designated fossil repositories, the Plio-Pleistocene Palaeontology Section of the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History (DNMNH; the former Transvaal Museum) curates much of the mammalian faunas recovered from the fossil-rich deposits of major South African hominin-bearing localities, including the holotype and paratype specimens of many primate, carnivore, and other mammal species (Orders Primates, Carnivora, Artiodactyla, Eulipotyphla, Hyracoidea, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla, and Proboscidea). Here we describe an open-access digital archive of high-resolution, full-color three-dimensional (3D) surface meshes of all 89 non-hominin holotype, paratype and significant mammalian specimens curated in the Plio-Pleistocene Section vault. Surface meshes were generated using a commercial surface scanner (Artec Spider, Artec Group, Luxembourg), are provided in formats that can be opened in both open-source and commercial software, and can be readily downloaded either via an online data repository (MorphoSource) or via direct request from the DNMNH. In addition to providing surface meshes for each specimen, we also provide tomographic data (both computerized tomography [CT] and microfocus [microCT]) for a subset of these fossil specimens. This archive of the DNMNH Plio-Pleistocene collections represents the first research-quality 3D datasets of African mammal fossils to be made openly available. This simultaneously provides the paleontological community with essential baseline information (e.g., updated listing and 3D record of specimens in their current state of preservation) and serves as a single resource of high-resolution digital data that improves collections accessibility, reduces unnecessary duplication of efforts by researchers, and encourages ongoing imaging-based paleobiological research across a range of South African non-hominin fossil faunas. Because the types, paratypes, and key specimens include globally-distributed mammal taxa, this digital archive not only provides 3D morphological data on taxa fundamental to Neogene and Quaternary South African palaeontology, but also lineages critical to research on African, other Old World, and New World paleocommunities. With such a broader impact of the DNMNH 3D data, we hope that establishing open access to this digital archive will encourage other researchers and institutions to provide similar resources that increase accessibility to paleontological collections and support advanced paleobiological analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2274319005,"During translation, stop codon read-through occasionally happens when the stop codon is misread, skipped, or mutated, resulting in the production of aberrant proteins with C-terminal extension. These extended proteins are potentially deleterious, but their regulation is poorly understood. Here we show in vitro and in vivo evidence that mouse cFLIP-L with a 46-amino acid extension encoded by a read-through mutant gene is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, causing hepatocyte apoptosis during embryogenesis. The extended peptide interacts with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM21, to induce ubiquitylation of the mutant protein. In humans, 20 read-through mutations are related to hereditary disorders, and extended peptides found in human PNPO and HSD3B2 similarly destabilize these proteins, involving TRIM21 for PNPO degradation.

Our findings indicate that degradation of aberrant proteins with C-terminal extension encoded by read-through mutant genes is a mechanism for loss of function resulting in hereditary disorders. Translation from an mRNA to a protein is normally terminated at stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA). However, reading through a stop codon occasionally happens, the frequency of which is affected by the nucleotides around the stop codon (1.McCaughan K.K. Brown C.M. Dalphin M.E. Berry M.J. Tate W.P. Translational termination efficiency in mammals is influenced by the base following the stop codon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

UAG readthrough in mammalian cells: effect of upstream and downstream stop codon contexts reveal different signals.BMC Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When read-through of a stop codon occurs, the translation continues to the next in-frame stop codon or to the poly(A) tail at the 3′ terminus of the mRNA, resulting in the production of aberrant proteins with C-terminal extension. Similar C-terminally extended proteins are constitutively produced when a stop codon is mutated to code for an amino acid; in both cases, this can lead to potentially deleterious proteins. Translation from mRNAs lacking a stop codon (nonstop mRNA) is suppressed by several mechanisms, including accelerated degradation of nonstop mRNA and translational repression triggered by stalled polysomes in the vicinity of the poly(A) tail (3.Ito-Harashima S. Kuroha K. Tatematsu T. Inada T.

However, genome-wide bioinformatics analysis of seven vertebrate animal species indicated that a relatively small number of mRNAs lack a downstream stop codon and that most mRNAs contain additional in-frame stop codons in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) (Table 1). Therefore, even if a canonical stop codon is mutated to code for an amino acid, translation is terminated at a downstream stop codon in many cases. Currently, more than 400 read-through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that result in encoding C-terminally extended proteins terminated at a downstream stop codon have been identified in humans (supplemental Table 1), and some of these SNPs are related to hereditary disorders. However, regulation of these C-terminally extended proteins is poorly understood.TABLE 1Number of stop mRNAs in seven vertebrate speciesHumanMouseRatCowPigFrogZebrafishTotal72,11077,95160,13670,36038,38228,81347,797Stop mRNA66,86170,01451,78461,06430,17123,91342,528Nonstop mRNA55211731119267Unknown4697782083219285820248745262Average length of extended amino acids (aa)27.825.925.128.328.020.620.7 Open table in a new tab As a model system to study the regulation of the read-through mutant genes, we found a read-through mutation in the long form of mouse cFLIP-L (cellular FLICE-like apoptosis-inhibitory protein) gene that results in a mutant cFLIP-L protein containing a C-terminal 46-amino acid extension (cFLIP-L+46). Structurally, cFLIP-L resembles caspase-8 but has no caspase activity, and therefore, it inhibits apoptosis signaling initiated by death receptor ligation (6.Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schröter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Inhibition of death receptor signals by cellular FLIP.Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that homozygous cFlip-l+46 mutant mice die at around 13.5 days postcoitum and undergo extensive apoptosis in the liver. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the extended 46-amino acid peptide functions as a degron to destabilize the cFLIP-L protein and that an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM21 (tripartite motif-containing 21), mediates the ubiquitylation of cFLIP-L+46. We also show that C-terminally extended PNPO (pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate oxidase) and HSD3B2 (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II) proteins, encoded by read-through mutant genes found in patients of congenital diseases, are degraded by a similar mechanism. These findings indicate that degradation of aberrant C-terminally extended proteins that are encoded by genes with read-through mutations is a mechanism for loss of function and can lead to hereditary disorders.

Apoptosis was analyzed with an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA), as described previously (9.Ohoka N. Nagai K. Hattori T. Okuhira K. Shibata N. Cho N. Naito M. Cancer cell death induced by novel small molecules degrading the TACC3 protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5: e1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, cells were gently trypsinized and washed with serum-containing medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation, additionally washed with PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer. The cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide at room temperature for 5 min in the dark, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). HeLa cells transfected with the indicated vectors were treated with 10 μm MG132 and lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 10% glycerol. After heat denaturation, the lysates were diluted 10 times with 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.5). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc agarose-conjugated beads, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA. Lysates from HeLa cells expressing GFP+46 or GFP+22 were immunoprecipitated with antibody against GFP. Following SDS-PAGE, gels were stained with SYPRO ruby protein gel stain (Lonza, Rockland, ME), and protein bands that specifically bind to the GFP+46 were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The peptides extracted from the gel pieces were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA). The analytical column for LC/MS was a reversed-phase column (L-column 2 ODS; 150 × 0.075 mm, 3 μm; Chemicals Evaluation and Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase was 0.1% formic acid containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid containing 90% acetonitrile (A buffer). The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min with a gradient of 2–65% of A buffer over 50 min. MS/MS conditions were as follows: an electrospray voltage of 2.5 kV in positive ion mode, a capillary temperature of 275 °C, and a collision energy of 35% for MS/MS. The spectra data obtained by MS/MS were subjected to database search analysis with the SEQUEST algorithm (Proteome Discoverer version 1.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the UniProt database. Total RNA was prepared from MEFs with RNeasy (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with an oligo(dT) primer using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system using TaqMan real-time PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with TaqMan probes/primers for mouse cFlip-l and 18S ribosome RNA (Applied Biosystems). The relative amounts of cFlip-l mRNAs were calculated by using the comparative Ct method. Mouse 18S ribosomal RNA was used as an invariant control. Data for human, mice, rat, cow, pig, frog, and zebrafish full-length mRNAs were retrieved from the NCBI RefSeq database in January 2015. Read-through SNP data and associated full-length human mRNA data were retrieved from dbSNP and RefSeq in the NCBI database in March 2014. Stop mRNAs that contain an in-frame termination codon in the 3′-UTR were selected. 3′-UTR sequences were translated in silico using a Perl translate module. In a large scale archive of ENU-mutagenized mice (10.Sakuraba Y. Sezutsu H. Takahasi K.R. Tsuchihashi K. Ichikawa R. Fujimoto N. Kaneko S. Nakai Y. Uchiyama M. Goda N. Motoi R. Ikeda A. Karashima Y. Inoue M. Kaneda H. Masuya H. Minowa O. Noguchi H. Toyoda A. Sakaki Y. Wakana S. Noda T. Shiroishi T. Gondo Y. Molecular characterization of ENU mouse mutagenesis and archives.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we found a read-through mutation (X482W) in the cFlip-l gene that results in encoding a mutant cFLIP-L protein containing a C-terminal 46-amino acid extension (cFLIP-L+46) (Fig. 1A). To understand how the extended protein is regulated and the phenotypic consequences of the read-through mutation, we analyzed the mutant mice and the cFLIP-L+46 protein. Heterozygous cFlip-l+46 mutant (+/Mut) mice developed normally and were fertile, but homozygous mutant (Mut/Mut) mice died at around E13.5 (Fig. 1B and Table 2A). To exclude the possibility that abnormalities found in the mutant (Mut/Mut) mice are due to ENU-generated mutation of another, unknown gene that happened to be homozygous in the cFlip-l+46 Mut/Mut mice, we crossed heterozygous cFlip-l+46 mutant (+/Mut) mice onto heterozygous cFlip-deficient (+/−) mice. The resulting transheterozygote (−/Mut) mice died at around E11.5 (Table 2B), which is slightly later than the embryonic lethality observed in cFlip null (−/−) mice (Table 2C). Because any mutation except for cFlip-l is heterozygous in the transheterozygotes and gives no phenotypic changes, the lethality observed in the transheterozygote embryos is due to the complication in the cFlip-l gene. Accordingly, these results indicate that the homozygous read-through mutation of the cFlip-l gene is embryonic lethal. Histological analysis of cFlip-l+46 Mut/Mut embryos at E12.5 showed hemorrhage with many condensed nuclei and TUNEL-positive cells in the liver (Fig. 1C). Thus, homozygous cFlip-l read-through mutant (Mut/Mut) embryos survived beyond E10.5 when cFlip null mice die because of impaired yolk sac vasculature development (8.Yeh W.C. Itie A. Elia A.J. Ng M. Shu H.B. Wakeham A. Mirtsos C. Suzuki N. Bonnard M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Requirement for Casper (c-FLIP) in regulation of death receptor-induced apoptosis and embryonic development.Immunity. 2000; 12: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 11.Sakamaki K.

Because the extended cFLIP-L+46 protein is destabilized (see below), these results suggest that a tiny amount of cFLIP-L+46 protein enables the embryos to survive beyond E10.5 but that it is not sufficient to suppress hepatocyte apoptosis at a later embryonic stage.TABLE 2Viability of cFlip-l read-through mutant and cFlip deficient embryos Open table in a new tab Next, we analyzed the behavior of the cFLIP-L+46 protein. Levels of cFLIP-L+46 protein were dramatically reduced in the Mut/Mut whole embryo (Fig. 2A) and liver (Fig. 2B) at E12.5. In the liver, the active form of caspase-3 was observed (Fig. 2B), which is in good agreement with the observed hepatocyte apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Reduced cFLIP-L+46 protein levels were similarly observed in Mut/Mut MEFs (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the reduced levels of cFLIP-L+46 protein, the Mut/Mut MEFs were highly sensitive to TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2D) as were wild-type MEFs depleted of cFLIP-L using siRNA (Fig. 2E). To examine whether the residual cFLIP-L+46 can inhibit apoptosis signaling in Mut/Mut MEFs, we down-regulated cFLIP-L+46 in Mut/Mut MEFs using siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, depletion of the residual cFLIP-L+46 protein significantly sensitized the cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Conversely, exogenous expression of cFLIP-L+46 protein in Mut/Mut MEFs suppressed TNFα-induced caspase activation (Fig. 3C) and increase of annexin V-positive apoptotic cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that cFLIP-L+46 protein has an activity to inhibit apoptosis but that the amount of cFLIP-L+46 protein is severely reduced, resulting in higher sensitivity to apoptosis in the Mut/Mut MEFs and hepatocytes. We next investigated why levels of cFLIP-L+46 protein are severely reduced. In MEFs, the turnover of cFLIP-L+46 protein was much faster than that of wild-type cFLIP-L protein. When the MEFs were treated with CHX, cFLIP-L+46 protein disappeared within 1 h, whereas wild-type cFLIP-L protein was retained for over 12 h (Fig. 4A). Similarly, cFLIP-L+46 exogenously expressed in HeLa cells turned over more rapidly than wild-type cFLIP-L (Fig. 4B). Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, increased the accumulation of cFLIP-L+46 in Mut/Mut MEFs (Fig. 4C). In addition, ubiquitylation of cFLIP-L+46 exogenously expressed in HeLa cells was highly enhanced compared with that of wild-type cFLIP-L (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, levels of cFlip-l+46 mRNA in Mut/Mut MEFs were not reduced compared with cFlip-l mRNA in wild-type (WT) MEFs (Fig. 4E). These results collectively indicate that the expression of cFLIP-L+46 protein is severely reduced because of the rapid degradation by the UPS. To examine whether the extended peptide can promote proteasomal degradation when grafted onto a heterologous protein, we genetically fused the extended peptide to the C terminus of GFP and expressed it in HeLa cells. GFP+46 levels were much lower than those of GFP, and this difference was reduced by proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5A), indicating that the extended peptide functions as a degradation signal. Trimming 10 C-terminal amino acids from the extended peptide to form GFP+36 did not affect the degradation signal activity, whereas deletion of 24 C-terminal amino acids to form GFP+22 abolished the activity (Fig. 5A). Because the extended peptide does not contain a lysine residue that can be ubiquitylated, we reasoned that the peptide functions as a degron that interacts with a ubiquitin ligase to destabilize cFLIP-L protein. To identify the ubiquitin ligase involved in the destabilization of cFLIP-L+46 protein, we searched for proteins that interact with GFP+46 but not with GFP+22 by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and identified TRIM21, a RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in innate and acquired immunity (12.McEwan W.A. Tam J.C. Watkinson R.E. Bidgood S.R. Mallery D.L. James L.C. Intracellular antibody-bound pathogens stimulate immune signaling via the Fc receptor TRIM21.Nat.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 negatively regulates the innate immune response to intracellular double-stranded DNA.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fig. 5B shows that GFP+46, but not GFP+22, co-precipitates TRIM21 protein in the cells. In addition, cFLIP-L+46 strongly, but cFLIP-L minimally, co-precipitates TRIM21 in the cells (Fig. 5C). These results confirmed the selective interaction of TRIM21 with the extended peptide harboring the degron activity. We next investigated whether TRIM21 is required for the degradation of GFP+46 and cFLIP-L+46 proteins. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of human TRIM21 in HeLa cells increased the levels of GFP+46, which was suppressed by restoring TRIM21 levels by co-transfecting an siRNA-resistant FLAG-tagged human TRIM21 construct (Fig. 5D). In addition, knockdown of mouse Trim21 in cFlip-l+46 Mut/Mut MEFs significantly increased the level of cFLIP-L+46 (Fig. 5E). The rapid protein turnover of cFLIP-L+46 exogenously expressed in HeLa cells was suppressed by knockdown of human TRIM21 (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, the ubiquitylation of cFLIP-L+46 protein was suppressed in cells depleted of TRIM21 and restored by co-transfection of the siRNA-resistant Trim21 gene (Fig. 5G). These results indicate that TRIM21 is a ubiquitin ligase responsible for the destabilization of cFLIP-L+46 and GFP+46 proteins. In humans, more than 400 read-through SNPs result in encoding C-terminally extended proteins that terminate at downstream in-frame stop codons (supplemental Table 1). Among them, 20 are related to hereditary disorders (Table 3). We hypothesized that some of the read-through mutant proteins could be regulated by a mechanism similar to that which degrades cFLIP-L+46 protein. To test this hypothesis, we examined in HeLa cells the expression of GFP proteins fused to the extended peptides encoded by the 20 genes involved with hereditary disorders. We found that the extended peptides from PNPO (28 amino acids) and HSD3B2 (95 amino acids) destabilized the GFP protein, which was abrogated by MG132 (Fig. 6A).TABLE 3Read-through SNPs related to human hereditary disordersSymboldbSNP IDOMIMDiseaseLengthaaCRYM104894509123740Deafness, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic5DBT121965000248610Maple syrup urine disease, intermediate, type II7ITM2B104894417603904Dementia, familial British11SH2D1A111033625300490Lymphoproliferative syndrome, X-linked, 112PAX6121907922607108Aniridia14MOCS2121908609603708Molybdenum cofactor deficiency B18CTSK74315301601105Pycnodysostosis19FKRP104894682606596Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (limb-girdle), type C, 521RUNX2104893994600211Cleidocranial dysplasia23IKBKG137853321300301Ectodermal dysplasia, anhidrotic, with immunodeficiency, osteopetrosis, and lymphedema27PNPO104894631603287Pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate oxidase deficiency28HBA241321345141850Hemoglobin H disease, nondeletional31SHOX137852559312865Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis48NHP2121908091606470Dyskeratosis congenita, autosomal recessive 251FHL1122459148300163Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy 6, X-linked52RAD50121912629604040Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like disorder66FOXF1121909337601089Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins72HSD3B2803582182018103-β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, type II, deficiency95FGFR3121913101134934Thanatophoric dysplasia, type I101CLCF1137853935610313Cold-induced sweating syndrome 1170 Open table in a new tab Consistent with this, levels of PNPO+28 expressed in HeLa cells were suppressed compared with wild-type PNPO, and this suppression was abrogated by MG132 (Fig. 6B, left panels). PNPO+28 protein turned over more rapidly than wild-type PNPO (Fig. 6C, left panels), and PNPO+28 was more heavily ubiquitylated compared with wild-type PNPO (Fig. 6D, left panels). Similar results were obtained with HSD3B2+95 and the corresponding wild-type HSD3B2 proteins (Fig. 6, B–D, right panels). These results indicate that C-terminal extension of PNPO and HSD3B2 proteins caused by read-through mutations results in protein instability through the UPS. Finally, we examined whether TRIM21 is involved in the destabilization of the extended PNPO+28 and HSD3B2+95 proteins. siRNA-mediated knockdown of human TRIM21 increased the levels of PNPO+28, but not of HSD3B2+95 protein (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, the rapid turnover of PNPO+28 protein was suppressed by knockdown of human TRIM21 (Fig. 6F), and TRIM21 strongly interacted with PNPO+28 in the cells (Fig. 6G). These results suggest that TRIM21 plays a role in the ubiquitylation of PNPO+28 but that another E3 ligase is responsible for the ubiquitylation of HSD3B2+95 protein. Currently, 20 stop codon read-through mutations are related to hereditary disorders in humans; however, it is not understood how the C-terminally extended read-through mutant proteins are regulated. In this study, we analyzed a read-through mutant of mouse cFlip-l as a model system and showed that the homozygous read-through mutant embryos undergo extensive apoptosis in the liver. The C-terminally extended peptide interacts with a ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 and promotes ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of cFLIP-L+46 protein. We also showed that the C-terminally extended proteins of human PNPO and HSD3B2 encoded by read-through mutant genes found in patients are degraded by a similar mechanism involving TRIM21 for PNPO degradation. PNPO plays an essential role in brain metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of pyridoxine 5′-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, a metabolically active form of vitamin B6 (15.Ngo E.O. LePage G.R. Thanassi J.W. Meisler N. Nutter L.M. Absence of pyridoxine-5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) activity in neoplastic cells: isolation, characterization, and expression of PNPO cDNA.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7741-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Patients with homozygous read-through mutation in the PNPO gene (X262Q) suffer from neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (16.Mills P.B. Surtees R.A. Champion M.P. Beesley C.E. Dalton N. Scambler P.J. Heales S.J. Briddon A. Scheimberg I. Hoffmann G.F. Zschocke J. Clayton P.T. Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the PNPO gene encoding pyridox(am)ine 5′-phosphate oxidase.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and show no PNPO activity. The null PNPO activity can be explained by degradation of the extended PNPO+28 protein via the UPS. Because TRIM21 plays an important role in the degradation of the extended PNPO+28 protein (Fig. 6, E and F), inhibition and/or suppression of TRIM21 could be a strategy to restore PNPO protein levels in these cases. HSD3B2 catalyzes the oxidation and isomerization of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid precursors into Δ4-ketosteroids and is essential for the formation of progesterone, a precursor for all classes of steroid hormones. Deficiency in the activity of HSD3B2 in the adrenal cortex causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia (17.Pang S. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia owing to 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 2001; 30: 81-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A read-through mutation in HSD3B2 (X373C) was found in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, resulting in dramatic reduction of HSD3B2 protein levels and activity (18.Pang S. Wang W. Rich B. David R. Chang Y.T. Carbunaru G. Myers S.E. Howie A.F. Smillie K.J. Mason J.I. A novel nonstop mutation in the stop codon and a novel missense mutation in the type II 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) gene causing, respectively, nonclassic and classic 3β-HSD deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2556-2563PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the mutant protein is degraded by the UPS, although the E3 ligase involved is currently unknown. Among 20 read-through mutant proteins that are related to hereditary disorders in humans, C-terminally extended PNPO+28 and HSD3B2+95 proteins are degraded by the UPS as well as mouse cFLIP-L+46 protein. Interestingly, the extended peptides of PNPO+28, HSD3B2+95, and cFLIP-L+46 share the Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Leu (LXXLL) sequence, whereas other extended peptides encoded by the mutant genes in Table 3 do not have the sequence. The LXXLL sequence is well known as a protein recognition motif widely used in transcriptional regulation (19.Plevin M.J. Mills M.M. Ikura M. The LxxLL motif: a multifunctional binding sequence in transcriptional regulation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the LXXLL sequence is involved in the degradation of C-terminally extended proteins, we generated point or deletion mutants of the sequence in cFLIP-L+46, but the mutations did not affect the protein degradation of cFLIP-L+46 (data not shown). Therefore, the LXXLL sequence in the C-terminally extended proteins is not likely to play an important role in regulating the protein stability. The 3′-UTR is known to regulate the stability of mRNAs and the translation (20.Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. The 3′ untranslated region of messenger RNA: a molecular “hotspot” for pathology?.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) but is rarely considered to encode functional protein sequence. However, in some cases, functional peptides are encoded in the 3′-UTR, downstream of the canonical termination codon, and they can influence the function of the mother protein. Examples include an isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-Ax) and a read-through mutant of CRYM. VEGF-Ax with a C-terminal 22-amino acid extension is generated by a programmed translational read-through mechanism depending on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1. The extended peptide converts a proangiogenic VEGF-A into an anti-angiogenic VEGF-Ax protein (21.Eswarappa S.M. Potdar A.A. Koch W.J. Fan Y. Vasu K. Lindner D. Willard B. Graham L.M. DiCorleto P.E. Fox P.L. Programmed translational readthrough generates antiangiogenic VEGF-Ax.Cell. 2014; 157: 1605-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A read-through mutation in the CRYM gene is found in patients with non-syndromic deafness, and subcellular localization of CRYM protein is altered by the C-terminal extension (22.Abe S. Katagiri T. Saito-Hisaminato A. Usami S. Inoue Y. Tsunoda T. Nakamura Y. Identification of CRYM as a candidate responsible for nonsyndromic deafness, through cDNA microarray analysis of human cochlear and vestibular tissues.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to these observations, our study provides evidence for the destabilization of proteins by C-terminally extended peptides encoded in the 3′-UTRs of human PNPO and HSD3B2, which result in congenital diseases, and in mouse cFlip-l, which causes embryonic lethality. Because there are more read-through mutations known to be involved in human hereditary disorders (Table 3), further study will clarify the function of the extended peptides and how the C-terminally extended proteins are regulated.

https://openalex.org/W2128200271,"Ferritin is an iron-storage protein composed of different ratios of 24 light (L) and heavy (H) subunits. The serum level of ferritin is a clinical marker of the body's iron level. Transferrin receptor (TFR)1 is the receptor not only for transferrin but also for H-ferritin, but how it binds two different ligands and the blood cell types that preferentially incorporate H-ferritin remain unknown. To address these questions, we investigated hematopoietic cell-specific ferritin uptake by flow cytometry. Alexa Fluor 488-labeled H-ferritin was preferentially incorporated by erythroid cells among various hematopoietic cell lines examined, and was almost exclusively incorporated by bone marrow erythroblasts among human primary hematopoietic cells of various lineages. H-ferritin uptake by erythroid cells was strongly inhibited by unlabeled H-ferritin but was only partially inhibited by a large excess of holo-transferrin. On the other hand, internalization of labeled holo-transferrin by these cells was not inhibited by H-ferritin. Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking functional endogenous TFR1 but expressing human TFR1 with a mutated RGD sequence, which is required for transferrin binding, efficiently incorporated H-ferritin, indicating that TFR1 has distinct binding sites for H-ferritin and holo-transferrin. H-ferritin uptake by these cells required a threshold level of cell surface TFR1 expression, whereas there was no threshold for holo-transferrin uptake. The requirement for a threshold level of TFR1 expression can explain why among primary human hematopoietic cells, only erythroblasts efficiently take up H-ferritin."
https://openalex.org/W2182050686,"Falls are a common complication of advancing Parkinson's disease (PD). Although numerous risk factors are known, reliable predictors of future falls are still lacking. The objective of this prospective study was to investigate clinical and instrumented tests of balance and gait in both OFF and ON medication states and to verify their utility in the prediction of future falls in PD patients.Forty-five patients with idiopathic PD were examined in defined OFF and ON medication states within one examination day including PD-specific clinical tests, instrumented Timed Up and Go test (iTUG) and computerized dynamic posturography. The same gait and balance tests were performed in 22 control subjects of comparable age and sex. Participants were then followed-up for 6 months using monthly fall diaries and phone calls.During the follow-up period, 27/45 PD patients and 4/22 control subjects fell one or more times. Previous falls, fear of falling, more severe motor impairment in the OFF state, higher PD stage, more pronounced depressive symptoms, higher daily levodopa dose and stride time variability in the OFF state were significant risk factors for future falls in PD patients. Increased stride time variability in the OFF state in combination with faster walking cadence appears to be the most significant predictor of future falls, superior to clinical predictors.Incorporating instrumented gait measures into the baseline assessment battery as well as accounting for both OFF and ON medication states might improve future fall prediction in PD patients. However, instrumented testing in the OFF state is not routinely performed in clinical practice and has not been used in the development of fall prevention programs in PD. New assessment methods for daylong monitoring of gait, balance and falls are thus required to more effectively address the risk of falling in PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2289833594,"Purpose To develop a Gamma Knife-based mouse model of late time-to-onset, cerebral radiation necrosis (RN) with serial evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology. Methods and Materials Mice were irradiated with the Leksell Gamma Knife® (GK) PerfexionTM (Elekta AB; Stockholm, Sweden) with total single-hemispheric radiation doses (TRD) of 45- to 60-Gy, delivered in one to three fractions. RN was measured using T2-weighted MR images, while confirmation of tissue damage was assessed histologically by hematoxylin & eosin, trichrome, and PTAH staining. Results MRI measurements demonstrate that TRD is a more important determinant of both time-to-onset and progression of RN than fractionation. The development of RN is significantly slower in mice irradiated with 45-Gy than 50- or 60-Gy, where RN development is similar. Irradiated mouse brains demonstrate all of the pathologic features observed clinically in patients with confirmed RN. A semi-quantitative (0 to 3) histologic grading system, capturing both the extent and severity of injury, is described and illustrated. Tissue damage, as assessed by a histologic score, correlates well with total necrotic volume measured by MRI (correlation coefficient = 0.948, with p<0.0001), and with post-irradiation time (correlation coefficient = 0.508, with p<0.0001). Conclusions Following GK irradiation, mice develop late time-to-onset cerebral RN histology mirroring clinical observations. MR imaging provides reliable quantification of the necrotic volume that correlates well with histologic score.

Agar dilution methods were employed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of meropenem (MEM) and imipenem (IMP) for P. aeruginosa. The gene encoding OprD2 was amplified from141 P. aeruginosa isolates and analyzed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Differences between the effects of IMPR and IMPS groups on the resistance of the P. aeruginosa were observed by SDS-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Three resistance types were classified in the 141 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) isolates tested, namely IMPRMEMR (66.7%), IMPRMEMS (32.6%), and IMPRMEMS (0.7%). DNA sequencing revealed significant diverse gene mutations in the OprD2-encoding gene in these strains. Thirty-four strains had large fragment deletions in the OprD2gene, in 6 strains the gene contained fragment inserts, and in 96 resistant strains, the gene featured small fragment deletions or multi-site mutations. Only 4 metallo-β-lactamase strains and 1 imipenem-sensitive (meropenem-resistant) strain showed a normal OprD2 gene. Using SDS-PAGE to detect the outer membrane protein in 16 CRPA isolates, it was found that 10 IMPRMEMR strains and 5 IMPRMEMS strains had lost the OprD2 protein, while the IMPSMEMR strain contained a normal 46-kDa protein. In conclusion, mutation or loss of the OprD2-encoding gene caused the loss of OprD2, which further led to carbapenem-resistance of P. aeruginosa. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism of carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2195023886,"Sleep problems are commonly reported in Rett syndrome (RTT); however the electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers underlying sleep dysfunction are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the temporal evolution of quantitative EEG (qEEG) biomarkers in overnight EEGs recorded from girls (2-9 yrs. old) diagnosed with RTT using a non-traditional automated protocol. In this study, EEG spectral analysis identified high delta power cycles representing slow wave sleep (SWS) in 8-9h overnight sleep EEGs from the frontal, central and occipital leads (AP axis), comparing age-matched girls with and without RTT. Automated algorithms quantitated the area under the curve (AUC) within identified SWS cycles for each spectral frequency wave form. Both age-matched RTT and control EEGs showed similar increasing trends for recorded delta wave power in the EEG leads along the antero-posterior (AP). RTT EEGs had significantly fewer numbers of SWS sleep cycles; therefore, the overall time spent in SWS was also significantly lower in RTT. In contrast, the AUC for delta power within each SWS cycle was significantly heightened in RTT and remained heightened over consecutive cycles unlike control EEGs that showed an overnight decrement of delta power in consecutive cycles. Gamma wave power associated with these SWS cycles was similar to controls. However, the negative correlation of gamma power with age (r = -.59; p<0.01) detected in controls (2-5 yrs. vs. 6-9 yrs.) was lost in RTT. Poor % SWS (i.e., time spent in SWS overnight) in RTT was also driven by the younger age-group. Incidence of seizures in RTT was associated with significantly lower number of SWS cycles. Therefore, qEEG biomarkers of SWS in RTT evolved temporally and correlated significantly with clinical severity."
https://openalex.org/W2204647556,"Sex differences in immatures predict behavioural differences in adulthood in many mammal species. Because most studies have focused on sex differences in social interactions, little is known about possible sex differences in ‘preparation’ for adult life with regards to tool use skills. We investigated sex and age differences in object manipulation in immature apes. Chimpanzees use a variety of tools across numerous contexts, whereas bonobos use few tools and none in foraging. In both species, a female bias in adult tool use has been reported. We studied object manipulation in immature chimpanzees at Kalinzu (Uganda) and bonobos at Wamba (Democratic Republic of Congo). We tested predictions of the ‘preparation for tool use’ hypothesis. We confirmed that chimpanzees showed higher rates and more diverse types of object manipulation than bonobos. Against expectation, male chimpanzees showed higher object manipulation rates than females, whereas in bonobos no sex difference was found. However, object manipulation by male chimpanzees was play-dominated, whereas manipulation types of female chimpanzees were more diverse (e.g., bite, break, carry). Manipulation by young immatures of both species was similarly dominated by play, but only in chimpanzees did it become more diverse with age. Moreover, in chimpanzees, object types became more tool-like (i.e., sticks) with age, further suggesting preparation for tool use in adulthood. The male bias in object manipulation in immature chimpanzees, along with the late onset of tool-like object manipulation, indicates that not all (early) object manipulation (i.e., object play) in immatures prepares for subsistence tool use. Instead, given the similarity with gender differences in human children, object play may also function in motor skill practice for male-specific behaviours (e.g., dominance displays). In conclusion, even though immature behaviours almost certainly reflect preparation for adult roles, more detailed future work is needed to disentangle possible functions of object manipulation during development."
https://openalex.org/W1885942567,"Tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum bacterium is a severe problem in Southern China, where relatively high environmental temperatures commonly prevails during the crop seasons. Previous research has indicated that bacterial wilt disease incidence generally increases during the warm months of summer leading to reduced tomato yield. Moreover, the efficacy of bio-organic fertilizers (BOFs)-organic compost fortified with pathogen-suppressive bacteria-is often lost during the periods of high environmental temperatures. Here we studied if the disease incidence could be reduced and the BOF performance enhanced by simply preponing and postponing the traditional seedling transplantation times to avoid tomato plant development during periods of high environmental temperature. To this end, a continuous, two-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of BOF in two traditional (late-spring [LS] and early-autumn [EA]) and two alternative (early-spring [ES] and late-autumn [LA]) crop seasons. We found that changing the transplantation times reduced the mean disease incidence from 33.9% (LS) and 54.7% (EA) to 11.1% (ES) and 7.1% (LA), respectively. Reduction in disease incidence correlated with the reduction in R. Solanacearum pathogen density in the tomato plant rhizosphere and stem base. Applying BOF during alternative transplantation treatments improved biocontrol efficiency from 43.4% (LS) and 3.1% (EA) to 67.4% (ES) and 64.8% (LA). On average, the mean maximum air temperatures were positively correlated with the disease incidence, and negatively correlated with the BOF biocontrol efficacy over the crop seasons. Crucially, even though preponing the transplantation time reduced the tomato yield in general, it was still economically more profitable compared to LS season due to reduced crop losses and relatively higher market prices. Preponing and postponing traditional tomato transplantation times to cooler periods could thus offer simple but effective way to control R. solanacearum disease outbreaks."

P53 can modulate other programmed cell death pathways including autophagy both transcriptionally and non-transcriptionally. We investigated autophagy induction in acute leukemia by Nutlin 3a, a first-in-class MDM2 inhibitor. Nutlin 3a induced autophagy in a p53 dependent manner and transcriptional activation of AMP kinase (AMPK) is critical, as this effect is abrogated in AMPK -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Nutlin 3a induced autophagy appears to be pro-apoptotic as pharmacological (bafilomycin) or genetic inhibition (BECLIN1 knockdown) of autophagy impairs apoptosis induced by Nutlin 3a."
https://openalex.org/W2192551925,"Targeted genome recombination has been applied in diverse research fields and has a wide range of possible applications. In particular, the discovery of specific loci in the genome that support robust and ubiquitous expression of integrated genes and the development of genome-editing technology have facilitated rapid advances in various scientific areas. In this study, we produced transgenic (TG) chickens that can induce recombinase-mediated gene cassette exchange (RMCE), one of the site-specific recombination technologies, and confirmed RMCE in TG chicken-derived cells. As a result, we established TG chicken lines that have, Flipase (Flp) recognition target (FRT) pairs in the chicken genome, mediated by piggyBac transposition. The transgene integration patterns were diverse in each TG chicken line, and the integration diversity resulted in diverse levels of expression of exogenous genes in each tissue of the TG chickens. In addition, the replaced gene cassette was expressed successfully and maintained by RMCE in the FRT predominant loci of TG chicken-derived cells. These results indicate that targeted genome recombination technology with RMCE could be adaptable to TG chicken models and that the technology would be applicable to specific gene regulation by cis-element insertion and customized expression of functional proteins at predicted levels without epigenetic influence.—Lee, H.

BoNTs have been classified as category A agent by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are listed among the six agents with the highest risk to be used as bioweapons. Neutralizing antibodies are required for the development of effective anti-botulism therapies to deal with the potential risk of exposure.In this study, a macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was immunized with recombinant light chain of BoNT/E3 and an immune phage display library was constructed. After a multi-step panning, several antibody fragments (scFv, single chain fragment variable) with nanomolar affinities were isolated, that inhibited the endopeptidase activity of pure BoNT/E3 in vitro by targeting its light chain. Furthermore, three scFv were confirmed to neutralize BoNT/E3 induced paralysis in an ex vivo mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm assay. The most effective neutralization (20LD50/mL, BoNT/E3) was observed with scFv ELC18, with a minimum neutralizing concentration at 0.3 nM. Furthermore, ELC18 was highly effective in vivo when administered as an scFv-Fc construct. Complete protection of 1LD50 BoNT/E3 was observed with 1.6 ng/dose in the mouse flaccid paralysis assay.These scFv-Fcs antibodies are the first recombinant antibodies neutralizing BoNT/E by targeting its light chain.

https://openalex.org/W2224106442,"Actin filament turnover underpins several processes in the life cycle of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Polymerization and depolymerization are especially important for gliding motility, a substrate-dependent form of cell movement that underpins the protozoan parasite's ability to disseminate and invade host cells. To date, given difficulties in extraction of native actins directly from parasites, much of our biochemical understanding of malarial actin has instead relied on recombinant protein extracted and purified from heterologous protein expression systems. Here, using in vitro transcription-translation methodologies and quantitative protein-binding assays, we explored the folding state of heterologously expressed P. falciparum actin 1 (PfACTI) with the aim of assessing the reliability of current recombinant-protein-based data. We demonstrate that PfACTI, when expressed in non-native systems, is capable of binding to and release from bacterial, yeast, and mammalian chaperonin complexes but appears to be incompletely folded. Characterization of the native Plasmodium folding machinery in silico, the chaperonin containing t-complex protein-1 complex, highlights key divergences between the different chaperonin systems that likely underpins this incomplete folded state. These results highlight the importance of characterizing actin's folded state and raise concerns about the interpretation of actin polymerization kinetics based solely on protein derived from heterologous expression systems."

Contrarily, PAK6 was found to predict a favorable prognosis in RCC patients. Nevertheless, the ambiguous tumor suppressive function of PAK6 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains obscure. Herein, decreased PAK6 expression was found to be associated with tumor node metastasis stage progression and unfavorable overall survival in HCC patients. Additionally, overexpression and silence of PAK6 experiments showed that PAK6 inhibited xenografted tumor growth in vivo, and restricted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis and anoikis in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of kinase dead and nuclear localization signal deletion mutants of PAK6 experiments indicated the tumor suppressive function of PAK6 was partially dependent on its kinase activity and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, gain or loss of function in polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components, including EZH2, SUZ12, and EED, elucidated epigenetic control of H3K27me3-arbitrated PAK6 down-regulation in hepatoma cells. More importantly, negative correlation between PAK6 and EZH2 expression was observed in hepatoma tissues from HCC patients. These data identified the tumor suppressive role and potential underlying mechanism of PAK6 in hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2225285706,"Cell-based approaches for bone formation require instructional cues from the surrounding environment. As an alternative to pharmacological strategies or transplanting single cell populations, one approach is to coimplant populations that can establish a new vasculature and differentiate to bone-forming osteoblasts. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) possess osteogenic potential and produce numerous angiogenic growth factors. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) are a subpopulation of endothelial progenitor cells capable of vasculogenesis in vivo and may provide endogenous cues to support MSC function. We investigated the contribution of the carrier biophysical properties to instruct entrapped human MSCs and ECFCs to simultaneously promote their osteogenic and proangiogenic potential. Compared with gels containing MSCs alone, fibrin gels engineered with increased compressive stiffness simultaneously increased the osteogenic and proangiogenic potential of entrapped cocultured cells. ECFCs produced bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a potent osteoinductive molecule, and increases in BMP-2 secretion correlated with gel stiffness. Coculture of MSCs with ECFCs transduced to knockdown BMP-2 production abrogated the osteogenic response to levels observed with MSCs alone. These results demonstrate that physical properties of engineered hydrogels modulate the function of cocultured cells in the absence of inductive cues, thus increasing the translational potential of coimplantation to speed bone formation and repair."

Given the important role of RB in tumor suppression, the above mentioned viral and cellular oncoproteins transform cells by promoting RB degradation. However, E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for proteasome-mediated degradation of RB are largely unknown. Transformation of rodent fibroblasts is a frequently used experimental approach to study the biological functions of oncoproteins. KIAA0649 transforms mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells as we described previously (45.Yang L. Zhao J. Lü W. Li Y. Du X. Ning T. Lu G. Ke Y. KIAA0649, a 1A6/DRIM-interacting protein with the oncogenic potential.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the biological processes involved in cell transformation by KIAA0649 are poorly understood. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that KIAA0649 harbored an RB-binding motif, LXCXE. In this study, we identify KIAA0649 as a novel RB E3 ubiquitin ligase (NRBE3) that binds RB, promotes RB degradation, and is transcriptionally activated by E2F1. Plasmids encoding GST-RB fusion protein and its deletion mutants GST-RBLP (aa 379–928), GST-RB (A+B) (aa 379–792), and GST-RBC (aa 792–928); FLAG-NRBE3 and deletion mutants; pCI-neo-FLAG-HPV E7; pCMV-HA-Ub; pCMV-HA-K48R-Ub; and pGL3-NRBE3-Luc were cloned in our laboratory. These constructed plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. Lipofectamine 2000TM was from Invitrogen. Polyclonal anti-NRBE3 antibody was developed in our laboratory (46.Zheng Z.F. Han W. He Q.H. Ke Y. Du X.J. Preparation of the polyclonal antibody against KIAA0649 and its cellular localization.Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao. 2009; 41: 613-619PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against RB was purchased from Pharmingen (G3-245) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-15). Antibodies against β-actin and GFP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against FLAG (M2) was obtained from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit, and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgGs were obtained from Zhongshan Co. (China). HeLa, MCF-7, U2OS, HCT116, and H1299 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction. The sequences of siRNAs were as follows: NRBE3 siRNA-1, 5′-CGCUUCUCCAGUGGUUGCU-3′; NRBE3 siRNA-2, 5′-AACUUGUACCUGGAUCAGGUG-3′; NRBE3 siRNA-3, 5′-AAUUCCGCCAAGUCACUCUUG-3′; and control siRNA, 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-3′ (47.Wu J.

Whole cell lysates were prepared in EBC250 buffer (32.Sdek P. Ying H. Chang D.L. Qiu W. Zheng H. Touitou R. Allday M.J. Xiao Z.X.

Proteins from cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized with appropriate antibodies after being blocked with 5% milk in PBS/T (0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). After extensive washing with PBS/T, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected with the ECL kit (GE Healthcare) before exposure to x-ray film. GST pulldown assays were performed as described previously(48.Hu L. Wang J. Liu Y. Zhang Y. Zhang L. Kong R. Zheng Z. Du X. Ke Y.

In brief, GST and GST-RB fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. FLAG-tagged NRBE3 proteins were transcribed/translated with TnT® lysate according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega) and incubated with GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST fusion protein-bound FLAG-NRBE3 proteins were evaluated by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Amounts of input GST or GST fusion proteins were confirmed as equal by staining the protein gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Cell lysates were prepared in buffer A (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Cell lysates used for in vivo ubiquitination assays were prepared in lysis buffer A (33.Uchida C. Miwa S. Kitagawa K. Hattori T. Isobe T. Otani S. Oda T. Sugimura H. Kamijo T. Ookawa K. Yasuda H.

Cell lysates were used directly for immunoprecipitation. Antibody was coupled with a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in IPP500 (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Coupled beads were incubated with cellular extracts for 2 h at 4 °C. After washes, precipitated proteins were evaluated by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously(48.Hu L. Wang J. Liu Y. Zhang Y. Zhang L. Kong R. Zheng Z. Du X. Ke Y. A small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome component, the human U3 protein 14A (hUTP14A) binds p53 and promotes p53 degradation.J. Biol.

Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) at −20 °C for 20 min. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum and incubated with appropriate antibodies in 3% goat serum at 4 °C overnight. After washes with PBS, cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG. The immunofluorescence signals were recorded by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Leica TCS-ST2). FLAG-NRBE3-His and FLAG-NRBE3(Δaa225–240)-His were produced in insect Sf9 cells using Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). These proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h in a 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH8.0, 0.5 mm DTT) containing 4 μl of 10× Energy solution (Boston Biochem catalog number K-960), 2 μg of ubiquitin (Boston Biochem catalog number K-960), 50 ng of recombinant human full-length RB (Active Motif Co. catalog number 31128), 50 ng of purified FLAG-NRBE3 or 50 ng of purified FLAG-NRBE3(Δaa225–240), 10 μg of Conjugation Fraction A (containing purified predominantly E1 and E2 enzymes, Boston Biochem catalog number K-960), and 1 μg of ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochem catalog number U-201). The reactions were terminated, and the proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using specific monoclonal RB antibody. pGL3-NRBE3 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-NRBE3-Luc) was co-transfected into 293 cells with E2F1 alone and/or DP1. The Renilla luciferase control reporter vector (Promega) was used in each transfection for normalizing transfection efficiency. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were harvested using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega) with a Berthold luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Data are presented as relative luciferase activity compared with the pGL3-Basic control, which is normalized to 1.0. Experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicates. Exponentially growing cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. After washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol and kept at 4 °C overnight. Cells were rehydrated in PBS at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Following RNase digestion, cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using red (propidium iodide) emission (at 630 nm). The data from 104 cells were collected and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Breast cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous breast tissues were collected from 16 breast cancer patients who underwent tumor resection at the Third Clinical Medical College of Peking University. None of these patients received any antineoplastic therapy prior to surgery. After resection, specimens were rinsed thoroughly in ice-cold normal saline and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Access to human tissues complied with the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Peking University. For each sample, tissue was homogenized in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT) on ice using a Polytron homogenizer. The samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g to remove particulate materials. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that NRBE3 contained an RB-binding sequence, LXCXE (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether NRBE3 binds RB, GST pulldown was performed with in vitro transcribed/translated FLAG-NRBE3 and E. coli-expressed GST-RB fusion proteins. FLAG-NRBE3 interacted with the large pocket of RB, whereas no interaction between NRBE3 and RB (A+B) or RB C-pocket was observed (Fig. 1B). The RB-binding domain of NRBE3 was further narrowed down by GST pulldown experiments using in vitro translated FLAG-NRBE3 deletion mutants (Fig. 1C, upper left) and E. coli-expressed GST-RBLP fusion protein. Both the N terminus containing residues 1–681 and the C terminus containing residues 805–1209 of NRBE3 bound the large pocket of RB (Fig. 1C, upper right). Because residues 1–681 of NRBE3 contained an LXCXE motif, we wanted to know whether the LXCXE motif was responsible for the interaction with RB. We constructed LXCXE motif-mutated plasmid FLAG-NRBE3aa1–681-RXRXH and performed GST pulldown with in vitro transcribed/translated FLAG-NRBE3aa1–681-RXRXH and E. coli-expressed GST-RB fusion proteins. The results showed that FLAG-NRBE3aa1–681-RXRXH lost the capability of binding RB (Fig. 1C, lower panel), demonstrating that the LXCXE motif was required for the N terminus of NRBE3 to bind RB. To verify whether NRBE3 interacts with RB in cells, immunoprecipitation was performed. However, RB was not found in the immunocomplexes of either endogenous NRBE3 or ectopically expressed FLAG-NRBE3 under normal culture conditions (Fig. 1D, upper panel). We therefore transfected cells with FLAG-NRBE3 and treated cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, before harvest of cells and performed immunoprecipitation. It was plausible that NRBE3 and RB interacted with each other in cells when the proteasome was inhibited, suggesting that NRBE3 might promote RB degradation through proteasome. Importantly, the majority of RB co-precipitated with FLAG-NRBE3 was hypophosphorylated RB, whereas both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated RB were observed in the RB-specific immunoprecipitate, demonstrating that the active RB interacted with NRBE3 in cells (Fig. 1D, lower panel). To confirm this result, we transfected cells with FLAG-NRBE3 or FLAG vector plasmids, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG or anti-RB antibodies after cells were treated with MG132 or dimethyl sulfoxide. FLAG-NRBE3 associated with RB only when cells were treated with MG132 (Fig. 1E), suggesting that NRBE3 might promote RB degradation in the proteasome. Next, we wanted to know in which cellular compartment NRBE3 interacted with RB. We first determined the localization of endogenous NRBE3 and ectopically expressed FLAG-NRBE3. FLAG-NRBE3 showed the same sparkle pattern in the nucleus as endogenous NRBE3 (Fig. 1, F and G). To determine whether NRBE3 co-localizes with RB, indirect immunofluorescence staining of endogenous NRBE3 and RB was performed, and the overlapping signals of NRBE3 and RB were quantified by Pearson correlation coefficient using a standard technique (49.French A.P. Mills S. Swarup R. Bennett M.J. Pridmore T.P. Colocalization of fluorescent markers in confocal microscope images of plant cells.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Results showed that endogenous NRBE3 co-localized partially with RB in the nucleus under normal culture conditions (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.763–0.5) (Fig. 1H), and MG132 treatment strongly enhanced the co-localization of NRBE3 with RB in the nucleus (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.864), further confirming that NRBE3 associated with RB when proteasome is inhibited. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NRBE3 interacted with RB only when proteasome was inhibited; thus we speculated that NRBE3 might affect RB function through the proteasomal pathway. We first determined whether NRBE3 affects RB protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2A, ectopic expression of FLAG-NRBE3 resulted in decreased levels of endogenous RB protein in a dose-dependent manner. The NRBE3-caused decrease of RB protein was further confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining, which showed that the endogenous RB protein level in FLAG-NRBE3 transfected cells was lower than that in the untransfected cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, knockdown of endogenous NRBE3 caused increased RB protein levels (Fig. 2C). To test whether NRBE3-induced RB reduction is due to a decrease of protein stability, the half-life of RB protein was determined in the presence or absence of FLAG-NRBE3. FLAG-NRBE3 was transfected into U2OS cells, and RB levels were evaluated by Western blotting at different time points after de novo protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide. The half-life of RB was reduced from more than 24 h to less than 3 h when FLAG-NRBE3 was ectopically expressed (Fig. 2D). As expected, the half-life of RB protein was prolonged to more than 72 h in U2OS cells when NRBE3 was knocked down (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that NRBE3 promoted a rapid protein degradation of RB. To verify whether NRBE3-induced RB degradation is proteasome-dependent, H1299 cells were transfected with FLAG-NRBE3, and cells were treated with MG132 before harvest. The"
https://openalex.org/W1828952991,"We investigated the different processes involved in spore liberation in the polypod fern Adiantum peruvianum (Pteridaceae). Sporangia are being produced on the undersides of so-called false indusia, which are situated at the abaxial surface of the pinnule margins, and become exposed by a desiccation-induced movement of these pinnule flaps. The complex folding kinematics and functional morphology of false indusia are being described, and we discuss scenarios of movement initiation and passive hydraulic actuation of these structures. High-speed cinematography allowed for analyses of fast sporangium motion and for tracking ejected spores. Separation and liberation of spores from the sporangia are induced by relaxation of the annulus (the 'throwing arm' of the sporangium catapult) and conservation of momentum generated during this process, which leads to sporangium bouncing. The ultra-lightweight spores travel through air with a maximum velocity of ~5 m s(-1), and a launch acceleration of ~6300 g is measured. In some cases, the whole sporangium, or parts of it, together with contained spores break away from the false indusium and are shed as a whole. Also, spores can stick together and form spore clumps. Both findings are discussed in the context of wind dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2111558118,"The human body is a highly familiar and socially very important object. Does this mean that the human body has a special status with respect to visual attention? In the current paper we tested whether people in natural scenes attract attention and “pop out” or, alternatively, are at least searched for more efficiently than targets of another category (machines). Observers in our study searched a visual array for dynamic or static scenes containing humans amidst scenes containing machines and vice versa. The arrays consisted of 2, 4, 6 or 8 scenes arranged in a circular array, with targets being present or absent. Search times increased with set size for dynamic and static human and machine targets, arguing against pop out. However, search for human targets was more efficient than for machine targets as indicated by shallower search slopes for human targets. Eye tracking further revealed that observers made more first fixations to human than to machine targets and that their on-target fixation durations were shorter for human compared to machine targets. In summary, our results suggest that searching for people in natural scenes is more efficient than searching for other categories even though people do not pop out."

We developed experimental methods to monitor autophagy in K. marxianus cells, identified the complete set of K. marxianus Atg homologs, and confirmed that each Atg homolog is engaged in autophagosome formation. Biochemical and bioinformatic analyses revealed that recombinant K. marxianus Atg proteins have superior thermostability and solubility as compared with S. cerevisiae Atg proteins, probably due to the shorter primary sequences of KmAtg proteins.

Morphologically, autophagy involves de novo formation of a double-membrane structure, called an autophagosome, that sequesters cytoplasmic materials. After the sequestration, the autophagosome fuses with lytic compartments (vacuoles in yeast and plants and lysosomes in mammals), leading to degradation of its contents (3Ohsumi Y.

Among these, 18 Atg proteins (Atg1-Atg10, Atg12-Atg14, Atg16-Atg18, Atg29, and Atg31), defined as core Atg proteins (1Nakatogawa H. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dynamics and diversity in autophagy mechanisms: lessons from yeast.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), are crucial for the process of autophagosome formation. These Atg proteins are functionally and hierarchically classified into six subgroups as follows: the Atg1 complex (Atg1, Atg13, Atg17, Atg29, and Atg31); a vesicular membrane protein required for the early step of autophagosome formation (Atg9); the autophagy-specific PtdIns 3-kinase complex (Atg6 and Atg14; also includes Vps15 and Vps34); the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate effector complex (Atg2 and Atg18); and two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems (Atg3, Atg4, Atg5, Atg7, Atg8, Atg10, Atg12, and Atg16). Consequently, most of the key findings concerning the molecular basis of autophagosome formation have been obtained in the model yeast S. cerevisiae. In particular, the members of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems have been well characterized, because several lines of structure-based analyses (9Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Obara K.

However, these structural and biochemical studies have been limited to a subset of the Atg proteins, because the rest of Atg proteins are difficult to prepare as recombinant proteins and cannot be purified efficiently from yeast cells.

One of the major problems in preparation of recombinant Atg proteins, most of which have been derived thus far from S. cerevisiae and mammals, is the modest stability of these proteins. We predicted that recombinant proteins derived from thermotolerant organisms would exhibit superior stability against high temperature and chemical reagents relative to their counterparts from S. cerevisiae. As an illustration of this principle, a heat-resistant TaqDNA polymerase derived from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus is widely used in polymerase chain reaction techniques (19Chien A. Edgar D.B. Trela J.M. Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophileThermus aquaticus.J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1550-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently, Amlacher et al.

Hence, we attempted to utilize the thermotolerant yeast strain Kluyveromyces marxianus DMKU3-1042, which can grow at temperatures above 49 °C (21Limtong S. Sringiew C. Yongmanitchai W.

In this study, we first identified the complete set of core Atg proteins of K. marxianus and then investigated their thermostability and solubility by biochemical analyses. Complementation assays showed that the K. marxianus Atg homologs can functionally replace their counterparts in S. cerevisiae cells. We propose that K. marxianus could be useful as a new model organism for further elucidation of the molecular details of autophagy. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. For cultivation of S. cerevisiae and K. marxianus cells, standard protocols of S. cerevisiae studies were used (22Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C in nutrient-rich medium YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or SD/CA (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.5% casamino acids, 2% glucose) supplemented with 20 μg/ml adenine, 20 μg/ml uracil, and/or 20 μg/ml tryptophan. To induce autophagy, yeast cells were transferred to nitrogen starvation medium SD(−N) (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose) or treated with 0.2 μg/ml rapamycin (Sigma). Gene deletions of S. cerevisiae cells were performed by using pFA6a-kanMX6, pFA6a-hphNT1, and pFA6a-natNT2 plasmids as reported previously (23Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S.

The K. marxianus cells expressing GFP-KmAtg8 were constructed; a DNA fragment, including the KmATG8 promoter, the KmATG8 gene, and the KmATG8 terminator (from 1000-bp upstream region of the initiation codon to 250-bp downstream region of the termination codon of the KmATG8 gene), was amplified from genomic DNA of K. marxianus and cloned into pFA6a-kanMX6 (23Janke C.

A BamHI site was introduced into the resultant plasmid just downstream of the first codon of the KmATG8 gene by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), and a DNA fragment encoding GFP was inserted into the BamHI site, yielding pFA6a-GFP-KmAtg8-kanMX6. A DNA fragment, including the KmATG8 promoter, the GFP gene, the KmATG8 gene, and the KmATG8 terminator, was amplified from pFA6a-GFP-KmAtg8-kanMX6 and integrated into the K. marxianus chromosome as reported previously (24Abdel-Banat B.M. Nonklang S. Hoshida H. Akada R.

The plasmids for integration of GFP-KmAtg8FG and GFP-KmAtg8FA were constructed by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The plasmids for expression of KmAtg proteins in S. cerevisiae cells under control of their own promoter were constructed as follows: a DNA fragment, including the KmATG promoter, the KmATG gene, and the KmATG terminator (from 1000-bp upstream region of the initiation codon to 250-bp downstream region of the termination codon of the KmATG gene), was amplified from genomic DNA of K. marxianus and cloned into pRS316 (25Sikorski R.S.

The plasmids for expression of KmAtg proteins in S. cerevisiae cells under control of ScTDH3 (GPD) promoter were constructed as follows: a DNA fragment including the KmATG gene was amplified from genomic DNA of K. marxianus and cloned into pRS316-GPDpro-PGKterm by using an In-Fusion cloning kit (Clontech). Cells were sandwiched between copper grids and rapidly frozen in liquid propane (−175 °C) using Leica EM CPC (Leica), followed by substitution fixation in 2% osmium tetroxide dissolved in acetone containing 3% distilled water. Specimens were embedded in Quetol-651, sectioned, and observed with a transmission electron microscope (H-7500, Hitachi). Fluorescence microscopy was performed at room temperature, as reported previously (26Yamamoto H. Kakuta S. Watanabe T.M. Kitamura A. Sekito T. Kondo-Kakuta C. Ichikawa R. Kinjo M. Ohsumi Y. Atg9 vesicles are an important membrane source during early steps of autophagosome formation.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 198: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), by using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX-71, Olympus) equipped with an electron-multiplying CCD camera (ImagEM, C9100-13, Hamamatsu Photonics) and 150× TIRF objective (UAPON 150XOTIRF, NA/1.45, Olympus). A 488-nm blue laser (20 milliwatts, Spectra-Physics) and a 561-nm yellow laser (25 milliwatt, Cobalt) were used for excitation of GFP and FM4-64, respectively. To increase image intensity and decrease background intensity, specimens were illuminated with a highly inclined laser beam (27Tokunaga M. Imamoto N. Sakata-Sogawa K. Highly inclined thin illumination enables clear single-molecule imaging in cells.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). For simultaneous observation of GFP and FM4-64, both lasers were combined and guided without an excitation filter, and the fluorescence was filtered with a Di01-R488/561-25 dichroic mirror (Semrock) and an Em01-R488/568-25 bandpass filter (Semrock) and separated into two channels using a U-SIP splitter (Olympus) equipped with a DM565HQ dichroic mirror (Olympus). The fluorescence was further filtered with an FF02-525/50-25 bandpass filter (Semrock) for the GFP channel and an FF01-624/40-25 bandpass filter (Semrock) for the FM4-64 channel. Images were acquired using AQUACOSMOS software (Hamamatsu Photonics) and processed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). ScAtg3, ScAtg7, and ScAtg8 were prepared as described previously (17Nakatogawa H. Ichimura Y. Ohsumi Y.

ScAtg10 was prepared as described previously (28Yamaguti M. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of Atg10.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). KmAtg7 and KmAtg10 were prepared as described previously (29Yamaguchi M. Noda N.N. Yamamoto H. Shima T. Kumeta H.

KmAtg3 and KmAtg8 were prepared as described previously (30Yamaguchi M. Matoba K. Sawada R. Fujioka Y. Nakatogawa H. Yamamoto H. Kobashigawa Y. Hoshida H. Akada R. Ohsumi Y. Noda N.N. Inagaki F. Noncanonical recognition and UBL loading of distinct E2s by autophagy-essential Atg7.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1250-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For NMR spectrometry of ScAtg10 and KmAtg10, 15N-labeled proteins were prepared by growing Escherichia coli cells in M9 medium using 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. Recombinant proteins (20 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT supplemented with 50,000th volume of SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) were heated from 25 to 95 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The fluorescence intensities were measured using an Mx3005P Real Time quantitative PCR system (Agilent Technologies) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 530 nm. The midpoint temperature of the unfolding transition (Tm) was determined using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software) from curve fitting to a Boltzmann equation (31Niesen F.H. Berglund H. Vedadi M. The use of differential scanning fluorimetry to detect ligand interactions that promote protein stability.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2212-22121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). NMR experiments were carried out at 298 K on a Varian UNITY INOVA 600 spectrometer. The sample solution of the 15N-labeled ScAtg10 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, and the 15N-labeled KmAtg10 in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl were prepared for measurements of 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The NMR spectra were processed by NMRpipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar), and data analysis was conducted using the Sparky program (33Kneller D.G. Goddard T.D. SPARKY. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar). One prospective approach to further understanding autophagy is utilization of novel organisms with advantageous features for investigating the molecular functions of Atg proteins. Here, we focused on a newly isolated thermotolerant yeast strain, K. marxianus (Km) DMKU3-1042, which can grow at temperatures up to 49 °C (21Limtong S. Sringiew C. Yongmanitchai W. Production of fuel ethanol at high temperature from sugar cane juice by a newly isolatedKluyveromyces marxianus.Bioresour. Technol. 2007; 98: 3367-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and whose genome sequence was determined recently (34Lertwattanasakul N. Kosaka T. Hosoyama A. Suzuki Y. Rodrussamee N. Matsutani M. Murata M. Fujimoto N. Suprayogi Tsuchikane K. Limtong S. Fujita N. Yamada M. Genetic basis of the highly efficient yeastKluyveromyces marxianus: complete genome sequence and transcriptome analyses.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2015; 8: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By bioinformatic approaches, we compared all of the open reading frames (ORFs) of the thermotolerant yeast K. marxianus and the model yeast S. cerevisiae. At first, we analyzed overall sequence alignments between K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae proteins (3,355 ORF pairs from 4,564 K. marxianus ORFs and 5,882 S. cerevisiae ORFs) using the BLAST and ClustalW web servers (Fig. 1A). These analyses showed that housekeeping proteins such as ribosomal proteins, mitochondrial proteins, and proteins involved in metabolism and nutrient utilization are nearly of the same length in S. cerevisiae and K. marxianus (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 2), potentially due to the fundamental importance of these proteins in cell proliferation. By contrast, several subgroups of K. marxianus proteins, annotated as involved in protein degradation, chromosome segregation, and morphogenesis, had significantly shortened primary sequences (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 2), potentially reflecting genetic diversity caused by adaptation to high temperature conditions, implying that these shortened K. marxianus proteins could have higher thermostability as compared with the S. cerevisiae counterparts. Bioinformatic analyses also showed that almost half of the K. marxianus proteins (48.7%, 1,635 ORFs) are shorter than their S. cerevisiae counterparts (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table 2), and the rest are nearly the same length (24.7%, 828 ORFs) or longer (26.6%, 892 ORFs). The total numbers of the comparable amino acid residues were 1,777,544 from K. marxianus ORFs and 1,799,483 from S. cerevisiae ORFs (supplemental Table 2), indicating that K. marxianus proteins are on average 1.22% shorter than S. cerevisiae proteins. Next, we analyzed the predicted unfoldability of K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae proteins using the FoldIndex web server (35Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Sussman J.L. FoldIndex: a simple tool to predict whether a given protein sequence is intrinsically unfolded.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). FoldIndex scores calculated from the amino acid sequences of K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae (3,355 ORF pairs) revealed that K. marxianus proteins are relatively less disordered than their S. cerevisiae counterparts (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table 3); the average scores of K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae ORFs were 0.0969 and 0.0934, respectively (Fig. 1C, p = 7.14E-8). In particular, the K. marxianus proteins that are shorter than S. cerevisiae counterparts are significantly less disordered (Fig. 1D, left, p = 5.08E-14). Additionally, K. marxianus proteins that are nearly the same length as their S. cerevisiae counterparts are also relatively less disordered (Fig. 1D, middle, p = 1.26E-6). Taken together, we found that almost half of the K. marxianus proteins are shorter in length and have a more ordered secondary structure than their S. cerevisiae counterparts, which might contribute to the superior thermotolerance of K. marxianus. Homology searches of the K. marxianus genome sequence identified a complete set of core KmAtg proteins by their sequence similarity to those of S. cerevisiae (Sc). As shown in Fig. 1B, most KmAtg proteins are apparently shorter than ScAtg proteins (located on the left side of the blue box indicating Km < Sc in Fig. 1B) and have relatively low identity (Figs. 1B and 2A), as compared with other housekeeping K. marxianus proteins (Fig. 1A). These features of KmAtg proteins strongly raised the possibility that KmAtg proteins has superior thermostability as compared with the ScAtg counterparts. In addition to KmAtg proteins, we identified several vacuolar enzymes frequently used in the autophagy field (Pep4, Prb1, Pho8, and Ape1) (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we first tried to develop experimental methods to assess autophagy in K. marxianus cells. One of the easiest ways to evaluate the progression of autophagy is to monitor intravacuolar accumulation of autophagy-related structures called autophagic bodies (36Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed several morphological analyses, including electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy, to examine autophagy in K. marxianus cells. To observe accumulation of autophagic bodies, we deleted the KmPEP4 gene from K. marxianus cells; ScPep4 is a putative master enzyme required for activation of the vacuolar hydrolases responsible for degradation of autophagic bodies (36Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy in yeast demonstrated with proteinase-deficient mutants and conditions for its induction.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), and KmPep4 is highly conserved in K. marxianus as a single gene product (Fig. 2A, 73.8% identical to ScPep4). Electron microscopy revealed that in Kmpep4Δ cells treated with the autophagy-inducing drug rapamycin, a large number of autophagic bodies accumulated in the vacuolar lumen (Fig. 2B, middle panel). This observation indicates that upon rapamycin treatment, autophagy was efficiently induced in K. marxianus cells. Next, we deleted the KmATG8 gene to determine whether KmAtg8 contributes to autophagosome formation, because Atg8 and its mammalian homolog LC3 have been widely used as an autophagosomal marker (37Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Formation process of autophagosome is traced with Apg8/Aut7p in yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 38Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar); furthermore, among the KmAtg homologs, KmAtg8 has the highest identity to its S. cerevisiae counterpart (Fig. 2A, 85.3% identical to ScAtg8). As expected, electron microscopy revealed that no autophagic bodies formed in the absence of KmAtg8 (Fig. 2B, right panel), confirming that KmAtg8 is involved in autophagosome formation in K. marxianus. We next developed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, a method for quantitatively assessing autophagic activity that was originally established in S. cerevisiae (39Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Novel system for monitoring autophagy in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The vacuolar alkaline phosphatase KmPho8 is also conserved as a single gene product in K. marxia"

We aimed to assess the interaction between metabolic factors and fibrosis in Taiwanese NASH patients. Methods A total of 130 biopsy-proven Taiwanese NASH patients (94 males, age = 43.0 ± 13.0 years) were consecutively enrolled. Their demographic, metabolic profiles and histopathological manifestations were analyzed. Results Twenty-four (18.5%) NASH patients were non-obese. Thirty-three (25.4%) patients had significant fibrosis (F2) or more: 22 (16.9%) patients were of F2, whilst 11 (8.5%) patients were of advanced fibrosis (F3-4). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension were 60.8%, 39.4%, and 61.5%, respectively. There was a significant inverse correlation between hyperuricemia and fibrosis stages, ranging from 48.4% of F0-1, 33.3% of F2, and 9.1% of F3-4, respectively (P = 0.01, linear trend). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a decreased serum albumin level (OR = 40.0, 95% CI = 4.5–300, P = 0.001) and normal uric acid level (OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.5–21.7, P = 0.01) were the significant factors associated with significant fibrosis. Conclusions Hyperuricemia inversely predicts fibrosis stages. Females might carry a more disease severity than males in Taiwanese NASH patients."
https://openalex.org/W1749485375,"Fiber tractography plays an important role in exploring the architectural organization of fiber trajectories, both in fundamental neuroscience and in clinical applications. With the advent of diffusion MRI (dMRI) approaches that can also model “crossing fibers”, the complexity of the fiber network as reconstructed with tractography has increased tremendously. Many pathways interdigitate and overlap, which hampers an unequivocal 3D visualization of the network and impedes an efficient study of its organization. We propose a novel fiber tractography visualization approach that interactively and selectively adapts the transparency rendering of fiber trajectories as a function of their orientation to enhance the visibility of the spatial context. More specifically, pathways that are oriented (locally or globally) along a user-specified opacity axis can be made more transparent or opaque. This substantially improves the 3D visualization of the fiber network and the exploration of tissue configurations that would otherwise be largely covered by other pathways. We present examples of fiber bundle extraction and neurosurgical planning cases where the added benefit of our new visualization scheme is demonstrated over conventional fiber visualization approaches."

DHEA-s levels peak in young adults and decline thereafter with age. DHEA-s has previously been shown to be lower in individuals reporting prolonged stress. This study investigates DHEA-s levels in patients with clinical burnout, a disorder caused by long-term psychosocial stress.122 patients (51% men) and 47 controls (51% men) in the age 25-54 years were included in the study. DHEA-s levels were compared between patients and controls in the whole sample and within each of the three 10-year-interval age groups.In the youngest age group (25-34 years), DHEA-s levels were on average 25% lower in the patients (p = 0.006). The differences in DHEA-s levels between patients and controls were more pronounced among female than male participants (on average 32% and 13% lower, respectively). There were no differences in DHEA-s levels between patients and controls in the age group 35-44 years (p = 0.927) or 45-54 years (p = 0.897) or when analyzing all age groups together (p = 0.187).The study indicates that levels of the health promoting ""youth"" hormone DHEA-s are low in younger burnout patients. The fact that younger adults have much higher DHEA-s levels and more pronounced inter-subject variability in DHEA-s levels than older individuals might explain why burnout status differentiates patients from controls only among the youngest patients included in this study."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the functional ITPA variants and hematological side effects during antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon (PegIFN) and RBV. Patients and Methods This cohort study included all consecutive Caucasian patients treated for chronic HCV infection with PegIFN and RBV between 2000 and 2009 for whom a serum sample was available for genetic testing. The predicted inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) activity was based on the genotypes of the SNPs rs1127354 and rs7270101. Decline in hemoglobin (Hb) during antiviral therapy, as well as dose reductions, blood transfusions and use of erythropoietin were assessed. Results In total, 213 patients were included. The predicted ITPase activity was normal among 152 (71%) patients; 61 (29%) patients had ITPase deficiency. By multivariable linear regression, RBV dose in mg per kilogram (Beta 0.09, 95%CI 0.04–0.13, p<0.001) and normal ITPase activity (Beta 0.89, 95%CI 0.64–1.14, p<0.001) were associated with more Hb decline at week 4 of treatment. Patients with normal ITPase activity underwent more dose adjustments of RBV than patients with ITPase deficiency (19(13%) vs 1(2%),p = 0.014) and received erythropoietin more frequently (12 (8%) vs 0 (0%),p = 0.024). Conclusion Genetic variants in the ITPA gene protected against RBV treatment-induced anemia among Caucasian patients with chronic HCV infection. Patients with normal ITPase activity underwent more dose reductions of RBV and received erythropoietin more frequently."
https://openalex.org/W2259187403,"Lung stretch is critical for normal lung development and for compensatory lung growth after pneumonectomy (PNX), but the mechanisms by which strain induces matrix remodeling are unclear. Our prior work demonstrated an association of chymotrypsin-like elastase 1 (Cela1) with lung elastin remodeling, and that strain triggered a near-instantaneous elastin-remodeling response. We sought to determine whether stretch regulates Cela1 expression and Cela1 binding to lung elastin. In C57BL/6J mice, Cela1 protein increased 176-fold during lung morphogenesis. Cela1 was covalently bound to serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1, resulting in a higher molecular mass in lung homogenate compared to pancreas homogenate. Post-PNX, Cela1 mRNA increased 6-fold, protein 3-fold, and Cela1-positive cells 2-fold. Cela1 was expressed predominantly in alveolar type II cells in the embryonic lung and predominantly in CD90-positive lung fibroblasts postnatally. During compensatory lung growth, Cela1 expression was induced in nonproliferative mesenchymal cells. In ex vivo mouse lung sections, stretch increased Cela1 binding to lung tissue by 46%. Competitive inhibition with soluble elastin completely abrogated this increase. Areas of stretch-induced elastase activity and Cela1 binding colocalized. The stretch-dependent expression and binding kinetics of Cela1 indicate an important role in stretch-dependent remodeling of the peripheral lung during development and regeneration."

The method was then applied to the isomerization of the phosphorylated intermediate associated with the Ca2+ release process E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+. In the wild type, Ca2+ release occurs concomitantly with EP isomerization fitting with rate-limiting isomerization (E1PCa2 → E2PCa2) followed by very rapid Ca2+ release. In contrast, with alanine mutants of Leu119 and Tyr122 on the cytoplasmic part of the second transmembrane helix (M2) and Ile179 on the A domain, Ca2+ release in 10 μm Ca2+ lags EP isomerization, indicating the presence of a transient E2P state with bound Ca2+. The results suggest that these residues function in Ca2+ affinity reduction in E2P, likely via a structural rearrangement at the cytoplasmic part of M2 and a resulting association with the A and P domains, therefore leading to Ca2+ release. The mechanism whereby events in and around the catalytic site/head of Ca2+-ATPase effect Ca2+ release to the lumen from the transmembrane helices remains elusive.

The enzyme is activated by the binding of two cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions at the high-affinity transport sites (E2 to E1Ca2, steps 1 and 2) and autophosphorylated at Asp351 with MgATP to form an ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P, step 3), which reacts with ADP to regenerate ATP in the reverse reaction. Upon E1P formation, the two bound Ca2+ are occluded in the transport sites (E1PCa2). The subsequent isomeric transition to the ADP-insensitive E2P form results in rearrangements of the Ca2+ binding sites to deocclude Ca2+, open the release path, and reduce the affinity, therefore releasing Ca2+ into the lumen (steps 4 and 5). Finally, the Asp351-acylphosphate in E2P is hydrolyzed to form a Ca2+-unbound inactive E2 state (step 6). sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase thapsigargin. The EP isomerization associated with luminal Ca2+ release is a key rate-limiting process and involves a large rotation of the A domain, its association with the P domain and the cytoplasmic part of M2, and an inclination of associated A and P domains and the connected helices M2/M1 and M4/M5 via a steric effect of a M1/M2 V-shaped body (4.Toyoshima C.

We have found previously that the hydrophobic association of Leu119/Tyr122 on the cytoplasmic part of M2 with the A and P domains (Tyr122 hydrophobic cluster) is critical for formation of the Ca2+-released E2P ground state structure, with hydrolytic ability at the catalytic site and a properly opened luminal Ca2+ release path with reduced affinity at the transport sites (16.Yamasaki K.

The Tyr122 hydrophobic cluster is formed with residues on the cytoplasmic part of M2 (Tyr122/Leu119), A domain (Ile179/Leu180), P domain (Val705/Val726), and A/M3 linker (Ile232), thereby producing a most compactly organized head in E2P. The postulated E2PCa2 transient intermediate was successfully trapped in the Ca2+-occluded state (before deocclusion) by elongation of the A/M1′ linker with a two- or four-glycine insertion. Consistently in this state, the Tyr122 hydrophobic cluster was shown to not yet be fully formed. The finding demonstrates the critical role of the strain in this linker, probably to effect inclination of the A and P domains and connected helices required for deocclusion and Ca2+ release (19.Daiho T.

Further understanding of Ca2+ binding/release processes in the transport cycle and roles of residues involved, especially the dynamic key process E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+, is hampered by an inability to determine and detect the bound but deoccluded Ca2+ in minute amounts of expressed wild type and mutants obtained from cultured cells. In this study, we developed a method to determine the bound Ca2+ in the non-phosphorylated state as well as in the phosphorylated state of expressed enzymes. We took advantage of the rapid occlusion in E1PCa2 of bound Ca2+, from either E1Ca2 or E2P species (E2P and, possibly, the transient E2P state with bound Ca2+) by addition of a high concentration (10 mm) of Ca2+ (plus ATP for E1Ca2) (21.Yamada S.

The results indicate the presence of a transient E2P state with bound but deoccluded Ca2+ and show that Leu119 and Tyr122 on the cytoplasmic part of M2 and Ile179 on the A domain function via their association to reduce Ca2+ affinity during E2P processing and, thereby, to accelerate Ca2+ release into the lumen. The detailed analyses suggest that a possibly stepwise assembly of the residues into the Tyr122 hydrophobic cluster takes place for proper Ca2+ handling (namely, deocclusion, affinity reduction, and release) and, therefore, Ca2+ transport coupled with EP processing. QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was utilized for the substitution of residues in rabbit SERCA1a cDNA. The ApaI-KpnI or KpnI-SalI restriction fragment was ligated back into the corresponding region in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 expression vector (30.Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K.

The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells with Lipofectamine and PlusTM reagent (Invitrogen), and the microsomes were prepared from COS-1 cells as described previously (18.Yamasaki K. Wang G. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. Roles of Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster and K+ binding in Ca2+-releasing process of ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.J. Biol.

Microsomes expressing wild-type or mutant SERCA1a prepared from the COS-1 cells were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi under the conditions described in the figure legends. The total amount of EP was determined following the addition of trichloroacetic acid. The amount of E2P was determined by adding an equal volume of a solution containing 2 mm ADP and 5 mm EGTA, followed by the trichloroacetic acid addition 1 s after the ADP addition. The amount of EP was quantified with digital autoradiography after separation by 5% SDS-PAGE at pH 6.0 according to Weber and Osborn (32.Weber K. Osborn M. The reliability of molecular weight determinations by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as described previously (33.Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. Mutations of Arg198 in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase cause inhibition of hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate formed from inorganic phosphate.FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of EP in expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity determined in the absence of Ca2+. In all mutants and the wild type, the background level was less than 1% of the total amount of EP. Microsomes were incubated with 0–10 μm 45Ca2+ at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 1 μm thapsigargin (TG), a highly specific and subnanomolar affinity inhibitor of SERCA that fixes the enzyme in the Ca2+-unbound E2 state (34.Sagara Y. Inesi G. Inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport ATPase by thapsigargin at subnanomolar concentrations.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50 μl of reaction mixture was spotted on a membrane filter (Millipore, 0.45-μm mixed cellulose membrane HAWP) and washed for 3 s with 1 ml of Ca2+ binding assay medium containing 50 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP. Other experimental conditions are described in detail in the figure legends. The 45Ca2+ remaining on the filter was quantified by digital autoradiography. The amount of Ca2+ specifically bound to the Ca2+-ATPase (trapped as occluded in E1PCa2) was obtained by subtracting the amount of nonspecific Ca2+-binding background determined in the presence of TG. We confirmed that all mutants retained TG sensitivity by observing that TG (1 μm used in this study) completely inhibits EP formation from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+, showing its validity for the background determination. The background level of nonspecific Ca2+ binding (in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+) was ∼100 pmol/mg of microsomal protein, which is 30–50% of total Ca2+ binding (see Fig. 4, A and B). Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (35.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc.). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated by the Calcon program. Three-dimensional models of SERCA1a were produced by the program VMD (36.Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38428) Google Scholar). To fix the bound Ca2+ in E1Ca2 in an occluded form in E1PCa2, it is necessary to rapidly phosphorylate E1Ca2 to E1PCa2 before Ca2+release and to stabilize E1PCa2 and prevent its decay during thorough washing. In analysis of the EP isomerization/Ca2+ release process E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+, the E2P species need to be rapidly converted to a stabilized E1PCa2 state. The crucial feature for the forward reaction is to add a very high concentration (10 mm) of Ca2+ together with ATP. E1PCa2 is extremely stable in a high concentration of Ca2+, probably because of Ca2+ replacing catalytic subsite Mg2+, as shown previously (23.Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Nakamura H.

Ca2+ versus Mg2+ coordination at the nucleotide-binding site of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This stabilization prevents possible Ca2+ exchange at the transport sites in the reverse conversion in E1PCa2 ↔ E2P + 2Ca2+. Actually, the Mg2+ at the catalytic subsite is not “occluded” in E1PCa2 and exchanges rapidly with Ca2+ at such a high concentration (26.Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Nakamura H.

Also, addition of a high concentration of Ca2+ rapidly converts E2P to the stable E1PCa2 in the reverse reaction (18.Yamasaki K. Wang G. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H.

In Fig. 2A, wild-type SERCA1a expressed in microsomes of COS-1 cells was incubated with 10 μm Ca2+ to form the E1Ca2 state in 7 mm Mg2+, and then [γ-32P]ATP plus an excess of EGTA or [γ-32P]ATP plus 10 mm Ca2+ was added in 0.1 m KCl, which accelerates E2P hydrolysis, causing E1PCa2 accumulation (37.Shigekawa M.

When ATP is added with EGTA, E1PCa2 forms very rapidly despite the removal of free Ca2+ and then decays slowly via the rate-limiting EP isomerization, followed by rapid hydrolysis. The maximum EP level immediately after ATP/EGTA addition, estimated by an extrapolation of the single exponential decay to zero time, is very close to that obtained with ATP plus 10 mm Ca2+. E1PCa2 formation in 10 mm Ca2+ is also rapid and reaches a maximum within ∼3 s, albeit slightly slower than that without free Ca2+ (i.e. with the substrate MgATP, consistent with previous kinetic studies (21.Yamada S.

Therefore, E1PCa2 formation and resulting Ca2+ occlusion by the simultaneous addition of ATP and 10 mm Ca2+ is rapid enough to trap almost all 45Ca2+ originally bound in E1Ca2 as an occluded E1PCa2 species before Ca2+ release and possible 45Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange (as demonstrated in Fig. 4). In Fig. 2B, the decay of E1PCa2 formed with [γ-32P]ATP in 10 μm Ca2+ and 7 mm Mg2+ was initiated by a cold (non-radioactive) ATP chase in various concentrations of Ca2+. The decay is slowed markedly with increasing Ca2+. Actually, E1PCa2 in 10 mm Ca2+ remains almost completely stable during the initial 3 s, a characteristic exploited in the Ca2+ binding assays in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9, FIGURE 10 as a period for membrane filter washing with 10 mm Ca2+.FIGURE 6Time courses of Ca2+ release and EP isomerization in mutant L119A. A, microsomes (MS) expressing mutant L119A (20 μg/ml microsomal protein) were incubated for 20 s with 10 μm 45Ca2+ in 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.3), 0.1 m KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 3 μm A23187. Then, at zero time (ATP + or −EGTA), phosphorylation was initiated by addition of 10 μm ATP with (open circles) or without 1 mm EGTA (closed circles), the mixture was spotted on the filter, and the amount of 45Ca2+ specifically bound to the Ca2+-ATPase was determined as in Fig. 5B. The values presented are the mean ± S.D. (n = 3–5). The solid lines show a single exponential fit, and the rates of the 45Ca2+ release thus determined are 0.10 s−1 in an excess of EGTA (open circles) and 0.05 s−1 in the presence of 10 μm 45Ca2+ (closed circles). B, inset, microsomes expressing the mutant L119A (40 μg/ml microsomal protein) in 10 μm Ca2+ were phosphorylated at zero time by mixing with an equal volume of a solution containing 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μm CaCl2 (circles) or 2 mm EGTA (triangles), and the total amount of EP (closed symbols) and the amount of E2P (open symbols) were determined at the indicated times as in Fig. 5A. Main panel, the fraction of E1P in the total amount of EP was calculated at each time point by subtracting the amount E2P from the total amount of EP (E1P plus E2P).

https://openalex.org/W2257589245,"We have investigated the potential role of molecular chaperones as modulators of the immune response by using α-synuclein (αSyn) as an aggregation-prone model protein. We first performed an in vitro immunoscreening with 21 preselected candidate chaperones and selected 2 from this set as displaying immunological activity with differential profiles, Grp94/Gp96 and FKBP4/52. We then immunized mice with both chaperone/α-synuclein combinations using monomeric or oligomeric α-synuclein (MαSyn or OαSyn, respectively), and we characterized the immune response generated in each case. We found that Grp94 promoted αSyn-specific T-helper (Th)1/Th17 and IgG1 antibody responses (up to a 3-fold increase) with MαSyn and OαSyn, respectively, coupled to a Th2-type general phenotype (generating 2.5-fold higher IgG1/IgG2 levels). In addition, we observed that FKBP4 favored a Th1-skewed phenotype with MαSyn but strongly supported a Th2-type phenotype with OαSyn (with a 3-fold higher IL-10/IFN-γ serum levels). Importantly, results from adoptive transfer of splenocytes from immunized animals in a Parkinson's disease mouse model indicates that these effects are robust, stable in time, and physiologically relevant. Taken together, Grp94 and FKBP4 are able to generate differential immune responses to α-synuclein-based immunizations, depending both on the nature of the chaperone and on the aggregation state of α-synuclein. Our work reveals that several chaperones are potential modulators of the immune response and suggests that different chaperones could be exploited to redirect the amyloid-elicited immunity both for basic studies of the immunological processes associated with neurodegeneration and for immunotherapy of pathologies associated with protein misfolding and aggregation.—Labrador-Garrido, A., Cejudo-Guillen, M., Daturpalli, S., Leal, M.

https://openalex.org/W1847967577,"Biomedical literature is an essential source of biomedical evidence. To translate the evidence for biomedicine study, researchers often need to carefully read multiple articles about specific biomedical issues. These articles thus need to be highly related to each other. They should share similar core contents, including research goals, methods, and findings. However, given an article r, it is challenging for search engines to retrieve highly related articles for r. In this paper, we present a technique PBC (Passage-based Bibliographic Coupling) that estimates inter-article similarity by seamlessly integrating bibliographic coupling with the information collected from context passages around important out-link citations (references) in each article. Empirical evaluation shows that PBC can significantly improve the retrieval of those articles that biomedical experts believe to be highly related to specific articles about gene-disease associations. PBC can thus be used to improve search engines in retrieving the highly related articles for any given article r, even when r is cited by very few (or even no) articles. The contribution is essential for those researchers and text mining systems that aim at cross-validating the evidence about specific gene-disease associations."
https://openalex.org/W2147481226,"Immunotherapy targeting glioblastoma initiating cells (GIC) is considered a promising strategy. However, GIC are prone to evade immune response and there is a need for potent adjuvants. IFN-β might enhance the immune response and here we define its net effect on the innate immunogenicity of GIC. The transcriptomes of GIC treated with IFN-β and controls were assessed by microarray-based expression profiling for altered expression of immune regulatory genes. Several genes involved in adaptive and innate immune responses were regulated by IFN-β. We validated these results using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and flow cytometry for corresponding protein levels. The up-regulation of the NK cell inhibitory molecules HLA-E and MHC class I was balanced by immune stimulating effects including the up-regulation of nectin-2. In 3 out of 5 GIC lines tested we found a net immune stimulating effect of IFN-β in cytotoxicity assays using NKL cells as effectors. IFN-β therefore warrants further investigation as an adjuvant for immunotherapy targeting GIC."
https://openalex.org/W1787669200,"Self-thinning is a dynamic equilibrium between forest growth and mortality at full site occupancy. Parameters of the self-thinning lines are often confounded by differences across various stand and site conditions. For overcoming the problem of hierarchical and repeated measures, we used hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate the self-thinning line. The results showed that the self-thinning line for Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.)Hook.) plantations was not sensitive to the initial planting density. The uncertainty of model predictions was mostly due to within-subject variability. The simulation precision of hierarchical Bayesian method was better than that of stochastic frontier function (SFF). Hierarchical Bayesian method provided a reasonable explanation of the impact of other variables (site quality, soil type, aspect, etc.) on self-thinning line, which gave us the posterior distribution of parameters of self-thinning line. The research of self-thinning relationship could be benefit from the use of hierarchical Bayesian method."
https://openalex.org/W2289813084,"The purpose of this study was to explore risk factors related to asthma prevalence among preschool and school-aged children using a representative national dataset from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted from 2009-2011. We evaluated the demographic information, health status, household environment, socioeconomic status, and parents' health status of 3,542 children aged 4-12 years. A sex-stratified multivariate logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals after accounting for primary sample units, stratification, and sample weights. The sex-specific asthma prevalence in the 4- to 12-year-old children was 7.39% in boys and 6.27% in girls. Boys and girls with comorbid atopic dermatitis were more likely to have asthma than those without atopic dermatitis (boys: OR = 2.20, p = 0.0071; girls: OR = 2.33, p = 0.0031). Boys and girls with ≥1 asthmatic parent were more likely to have asthma than those without asthmatic parents (boys: OR = 3.90, p = 0.0006; girls: OR = 3.65, p = 0.0138). As girls got older, the prevalence of asthma decreased (OR = 0.90, p = 0.0408). Girls residing in rural areas were 60% less likely to have asthma than those residing in urban areas (p = 0.0309). Boys with ≥5 family members were more likely to have asthma than those with ≤3 family members (OR = 2.45, p = 0.0323). The factors related to asthma prevalence may differ depending on sex in preschool and school-aged children. By understanding the characteristics of sex-based differences in asthma, individualized asthma management plans may be established clinically."
https://openalex.org/W1750728818,"Healthy individuals rarely have problems with wound healing. Most skin lesions heal rapidly and efficiently within one to two weeks. However, many medical and surgical complications can be attributed to deficiencies in wound repair. Open wounds have lost the barrier that protects tissues from bacterial invasion and allows the escape of vital fluids. Without expeditious healing, infections become more frequent. The CD24 gene encodes a heavily-glycosylated cell surface protein anchored to the membrane by phosphatidylinositol. CD24 plays an important role in the adaptive immune response and controls an important genetic checkpoint for homeostasis and autoimmune diseases in both mice and humans. We have previously shown that overexpression of CD24 results in increased proliferation and migration rates.To examine the role of CD24 in the wound healing process.An excisional model of wound healing was used and delayed wound healing was studied in genetically modified heat stable antigen (HSA/CD24)-deficient mice (HSA-/-) compared to wild-type (WT) mice.Large full-thickness skin wounds, excised on the back of mice, exhibited a significant delay in the formation of granulation tissue, and in wound closure when compared to their WTHSA+/+ littermates. Wounds were histologically analyzed and scored, based on the degree of cellular invasion, granulation tissue formation, vascularity, and re-epithelialization. Additionally, in stitched wounds, the HSA-/- mice failed to maintain their stitches; they did not hold and fell already 24 hours, revealing erythematous wound fields. Re-expression of HSA, delivered by lentivirus, restored the normal healing phenotype, within 24 hours post-injury, and even improved the healing in WT, and in BalbC mice.Delayed wound-healing in the absence of HSA/CD24 suggests that CD24 plays an important role in this process. Increased expression of CD24, even in the normal state, may be used to enhance wound repair."
https://openalex.org/W1852861686,"We examined whether intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone [1–34] (PTH[1–34]; 60 μg/kg/day) can prevent the negative effects of titanium (Ti) particles on implant fixation and periprosthetic osteolysis in a rat model. Eighteen adult male rats (12 weeks old, bones still growing) received intramedullary Ti implants in their bilateral femurs; 6 rats from the blank group received vehicle injections, and 12 rats from the control group and PTH treatment group received Ti particle injections at the time of operation and intra-articular injections 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively. Six of the rats that received Ti particles from the PTH group also received PTH[1–34] treatment. Six weeks postoperatively, all specimens were collected for assessment by X-ray, micro-CT, biomechanical, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dynamic histomorphometry. A lower BMD, BV/TV, Tb.N, maximal fixation strength, and mineral apposition rate were observed in the control group compared to the blank group, demonstrating that a periprosthetic osteolysis model had been successfully established. Administration of PTH[1–34] significantly increased the bone mineral density of the distal femur, BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, Con.D, SMI, and maximal fixation strength in the PTH group compared to that in the control group. SEM revealed higher bone–implant contact, thicker lamellar bone, and larger trabecular bone area in the PTH group than in the control group. A higher mineral apposition rate was observed in the PTH group compared to both the blank and control groups. These findings imply that intermittent administration of PTH[1–34] prevents periprosthetic osteolysis by promoting bone formation. The effects of PTH[1–34] were evaluated at a suprapharmacological dosage to the human equivalent in rats; therefore, additional studies are required to demonstrate its therapeutic potential in periprosthetic osteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1956537006,"Encephalitis presents with seizures in the acute phase and increases the risk of late unprovoked seizures and epilepsy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients with acute seizures due to encephalitis and epilepsy.Cases of acute pediatric encephalitis between January 2000 and December 2010 were reviewed. Clinical data, including onset at age, seizure type, seizure frequency, effects of antiepileptic drugs, and prognosis were analyzed.During the study period, 1038 patients (450 girls, 588 boys) were enrolled. Among them, 44.6% (463) had seizures in the acute phase, 33% had status epilepticus, and 26% (251) developed postencephalitic epilepsy. At one year of follow-up, 205 of the 251 patients with postencephalitic epilepsy were receiving antiepileptic drugs while 18% were seizure free even after discontinuing the antiepileptic drugs. Among those with postencephalitic epilepsy, 67% had favorable outcomes and were using <2 anti-epileptic drugs while 15% had intractable seizures and were using ≥ 2 antiepileptic drugs. After benzodiazepines, intravenous phenobarbital was preferred over phenytoin as treatment of postencephalitic seizures in the acute phase. For refractory status epilepticus, high-dose topiramate combined with intravenous high-dose phenobarbital or high-dose lidocaine had less side effects.Children with encephalitis have a high rate of postencephalitic epilepsy. Phenobarbital and clonazepam are the most common drugs used, alone or in combination, for postencephalitic epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2341912384,"Online social media activity can often be a precursor to disruptive events such as protests, strikes, and ""occupy"" movements. We have observed that such civil unrest can galvanize supporters through social networks and help recruit activists to their cause. Understanding the dynamics of social network cascades and extrapolating their future growth will enable an analyst to detect or forecast major societal events. Existing work has primarily used structural and temporal properties of cascades to predict their future behavior. But factors like societal pressure, alignment of individual interests with broader causes, and perception of expected benefits also affect protest participation in social media. Here we develop an analysis framework using a differential game theoretic approach to characterize the cost of participating in a cascade, and demonstrate how we can combine such cost features with classical properties to forecast the future behavior of cascades. Using data from Twitter, we illustrate the effectiveness of our models on the ""Brazilian Spring"" and Venezuelan protests that occurred in June 2013 and November 2013, respectively. We demonstrate how our framework captures both qualitative and quantitative aspects of how these uprisings manifest through the lens of tweet volume on Twitter social media."
https://openalex.org/W2198121894,"Our previous work has demonstrated that islet depolarization with KCl opens connexin36 hemichannels in β-cells of mouse pancreatic islets allowing the exchange of small metabolites with the extracellular medium. In this study, the opening of these hemichannels has been further characterized in rat islets and INS–1 cells. Taking advantage of hemicannels’opening, the uptake of extracellular ATP and its effect on insulin release were investigated. 70 mM KCl stimulated light emission by luciferin in dispersed rat islets cells transduced with the fire-fly luciferase gene: it was suppressed by 20 mM glucose and 50 μM mefloquine, a specific connexin36 inhibitor. Extracellular ATP was taken up or released by islets depolarized with 70 mM KCl at 5 mM glucose, depending on the external ATP concentration. 1 mM ATP restored the loss of ATP induced by the depolarization itself. ATP concentrations above 5 mM increased islet ATP content and the ATP/ADP ratio. No ATP uptake occurred in non-depolarized or KCl-depolarized islets simultaneously incubated with 50 μM mefloquine or 20 mM glucose. Extracellular ATP potentiated the secretory response induced by 70 mM KCl at 5 mM glucose in perifused rat islets: 5 mM ATP triggered a second phase of insulin release after the initial peak triggered by KCl-depolarization itself; at 10 mM, it increased both the initial, KCl-dependent, peak and stimulated a greater second phase of secretion than at 5 mM. These stimulatory effects of extracellular ATP were almost completely suppressed by 50 μM mefloquine. The magnitude of the second phase of insulin release due to 5 mM extracellular ATP was decreased by addition of 5 mM ADP (extracellular ATP/ADP ratio = 1). ATP acts independently of KATP channels closure and its intracellular concentration and its ATP/ADP ratio seems to regulate the magnitude of both the first (triggering) and second (amplifying) phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2206965250,"Myriophyllum elatinoides was reported to effectively treat wastewater by removing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, little is known about the abundance and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms associated with M. elatinoides purification systems. The objective of this research was to characterize the abundance and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in swine wastewater and determine the main nitrogen removal pathways. In this study, five different waters were treated by M. elatinoides in microcosms for one month. The five waters included tap water (Control), swine wastewater (SW), 50% diluted swine wastewater (50% SW), and two synthetic wastewaters: 200 mg NH4+-N L−1 (200 NH4+-N) and 400 mg NH4+-N L−1 (400 NH4+-N). The most dramatic changes were in NH4+-N and total N (TN) concentrations, with average removal rates of 84% and 90%, respectively, in the treatments containing swine wastewater. On days 7, 14, and 28, the dissolved oxygen (DO) increased by 81.8%, 210.4% and 136.5%, respectively, compared with on day 0, in the swine wastewater. The results also showed that the bacterial amoA (AOB) copy numbers in the sediments of the treatments were significantly higher than those of archaeal amoA (AOA) copy numbers (p = 0.015). In addition, the high DO concentrations in swine wastewater responded well to the high abundance of AOB. The AOA and AOB community distributions were positively related with NO3-N and were negatively related with DO in swine wastewater treatments. In summary, our experimental results suggested that the M. elatinoides purification system could improve the activity of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and consequently might contribute to the significant N removal from the swine wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2182357303,"Host plant interactions are likely key drivers of evolutionary processes involved in the diversification of phytophagous insects. Granivory has received substantial attention for its crucial role in shaping the interaction between plants and their seed parasites, but fine-scale mechanisms explaining the role of host plant reproductive biology on specialization of seed parasites remain poorly described. In a comparative approach using plant histological techniques, we tested the hypotheses that different seed parasite species synchronize their life cycles to specific stages in seed development, and that the stage they target depends on major differences in seed development programs. In a pinaceous system, seed storage products are initiated before ovule fertilization and the wasps target the ovule's nucellus during megagametogenesis, a stage at which larvae may benefit from the by-products derived from both secreting cells and dying nucellar cells. In a cupressaceous system, oviposition activity peaks later, during embryogenesis, and the wasps target the ovule's megagametophyte where larvae may benefit from cell disintegration during embryogenesis. Our cytohistological approach shows for the first time how, despite divergent oviposition targets, different parasite species share a common strategy that consists of first competing for nutrients with developing plant structures, and then consuming these developed structures to complete their development. Our results support the prediction that seed developmental program is an axis for specialization in seed parasites, and that it could be an important parameter in models of their ecological and taxonomic divergence. This study provides the basis for further investigating the possibility of the link between plant ontogeny and pre-dispersal seed parasitism."
https://openalex.org/W2257792903,"Delivery of antibodies to monitor key biomarkers of retinopathy in vivo represents a significant challenge because living cells do not take up immunoglobulins to cellular antigens. We met this challenge by developing novel contrast agents for retinopathy, which we used with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Biotinylated rabbit polyclonal to chick IgY (rIgPxcIgY) and phosphorylthioate-modified oligoDNA (sODN) with random sequence (bio-sODN-Ran) were conjugated with NeutrAvidin-activated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION). The resulting Ran-SPION-rIgPxcIgY carries chick polyclonal to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) as Ran-SPION-rIgP/cIgY-MAP2, or to rhodopsin (Rho) as anti-Rho-SPION-Ran. We examined the uptake of Ran-SPION-rIgP/cIgY-MAP2 or SPION-rIgP/cIgY-MAP2 in normal C57black6 mice (n = 3 each, 40 μg/kg, i.c.v.); we found retention of Ran-SPION-rIgP/cIgY-MAP2 using molecular contrast-enhanced MRI in vivo and validated neuronal uptake using Cy5-goat IgPxcIgY ex vivo. Applying this novel method to monitor retinopathy in a bilateral carotid artery occlusion-induced ocular ischemia, we observed pericytes (at d 2, using Gd-nestin, by eyedrop solution), significant photoreceptor degeneration (at d 20, using anti-Rho-SPION-Ran, eyedrops, P = 0.03, Student's t test), and gliosis in Müller cells (at 6 mo, using SPION-glial fibrillary acidic protein administered by intraperitoneal injection) in surviving mice (n ≥ 5). Molecular contrast-enhanced MRI results were confirmed by optical and electron microscopy. We conclude that chimera and molecular contrast-enhanced MRI provide sufficient sensitivity for monitoring retinopathy and for theranostic applications."
