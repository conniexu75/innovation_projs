The mechanisms by which JNK integrates with other signaling pathways and regulates the diverse cellular events are unclear. We found JNK, but not p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, to be persistently activated in apoptosis induced by γ radiation, UV-C, and anti-Fas treatment. Direct correlation was found between JNK activation and apoptosis induced by UV-C and γ radiation; however, JNK induction and apoptosis induced by Fas signaling were not well correlated. Overexpression of activated JNK1 caused cell death in transfected cells, and the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MAPK kinase 1 or JNK1 (but not a dominant-negative mutant of p38-MAPK or c-Raf) prevented the UV-C- and γ radiation-induced cell death. The inductions of JNK in T-cell activation and apoptosis were distinguished by the different activation patterns, transient versus persistent, respectively. Co-treatment with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (sodium orthovanadate) and T-cell activation signals (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin) prolonged JNK induction, followed by T-cell apoptosis. Our data revealed the requirement of the JNK pathway in radiation-induced apoptosis and implicated the importance of the duration of JNK activation in determining the cell fates. c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) participate in cellular responses to mitogenic stimuli, environmental stresses, and apoptotic agents.

Cell death is as important as cell proliferation in regulating development and homeostasis in multicellular organisms (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar). Physiological cell death is usually mediated through apoptosis, which is positively or negatively regulated by various extracellular factors. Most growth factors prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis, and deprivation of growth factors usually causes the induction of cell death in growth factor-dependent cells (3Rozengurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

Besides the physiological regulators of cell death, many environmental stresses also cause apoptosis (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar); however, the exact mechanism of stress-induced apoptosis remains unclear. Recent studies have identified c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), also called stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), to be involved in cellular responses to environmental stresses (6Hibi M. Lin A.

JNKs phosphorylate transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF-2, and Elk-1 and strongly augment their transcriptional activity (21Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J.

JNK induction by TNF-α and various environmental stresses implies that JNK may regulate gene expression or other biochemical functions in cells under detrimental conditions. One potential function of JNK may be the initiation of programmed cell death. It was shown that overexpression of MEKK, the JNK kinase kinase, had a lethal effect on fibroblasts (24Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, the tumor suppressor p53, which is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis (26Lowe S.W. Schmitt S.W. Smith B.A. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar), was suggested to be a substrate of JNK1 in vivo (27Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5511-5518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the JNK kinase cascade may participate in apoptosis. Previously, we showed that JNK1 was persistently activated in Jurkat cells exposed to a lethal dose of γ radiation (10Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Here, we report that JNK, but not p38-MAPK or ERK2, was significantly activated in apoptotic cells treated with γ radiation, UV-C, and anti-Fas. However, JNK induction was well correlated with the radiation-induced apoptosis, but not with Fas-mediated apoptosis. Overexpression of JNK1 caused cell death in the transfected cells; in contrast, expression of dominant-negative mutants of the JNK kinase cascade blocked γ radiation and UV-C-induced cell death. JNK activation in T-cell apoptosis was characterized by a persistent kinetics in contrast to the transient induction in T-cell activation. Co-treatment of T-cell activation signals PMA plus ionomycin with a phosphatase inhibitor extended the duration of JNK1 activation and caused apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Therefore, JNK is involved in both cell proliferation and apoptosis, and the duration of JNK induction may be the crucial factor in mediating the signaling decision. Human Jurkat T cells (clone J.LEI) and 293T human embryonic kidney cells were cultured as described previously (28Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody ascites (clone 9.3; used at a 1:1,000 dilution) were provided by Dr. L. Chen (Bristol-Meyers Squibb Research Institute; Seattle, WA). The anti-Fas monoclonal Ab (CH-11, immunoglobulin M) and interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor Z-YVDA-FK were purchased from Kamiya Biomedical. Rabbit anti-JNK1 antiserum (Ab101) was described previously (10Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Anti-ERK2 and anti-p38-MAPK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PMA and ionomycin were obtained from Sigma. Myelin basic protein (Bio-Rad) was prepared at a concentration of 5 μg/μl in kinase reaction buffer. GST-Jun(1-79)-expressing plasmid was obtained from Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). pCIneo-JNK1, pEECMV, pCMV-ΔMEKK1, and pUna3-MEKK1(KR) were described previously (28Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Cells were γ-irradiated by using a Gammacell 1000 137Cs source (10 Gy/min), and UV irradiation was performed by using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). To prepare whole cell extract, 107 cells were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM Na3VO4). The cell lysates were vigorously vortexed several times and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 3 min. The DNA fragmentation assay was performed as described previously (10Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This assay was performed as described (29Memon S.A. Petrak D. Moreno M. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 1 × 106/100-mm culture dish. Cells were co-transfected with pCMV-βGal plasmid expressing β-galactosidase and empty vectors or plasmids expressing a kinase as indicated. The calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media) was used for transfection. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and lysed in a buffer containing 250 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 5 mM EDTA. To determine the β-galactosidase activity, 2 μl of each lysate was diluted in 48 μl of distilled water and mixed with 50 μl of 2 × reaction buffer (200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside) in a 96-well microtiter plate. The reaction was carried out at 37°C for 1 h and was terminated by adding 150 μl of 1 M Na2CO4. The absorbance at 420 nm was measured using a microtiter plate reader (SLT Spectra). Cells were transfected as described above with duplicates performed for each transfection. After removing the transfection mixture, the cells were incubated in complete medium for 6 h for recovery and then treated with or without radiation. Cells were harvested 24 h after radiation and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The fixed cells were washed with PBS once, resuspended in staining solution (PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM K4(Fe(CN)4), 10 mM K3(Fe(CN)4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM X-gal) for 2 h, and then washed with PBS twice. The ratio of β-galactosidase-expressing cells (blue) were examined with a hemacytometer. Cell survival was determined as (% of blue cells in irradiated group/% of blue cells in nonirradiated group) × 100%. An apoptosis detection kit (R & D Systems) was used to determine apoptotic cells. Cells after different treatments were stained with annexin V-fluorescein and propidium iodide by following the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry (Epic Profile, Coulter Co.). For DNA staining, 106 cells were collected and washed with PBS once and then fixed with 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were washed with PBS to remove residual ethanol, pelleted, and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide (Sigma; 50 μg/ml). The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Forward light scatter characteristics were used to exclude the cell debris from the analysis. Apoptotic cells were determined by their hypochromic, subdiploid staining profiles. A solid-phase kinase assay was performed as described previously (6Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Immunocomplex kinase assays were carried out as described (30Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) with some modifications. MAP kinases were precipitated by incubation with specific antibodies and protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad) in incubation buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 50 mM glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM Na3VO4). The precipitates were washed twice with incubation buffer and twice with LiCl buffer (500 mM LiCl, 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and twice with kinase buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.6, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM Na3VO4) and then mixed with 5 μg of the indicated substrates, 15 μM ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was performed at 30°C for 30 min and then terminated with an equal volume of SDS sampling buffer. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. In our previous report, we showed that JNK is activated by γ radiation in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of γ radiation to activate JNK and to induce apoptosis are correlated (10Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Since different members of the MAP kinase family are usually coordinately regulated, e.g. JNKs and ERKs are activated by mitogenic signals (17Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Dérijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), and environmental stresses or proinflammatory cytokines induce JNK and p38-MAPK kinase activities simultaneously (16Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar), we examined whether apoptotic signals specifically induced JNK activation or whether they also activated other MAP kinases. A lethal dose of γ radiation (100 Gy) induced apoptosis (as determined by DNA fragmentation and propidium staining; 10Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar and data not shown) and persistent JNK1 activation in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). γ radiation also induced the p38-MAPK activation (Fig. 1A), but the induction was weaker than the JNK1 induction. UV light is a potent agent for apoptosis (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar) and JNK induction (6Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). However, the JNK activation induced by a low dose of UV light was reported to be rapid and transient (8Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). After irradiating the Jurkat cells with a lethal dose of UV-C (300 J/m2), we observed an immediate JNK1 induction within 30 min (Fig. 1B), which was followed by a sustained JNK1 kinase activation. We did not detect any p38-MAPK induction paralleled with JNK1 activation after the lethal UV radiation (Fig. 1B). In both γ and UV radiation, ERK2 activity did not change significantly in the early phase, but gradually decreased 5-6 h after radiation (Fig. 1, A and B). Besides JNK activation in radiation-induced apoptosis, we detected a sustained JNK induction, which coincided with the DNA fragmentation (data not shown), in Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1C). These results revealed that apoptotic signals strongly induced JNK activation but did not significantly affect other MAP kinases. To examine whether the radiation-induced JNK activation is a unique phenomenon in lymphocytes, we used different cell types to repeat the experiments. Both γ and UV-C radiations induced sustained JNK activation in 293T embryonic kidney cells (Fig. 1, D and E). In 293T cells, γ radiation induced JNK activity within 30 min, which was different from the delayed induction in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). γ radiation, but not UV-C, induced weak p38-MAPK activation, as observed in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1, D and E). ERK2 activity did not change significantly by the radiation. In addition, we detected γ radiation-induced JNK activation in myeloid leukemia cells, HL-60 and BV173, which were susceptible to γ radiation-induced apoptosis (data not shown). However, we failed to detect JNK activation in γ-irradiated murine primary fibroblasts, which did not show apparent cell death after radiation (data not shown). This suggests that γ radiation does not induce JNK kinase activity in all cell types; however, in the cells that are susceptible to γ radiation-induced apoptosis, the same doses of γ radiation can always induce JNK activity. Because UV-induced JNK activation was suggested to play roles in the protection from UV-induced damages and in the tumor promotion effect of UV light (8Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar), we studied the correlation between JNK induction and apoptosis induced by different doses of UV light. Both a low dose (60 J/m2) and a high dose (300 J/m2) of UV-C induced a rapid JNK1 induction (Fig. 2A). However, the low dose of UV-C induced a weaker and less sustained JNK1 induction in comparison with the persistent JNK1 activity induced by the high dose UV-C. DNA fragmentation assays showed that the UV-induced JNK activation preceded the occurrence of DNA fragmentation, and the extent of DNA degradation was correlated with the intensity of JNK1 activation (Fig. 2B). Jurkat cells transfected with a JNK1 expression vector (pCIneo-JNK1) were selected by incubation with G418 for stable transfectants overexpressing JNK1. Several independent clones were isolated; however, no detectable elevation of JNK1 protein expression was detected in the transfectants in comparison with parental cells (data not shown). This may be because Jurkat T cells with higher JNK levels were in an unfavorable condition and were eliminated in the selection process. However, the responsiveness of these Jurkat clones to γ radiation were different. The basal JNK activities in these clones remained at the same low levels, but γ radiation-induced JNK activities were significantly higher in clones 8A and 8G than in other clones (Fig. 3A). All of the Jurkat clones, except clone 8D, showed detectable levels of apoptosis 12 h after γ radiation treatment, as determined by propidium iodide staining (Fig. 3B). With the higher JNK induction, clones 8A and 8G were also more susceptible to the γ radiation-induced apoptosis than the other clones (Fig. 3B). The γ radiation-induced JNK activation and apoptosis in parental Jurkat cells were comparable to that of clone 8C (data not shown). The correlation between JNK activation and apoptosis induced by γ radiation suggests the involvement of the JNK kinase cascade in γ radiation-induced apoptosis. When we examined the JNK activation and apoptosis induced by anti-Fas in those T-cell clones, we found that JNK induction by γ radiation and Fas ligation were not correlated in the individual clones (Fig. 3A). This suggested that JNK induction by γ radiation and Fas signaling were mediated by different pathways. Five of seven Jurkat clones (8B, 8D, 8G, 8H, and 12G) had comparable levels of JNK activation and apoptosis induced by anti-Fas (Fig. 3, A and C). However, clone 8A, which was highly susceptible to anti-Fas treatment, showed a weak JNK induction, and clone 8C, which was relatively resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, had a strong JNK activation. The dissociation of JNK activation and apoptosis caused by Fas ligation implicates the existence of JNK-independent pathways in Fas-mediated apoptosis. ICE family proteases are the effector molecules for apoptotic cell death (31Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We preincubated Jurkat cells with ICE protease inhibitor Z-YVAD-FK and then studied JNK activation and apoptosis induced by different agents. We were able to detect JNK induction by UV-C and γ radiation in the presence of ICE inhibitor (Fig. 4A), even though the DNA fragmentation was completely inhibited (Fig. 4B). This result indicated that the activation of JNK was either upstream of or independent of the activation of ICE-like proteases in UV-C- and γ radiation-induced apoptosis. In contrast, along with the inhibition of DNA fragmentation, the ICE inhibitor abolished the JNK induction by anti-Fas treatment (Fig. 4, A and B), which indicated that JNK induction in Fas-mediated apoptosis occurred after the ICE protease activation. Since activation of ICE-like proteases was considered as a late event in apoptosis, JNK activation may not be involved in the initiation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. A transient transfection death assay was used to study the effect of JNK1 on cell death. 293T cells were cotransfected with β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCMV-βGal) plus either empty vectors or different combinations of effector plasmids for JNK1, dominant-negative JNK1 mutant (JNK1(APF)), and activated MEKK1 (ΔMEKK1). Transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and then assayed for β-galactosidase activity. A decrease in β-galactosidase activity in comparison with the control group was used as an indicator of cell death. A combination of transfected ΔMEKK1 and JNK1 induced significant levels of cell death in 293T cells, whereas vector alone or ΔMEKK plus JNK1(APF) did not have any cytotoxic effects (Fig. 5A). There was a direct correlation between the cytotoxicity observed in the death assay and JNK kinase activity in the transfected cells (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that activation of JNK may initiate apoptosis. Transient transfection assays were also used to examine the protective effects of dominant-negative mutants MEKK1(KR) and JNK1(APF) of the JNK kinase pathway on radiation-induced cell death. 293T cells were transfected with pCMV-βGal, with or without mutant kinases expressing plasmids, and each transfection was duplicated for treatments with or without radiation. The cells were harvested 24 h after radiation and stained by X-gal staining to examine the β-galactosidase-expressing cells (blue). The survival rate of transfected cells after radiation treatment was determined as the percentage of blue cells in the irradiated group divided by the percentage of blue cells in the nonirradiated group. MEKK1(KR), JNK1(APF), or a combination of MEKK1(KR) and JNK1(APF) blocked γ radiation-induced cell death in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Transfection of the dominant-negative Raf1 mutant (Raf-BXB301) did not suppress radiation-induced cell death. Similarly, the dominant-negative p38-MAPK mutant (p38(AGF)) failed to block cell death induced by γ radiation. A combination of JNK1(APF) and p38(AGF) did not have any synergistically protective effects in comparison with JNK(APF) alone. The same blocking experiments were performed using UV-C radiation as the treatment. Transfection of MEKK1(KR) or JNK1(APF) significantly enhanced the survival of transfected cells after UV radiation (Fig. 7, A and B). A combination of MEKK1(KR) and JNK1(APF) did not have synergistic effects on protection of UV-C-induced cell death. A dominant-negative mutant of c-Raf or p38-MAPK, Raf-BXB301 or p38(AGF), respectively, did not show any effect on cell survival (Fig. 7, A and B). These results demonstrate that interfering with JNK signaling can prevent radiation-induced cell death, indicating that the JNK kinase cascade is required for cell death signaling. In contrast, the Raf-ERK and p38-MAPK pathways are not involved in cell death signaling. Since JNK activity is also induced by various mitogenic stimuli, it is intriguing to see the same kinase participating in two completely opposing pathways—cell proliferation and apoptosis. We treated the Jurkat cells with anti-CD28 plus PMA or PMA plus ionomycin and examined the JNK induction. JNK1 activation by anti-CD28 plus PMA displayed a rapid and transient induction pattern (Fig. 8A, top panel). Similar kinetics was observed in the JNK1 activation induced by PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 8B, top panel). Both T-cell stimulation signals induced a moderate ERK2 activation (Fig. 8, A and B, bottom panels) but had no significant effect on p38-MAPK activity (Fig. 8, A and B, middle panels). These data indicate that the duration of JNK induction is regulated differentially in T-cell activation and apoptosis. JNK kinase activities are down-regulated by dual specificity phosphatases (32Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The different kinetics of JNK induction in T-cell activation and apoptosis may be due to the preferential activation of the phosphatases in T-cell activation but not in T-cell apoptosis. We treated Jurkat cells with sodium orthovanadate (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) in the presence or absence of PMA plus ionomycin for 1 h. Sodium orthovanadate alone caused a transient JNK1 induction, which occurred immediately after the treatment and sharply increased at the 2-h time point and then vanished after the 4-h time point (Fig. 9A). This transient induction may be due to the temporary inhibition of cellular phosphatase activities. A combination of the phosphatase inhibitor and PMA plus ionomycin caused a rapid JNK1 induction within 1 h, as in the T-cell activation signal alone. However, the JNK1 activation induced by PMA and ionomycin was significantly prolonged by co-incubation with sodium orthovanadate (Fig. 9A). JNK activity remained higher than the basal level even 6 h after the co-treatment. In the early phase of apoptosis, the cells maintain an intact plasma membrane that enables them to exclude propidium iodide but expose phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane; this then enables them to bind annexin V (34Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). We found a significant percentage of cells stained by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate but excluded propidium iodide in the cells treated with sodium orthovanadate and PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 9B). In addition, using propidium iodide to stain the permeabilized cells, we detected an increase of apoptotic cells, which have the subdiploid staining profile, in Jurkat cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitor and T-cell activation agents but not in the cells treated with each of the individual agents (Fig. 9C). Taken together, phosphatase activities may be responsible for the rapid down-regulation of JNK activity in T-cell activation. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activities during T-cell activation converted the mitogenic signals into an apoptotic signal, and this effect may be mediated through the sustained induction of JNK activity. Many regulatory molecules, such as the Bcl-2 family members (35Núñez G. Merino R. Grillot D. González-García M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 582-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and ICE family proteases (31Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), have been shown to be involved in the control of apoptosis, but the exact regulatory mechanisms for apoptosis remain unknown. We found that JNK was activated in apoptosis induced by γ radiation, UV-C, Fas signaling, and DNA-damaging drugs (13Yu R. Shtil A.A. Tan T.-H. Roninson I.B. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). JNK activation and apoptosis induced by γ radiation were correlated. In peripheral lymphocytes, which were very sensitive to γ radiation, JNK activity and apoptosis can be induced by 5 Gy of γ radiation (10Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In contrast, no significant JNK activation and cell death were observed in murine fibroblasts treated with γ radiation (15-100 Gy; data not shown). In myeloid leukemia cells, HL-60 and BV173, JNK activation and apoptosis can be induced with less than 20 Gy (data not shown). In Jurkat T cells and 293T cells, which are more resistant to γ radiation, apparent cell death and JNK activation only occurred after receiving more than 40-50 Gy (10 and data not shown). To exclude the possibility that a high dose of γ radiation induced cell death (e.g. necrosis) other than apoptosis, by JNK induction, the cell morphology change, DNA fragmentation, propidium iodide staining, and blocking by an ICE inhibitor were used to classify that the cell death induced by the radiation treatments was in fact apoptosis (data not shown; 10Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). In summary, although JNK induction did not always occur in cells exposed to γ radiation, in the cells that were susceptible to γ radiation-induced apoptosis, the same dose of γ radiation always induced JNK activation. Our data showed that different mechanisms may have existed for the radiation-induced and Fas-mediated JNK induction. In subcloned Jurkat cells, JNK activation was well correlated with γ radiation-induced, but not Fas-mediated, apoptosis. UV-C- and γ radiation-induced JNK activation occurred in the presence of ICE inhibitor, although the DNA fragmentation was completely inhibited. In contrast, preincubation of the ICE inhibitor blocked both JNK induction and apoptosis induced by anti-Fas. This data indicate that JNK induction by UV-C and γ radiation were independent of ICE-like proteases or were upstream of these proteases; however, Fas-mediated JNK induction was a downstream effect of ICE-like protease activation. Because the progression of Fas-mediated apoptosis was very quick (the DNA fragmentation occurred in 2 h, which coincided with the JNK activation), and the ICE-like proteases were considered end effectors of apoptosis, the JNK kinase pathway may not be important for the initiation of Fas-mediated apoptosis. In nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC-12 neuronal cells, JNK and p38-MAPK activities were persistently activated during apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal (36Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). Repression of JNK or p38-MAPK activation by transfection of dominant-negative mutants of upstream kinases (MEKK1 and MKK3 for JNK and p38-MAPK, respectively) blocks cell death induced by NGF depletion. These findings along with our data indicate that the JNK kinase cascade plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis induced by various agents. In apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal (36Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar), ERK activity is significantly reduced in PC-12 cells; in contrast, constitutive activation of ERK prevents apoptosis. It was suggested that ERK and the JNK/p38 cascade may have opposing effects on nerve cells, and the dynamic balance between ERK and the JNK-p38 kinase pathways is important in determining whether the cells will undergo proliferation or apoptosis. We detected a sustained JNK activation during apoptosis induced by γ radiation and UV-C. The ERK2 activity was either unchanged or decreased slightly 6 h after the radiation treatments. Since the reductions of ERK2 activity in radiation treatments appeared hours after DNA fragmentation, they are unlikely to be involved in the initiation of apoptosis. Therefore, the regulation of ERK and JNK kinase cascades in radiation-induced apoptosis was distinct from that in apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal. This difference may be due to the nature of different cell types or different apoptotic stimuli. In addition, we observed a strong JNK activation, along with ERK2 induction, in Jurkat cells stimulated with T-cell activation signals. Since the JNK kinase cascade is also involved in and required for mitogenic signaling (17Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Dérijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 23Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), ERK and JNK may not always have opposing effects, and these two MAP kinase cascades may have distinct functions in different cell types, or in different stages of the same cell type. The observations of: (i) JNK activation in apoptosis induced by different agents; (ii) induction of cell death by overexpression of JNK; and (iii) blockage of cell death by a dominant-negative JNK mutant indicate the essential role of JNK in apoptosis. The activation of JNK kinases may be the executing step of cell death in response to the accumulating genomic and/or structural damages after treatment with apoptotic agents. Similarly, in neuronal cells, deprivation of NGF may render the cells in an unfavorable condition that causes activation of JNK and initiates the cell death program. Constitutive activation of ERK may actually mimic the survival signal of NGF that in turn prevents the cell death process. The different patterns of JNK induction between T-cell activation and apoptosis imply that the duration of JNK induction may be the determining factor in the cell-signaling decision. Transient activation of JNK may induce the genes required for T-cell proliferation, and persistent activation of JNK may cause aberrant gene expression and subsequent T-cell apoptosis (Fig. 10). The prolonged JNK1 induction and apoptosis in Jurkat cells co-treated with T-cell activation signals and sodium orthovanadate suggest that phosphatase activity is important for controlling the duration of JNK induction and prevention of apoptosis. The different kinetics of JNK1 induction in T-cell activation and apoptosis may be due to the preferential induction of dual specificity phosphatases by T-cell activation signals but not by apoptotic signals. This hypothesis is supported by the failure of DNA-damaging agents to induce the dual specificity phosphatase CL100/MKP1 (37Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), which is inducible by mitogenic signals (38Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) and is a JNK phosphatase (32Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In summary, co-treatment of sodium orthovanadate with PMA plus ionomycin prolonged JNK induction and converted the T-cell activation signal into an apoptotic signal. This result strongly suggests, but does not prove, that the duration of JNK induction may determine cell proliferation versus apoptosis (Fig. 10). Different durations of ERK activation also have distinct effects on cell fate (39Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). Transient induction of ERK leads to proliferation of PC12 cells, whereas prolonged ERK activation causes the differentiation of PC12 cells to sympathetic neurons (40Hearsley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 41Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a single kinase-signaling pathway may have distinct functions if the induction patterns are different. However, the kinetics of JNK activation may not be the only determining factor for the fate of cells; hence, we do not exclude the possibility that the wrong timing of JNK activation in the presence or absence of other cellular factors may affect the outcomes. For example, constitutive JNK activation is associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-mediated tumorigenesis after certain unknown genetic changes in infected cells (43Xu X. Heidenreich O. Kitajima I. McGuire K. Li Q. Su B. Nerenberg M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 135-142PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the interaction between JNK and other apoptotic regulators will provide important information on the mechanisms of cell death as well as cell proliferation and transformation.

In order to elucidate intracellular signaling pathways involved in this differentiation process, we focused our interest on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/p70S6-kinase pathway. The specific inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by LY294002 markedly stimulated dendrite outgrowth, thus mimicking the action of cAMP-elevating agents on B16 cell morphology. In addition, LY294002 and rapamycin, a specific p70S6-kinase inhibitor, were found to independently stimulate tyrosinase expression, thus increasing melanin synthesis. In an attempt to better dissect the molecular mechanisms triggered by cAMP to induce melanoma cell differentiation, we examined the effects of a cAMP-elevating agent forskolin, on both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6-kinase activities. Specific kinase assays revealed that forskolin partially inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and completely blocked p70S6-kinase activity and phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6-kinase is involved in the regulation of B16 cell differentiation.

INTRODUCTIONIn the epidermis, melanocytes synthesize melanin, which is responsible for skin pigmentation. Melanin synthesis is carried out by a cell-specific enzymatic pathway controlled by tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1), the enzyme that catalyzes the initial two rate-limiting reactions of this process, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopa and its subsequent oxidation to dopaquinone (1Hearing V.J.

In cultured melanocytes or in melanoma cells, melanogenesis can be induced by ultraviolet A and B radiation and by a large array of effectors including α-MSH (4Hearing V.J. Tsukamoto K. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2902-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and pharmacological agents such as forskolin, cholera toxin, or isobutylmethylxanthine (6Wong G. Pawelek J.

These agents increase the intracellular cAMP content, thereby indicating the importance of the cAMP pathway in melanogenesis. The stimulation of melanogenesis by cAMP-elevating agents seems to occur through the induction of tyrosinase expression and stimulation of its intrinsic enzymatic activity ensuing post-translational modifications (10Fuller B.B. Lundsford J.B. Iman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, few data are available concerning molecular mechanisms that connect the cAMP signaling pathway and tyrosinase regulation. Recently, we have shown in B16 melanoma cells that cAMP-elevating agents stimulate ERK1 activity and induce its translocation to the nucleus (9Englaro W. Rezzonico R. Durand-Clément M. Lallemand D.

Furthermore, concomitantly to the stimulation of ERK1 and melanogenesis, cAMP induces a morphological differentiation characterized by dendrite outgrowth (9Englaro W. Rezzonico R. Durand-Clément M.

Similar effects including ERK1 activation, neurite outgrowth, and cell growth inhibition have been observed during cAMP-induced differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (12Cowley S.

The mechanisms of differentiation in PC12 cells have been thoroughly investigated. Recently, two reports have shown that wortmannin (14Arcaro A. Whymann M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), a potent phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, as well as dominant negative mutants of PI3-K, clearly inhibit nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, thus demonstrating a positive involvement of PI3-K in PC12 cell differentiation (15Kimura K.

Sakaue H. et al.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).Recent studies have demonstrated that the serine/threonine kinase, p70S6-kinase (p70S6K) acts downstream of PI3-K (28Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 29Chou M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). P70S6K phosphorylates its main target, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6, which is involved in translational up-regulation of an essential family of mRNAs, including transcripts for ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. Inhibition of the p70S6K activity by the immunosupressant rapamycin or microinjection of neutralizing antibodies severely block cell cycle progression at the middle G1 phase, indicating that p70S6K is necessary for cells to enter the S phase (28Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar).Taking into account the involvement of the PI3-K pathway in PC12 cell differentiation and in an attempt to search for intracellular signaling pathways involved in melanogenesis, we focused our interest on the implication of PI3-K in the B16 melanoma cell differentiation process. In this report, using the specific PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 (30Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the p70S6K-specific inhibitor rapamycin (31Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), we show that the inhibition of the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway mimics the effect of cAMP-elevating agents and leads to a strong stimulation of melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells. Furthermore, cAMP triggers a significant inhibition of PI3-K activity and a strong blockage of p70S6K activity, thus revealing the implication of the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway in the transmission of the melanogenic effect of cAMP.DISCUSSIONIn the present work we provide evidence for the role of the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway in the control of B16 melanoma cell differentiation which is characterized by a stimulation of melanin synthesis and dendrite outgrowth. In PC12 cells, the inhibition of PI3-K activity has been shown to prevent nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth (15Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Latanya P.H.-O. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G. Heldman K.A. Theibert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 109: 289-300Google Scholar). Since PC12 cells share numerous features with B16 cells, we therefore expected that the inhibition of PI3-K would block the cAMP-induced dendrite outgrowth in this melanoma cell line. Strikingly, our studies revealed that, in B16 cells, the inhibition of PI3-K by LY294002 did not block forskolin effects but was sufficient by itself to induce a strong cell dendricity. However, the inhibition of p70S6K that functions downstream PI3-K (29Chou M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) did not lead to any morpholological changes. This observation suggests the existence of PI3-K targets acting upstream or independently of p70S6K that might play a regulatory role in the induction of these morphological modifications. The protein kinase B/Akt which is a serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the proto-oncogene akt (43Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar) has been found to function downstream PI3-K and to participate to the p70S6K activation (44Boudewijn M. Burgering T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar); it is tempting to propose that other unknown targets of protein kinase B/AKT could be involved in the induction of the dendritic phenotype. Similarly, some members of the protein kinase C family such as protein kinase C δ, ϵ, θ, and ζ, which are directly activated by phosphatidylinositol phosphate (45Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) are also putative candidates that could participate in this phenomenon. Moreover, it has recently been reported that proteins Rho and Rac, which belong to the superfamily of small G proteins, are indirectly regulated by PI3-K and mediate cytoskeleton rearrangements triggering events such as membrane ruffling and vesicle reorganization (48Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 747-752PubMed Google Scholar, 49Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 50Kotani K.

Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This points to the putative involvement of these molecules in eliciting dendrite outgrowth processes after cAMP or LY294002 stimulation. Future research is certainly required to identify the pathway leading to this morphological modification (dendricity) in B16 melanoma cells.On the other hand, our work demonstrates that the inhibition of PI3-K led to a stimulation of melanin synthesis that appeared to result from an increased tyrosinase activity and expression. In addition, similar effects were observed with rapamycin, indicating that the inhibition of p70S6K is sufficient to induce melanogenesis. However, rapamycin, which is as potent as forskolin or LY294002 in stimulating tyrosinase activity, is markedly less efficient in inducing cell tanning. A possible explanation of this finding might reside in the fact that the synthesis of black melanin (eumelanin) involves other specific regulated enzymes such as tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 (52Jackson J.I. Cambers D.M. Tsukamoto K. Copeland N. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hearing V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 53Kameyama K. Takemura T. Hamada Y. Sakai C. Kondoh S. Nishiyama S. Urabe K. Hearing V.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 126-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Yokoyama K. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27080-27087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we can hypothesize that rapamycin may somehow inhibit the expression or the activity of these tyrosinase-related enzymes or down-regulate other steps downstream of tyrosinase in the melanin production pathway.It is worth emphasizing that forskolin, LY294002, and rapamycin produced similar effects on melanogenesis. This supports the hypothesis that the induction of melanogenesis by cAMP could be due to a down-regulation of the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway. Indeed an inhibition of PI3-K activity by cAMP has been already described in T lymphocytes (55Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and in neutrophils (56Ahmed M.U. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Katada T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23816-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAMP-elevating agents have been shown to inhibit p70S6K activity in Swiss 3T3 cells (57Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M.L. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26619-26625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and in T lymphocytes (55Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In B16 melanoma cells, forskolin partially inhibits PI3-K activity and completely blocks p70S6K activity. In addition, this cAMP-elevating agent as well as α-MSH (not shown), a physiological melanogenic agent that increases the intracellular cAMP levels, induced a dramatic inhibition of p70S6K phosphorylation which constitutes an essential event for the activation of the kinase. Since the inhibition of PI3-K activity by cAMP appears rather weak, this could not entirely explain the strong inhibition of p70S6K activity found after the treatment with cAMP elevating agents. Therefore it can be proposed that cAMP could act through the regulation of the activity of protein kinase B or other kinases involved in phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K.Interestingly, we observed a significant diminution in the cell number and in DNA synthesis, without cytotoxic effects, after forskolin, LY294002, or rapamycin treatments (not shown), revealing an arrest of cell growth. This could be due to the inhibitory effects of forskolin, LY294002, or rapamycin on p70S6K activity, which has been found essential for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (40Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, serum or growth factors, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or epidermal growth factor that activate p70S6K, display an inhibitory effect on melanogenesis in B16 cells (not shown). These findings suggest that the induction of melanogenesis and morphological differentiation in B16 cells might require the arrest of cell growth at the G1 phase. A similar conclusion has been reached concerning the induction of neurite outgrowth in the neuroblastoma cell line NE1-115 (58Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).The precise molecular mechanisms that connect the inhibition of the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway to the induction of melanogenesis and dendrite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, the existence of a nuclear isoform of the S6 kinase (p85S6K) (59Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) is consistent with the idea that this kinase could modulate the activity of transcription factors. Indeed, cAMP-responsive element modulator τ has been reported to be phosphorylated and activated by p70S6K (60Groot R.P. Ballou L.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1994; 79: 81-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). On the other hand, microphthalmia, a tissue-specific transcription factor that has been recently shown to play a key role in the stimulation of tyrosinase gene expression by cAMP (61Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), could also be a target of p70S6K. Thus the inhibition of this kinase by cAMP would lead to a decreased activation of microphthalmia, or other transcription factors involved in B16 cell differentiation, and thereby regulate their transcriptional activities.Taken together our results demonstrate the involvement of the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway in B16 melanoma cells differentiation and indicate for the first time that the inhibition of this signaling cascade by cAMP is likely to be a key event for the cAMP-induced melanogenesis and dendrite outgrowth. Furthermore, the novel finding that the inhibition of the PI3-K/p70S6K pathway displays a positive effect on B16 melanoma cell differentiation whereas the PI3-K inhibition blocks the differentiation process in PC12 cells, reveals that the study of several cell systems is required to fully understand the mechanisms of cell differentiation. INTRODUCTIONIn the epidermis, melanocytes synthesize melanin, which is responsible for skin pigmentation. Melanin synthesis is carried out by a cell-specific enzymatic pathway controlled by tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1), the enzyme that catalyzes the initial two rate-limiting reactions of this process, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopa and its subsequent oxidation to dopaquinone (1Hearing V.J.

In vivo, melanogenesis is induced mainly by ultraviolet A and B radiation of sunlight and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) 1The abbreviations used are: α-MSHα-melanocyte-stimulating hormoneAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluorideERK1extracellular signal regulated kinase 1PNPPp-nitrophenolphosphatePIphosphatidylinositolPI3-Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasep70S6Kp70S6-kinaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salinebpbase pair(s).

In cultured melanocytes or in melanoma cells, melanogenesis can be induced by ultraviolet A and B radiation and by a large array of effectors including α-MSH (4Hearing V.J. Tsukamoto K. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2902-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and pharmacological agents such as forskolin, cholera toxin, or isobutylmethylxanthine (6Wong G. Pawelek J.

These agents increase the intracellular cAMP content, thereby indicating the importance of the cAMP pathway in melanogenesis. The stimulation of melanogenesis by cAMP-elevating agents seems to occur through the induction of tyrosinase expression and stimulation of its intrinsic enzymatic activity ensuing post-translational modifications (10Fuller B.B. Lundsford J.B. Iman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, few data are available concerning molecular mechanisms that connect the cAMP signaling pathway and tyrosinase regulation. Recently, we have shown in B16 melanoma cells that cAMP-elevating agents stimulate ERK1 activity and induce its translocation to the nucleus (9Englaro W. Rezzonico R. Durand-Clément M. Lallemand D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24315-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas in the majority of cell systems, cAMP has been described to inhibit this kinase (11Burgering B.M. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Furthermore, concomitantly to the stimulation of ERK1 and melanogenesis, cAMP induces a morphological differentiation characterized by dendrite outgrowth (9Englaro W. Rezzonico R. Durand-Clément M. Lallemand D. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24315-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and an inhibition of B16 melanoma cell proliferation. Similar effects including ERK1 activation, neurite outgrowth, and cell growth inhibition have been observed during cAMP-induced differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (12Cowley S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which, like melanocytes, are derived from the neural crest. The mechanisms of differentiation in PC12 cells have been thoroughly investigated. Recently, two reports have shown that wortmannin (14Arcaro A. Whymann M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), a potent phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, as well as dominant negative mutants of PI3-K, clearly inhibit nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, thus demonstrating a positive involvement of PI3-K in PC12 cell differentiation (15Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jackson T.R.

PI3-K is activated after association of the p85 regulatory subunit with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including activated tyrosine kinase receptors, non-receptor tyrosine kinases (19Carpenter C.L.

Thus, this compound has been used as a selective tool for studies aimed at elucidating the role of iPLA2 in certain cellular functions. Herein we report that BEL also inhibits cellular phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) activity in intact P388D1 macrophages with an IC50 of about 8 μM, which is very similar to that previously found for inhibition of iPLA2 under the same experimental conditions. This results in the blockage of the incorporation of exogenous arachidonate and palmitate into diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Thus, inhibition of PAP by BEL blocks triacylglycerol biosynthesis in P388D1 cells due to decreased diacylglycerol availability. Because two forms of PAP activity exist in mammalian cells, differential assays were performed to identify which of these forms was inhibited by BEL. The results of these experiments revealed that BEL selectively inhibits the cytosolic, Mg2+-dependent enzyme. No apparent effect of BEL on the membrane-bound Mg2+-independent PAP form could be detected. Collectively, the results reported herein establish that BEL inhibits two cellular phospholipases, namely iPLA2 and Mg2+-dependent PAP, with similar potency.

In contrast, IL-4 appears to antagonize host defense to such agents while contributing to protection from intestinal helminths and facilitating the development of allergic responses (1Locksley R.M.

Both promoters contain regulatory elements that engage one or more NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) proteins (6Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves R. Grumnt F.

Preformed NFAT resides in the cytosol in resting T cells and translocates to the nucleus on activation; this translocation is regulated by calcineurin, the action of which is inhibited by cyclosporin (7McCaffrey P.G.

Calcineurin also acts in concert with protein kinase C to activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinases, which phosphorylate Jun and ATF-2 (activating transcription factoractor) (14Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M.

However, the transcription factors binding to these elements are common to cell types other than T cells, and the distal NFAT site and the P1 NFAT site can be exchanged between the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters without affecting specificity of promoter function for Th1 (T h elper lymphocytes) and Th2 T cell clones, respectively (9Rooney J.W.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these elements are sufficient to account for activation-specific, cyclosporin-sensitive promoter function, but not for specificity of their promoters. Like IL-2, IFN-γ expression is restricted to the Th1 subset of primed CD4+ T cells, whereas IL-4 is expressed by Th2 cells. IFN-γ expression does not completely parallel that of IL-2 since IFN-γ is expressed by primed but not naive T cells and, among primed T cells, also is highly expressed by the CD8+ subset, whereas IL-2 is not (2Seder R.A.

Despite its importance in regulation of the immune response, compared with IL-2 and IL-4, little information exists regarding the regulation of IFN-γ expression. We recently reported that the proximal 108 bp of 5′-flanking sequence from the IFN-γ gene are necessary and sufficient to confer T cell and activation-specific, cyclosporin-sensitive expression and that the activity of this region is associated with two essential and evolutionarily conserved elements (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The proximal element (−73 to −48 bp) shares homology with the NFIL-2A element of the IL-2 promoter (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and is a target for methylation at its central CpG dinucleotide (22Young H.A. Ghosh P. Ye J. Lederer J. Lichtman A. Gerard J.R. Penix L. Wilson C.B. Melvin A.J. McGurn M.E. Lewis D.B. Taub D.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3603-3610PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation at this site correlates strongly and inversely with the capacity of primary T cell populations and Th1 and Th2 T cell clones to express IFN-γ (22Young H.A. Ghosh P. Ye J. Lederer J. Lichtman A. Gerard J.R. Penix L. Wilson C.B. Melvin A.J. McGurn M.E. Lewis D.B. Taub D.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3603-3610PubMed Google Scholar, 23Melvin A.J. McGurn M.E. Bort S.J. Gibson C. Lewis D.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This suggests that the IFN-γ proximal element is likely to play an important role in the regulation and perhaps the specificity of this lymphokine's expression. This work indicates that the IFN-γ proximal element, like elements defined in the IL-2 and IL-4 promoters, is a composite binding site for a complex array of transcription factors including ATF-2, c-Jun and other Jun proteins, CREB (cAMP re-sponse element-binding proteinamer). c-Jun engages this element, preferentially as a heterodimer with ATF-2, and activates transcription in response to T cell activation. In contrast, CREB and ATF-1, which are cAMP- and calcium/calmodulin-responsive transcription factors (24Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), also bind to this element with high affinity, and CREB impedes transcription. In addition, methylation of the central CpG dinucleotide of this element diminishes transcription factor binding, which is consistent with the inverse relationship between methylation of this element and expression of IFN-γ by T cell subsets. These observations suggest that the proximal element of the IFN-γ promoter, through competitive engagement of transcription factors and differential methylation, is likely to play an important role in the selective expression of IFN-γ in T cells. The line of Jurkat T cells (which expresses IFN-γ following activation), the human monocyte-macrophage cell line U937 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), and the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line 816 (D. Pious, University of Washington, Seattle) were maintained as described previously (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), except that the 816 cells were grown in medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). L929 murine fibroblasts were grown as described previously (25Burchett S.K. Weaver W.M. Westall J.A. Larsen A. Kronheim S. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3473-3481PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies to transcription factors were used. For the CREB/ATF family, anti-CREB-1 (C-21), anti-ATF-1 (C41-5.1), anti-CREB-1/ATF-1/CREM (25C10G), and anti-ATF-4 (25Burchett S.K. Weaver W.M. Westall J.A. Larsen A. Kronheim S. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3473-3481PubMed Google Scholar) were mouse monoclonal antibodies, and anti-ATF-3 (C-19) was a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal (F2BR1) and rabbit polyclonal (F2poly) antibodies to human ATF-2 were provided by J. P. Hoeffler (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For the AP-1 and octamer families, rabbit polyclonal anti-Jun (c-Jun/AP-1[D]), anti-c-Jun-specific (c-Jun/AP-1[N]), anti-Fos (K-25), and anti-Oct-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The pIFN-538-, pIFN-108-, pIFN-39-, and pIL2-568-β-galactosidase reporter and β-actin-CAT constructs were described previously (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing head-to-tail (5′ to 3′) dimers of the IFN-γ proximal element (−71 to −44 bp from the transcription start site) were generated by subcloning ligated oligomers synthesized with terminal BglII (5′) and BamHI (3′) restriction sites into the pIFN-39 basal promoter construct. Proximal dimers with mutations M1-M4 (see Fig. 5A) were produced in a similar manner. The full-length promoter (pIFN-538) containing the M5 (C to T) mutation was prepared by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis and splicing by overlap extension (26Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) to generate a 240-bp fragment that was subcloned into pIFN-538Δ−177/−109 (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The sequence of each construct was confirmed with dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing. Plasmids containing the cDNAs for CREB and CREB containing a mutation in the DNA-binding domain that allows dimerization but blocks binding to target DNA (KCREB) (27Rehfuss R.P. Walton K.M.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from R. H. Goodman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Plasmids containing cDNAs for murine ATF-2 (CRE-BP2.1) and murine ATF-2 with a mutation abrogating DNA binding (CRE-BP1mu) were obtained from K. Georgopoulos (Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA) (29Georgopoulos K. Morgan B.A. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing wild-type human ATF-2 (ATF-2FL) and a truncated form lacking the transcriptional activation domain (ATF-2BR) (30Abdel-Hafiz H.A. Heasley L.E. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Kroll D.J. Johnson G.L. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and wild-type c-Jun (31Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have been described; the plasmid containing c-Jun with a deletion of residues 260-266 in the DNA-binding domain (c-JunΔBR) was analogous to that described in 33Gentz R. Rauscher III, F.J. Abate C. Curran T. Science. 1989; 243: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar. These cDNAs were received or cloned into the pRcRSV vector (Invitrogen). Jurkat, U937, and 816 cells were transiently transfected with both 30 μg of IFN-γβ-galactosidase plasmid and 16 μg of control β-actin-CAT plasmid in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium by electroporation (ECM600, BTX Inc., San Diego, CA) at 250 V, 186 ohms, and 1900, 1500, or 1050 microfarads, respectively. In cotransfection experiments, the indicated amounts of expression plasmids containing transcription factor cDNAs under the control of the RSV (Rous sarcoma virus) promoter were also included. The total amount of RSV vector per cuvette was kept constant by the addition of control pRcRSV plasmid lacking a cDNA insert. After electroporation, the cells were unstimulated or stimulated with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as described previously (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 20 min with cyclosporin A (500 ng/ml). Cell lysates were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity using chlorophenol red as substrate (34Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Coberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar) and corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing to CAT content as described previously (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). L929 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of IFN-γβ-galactosidase plasmid and 2.5 μg of control β-actin-CAT plasmid using 400 μg/ml DEAE-dextran for 3 h and then shocked with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline for 1-2 min. The cells were stimulated, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells that were untreated or stimulated for 2 h as described (21Penix L.

CREB-1 (the DNA-binding domain, amino acids 254-327), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, as well as recombinant c-Jun (the DNA-binding domain, amino acids 199-334) and c-Fos (the DNA-binding domain, amino acids 139-200), provided by T. K. Kerppola (32Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), were purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography of bacterial lysates (37Abate C. Luk D. Gentz R. Rauscher F. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recombinant ATF-1 (full-length) and ATF-2BR (the DNA-binding domain, amino acids 350-505) were obtained from boiling lysis preparations of bacteria without further purification and are ∼90% pure (30Abdel-Hafiz H.A.

Sequences of oligonucleotides used (with their consensus sequences underlined) are as follows: the IFN-γ proximal element (−71 to −47 bp), 5′-AAAACTTGTGAAAATACGTAATCCT-3′; the NFIL-2A element (36Ullman K.S. Flanagan W.M. Edwards C.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1991; 254: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), 5′-GAAAATATGTGTAATATGTAAAACAT-3′; the consensus somatostatin CRE (cAMP response element)) (38Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), 5′-GATCCGGCTGAC-GTCATCAAGCTA-3′; the consensus metallothionein IIa AP-1 element (39Turner R.

Oakley B.K. Tsai S.F. Orkin S.H. Leiden J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1187-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), 5′-GTTAGAGATAGCATCGCCCCA-3′, was used as a nonspecific competitor. Oligonucleotides were labeled, and the binding reactions were performed as described previously (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), except that reactions containing recombinant proteins were incubated in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A. In experiments using antiserum or monoclonal antibodies to specific transcription factors, these were routinely preincubated with nuclear extracts for 2 h on ice before the addition of probe. Bound complexes were resolved on 6% Duracryl gels (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at room temperature in 0.4 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer, and then the gels were dried and autoradiographed overnight. The DNA template for the footprinting experiment was made by end labeling a human (−350 to +50 bp) IFN-γ promoter fragment at the downstream end. The binding reactions and DNase I digestions were carried out as described previously (9Rooney J.W. Hoey T. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1995; 2: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The binding reactions with the Jurkat nuclear extracts utilized 3 μg of protein. Using transient transfection of reporter constructs containing 10-bp scanning internal deletions, our laboratory identified two highly conserved, regulatory elements in the immediate 5′-flanking sequence of the human IFN-γ gene, which were necessary for activation-specific and cyclosporin-sensitive expression in Jurkat T cells (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To determine if the most proximal of these transcriptional regulatory elements, like the intact IFN-γ promoter, is sufficient to confer activation-specific and cyclosporin-sensitive expression, two tandem copies of this element were placed upstream of the basal IFN-γ promoter driving expression of a β-galactosidase reporter gene and transfected into Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1). Expression from the proximal dimer construct was stimulated to the same extent as that from the full-length promoter (pIFN-538) by ionomycin and PMA and was blocked by cyclosporin (>85%). Likewise, expression of both these constructs was minimal in unstimulated cells and in cells stimulated with ionomycin or PMA alone. Thus, a dimer of the proximal element was sufficient for properly regulated expression in Jurkat T cells. In contrast to the robust expression observed in Jurkat T cells, expression from the proximal dimer and the full-length promoter constructs was similar to that from a promoterless construct (pEQ3) and lower than that from the basal promoter construct (pIFN-39) in unstimulated or stimulated U937 monocyte-macrophages or L929 fibroblasts (data not shown). Very low levels of expression were observed in the 816 B cell line, which is consistent with data indicating that transformed B cell lines express IFN-γ in low amounts (42Dayton M.A. Knobloch T.J. Benjamin D. Cytokine. 1992; 4: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Pang Y. Norihisa Y. Benjamin D. Kantor R.R. Young H.A. Blood. 1992; 80: 724-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, like the full-length promoter, the proximal dimer appears sufficient to confer activation- and cell lineage-specific expression. The proximal element of the IFN-γ promoter has partial homology to the NFIL-2A element of the IL-2 gene, which binds octamer, AP-1 (including c-Jun, JunD, and Fos proteins), and NFAT proteins (10Rooney J.W. Sun Y. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 36Ullman K.S. Flanagan W.M. Edwards C.A. Crabtree G.R.

The binding sites of AP-1 and CREB/ATF transcription factors are closely related, and certain members of these families can form cross-family heterodimers (47Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Accordingly, binding of nuclear proteins to the IFN-γ proximal element probe was compared with that of probes containing NFIL-2A, octamer, AP-1, and CRE elements by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 2A). In previous studies, EMSA of the proximal IFN-γ element showed two intense complexes, A and B (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which are now resolved into doublets, and a previously undetected intermediate-mobility complex. Also noted in response to activation, the A1 complex is barely detectable, and A2 is the predominant complex (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). This difference was seen in five independently prepared Jurkat nuclear extracts (data not shown). When used as unlabeled competitors in EMSA (Fig. 2A), the CRE oligonucleotide markedly reduced all the complexes generated by the IFN-γ proximal element probe, with the exception of the intermediate-mobility complex. The NFIL-2A competitor completely blocked formation of the intermediate-mobility complex and inhibited formation of the other complexes. The AP-1 oligonucleotide partially competed for the A2 and B complexes, but much less than seen with CRE. Together, these results suggest the presence of CREB/ATF and AP-1 proteins in complexes formed with the proximal element. To confirm this and to identify the specific factors contained within each complex, antisera specific for the various factors were added to the binding reactions. Antibodies to CREB/ATF-1 proteins supershifted or attenuated the B1-B2 complexes, suggesting the presence of ATF-1, CREB, and perhaps other members of the CREB/ATF-1 family (Fig. 2B, lanes 6-8). The results were similar with extracts from unstimulated and stimulated cells (data not shown). Antibody to ATF-2 blocked or supershifted the A1 and A2 complexes in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), but only partially blocked or supershifted the more prominent A2 complex in stimulated cells (lanes 9 and 10, complex indicated by arrow). Antibodies to ATF-3 and ATF-4 had no consistent effects upon the IFN-γ proximal element complexes (data not shown). An antiserum recognizing all Jun proteins completely blocked the A2 complex in both stimulated and unstimulated extracts (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 11), and a c-Jun-specific antiserum produced a supershifted complex in stimulated Jurkat extracts (Fig. 2C, lane 6). In contrast, antibodies to the Fos family of proteins or to c-Fos had no effect on complexes formed with the proximal element probe, although each antibody blocked and/or supershifted complexes formed with an AP-1 probe (Fig. 2C, lanes 7-12). Several observations suggest that the intermediate complex is generated by binding of Oct-1 to the IFN-γ proximal element (Fig. 2A). 1) The intermediate-mobility complex comigrated with the predominant complex generated by the NFIL-2A probe. 2) This complex was inhibited by the IFN-γ proximal element, NFIL-2A, and consensus octamer oligonucleotides, but not by CRE- or AP-1-containing oligonucleotides. 3) Oct-1-specific antiserum blocked formation of this complex and the corresponding NFIL-2A complex, but had little or no effect on the A or B complexes (data not shown). Results obtained with recombinant transcription factors supported the results obtained with Jurkat T cell extracts. The IFN-γ proximal element probe readily bound recombinant CREB, CREB/ATF-1, and ATF-2, whereas ATF-1 bound poorly alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-8). The AP-1 and NFIL-2A oligonucleotides bound these proteins less well (Fig. 3A, lanes 9-16). c-Jun homodimers and c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers formed complexes with the IFN-γ proximal element, although the complexes generated were less intense than those bound by either the consensus CRE or AP-1 probes (Fig. 3B). When c-Jun and ATF-2 were added together in the ratio yielding optimal binding (10:1), essentially all complexes ran with a mobility intermediate between those seen with either protein alone, suggesting that c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers were preferred (Fig. 3B, lane 6). The consensus CRE probe also bound c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers well, although the intermediate heterodimer complex is obscured by a predominance of c-Jun homodimer (Fig. 3B, lane 2). In contrast, the AP-1 and NFIL-2A probes bound ATF-2 and c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers poorly or not at all compared with c-Jun or c-Jun/c-Fos. To b"
https://openalex.org/W2033123702,"One of the major protein components of the ocular lens, α-crystallin, is composed of αA and αB chain subunits that have structural homology to the family of mammalian small heat shock proteins. Like other small heat shock proteins, α-crystallin subunits associate to form large oligomeric aggregates that express chaperone-like activity, as defined by the ability to suppress nonspecific aggregation of proteins destabilized by treatment with a variety of denaturants including heat, UV irradiation, and chemical modification. It has been proposed that age-related loss of sequences at the C terminus of the αA chain subunit may be a factor in the pathogenesis of cataract due to diminished capacity of the truncated crystallin to protect against nonspecific aggregation of lens proteins. To evaluate the functional consequences of α-crystallin modification, two mutant forms of αA subunits were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. Like wild type (WT), aggregates of ∼540 kDa were formed from a tryptophan-free αA mutant (W9F). When added in stoichiometric amounts, both WT and W9F subunits completely suppressed the heat-induced aggregation of aldose reductase. In contrast, subunits encoded by a truncation mutant in which the C-terminal 17 residues were deleted (R157STOP), despite having spectroscopic properties similar to WT, formed much larger aggregates with a marked reduction in chaperone-like activity. Similar results were observed when the chaperone-like activity was assessed through inhibition of γ-crystallin aggregation induced by singlet oxygen. These results demonstrate that the structurally conservative substitution of Phe for Trp-9 has a negligible effect on the functional interaction of αA subunits, and that deletion of C-terminal sequences from the αA subunit results in substantial loss of chaperone-like activity, despite overall preservation of secondary structure.

The major components of the mammalian lens fiber cells are the α-, β-, and γ-crystallins, which constitute an estimated 35% wet weight of the lens. The crystallins contribute to the transparency and refractive power of the lens by short range interactions among themselves and cytoskeletal elements in a highly concentrated matrix (1Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 1-14Google Scholar, 2Delaye M. Tardieu A.

It is a Mr∼0.6-1.0 × 106 complex composed of two structurally related subunits, designated αA and αB, which are encoded by genes localized to chromosomes 21 and 11, respectively (4Quax-Jeuken Y.

Genomics. 1989; 5: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While expression of the αA gene appears to be preferentially but not exclusively restricted to lens cells (6Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the αB gene product has been described in a broad number of tissues and organs including the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney (7Bhat S.P.

Since the original finding that the C-terminal region of αB-crystallin and Drosophila small heat shock proteins share striking sequence homology (10Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), many investigators have noted structural and functional homologies between α-crystallin and various members of the mammalian small heat shock proteins (sHSP) 1The abbreviations used are: sHSPsmall heat shock proteinWTwild type αA-crystallinW9FTrp-9→Phe substitution in αA-crystallinR157STOPdeletion of amino acids from the C terminus to Glu-156 in αA-crystallinRBrose bengalRNOp-nitrosodimethylanilinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. family. Like other sHSPs, α-crystallin is a large (0.35 to >1 MDa) oligomeric complex and has the ability to suppress nonspecific aggregation of various proteins and enzymes denatured by heat (11Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar), UV irradiation (12Borkman R.F. McLaughlin J. Photochem.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Unlike the classical bacterial chaperonin GroEL, α-crystallin does not participate in folding or reassociation of denatured proteins (14Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Exposure of the lens to various environmental stresses may result in aggregation of proteins and alteration of the refractive index gradient necessary for lens transparency. Several endogenous lens chromophores such as N-formylkynurenine, riboflavin, and age-related yellow compounds absorb light present in the environment and have the capacity to act as photosensitizers generating reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen (16Andley U.P. Albert D.M. Jakobiec F.A. Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology: Clinical Practice. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1994: 575-590Google Scholar). Singlet oxygen has been implicated in the cataractogenic process as a highly reactive species that can cross-link lens proteins and produce high molecular weight aggregates (17Goosey J.D. Zigler Jr., J.S. Kinoshita J.H. Science. 1980; 208: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When illuminated, rose bengal is a classic singlet oxygen generator (18Lamberts J.J.M. Neckers D.C. Tetrahedron. 1985; 41: 2183-2190Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effects of singlet oxygen on lens crystallin structure and cross-linking have been relatively well studied (17Goosey J.D. Zigler Jr., J.S. Kinoshita J.H. Science. 1980; 208: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Balasubramanian D. Du X. Zigler Jr., J.S. Photochem.

Since crystallins exist for the lifespan of the host due to the virtual absence of protein turnover in mature lens fiber cells, it seems likely that mechanisms must exist to maintain these proteins in their native conformations throughout decades of exposure to metabolic and environmental insult. Whether α-crystallin functions as a molecular chaperone to suppress protein aggregation in lens cells is the subject of intensive study. Structure-function studies to probe the mechanism of chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin can be assisted with the use of recombinant α-crystallin subunits and protein substrates. The chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is reported to decrease as a function of age (21Horwitz J. Emmons T. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), possibly due to proteolytic loss of sequences from the C terminus of the αA chain subunit (22Takemoto L. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Takemoto L. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H NMR studies showed that the 6 amino acids at the C terminus of the αA subunit comprise a highly flexible tail having no detectable role in inter- or intrasubunit interaction (24Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Ralston G.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, efforts to understand the consequences of C-terminal modification in a structural context have not been successful due to lack of an accepted model for the α-crystallin complex. The protein has a predominantly β-sheet secondary structure, but a universal model consistent with all the available experimental evidence has not been established (reviewed in 25de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A. Voorter C.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of a confirmed structure, the α-crystallin complex can be probed using novel mutant proteins designed to enhance the resolving power of various spectroscopic probes. To this end, we constructed a mutant form of αA-crystallin (W9F) containing phenylalanine substituted for the sole Trp residue at position 9. Utilization of this tryptophan-free mutant made it possible to probe the interaction of α-crystallin with substrate proteins by taking advantage of the tryptophan fluorescence of the substrate without interference from tryptophan of α-crystallin itself (26Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, construction of a truncated αA chain subunit in which the C-terminal 17 amino acids were deleted (R157STOP) now enables us to estimate the functional consequences of in vivo proteolysis, a posttranslational modification postulated to be a factor in the apparent reduction in chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin in the aged lens (22Takemoto L. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study we have developed a system to probe the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin using a reconstituted system derived entirely from recombinant human lens proteins. The chaperone-like activity of αA-crystallin as well as the W9F and R157STOP mutants was assessed using two independent tests involving inhibition of heat denaturation of human aldose reductase, a protein linked to the pathogenesis of sugar cataract (27Kinoshita J.H. Nishimura C. Diabetes-Metab. Rev. 1988; 4: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and inhibition of singlet-oxygen induced aggregation of human γD-crystallin. Our results show that the recombinant αA subunit has secondary and tertiary structures similar to that of native αA isolated from human lenses. The recombinant protein forms aggregates of similar size to those of native α-crystallin and completely prevents heat-induced aggregation of aldose reductase as well as singlet oxygen-induced aggregation of γD-crystallin. Both mutated αA subunits form oligomeric complexes and display far-UV CD spectra similar to the wild type protein. Results from the two different chaperone assay procedures were concordant and showed that the chaperone-like activity of the tryptophan-free W9F mutant was virtually unaffected, while that of the R157STOP truncation mutant was markedly reduced. Complementary DNA clones (cDNA) encoding γ-crystallins were constructed by the reverse transcriptase-PCR method. Total RNA was typically isolated from a single human lens by homogenization in Trizol (TelTest, Friendswood, TX) followed by thorough extraction with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. First strand cDNA synthesis, primed with an oligo(dT) adaptor (Table I), was catalyzed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase contained in a RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). Amplification of target sequences by PCR was carried out using the oligo(dT) adaptor and upstream primers designed with reference to γC- and γD-crystallin genes, respectively (Table I). PCR products, which migrated as prominent bands at the expected position on agarose gels, were gel-purified (QIAextract, Qiagen, Palo Alto, CA), treated with T4 DNA polymerase to expose cohesive ends and subsequently cloned into the pDIRECT plasmid vector (accession no. U02449 (1993)) following the vendor's guidelines (PCR-Direct™ cloning system, Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid minipreps from the resulting transformants were screened for γ-crystallin sequences by restriction mapping and Southern blot hydridization with a bovine γ-crystallin cDNA (28Hay R.E. Woods W.D. Church R.L. Petrash J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sequence of both strands of selected cDNA clones was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (Amersham) or by cycle sequencing using Taq DNA polymerase contained in a sequencing kit (Promega). At least two individual clones for each amplified γ-crystallin transcript were sequenced and found to contain identical structures. For overexpression of γ-crystallins in Escherichia coli, their cDNA sequences were subcloned into an expression vector derived from pMON20,400, a derivative of the plasmid expression vector described previously (30Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Bhatnagar A. Liu S. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their cDNA sequences were excised from pDIRECT by digestion with SacI, followed by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase to produce blunt ends. Plasmids were then treated with NcoI to produce a restriction fragment containing the complete coding sequence and 3′-nontranslated region. Such fragments were purified from agarose gel slices and ligated into pMON20,400 which had been sequentially treated with EcoRI, DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment), and NcoI. Coding regions were completely sequenced after cloning into expression plasmids to ensure that no unintended mutations had been introduced. For expression studies, plasmids were introduced into E. coli strain JM101. Cultures (1.6 liters) were grown in baffled shaker flasks as described previously (30Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Bhatnagar A. Liu S. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hay R.E. Andley U.P. Petrash J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Expression of crystallins was induced in logarithmic cultures by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM and cultures were grown for an additional 12-18 h. Cells from a typical culture (A600∼ 6) were collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and were extracted by treatment with DNase (Sigma) and lysozyme essentially as described (32Merck K.B. De Haard Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Extraction buffers contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (each at 1 μg/ml) including antipain, bestatin, chymotrypsin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim).Table I.Oligonucleotide primersPrimerApplicationGene specific sequenceReferenceaGene sequences on which primers were designed are referenced according to their GenBank accession numbers.pD5CRYGCγC upstream primerCGTGTCAACCCAGCC-3′K03003pD5CRYGDγD upstream primerCGCCCAGCCAGCCA-3′K03005pD5CRYAAαA upstream primerbUnderlined bases represent an addition to the 5′ extension to create anNcoI site in the PCR product which facilitated itscloning into the expression vector.CCATGGACGTGACCATCCAG-3′X14789pD3CRYAAαA downstream primerGGCTGCTATCTAA-3′X14789W9F upstreamW9F mutagenesisAUC CAG CAC CCC UUU UUC AAG CGC ACC CUG-3′W9F downstreamW9F mutagenesisCUU GAA AAA GGG GUG CUG GAU GGU CAC GUC-3′R157STOP upstreamR157STOP mutagenesisCCA CGC UGC GUG AGC CAU CCC CGT GTC-3′R157STOP downstreamR157STOP mutagenesisGGA UGG CUC ACU CAG CGT GGG TGG CAT-3′a Gene sequences on which primers were designed are referenced according to their GenBank accession numbers.b Underlined bases represent an addition to the 5′ extension to create anNcoI site in the PCR product which facilitated itscloning into the expression vector. Open table in a new tab Recombinant crystallins were purified by chromatography using Macro-Prep S cation exchange resin (Bio-Rad). Chromatography steps were conducted at 23°C in columns shielded from ambient light. In addition to other components as specified, all chromatography buffers contained 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA. The crude lysate was dialyzed (Mr∼ 12,000-14,000 cut-off) at 4°C first against 70 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). A white precipitate, comprised primarily of lysozyme, formed during this dialysis step was removed by centrifugation (27,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C). The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 70 volumes of 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 6.0) and was applied at 1 ml/min to a column (2.5 × 30 cm) packed with Macro-Prep S previously equilibrated with 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 6.0). After a wash to remove unadsorbed material, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium acetate (0-500 mM) contained in the column buffer. The presence of γ-crystallin in elution fractions was estimated by co-migration on SDS-PAGE of recombinant crystallins with native γ-crystallin purified from human and/or bovine lenses (see below). Western blotting of selected fractions using antisera against native bovine γ-crystallin (31Hay R.E. Andley U.P. Petrash J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was also used to verify the identity of putative γ-crystallin protein bands on SDS gels. Selected peak fractions containing γ-crystallin were pooled and concentrated by pressure filtration (Amicon) using Mr 10,000 cut-off membranes (YM10, Amicon, MA). Where indicated, γ-crystallins were further purified by chromatography using a 1.0 × 100-cm FPLC column packed with Superose 200 gel permeation chromatography support (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purified materials were stored at −20°C. γ-crystallins were quantified by Bradford assays (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Alternatively, homogeneous preparations of γC and γD were quantified by measurements of A280 assuming ϵ = 41.4 mM−1 cm−1 calculated on the basis of amino acid composition (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA clones encoding human αA-crystallin were constructed using the reverse transcriptase-PCR method following the general approach described above for the γ-crystallins. First strand cDNA synthesis was primed with a downstream primer/adaptor designed to anneal in the 3′-untranslated region approximately 350 base pairs downstream from the translational termination codon (Table I). An upstream primer overlapping to the translational initiation codon was designed with reference to the published sequence of human αA-crystallin gene (35Jaworski C.J. Piatigorsky J. Nature. 1989; 337: 752-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The upstream primer was also designed to create an NcoI recognition site precisely at the initiation codon to aid in subsequent transfer of the cloned cDNA into our expression vector. A prominent band corresponding to the expected ∼800-base pair PCR product was extracted from agarose gel slices and cloned into pDIRECT as described above. Transformants in E. coli strain DH5α were identified by PCR screening using primers designed to anneal at vector sites flanking the cloned cDNA (T3 and T7 primer binding sites, respectively). Nucleotide sequence analysis of both strands of selected clones confirmed the colinearity of the published sequence of the human αA-crystallin gene and our cloned cDNA. The cloned cDNA was then excised from the pDIRECT vector by digestion with NcoI and HindIII and transferred into pMON20,400. Mutants of αA-crystallin was produced by site-directed mutagenesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). The W9F mutant was created by replacing Trp-9 with Phe (W9F). A truncation mutant in which the C-terminal 17 amino acids were deleted was constructed by converting the codon for Arg-157 (CGA) to a translational termination codon (UGA). In all cases, coding sequences in both wild type and mutant expression constructs were completely sequenced to verify the structures of their encoded proteins. Mutagenesis primers are shown in Table I. Overexpression of human αA-crystallin was achieved in E. coli strain JM101. Recombinant proteins were extracted from host cells by the DNase/lysozyme method as described above for the γ-crystallins. When necessary, insoluble proteins present in the initial crude cell extract were purified by treatment for 30 min at 23°C with cracking buffer consisting of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 6 M urea, 142 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors. Materials solubilized in cracking buffer, as with buffer-soluble materials, were dialyzed (Mr 12,000-14,000 cut-off tubing) against 70 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After centrifugation to remove precipitated materials, lysates were dialyzed in chromatography buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA) and applied at 1 ml/min to a column packed with Macro-Prep Q anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad). Bound proteins were eluted with a 0-0.5 M NaCl linear salt gradient. Column fractions were continuously monitored by measuring the A280, which revealed a single predominant peak. The corresponding fractions were pooled and αA-crystallin further purified by gel permeation chromatography using Sephacryl S400 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Quantification of homogeneous preparations of α-crystallins was carried out by measuring A280 using extinction coefficients calculated as described previously (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). In some cases, recombinant crystallins were purified by FPLC chromatography on Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 200 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) gel as described previously (31Hay R.E. Andley U.P. Petrash J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The gel filtration buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. Aggregate sizes of α-crystallin complexes were estimated by gel permeation chromatography operated as described above. Size standards including thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) were applied as recommended by the supplier (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Crystallins in column fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The ability of α-crystallin to suppress thermal-induced aggregation of purified aldose reductase was assessed by incubating 0.28 μM recombinant human aldose reductase (30Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Bhatnagar A. Liu S. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 52°C in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 1 mM dithiothreitol in the presence of varying amounts of αA-crystallin. Aggregation of aldose reductase was monitored at 360 nm for at least 30 min using a Cary 1E spectrophotometer interfaced with a thermojacketed cuvette positioner. Reaction blanks containing buffer alone or crystallin alone were run in parallel. Singlet oxygen-induced opacification studies were performed by periodic measurement of absorbance at 295, 300, 400, 500, 548.6, and 600 nm with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 4B spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra of crystallins were measured using 1-cm pathlength quartz cells. Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer MPF-66 spectrofluorometer. Circular dichroism spectra were measured with a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter, as described previously (31Hay R.E. Andley U.P. Petrash J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD measurements were made between 200-250 nm with 1-mm pathlength cells, and near-UV CD spectra were measured between 250 and 350 nm with 1-cm pathlength cells. Crystallins were treated with 0.1 μM rose bengal (RB) and irradiated with 546.8 nm light for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. This photodynamic system has been shown to generate singlet oxygen in aqueous buffered solutions, with negligible formation of free radicals (18Lamberts J.J.M. Neckers D.C. Tetrahedron. 1985; 41: 2183-2190Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The light scattering by recombinant γD solutions was measured immediately after irradiation. Singlet oxygen produced in this system was detected spectrophotometrically by measuring the bleaching of p-nitrosodimethylaniline (RNO) induced by the reaction of singlet oxygen with imidazole (36Krajlic I. Mohsni S.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 577-581Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing 8 mM imidazole, 0.1 μM RB, 50 μM RNO in phosphate-buffered saline was exposed to 548.6 nm radiation, and the photobleaching of RNO was monitored at 440 nm. The control sample contained all the above reagents except imidazole. A quantitative estimate of singlet oxygen formation was accomplished by directly measuring the amount of imidazole oxidized under the conditions of irradiation of lens proteins. In this assay imidazole acts as an acceptor of the singlet oxygen, with the resulting imidazole endoperoxide causing the bleaching of RNO. The RNO bleaching rises slowly at first and then increases rapidly with time of irradiation (Fig. 1). Singlet oxygen has a high reaction rate constant with His and Trp residues of proteins (k = 2.8 × 107 for His and 0.6 × 107 for Trp). Production of singlet oxygen was confirmed by measuring γ-crystallin aggregation with the addition of a quencher, sodium azide, to the lens protein solutions. Antibodies against purified bovine lens α-crystallin were prepared in rabbits essentially as described previously for other antigens (31Hay R.E. Andley U.P. Petrash J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted to nitrocellulose or Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and were probed with antisera (diluted 1000-fold) under the conditions used previously (37Petrash J.M. DeLucas L.J. Bowling E. Egen N. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Immune complexes on filter blots were visualized by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to either alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) or 125I-protein A (Amersham). While mRNAs encoding a variety of crystallins have been cloned from lenses of many experimental animal models (reviewed in 38Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), it is surprising that most of the orthologous human crystallin gene transcripts have not been characterized. Given the practical difficulties in obtaining adequate human lens material to support traditional cloning studies, we sought to apply PCR-based cloning technology for rapid amplif"
https://openalex.org/W2113780740,"We have recently demonstrated that a human amniotic fluid-derived glycoprotein, glycodelin-A (GdA; previously known as PP14 or PAEP), potently inhibits gamete binding in an established sperm-egg binding system and expresses immunosuppressive activities directed against a variety of different immune cell types. GdA has high mannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type biantennary oligosaccharides including structures with fucosylated or sialylated N,N′-diacetyllactosediamine (GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc) sequences, which are rare in other human glycoproteins. We now report the characterization of glycodelin-S (GdS). This is a human seminal plasma glycoprotein that is immunologically indistinguishable from GdA, but unlike the latter, does not inhibit human sperm-zona pellucida binding under hemizona assay conditions. Analysis of the N-glycans of GdS by mass spectrometry revealed that all glycoforms of GdS are different from those of GdA. GdS glycans are unusually fucose-rich, and the major complex-type structures are biantennary glycans with Lewisx (Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc) and Lewisy (Fucα1-2Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc) antennae. It is probable that these highly fucosylated epitopes contribute to the immunosuppressive activity of human seminal plasma and to the low immunogenicity of sperm. This study provides the first evidence for gender-specific glycosylation that may serve to regulate key processes involved in human reproduction.

https://openalex.org/W2051588573,"Site-specific substitutions of as few as four amino acids (M46I/L63P/V82T/I84V) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease engenders cross-resistance to a panel of protease inhibitors that are either in clinical trials or have recently been approved for HIV therapy (Condra, J. H., Schleif, W. A., Blahy, O. M., Gadryelski, L. J., Graham, D. J., Quintero, J. C., Rhodes, A., Robbins, H. L., Roth, E., Shivaprakash, M., Titus, D., Yang, T., Teppler, H., Squires, K. E., Deutsch, P. J., and Emini, E. A. (1995) Nature374, 569-571). These four substitutions are among the prominent mutations found in primary HIV isolates obtained from patients undergoing therapy with several protease inhibitors. Two of these mutations (V82T/I84V) are located in, while the other two (M46I/L63P) are away from, the binding cleft of the enzyme. The functional role of these mutations has now been delineated in terms of their influence on the binding affinity and catalytic efficiency of the protease. We have found that the double substitutions of M46I and L63P do not affect binding but instead endow the enzyme with a catalytic efficiency significantly exceeding (110-360%) that of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the double substitutions of V82T and I84V are detrimental to the ability of the protease to bind and, thereby, to catalyze. When combined, the four amino acid replacements institute in the protease resistance against inhibitors and a significantly higher catalytic activity than one containing only mutations in its active site. The results suggest that in raising drug resistance, these four site-specific mutations of the protease are compensatory in function; those in the active site diminish equilibrium binding (by increasing Ki), and those away from the active site enhance catalysis (by increasing kcat/KM). This conclusion is further supported by energy estimates in that the Gibbs free energies of binding and catalysis for the quadruple mutant are quantitatively dictated by those of the double mutants.

Nature. 1995; 374: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Three of these inhibitors, Ritonavir (Ro 31-8959), Saquinavir (ABT-538), and Indinavir (MK-639), have been approved by the U. S. Federal Drug Administration as therapeutic agents for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. The 4X mutant protease is a poor enzyme. Two of its mutations, V82T and I84V, are located in the active site of the protease (see Fig. 1), and their perturbations of binding have been deduced from the x-ray structure (2Chen Z. Li Y. Schock H.B. Hall D. Chen E. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21433-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); the V82T substitution introduces an unfavorable hydrophilic moiety for binding in the active site, and the I84V substitution creates a void (unoccupied by water) that should lead to a decrease in van der Waals contacts with the inhibitor. The combined contribution accounts for a total loss of ∼3 kcal/mol in energetics. 2This estimate is in agreement with the 70-fold drop in binding affinity obtained from kinetic measurements (see 2Chen Z.

The other two mutations are in the flap (M46I) and hinge (L63P) domains of the protease, and their role in drug resistance is not apparent from the crystallographic data. These changes only induce minor perturbations in the flap domain, as well as in the hinge region, of the native enzyme. One possibility is that the M46I and L63P substitutions affect the stability and/or activity of the enzyme unrelated directly to but ameliorate for the deleterious effect on equilibrium binding by the V82T/I84V mutations. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 resistant mutant HIV-1 protease containing the M46I/L63P/V82T/I84V substitutions dimethyl sulfoxide dithiothreitol high performance liquid chromatography 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid strong cation exchange precursor protein containing HIV non-envelope structural proteins precursor protein containing HIV protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. The 4X mutant is derived from clinical studies of AIDS patient viral isolates and is not an intermediate found in the path of emergence of HIV resistance, but it provides a model system with which we may be able to gain some understanding of HIV drug resistance at the molecular level. With the aid of a panel of inhibitors and peptide substrates, the functional roles of these four mutations have now been evaluated in terms of the binding affinity and catalytic efficiency of the two double mutants (M46I/L63P and V82T/I84V) that comprise the 4X protease. The results reveal that contributions of the two pairs of mutations toward the energetics of binding and catalysis are quantitatively countervailing, with those in the active site of the enzyme (the V82T/I84V substitutions) diminishing affinity for inhibitors and those away from the active site (the M46I/L63P replacements) enhancing catalysis. The coupled action of these or similar mutations could possibly be necessary for the production of viable, resistant HIV variants. The pET-3b-HIV1Pr-4X plasmid containing the synthetic gene for the 4X mutant of the HIV-1 protease was constructed as described previously (2Chen Z. Li Y. Schock H.B. Hall D. Chen E. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21433-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The pET-3b-HIV1Pr-M46I/L63P plasmid was constructed by subcloning the pET-3b-HIV1Pr-4X KpnI/AvaI fragment containing the M46I/L63P mutations into the corresponding sites of the wild-type (3Ido E. Han H. Kezdy F.J. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24359-24366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) pET-3b-HIV1Pr plasmid. The pET-3b-HIV1Pr-V82T/I84V plasmid was constructed by subcloning the pET-3b-HIV1Pr KpnI/AvaI fragment containing the wild-type protease sequence into the corresponding sites of the pET-3b-HIV1Pr-4X plasmid. Sequence-verified clones were transformed as described (2Chen Z. Li Y. Schock H.B. Hall D. Chen E. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21433-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Host cells were grown to an optical density of 0.4 to 0.6 at 600 nm in Luria-Burtani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and induced with 400 μM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were pelleted and stored at −70°C until use. The 4X protease was expressed in a ratio of ∼90% mature protease (11 kDa) to ∼10% miniprecursor protease (14 kDa), as demonstrated previously for the wild-type enzyme (3Ido E. Han H. Kezdy F.J. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24359-24366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.001% lysozyme, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.0001% DNase I on ice. The mutant protease was extracted from inclusion bodies with solubilizing buffer (6 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM DTT). Insoluble particulates were removed with ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) sizing column pre-equilibrated with solubilizing buffer. Elution was performed at 1.25 ml/min, and fractions containing the active protease were pooled and re-folded for 5 h at 4°C by a 1-10-fold dilution in 50 mM MES, pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol. The diluted sample was adjusted to 2 M NaCl and added batch-wise to Bakerbond Wide-Pore Hi-Propyl*C3 resin for 3 h. The protease-bound resin was poured into an Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 50 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol. The protease was then eluted with the same buffer without NaCl. Fractions containing active protease were pooled and adjusted to <70 mM NaCl by dilution into a solution of 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. The diluted sample was filtered prior to loading onto a polysulfonethyl strong cation exchange (SCX) column (The Nest Group). Protease was eluted from the SCX column in 50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol with a gradient to 650 mM NaCl. Fractions containing the enzyme were concentrated in a CentriPrep device (Amicon) to a final volume of 8 ml and loaded on an affinity column of Pepstatin Agarose Resin (Sigma). The protease was eluted at pH 5.5. The purest fractions were pooled and concentrated with a final yield of 7 mg of protease per liter of induction culture. Both concentration and homogeneity of the purified enzyme were confirmed by amino acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing. The M46I/L63P mutant was expressed as described above and extracted from inclusion bodies in 8 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT and refolded at room temperature by a 1-20-fold dilution into refold buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol) at pH 3.7. After 3 h, the pH of the refold sample was adjusted to 5.5 prior to its chromatography on an SCX column and a pepstatin-agarose column as described above. The M46I/L63P mutant protease was eluted from the pepstatin column at pH 3.5. The purified protease was concentrated for a final yield of 0.4 mg of protease per liter of induction culture; its homogeneity and concentration were determined by amino acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing. The V82T/I84V mutant was expressed in ratios of 5% mature protease to 95% miniprecursor. The protease was dissolved and chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column as described. The fractions containing protease, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, were pooled and diluted 100-fold in refold buffer at pH 4.5 and 25°C. The unprocessed miniprecursor protease was precipitated with 2 M NaCl, washed with refold buffer, solubilized in 3 M acetic acid, and diluted to 0.05 mg/ml. The sample was stirred gently at pH 4.5 for 2 h to allow for conversion to the mature protease prior to its pH being readjusted to 5.5. The supernatant containing the mature form of the V82T/I84V protease was applied at a rate of 2.5 ml/min to an affinity column (Affi-Gel 10 Resin (Bio-Rad) coupled to the protease inhibitor L-734,353 (Ki∼11 nM)); the column was preequilibrated in equilibration buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, pH 5.5). The column was washed with 5 volumes of equilibration buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by 10 volumes of equilibration buffer, 2.5 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2 volumes of equilibration buffer. The mutant protease was eluted from the column with 50 mM CAPS, 20% ethylene glycol, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT at pH 10.5. Fractions were immediately neutralized to pH 5.5 with 3 M acetic acid, and those containing pure protease were pooled and concentrated in a CentriPrep prior to diluting in 3 volumes of pre-neutralized elution buffer containing no ethylene glycol. The homogeneity of the V82T/I84V mutant protease was determined to be >95% by N-terminal sequencing. The HIV-1 protease inhibitors Indinavir (MK-639) (4Dorsey B.D. Levin R.B. McDaniel S.L. Vacca J.

Substrates I-VI were solubilized in Me2SO to a concentration of 25 mg/ml (12.53-15.65 mM). Substrates VII and VIII were initially solubilized in Me2SO at 12.5 mg/ml; the solubility of these peptides was then increased to 25 mg/ml with additional powder peptides and flash-heating in boiling water for 5 s and immediately returned to room temperature. To restrict the final Me2SO concentration in the enzymic assays to <4%, the maximum assay concentration of substrate was limited to the following: I, 352 μM; II, 322 μM; III and VI, 358 μM; IV, 313 μM; V, 367 μM; VII, 391 μM; VIII, 343 μM. The catalytic activities of the wild-type and mutant HIV-1 proteases were measured with peptide hydrolysis assays (10Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 11Darke P.L. Jordan S.P. Hall D.L. Zugay J.A. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 30°C and pH 5.5 in 50 mM sodium acetate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and Me2SO (at 3.75% for inhibition assays and at 2.5% for other assays). Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme following a 5-min pre-incubation at 30°C and were quenched by the addition of phosphoric acid to 4% (v/v). The appearance of products and the corresponding loss of substrate were monitored with ultraviolet absorbance at 225 nm on a 5-cm C-18 reversed phase HPLC column (Vydac). Gradients employing 0.1% phosphoric acid and acetonitrile were developed and optimized for separation of each substrate and its corresponding products (see figure and table legends for details). All substrates and their hydrolyzed products were stable in assay buffer and 4% phosphoric acid at 25°C for 24 h with the exception of V. At room temperature, the hydrolyzed products of V precipitated in assay buffer and 4% phosphoric acid within 15 min, while at 4°C, there was no detectable precipitation for >24 h. Consequently, samples containing V and its products were placed at 4°C immediately after quenching and were incubated at the same temperature in a chilled auto-sampler until just prior to HPLC injection. Steady-state and initial velocity conditions were established and strictly observed in the reactions catalyzed by the wild-type and mutant enzymes for every peptide substrate.

When saturation was not achieved; the value of kcat/KM was obtained from least-squares fits of the linear slope of plots of initial velocity as a function of substrate concentration at [S] ≪ KM. The values of Ki were obtained for each competitive inhibitor in steady-state turnover assays of I, or the derivative of I (VSQN-(β-naphthylalanine)-PIV), catalyzed by each protease, under the condition that [S] ≪ KM. Reactions were initiated in the presence of inhibitor by addition of a protease, at a concentration at least less than one-half the Ki value, and were allowed to proceed at 30°C for 1 h. At least three different concentrations of each inhibitor were employed to determine Ki with use of Equation 1:Ki=[I]f⋅{1(kcat/KM)−i÷(kcat/KM)+i−1},(Eq. 1) where [I]f is the free inhibitor concentration in equilibrium with enzyme, (kcat/KM)-i and (kcat/KM)+i are the apparent substrate specificity of the enzyme in the absence and presence of a competitive inhibitor, respectively. All three purified enzymes, the 4X, the V82T/I84V, and the M46I/L63P proteases, are stable homodimers in the 5-375 nM concentration range, as is the wild-type protease (11Darke P.L. Jordan S.P. Hall D.L. Zugay J.A. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have found that there is no detectable dissociation of these dimers into their monomeric subunits during catalysis, either in the presence or absence of inhibitors; the specificity of each protease is independent of enzyme concentration. 4We note that for some point mutants of the HIV-1 protease an increase in the equilibrium constant has been observed (H. Schock and L. Kuo, unpublished data) for dissociation of the homodimer. For these mutants, dissociation of the protease subunits needs be accounted for (11Darke P.L. Jordan S.P. Hall D.L. Zugay J.A. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in the calculations of kinetic and equilibrium constants. Hence, analyses of the kinetic behavior of a mutant HIV-1 protease should begin with an analysis of its dimer stability. Fig. 4 shows the saturation curves of the wild-type HIV-1 protease and its 4X mutant in their catalysis of steady-state hydrolysis of peptides representing two of the eight cleavage sites in the GAG-POL polyproteins. One (VII) is saturating while the other (VIII) is not. The saturation curves for the other six peptides are similar, with characteristics as described below, and are not shown separately here. Bound by solubility varying from 60 to 300 μM in a reaction buffer containing 3.75% Me2SO, only substrates III and VII are saturating for the wild-type, the 4X, and the M46I/L63P proteases. None is saturating for the V82T/I84V protease. For III and VII, the KM values are 0.25 and 0.065 mM for the wild-type protease, 0.94 and 0.33 mM for the 4X mutant, and 0.05 and 0.043 mM for the M46I/L63P mutant, respectively. For the other substrates, KM is likely to be in the very high micromolar range for the majority of the peptides (based on estimates with use of the double-reciprocal plots) so that accurate values are determinable only for kcat/KM measured from the linear increase of initial velocity with substrate concentration at [S] ≪ KM. Table I compares the values of kcat/KM observed for the hydrolysis of the eight cleavage site peptides catalyzed by the HIV-1 protease and its three variants. It can be seen that kcat/KM varies drastically for these substrates. For the wild-type enzyme, the kcat/KM values range from <400 (IV) to ≥100,000 M−1 s−1 (V). 5Our observed specificity (kcat/KM) is similar in magnitude to those reported, 103 to 105 M−1 s−1, by Tozser et al. (12Tozser J. Blaha I. Copeland T.D. Wondrak E.M. Oroszlan S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) whose assay buffer contains 7.5% glycerol and 2 M NaCl. The notable difference is that their observed apparent KM values are smaller than ours. One possible reason is that the high ionic strength of their buffer may increase the binding affinity of their substrates that are different in length (8-11 residues) from ours. A second possibility is that our longer substrates intrinsically possess higher KM values. We have noted that the apparent affinity of HIV-1 protease inhibitors is substantially increased by buffer ionic strength (P. Darke and L. Kuo, unpublished data). For the 4X mutant, the kcat/KM values are significantly smaller ranging from ∼60 (VIII) to ∼6,800 M−1 s−1 (V). These values are further diminished for all of the substrates by an additional 12-70% when mutational substitutions are restricted to V82T and I84V. In contrast, the catalytic efficiency of the M46I/L63P mutant is unexpectedly found to be greater than that of the wild-type enzyme for every substrate by 110-360%. Table II lists the binding constants (Ki) of the four potent HIV protease inhibitors (Fig. 2) for the wild-type and each of the mutant HIV proteases. Each of these inhibitors is currently being evaluated in various phases of clinical studies for antiviral effect. For the wild-type protease, all of these inhibitors display subnanomolar binding affinity in our low-salt (50 mM sodium acetate) reaction buffer. For the mutants, the Ki values are increased by the 4X and the V82T/I84V but not the M46I/L63P substitutions.Table IIDissociation constants (Ki) of four potent protease inhibitors as obtained from their inhibition of the hydrolytic reactions catalyzed by the HIV-1 protease and its resistance-conferring mutants.InhibitorWild-type4XM46I/L63PV82T/I84VnMnMnMnMMK-6390.4021.60.4723.7ABT-5380.1928.50.1530.1Ro 31-89590.3311.90.3713.3VX-4780.575.80.5310.1 Open table in a new tab There is no clear classification of the sequences representing the eight cleavage sites of the GAG-POL polyproteins of HIV. Most researchers consider these sites to be represented by two types of substrates, those containing Tyr/Phe-Pro and those containing other hydrophobic-hydrophobic residues at the P1-P1′ positions (13Griffiths J.T. Phylip J. Konvalinka J. Strop P. Gustchina A. Wlodawer A. Davenport R.J. Briggs R. Dunn B.M. Kay J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Petit S.C. Simsic J. Loeb D.D. Everitt L. Hutchison III, C.A. Swanstrom R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14539-14547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bulky aromatic residues are not found in the P2 and P2′ positions. We have attempted to mimic better the natural protease substrates and to make comparison as direct and relevant as possible, by increasing the length of our peptides to 13 residues for all eight cleavage sites, with each peptide containing 7 residues on its N-terminal side (P-sites) of the scissile bond. Low solubility (<400 μM) is a severe limitation that discourages us from further increasing the length of these peptides. The HIV-1 protease specificity for the eight substrates varies enormously and bears no obvious structure-activity relationship (Table I). In particular, there is no apparent specificity dependence on the identities of the immediate residues linked by the scissile bond. 6Similar observations have been reported previously for peptides of different lengths assayed under different conditions (12Tozser J. Blaha I. Copeland T.D. Wondrak E.M. Oroszlan S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Tozser J. Gustchina A. Weber I.T. Blaha I. Wondrak E.M. Oroszlan S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4793-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, peptide V is the fastest substrate (∼105 M−1 s−1), and peptides II, IV, and VIII are the slowest (<103 M−1 s−1). Interestingly, all three slow substrates have a leucine at either the P1 or P1′ position. On the other hand, both the fastest (V) and the slowest (IV) peptides contain phenylalanine in the P1 and asparagine in the P2 sites. Also, both peptides V and VI contain phenylalanine, asparagine, and proline in the P2, P1, and P1′ sites, respectively, but the kcat/KM value for VI is only ∼8% that of V. These results are consistent with the suggestion (13Griffiths J.T. Phylip J. Konvalinka J. Strop P. Gustchina A. Wlodawer A. Davenport R.J. Briggs R. Dunn B.M. Kay J.

We note that although our substrates are of equal length and span well beyond the entire active site cleft of the protease, the kcat/KM values reported here do not necessarily reflect the precise in vivo specificity of polyprotein processing since short oligopeptides in general possess little or no definable secondary structure. 7By determining the accessibility of the protease to the various cleavage sites, Petit et al. (18Pettit S.C. Moody M.D. Wehbie R.S. Kaplan A.H. Nantermet P.V. Klein C.A. Swanstrom R. J.

Reviews of HIV protease substrates with natural and substituted sequences of the GAG-POL polyproteins have been presented by Dunn et al. (19Dunn B.M. Gustchina A. Wlodawer A. Kay J.

SCP-2 bound fluorescent fatty acyl-CoAs at a single site with high affinity. Kd values for cis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoA were 4.5 and 2.8 nM, respectively. Saturated 10-18-carbon and unsaturated 14-20-carbon fatty acyl-CoAs displaced SCP-2-bound fluorescent ligand. Oleoyl-CoA and oleic acid (but not coenzyme A) significantly altered SCP-2 Trp50 emission and anisotropy decay, thereby increasing SCP-2 rotational correlation time, SCP-2 hydrodynamic radius, and SCP-2 Trp50 remaining anisotropy up to 1.7-, 1.2-, and 1.3-fold, respectively. These changes were not accompanied by significant alterations in protein secondary structure as determined by circular dichroism. Finally, SCP-2 differentially altered the fluorescence emission and anisotropy decays of bound cis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoA. Both fluorescent fatty acyl-CoAs were located within a very ordered (limited cone angle of rotation) environment within SCP-2, as shown by a remaining anisotropy of 0.365 and 0.361 and a wobbling cone angle of 12 and 13°, respectively. These anisotropy values were very close to those of such ligands in a propylene glass. However, the rotational relaxation times exhibited by SCP-2-bound cis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoA, 8.4-8.8 ns, were longer than those for the corresponding free fatty acid, 7.5-6.6 ns.

Long chain fatty acyl-CoAs are not only important in the intermediary metabolism of fatty acids and the production of cellular energy; they are also potent regulators of many intracellular functions including neutrophil signaling, Ca2+ signaling, insulin release, protein acylation, protein kinase activation, and gene transcription (reviewed in 1Gossett R.E. Frolov A.A. Roths J.B. Behnke W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1996; 31: 895-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The fatty acyl-CoAs are extremely potent, with regulatory activities occurring in the low nanomolar range (2Oram J.F. Wenger J.I. Neely J.R. J. Biol.

Cellular concentrations of fatty acyl-CoAs range from 2 to 248 nmol/g of protein, depending on tissue, and are as high as 110-150 μM in the cytosol of normal liver (reviewed in 1Gossett R.E. Frolov A.A. Roths J.B. Behnke W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1996; 31: 895-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fatty acyl-CoA levels can vary over a 20-fold range, depending on nutrition, drugs, endocrine status, or oxygenation (reviewed in 1Gossett R.E. Frolov A.A. Roths J.B. Behnke W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1996; 31: 895-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cytosolic fatty acyl-CoAs are found bound to cell membranes (7Sumper M. Trauble H. FEBS Lett. 1973; 30: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and to small nonenzymatic cytosolic proteins. It was recognized over 20 years ago that cytosolic fatty acid-binding proteins, representing 2-6% of cytosolic protein, can bind fatty acyl-CoAs (reviewed in 1Gossett R.E. Frolov A.A. Roths J.B. Behnke W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Lipids. 1996; 31: 895-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More than 17 members of this family have thus far been identified, with most of them having low micromolar affinities for fatty acyl-CoAs. More recently a totally different fatty acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), 1The abbreviations used are: ACBPfatty acyl-CoA-binding proteinSCP-2sterol carrier protein-2I-FABPintestinal fatty acid-binding proteinL-FABPliver fatty acid-binding proteinCoASHcoenzyme A; cis-parinaric acid, 9Z,11E,13E,15Z-octadecatetraenoic acid; cis-parinaroyl-CoA, 9Z,11E,13E,15Z-octadecatetraenoyl coenzyme Adimethyl-POPOP1,4-bis[4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazollyl]benzenediphenylhexatriene-PC1-palmitoyl-2-(3-[diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatrienyl]propionyl)sn-3-phosphocholine. unrelated to the fatty acid-binding protein superfamily, was reported (8Knudsen J.

In contrast to the ACBP, the cellular sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) has long been associated with the metabolism of lipids, especially cholesterol (reviewed in 11Schroeder F. Frolov A.A. Murphy E.J. Atshaves B.P. Pu L. Wood W.G. Foxworth W.B. Kier A.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 149-176Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Like ACBP, SCP-2 is also a ubiquitous protein, identical in all tissues examined (12Myers-Payne S. Fontaine R.N. Loeffler A.L. Hubbell T. Pu L. Rao A.M. Kier A.B. Wood W.G. Schroeder F. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SCP-2 appears localized in subcellular organelles intimately involved with fatty acid oxidation, the peroxisomes, and mitochondria, with lesser amounts in the cytosol and near endoplasmic reticulum (13Keller G.A. Scallen T.J. Clarke D. Maher P.A. Krisans S.K. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that SCP-2 can bind fatty acids with Kd values near 0.2 μM (14Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) led us to examine whether SCP-2 could also interact with fatty acyl-CoAs. We show herein for the first time that SCP-2 is a high affinity fatty acyl-CoA-binding protein with Kd values near 2-4 nM. The chain length and unsaturation specificity of fatty acyl-CoAs was also examined. Furthermore, we report the effect of fatty acyl-CoAs and fatty acids on the rotational dynamics and structure of SCP-2 as ascertained by phase-resolved fluorescence. cis-Parinaric and trans-parinaric acids were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). cis-Parinaroyl- and trans-parinaroyl-CoAs were synthesized (15Hubbell T. Behnke W.D. Woodford J.K. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oleic acid, hexadecanoic acids, CoASH, acyl-coenzyme A synthase, ATP, 1,4-bis[4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl]benzene (dimethyl-POPOP), and p-terphenyl- as well as acetyl-, n-butyryl-, n-hexanoyl-, n-octanoyl-, n-decanoyl-, lauroyl-, myristoyl-, palmitoyl-, stearoyl-, arachidoyl-, myristoleoyl-, linoleoyl-, linolenoyl-, 11,14,17-eicosatrienoyl-, and arachidonoyl-CoAs were from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. Recombinant human SCP-2 was isolated as shown earlier (16Matsuura J.E. George H.J. Ramachandran N. Alvarez J.G. Strauss III, J.F. Billheimer J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the Bradford assay (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were measured at 24°C using a UV/VIS Lambda 2 Double-Beam spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Corrected (unless otherwise noted) steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured on a PC1 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter (ISS Instruments, Champaign, IL) using 1-cm quartz cuvettes. Sample temperature was kept at 25°C (±0.1°C) in a thermostatted cell holder. Excitation and emission bandwidths were 4 and 8 nm. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed on a GREG 250 subnanosecond multifrequency cross-correlation and modulation fluorometer equipped with KOALA automatic sample compartment (ISS Instruments) with a Glan-Taylor polarizer in the excitation channel. Excitation was with an Innova-Sabre argon ion laser (Coherent Laser Group, Palo Alto, CA) with automatic wavelength selection of single selectable lines at λ = 275.4, 300.2, 302.4, and 305.5 nm (power output of 340, 630, 800, and 460 milliwatts, respectively). Laser output was kept stable over several hours in either “Power Track” or the “Light Regulation” mode. In order to avoid scattered emission and Raman scatter artifacts, protein fluorescence emission was observed with a 0.3-cm quartz cuvette (Expotech Inc., Houston, TX) through a model 341 BP15 interference filter (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) with a transmittance maximum at 341 nm (bandwidth of 15 nm). Excitation intensity was optimized to minimize protein photobleaching (typically ≤10%) while maximizing high signal:noise ratio. cis-Parinaric acid and cis-parinaroyl-CoA were excited at λ = 325 nm by a 4240NB He-Cd laser (Liconix, Sunnyvale, CA), and emission was observed through KV389 low fluorescent cut-off filters (Schott Glass Technologies Inc., Duryea, PA). Sample absorbance at the excitation wavelengths was ≤0.05. All data were obtained in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 25°C. Fluorescence decay kinetics were measured with the excitation polarizer oriented at 35° to yield rotation-free results (18Spencer R.D. Weber G. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 1654-1663Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Lifetime data were acquired at 12-15 modulation frequencies (20-225 MHz) using external lifetime standards for protein (p-terphenyl, τ = 1.05 ns) and cis-parinaric acid (dimethyl-POPOP, τ = 1.45 ns) in absolute ethanol. Data were acquired until the limit of standard error (phase, 0.2°; modulation, 0.004) and analyzed by ISS-187 software (ISS Instruments) as a sum of exponentials: I(t) = Σαifiexp(−t/τi), where I is fluorescence, τi is lifetime, and Σαi = 1. Fractional intensity, fi, was fi = αiτi/Σαiτi. Mean lifetime was Σfiτi. The minimized χ2 parameter was the criterion for goodness of fit to the model, with χ2 < 3 acceptable (19Parasassi T. Conti F. Gratton E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5660-5664Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Time-resolved anisotropy data were obtained at 12-15 modulation frequencies for both I∥ and I⊥ components over the range of 20-225 MHz with Glan-Taylor and Glan-Thompson polarizers in the excitation and emission channels, respectively. Standard error limits were 0.2, 0.004, and 0.01° for phase, modulation, and polarization. Anisotropy decay was modeled by a sum of exponentials as: r(t) = r(0)Σgiexp(−t/θi), where r(0) is anisotropy of a fluorophore in the absence of rotational diffusion, θi is the rotational correlation time, and gi is fractional anisotropy. The goodness of fit to the applied model was determined as described above using ISS-187 software (ISS Instruments). The equivalent hydrodynamic radius of the protein was calculated as follows,R=(3kTθ/4πη)1/3(Eq. 1) where η is solvent viscosity. The value of the same parameter can be estimated from the hydrated protein volume,R=(3/4π)(M/N0)(V2+δ1V1)1/3(Eq. 2) where M is molecular weight, N0 is Avogadro's number, δ1 is fraction of hydration, V1 is volume of bound water, and V2 is protein specific partial volume. δ1 = 0.4 g of H2O/g of protein; V2 = 0.72 cm−3g−1 for an average protein (20Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, CA1980Google Scholar); and V1 = 1 cm3g−1 for water in Equation 3. Spectra of SCP-2 (2-4 μM, 25 mM phosphate buffer) were recorded (1-mm circular cuvette, 1-nm resolution) on a J-710 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Inc., Easton, MD) (bandwidth 2 nm, sensitivity 10 millidegrees, scan rate 50 nm/min, time constant 1 s) at 23°C. Ten scans were averaged for structure analysis (SELCON) (21Sreerama N. Woody R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) with software from JASCO Inc. All Kd values and stoichiometries of SCP-2 binding parinarates or parinaroyl-CoAs were determined (22Nemecz G. Hubbell T. Jefferson J.R. Lowe J.B. Schroeder F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) at 24°C with 2-ml samples of 0.18 μM SCP-2 (25 mM phosphate buffer) titrated with small increments of fatty acids (1-2 μl) dissolved in 10 mM NaOH. We replaced ethanol with NaOH to avoid interference with ligand binding to SCP-2 (14Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were added from a 150 μM stock solution in 10 mM NaOH. Alternately, fatty acyl-CoAs were added from a 270 μM stock solution in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Each sample and blank (without SCP-2) were thoroughly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 1-2 min to allow for stable measurement of the fluorescence signal. Kd and binding stoichiometry (n) were calculated as follows (22Nemecz G. Hubbell T. Jefferson J.R. Lowe J.B. Schroeder F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Gutfreund H. Gutfreund H. Enzymes: Physical Principles. Wiley Interscience Inc., New York1972: 68-94Google Scholar),1/(1−F/Fmax)=C1/(F/Fmax)×(1/Kd)−(nE0)/Kd(Eq. 3) where F and Fmax are corrected measured and maximal fluorescence intensity of the ligand, respectively, CL is the total ligand concentration, and E0 is the protein concentration. A plot of 1/(1 − F/Fmax) versus CL/(F/Fmax) yields a linear function with a slope of (1/Kd) and an ordinate intercept of (nE0)/Kd. SCP-2 (0.18 μM) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated with cis-parinaric acid (0.44 μM) for 5 min at 24°C to obtain maximal fluorescence. SCP-2-bound cis-parinaric acid was displaced by a series of fatty acyl-CoAs with fatty acyl chain length ranging from 0 to 20. Measurements were corrected for the blank (ligand or protein only) and photobleaching (see above). The relative affinity of SCP-2 for kinked chain fatty acyl-CoA versus straight chain fatty acyl-CoA was examined with fluorescent parinaroyl-CoA derivatives. The parinaric acids are naturally occurring fatty acids oriented to form either an 18-carbon, kinked chain, fluorescent analogue (cis-parinaric acid) of oleic acid or an 18-carbon, straight chain, fluorescent analogue (trans-parinaric acid) of stearic acid. Parinaroyl-CoAs fluoresce poorly in water, possibly due to strong electrostatic interactions of these fluorophores with the molecules of the solvent. Upon titration of SCP-2 with cis- or trans-parinaroyl-CoA, a progressive increase in fluorescence intensity with the maximum around 420 nm was observed (not shown), consistent with localization of this ligand in a less hydrophilic environment, i.e. binding to SCP-2. cis-Parinaroyl- or trans-parinaroyl-CoA intensities with SCP-2 measured at 420 nm, corrected for the background (no SCP-2), and plotted as a function of total ligand concentration yield pure saturation curves for both cis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoA as shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. The Fmax parameters were obtained by fitting the saturation curves to a rectangular hyperbola. Subsequent analysis of the data in 1/(1 − F/Fmax) and CL/(F/Fmax) coordinates yielded a strong linear dependence for each parinaroyl-CoA (r2∼0.9) (Fig. 1, A, inset, and B, inset). The Kd and n calculated thereby for cis-parinaroyl-CoA were 4.57 ± 0.75 nM and 0.85 ± 0.01, respectively (Fig. 1A, inset), and for trans-parinaroyl-CoA they were 2.76 ± 0.10 nM and 0.71 ± 0.03, respectively (Fig. 1B, inset). These data are consistent with the presence of one cis- or trans-parinaroyl-CoA binding site per SCP-2 molecule. Furthermore, the relative affinity of SCP-2 for the trans-parinaroyl-CoA was nearly 2-fold greater than for the cis-parinaroyl-CoA. Free fatty acid binding was examined to determine if SCP-2 fatty acyl-CoA structural specificities (straight versus kinked acyl chain) were based on the SCP-2 specificity for the fatty acyl chain structure. When SCP-2 was titrated with cis- or trans-parinaric acid, fluorescence intensity at the emission maximum (420 nm) increased without shifting the emission maximum. Binding curves were constructed as described above, and both cis- and trans-parinaric acid showed clear saturation curves (Fig. 2, A and B). The Kd and n for cis-parinaric acid were 0.18 ± 0.01 μM and 1.13 ± 0.04, respectively (Fig. 2A, inset), similar to those reported earlier (14Schroeder F. Myers-Payne S.C. Billheimer J.T. Wood W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11919-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Kd and n of SCP-2 for trans-parinaric acid were 0.56 ± 0.04 μM and 0.85 ± 0.02, respectively (Fig. 2B, inset). Thus, SCP-2 binds the cis-parinaric acid with a 3-fold higher affinity than trans-parinaric acid. Furthermore, SCP-2 bound cis- and trans-parinaric acids with 39- and 203-fold lower affinity than the corresponding cis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoAs. Two types of experiments were performed. First, the effect of fatty acyl-CoA carbon chain length on the ability to displace SCP-2-bound cis-parinaric acid was determined (Table I). Fatty acyl-CoAs with 10-18-carbon chain length were good displacers, while longer (e.g. C20) or shorter (e.g. C8, C6, C4, C2, or coenzyme A) fatty acyl-CoAs did not displace bound cis-parinaric acid. Second, the effect of unsaturation on ability to displace SCP-2-bound cis-parinaric acid was determined (Table I). All of the C14 to C20 unsaturated fatty acids tested displaced of bound cis-parinaric acid. The C14:1 myristoleoyl acyl-CoA displaced bound cis-parinaric acid (64.3 ± 1.9%) to the same extent as C14:0 myristoyl-CoA (64.9 ± 0.8%). The C18 unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs had 5-6-fold greater displacement efficiency than C18:0 stearoyl-CoA (Table I). Even more striking, the C20 unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs (arachidonoyl-CoA and 11,14,17-eicosatrienoyl-CoA) displaced bound cis-parinaric acid, while the saturated C20:0 arachidoyl-CoA did not displace SCP-2-bound cis-parinaric acid (Table I). Thus, SCP-2 displayed an ability to bind saturated fatty acyl-CoAs only over a narrow acyl chain length from 10 to 18 carbons. However, SCP-2 bound unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs over a wider chain length range.Table IDisplacement of cis-parinaric acid by saturated fatty acyl-CoAsDisplacing ligandChain lengthDouble bondsDisplacement%Arachidoyl-CoAC2000Stearoyl-CoAC18011.3 ± 2.0Palmitoyl-CoAC16061.0 ± 1.1Myristoyl-CoAC14064.9 ± 0.8Lauroyl-CoAC12054.1 ± 2.7n-Decanoyl-CoAC10018.3 ± 3.8n-Octanoyl-CoAC800n-Hexanoyl-CoAC600N-Butyryl-CoAC400Acetyl-CoAC200CoAC000Arachidonoyl-CoAC20465.0 ± 0.911,14,17-Eicosatrienoyl-CoAC20360.5 ± 0.6Linolenoyl-CoAC18362.4 ± 1.2Linoleoyl-CoAC18257.6 ± 5.3Myristoleoyl-CoAC14164.3 ± 1.9 Open table in a new tab SCP-2 has a single tryptophan (Trp50) residue and no tyrosine (24Yamamoto R.

The fluorescence emission spectrum of SCP-2 upon excitation at 280 nm showed a sole maximum at 332 nm with a bandwidth (full width at half-height) of 48 nm (data not shown). Both the position of the SCP-2 Trp50 emission peak (∼330 nm) and its bandwidth (∼50 nm) were consistent with the Trp50 being located in a hydrophobic locus in SCP-2 (26Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The addition of up to 5 molar equivalents of oleoyl-CoA to SCP-2 did not significantly alter either the fluorescence emission intensity of SCP-2 Trp50 excited at 280 nm or the shape of the emission spectrum. The same result was obtained when SCP-2 was titrated with oleic acid or CoASH (data not shown). It should also be noted that no detectable fluorescence quenching was observed when an equivalent amount of a free tryptophan in solution (as compared with SCP-2 concentration) was titrated with the same ligands over the concentration range that was used for the titration of SCP-2 (data not shown). The fluorescence Trp50 in apo-SCP-2 exhibited biexponential decay (data not shown). Biexponential decay is common for proteins with a single tryptophan residue (18Spencer R.D. Weber G. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 1654-1663Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 27Demchenko A.P. Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Proteins. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1986Crossref Google Scholar, 28Tan H. Okazaki K. Kubota I. Kamiryo T. Utiyama H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Upon excitation of SCP-2 at 275 nm (emission at 341 nm) the lifetimes of the major and minor components were 2.06 (fraction 0.55) and 0.69 ns (fraction ∼0.45). The apparent (mean) lifetime was calculated to be 1.51 ns. The addition of 5 molar equivalents of oleoyl-CoA to SCP-2 significantly increased the long lifetime component, τ1, from 2.06 to 2.29 ns (p < 0.05), without altering the short lifetime component at 0.70 ns or respective fractions. Overall, oleoyl-CoA did not significantly increase the mean lifetime of SCP-2 Trp (1.51 versus 1.58 ns). The two components comprising oleoyl-CoA, oleic acid and coenzyme A, were then tested. Oleic acid did not affect either lifetime of SCP-2 Trp50 but increased the longer lifetime fraction from 0.55 to 0.62 again without significantly increasing the mean lifetime of SCP-2 Trp, 0.55 versus 0.62 ns. Coenzyme A significantly increased the short lifetime component from 0.69 to 0.84 ns but significantly lowered its fraction, from 0.55 to 0.44 ns, thereby eliciting no overall significant effect on the mean lifetime of SCP-2 Trp50 (1.51 versus 1.59 ns). Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy provides information on the hierarchy of rotational motions in SCP-2 on a nanosecond and subnanosecond time scale. The anisotropy decay of Trp50 in apo-SCP-2 displays a single correlation time of 7.8 ns (Table II). The magnitude of this correlation time reflects the rotational diffusion of the entire protein globule (18Spencer R.D. Weber G. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 1654-1663Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Elofsson A. Rigler R. Nilsson L. Roslund J. Krause G. Golmgren A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9648-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The measured rotational correlation time, 7.8 ns, was consistent with that expected for the molecular mass, 13.2 kDa, of SCP-2 (20Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, CA1980Google Scholar). The SCP-2 hydrodynamic radius calculated from the data in Table II was 20.5 Å. The same parameter calculated on the basis of the theoretical Equation 2 was 18.8 Å. The small difference between the radius determined from anisotropy data (Equation 1) and from physicochemical characteristics of a globular, spherical protein (Equation 2) is consistent with SCP-2 not being shaped as an ideal sphere but instead having a slightly elongated structure. The addition of 5 molar equivalent of oleoyl-CoA significantly increased the SCP-2 overall rotational rate by 35% and increased the hydrodynamic radius from 20.5 to 22.4 Å (Table II). Under the same conditions oleic acid also increased both the SCP-2 Trp50 rotational correlation time from 7.8 to 13.3 ns, thereby increasing the hydrodynamic radius of SCP-2 by more than 20% from 20.5 to 24.5 Å. Coenzyme A was without effect on the rotational dynamics of SCP-2 (Table II). In general, the overall rotational dynamics of the SCP-2 protein were sensitive to the interaction with fatty acyl-CoA and fatty acid but not CoASH. The absence of a second, much faster, rotational component in the subnanosecond time frame suggests that Trp50 in apo-SCP-2 may not undergo rapid segmental rotational motions. This is not the case, however. The fact that the measured remaining anisotropy, r(0)g1 = 0.167, is much less than that of 0.315 for the tryptophan in a propylene glycol glassy matrix at −60°C (18Spencer R.D. Weber G. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 1654-1663Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar) indicates the possible existence of a much faster Trp50 rotation, i.e. on a pico- and/or femtosecond time scale, than measured herein. The SCP-2 Trp50 wobbling cone angle (amplitude of Trp torsional motions) was 34°. The addition of oleic acid increased the SCP-2 Trp50 remaining anisotropy from 0.167 to 0.215 and correspondingly decreased the wobbling cone angle from 34 to 27° (Table II). In contrast, oleoyl-CoA and CoASH were without effect on the segmental motion of SCP-2 Trp50 as indicated by the lack of change in the remaining anisotropy and wobbling cone angle (Table II).Table II.Anisotropy decays of SCP-2Ligandθ1Hydrodynamic radiusaHydrodynamic radius was calculated from θ1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”r(0)g1br(0) was allowed to vary.Wobbling cone anglecWobbling cone angle was calculated in degrees (deg) using cos2θ = ((r/ro) × 2 + 1)/3, where r is the remaining anisotropy,r = r(0)g1.ro is the tryptophan fundamental anisotropy,ro = 0.315 (18).nsÅdegNone7.8 ± 0.620.50.167 ± 0.00234Oleoyl CoA10.5 ± 0.04dp < 0.05 as compared with no ligand.22.40.163 ± 0.00134Oleic acid13.3 ± 0.4dp < 0.05 as compared with no ligand.24.50.215 ± 0.001dp < 0.05 as compared with no ligand.27CoASH8.61 ± 1.4521.10.165 ± 0.00234a Hydrodynamic radius was calculated from θ1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b r(0) was allowed to vary.c Wobbling cone angle was calculated in degrees (deg) using cos2θ = ((r/ro) × 2 + 1)/3, where r is the remaining anisotropy,r = r(0)g1.ro is the tryptophan fundamental anisotropy,ro = 0.315 (18Spencer R.D.

This mean lifetime of bound trans-parinaric acid was nearly 50% longer than that of bound trans-parinaroyl-CoA.

It shows sequence similarity to the catalytic β subunit of the F0F1-ATPase and is even more closely related to putative ATPases in Type III bacterial secretory pathways. A His-tagged version of FliI, which was fully functional in complementation tests, was purified to homogeneity. It had an ATPase activity of 0.16 s−1 at 25°C and pH 7, and a Km for ATP of 0.3 mM; Mg2+ was required. The activity was not affected by inhibitors of the F-, V- or P-type ATPases, or inhibitors of the Type I or Type II bacterial secretory pathways. Mutations K188I and Y363S decreased the ATPase activity about 100-fold, increased the Km about 10-fold, blocked flagellar assembly, and were dominant. Other FliI mutations that disrupted flagellar protein export were found near the N terminus; they permitted essentially wild-type ATPase activity, were not dominant, and showed a dosage-dependent phenotype. We propose that FliI has a C-terminal ATPase domain and an N-terminal domain that interacts with other components in the flagellum-specific export apparatus.

We propose that FliI has a C-terminal ATPase domain and an N-terminal domain that interacts with other components in the flagellum-specific export apparatus. The flagellum of Salmonella typhimurium and many other bacteria consists of a long helical filament, a short hook, and a basal body with a central rod and several rings (see 1Macnab R.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low Jr., K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Only two of the structural components are exported by the general secretory pathway, which involves processing of an N-terminal signal peptide (2Jones C.J. Homma M. Macnab R.M. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4200-4207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); these two proteins, FlgI and FlgH, are the subunits of the outer-membrane and periplasmic rings of the basal body. All of the other external proteins are exported by a flagellum-specific pathway. These proteins (the subunits of the rod, hook, hook cap, hook-filament junction, filament, and filament cap) are thought to travel through a hollow channel in the nascent structure (4Mimori Y.

The flagellar export apparatus is presumed to be at the base of the flagellum and involves at least three protein components, one of them being FliI (8Vogler A.P. Homma M. Irikura V.M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3564-3572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three classes of bacterial protein secretory pathways have been described (9Salmond G.P.C. Reeves P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 7-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The Type I pathway (10Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exemplified by the hemolysin secretion pathway of Escherichia coli, is signal peptide-independent; one of its components contains an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABCATP-binding cassetteNi-NTANi-nitrilotriacetic acidAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphateAMPSO3-[(1,1,-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acidCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acidDCCDdicyclohexylcarbodiimideIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosideMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. and is called an ABC transporter or traffic ATPase. The ATPase activities of two such transporters, HlyB from E. coli and PrtD from Erwinia, have been described (11Koronakis V. Hughes C. Koronakis E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27952-27957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Type II or general secretory pathway is signal sequence-dependent and proceeds in two stages: from cytoplasm to periplasm, and from periplasm to the external medium (13Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step employs SecA as the ATPase that catalyzes pre-protein insertion and translocation. The most extensively studied Type II secretion system is that of pullulanase in Klebsiella oxytoca. PulE and its homologs contain a consensus ATP-binding site and have been termed traffic ATPases (14Possot O. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

A third type of secretory pathway, Type III, has recently been identified in a variety of animal and plant pathogenic bacteria (1Macnab R.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low Jr., K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed.

Type III secretory systems have several components homologous to proteins implicated in flagellar protein export (1Macnab R.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low Jr., K.B.

Thus, although virulence protein secretion and flagellar protein export have different end results (host targeting versus organelle assembly), they are clearly related. The flagellar protein export system and the Type III secretion systems all contain a putative ATPase component, which in the case of the flagellar system is FliI. Surprisingly, FliI and its homologs show similarity to the catalytic β subunit of the proton-translocating F0F1-ATPase (8Vogler A.P. Homma M. Irikura V.M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3564-3572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dreyfus et al. (16Dreyfus G. Williams A.W. Kawagishi I. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3131-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated ATP binding by S. typhimurium FliI but failed to detect ATP hydrolysis. Since then, ATPase activity has been demonstrated for glutathione S-transferase fusions of the S. typhimurium Type III secretion component InvC (17Eichelberg K. Ginocchio C.C. Galán J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4501-4510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and FliI (18Williams A.W. The Roles of FliI, FliK, and FlhB Proteins in the Export and Assembly of the Bacterial Flagellum.

We have also examined the effects of selected mutations on ATPase activity and on flagellation and motility. S. typhimurium SJW1103 is wild-type for motility and chemotaxis (19Yamaguchi S. Fujita H.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pIK2101 contains an Eco47III fragment of S. typhimurium DNA that encodes the entire fliI gene (16Dreyfus G. Williams A.W. Kawagishi I. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3131-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was used to create NdeI and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of fliI, respectively, by amplifying fliI using primers NdeI-FliIa (complementary to the vector sequence and the 5′ end of fliI) and FliI-BamHIb (complementary to the vector sequence and the 3′ end of fliI). The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into vector pET-FLAG-19b, yielding plasmid pIFF200, encoding a His-tagged but otherwise wild-type FliI, or vector pET22b, yielding plasmid pIFF600, encoding an untagged wild-type FliI. Chromosomal DNA from fliI mutant strain MY644 was prepared following the protocol of Woo et al. (29Woo T.H.S. Cheng A.F. Ling J.M. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 696-698PubMed Google Scholar), and the mutant fliI allele was amplified using primers NdeI-FliIa and FliI-BamHIb. The fragment was then cloned into pET-FLAG-19b to give plasmid pIFF203. The FliI mutations C52T, L12P, and R7C/L12P were made by PCR-directed mutagenesis (30Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). To generate the two mutagenic fragments from plasmid pIFF200, the two primary PCR reactions used either a T7 promoter a-strand primer and the b-strand mutamer, or the a-strand mutamer and FliI-BamHIb. These two fragments were allowed to anneal and extend and the T7 promoter primer and FliI-BamHIb were used to amplify the extended fragment. The mutagenic site was cloned as a 0.5-kilobase pair NdeI-HpaI fragment to replace the corresponding wild-type sequence in plasmid pIFF200, yielding plasmids pIFF201 (FliI C52T) and pIFF204 (FliI L12P). In one clone we found a second mutation causing the amino acid change R7C; the resulting plasmid was pIFF205 (FliI R7C/L12P). The mutations FliI K188I, K188E and Y363S had been made previously (16Dreyfus G. Williams A.W. Kawagishi I. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3131-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K188I and K188E mutagenic sites were cloned as 0.8-kilobase pair MluI-PstI fragments, replacing the corresponding wild-type sequence in pIFF200, and yielding plasmids pIFF206 and pIFF207. Similarly, a 0.5-kilobase pair PvuI-PstI fragment in pIFF200 was replaced by the same fragment containing the Y363S mutagenic site, yielding plasmid pIFF209. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The NcoI-BamHI fragments containing the His-tagged wild-type or mutant fliI alleles from the pET-FLAG-19b-based plasmids were also cloned into pTrc99A under the control of the trc promoter (31Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). S. typhimurium was transformed by electroporation (E. coli Pulser, Bio-Rad). Plasmids were used to transform SJW2702 (fliI null) for complementation, or SJW1103 (wild-type) and MY644 (fliIts) for dominance analysis. Semisolid tryptone agar (0.35%) plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) were used to examine the motility of transformed cells at 30°C or 42°C. Extent of flagellation and motility were examined by high intensity dark-field light microscopy (32Macnab R.M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1976; 4: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with pET-FLAG-19b-based plasmids containing fliI alleles. Cells were grown overnight at 30°C in 10 ml of Luria medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, placed in 1 liter of the same medium, and grown at 25°C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. IPTG was added to 0.2 mM, and growth was continued for 10 h. The cells were harvested (10,000 × g, 15 min) and the pellets resuspended in 30 ml binding buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The cells were disrupted by passage three times through a French press (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 4000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged (17,000 × g, 40 min) to pellet unlysed cells and inclusion bodies. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 2.5 h and the pellet discarded. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a column containing 5-10 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose pre-equilibrated with binding buffer at a flow rate of 10-15 ml/h. The column was washed with 50 ml of binding buffer and then with 50 ml of binding buffer plus 25 mM imidazole. FliI was eluted with a gradient of 25-250 mM imidazole in binding buffer. Fractions containing FliI were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated to 5 ml (YM-30 membrane, Stirred Cell 8050, Amicon, Beverly, MA). After overnight dialysis (Spectra/Por 1 membrane) against 4 liters of 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, 0.25 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (with 1 change), FliI was further concentrated to about 0.5 ml (Centriprep-30 and Centricon-30 concentrators, Amicon). Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically by intrinsic absorbance at 280 nm or by the Bradford dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad). All stages of the purification were performed at 4°C. FPLC gel filtration chromatography employed a Superdex HR200 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and binding buffer. Two methods of assaying ATPase activity were used. The first was a malachite green assay (33Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar), with minor modifications from the protocol described by Eichelberg et al. (17Eichelberg K. Ginocchio C.C. Galán J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4501-4510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was also measured in an enzyme-coupled assay (34Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) that uses an ATP-regenerating system coupled to the oxidation of NADH. ATPase activity in situ was performed by electrophoresing 30 μg of purified FliI in each of two lanes of a 1% agarose native gel, with a running buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-Cl, 250 mM glycine, pH 8.8. The two lanes of the gel were then cut apart, and one was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The other lane was incubated for 30 min with the running buffer plus 5 mM ATP and 5 mM Mg2+, and the released Pi was then stained for 20 min with malachite green reagent. Far-UV CD spectra were collected on a Model 62DS spectrometer (AVIV, Lakewood, NJ). Purified FliI (∼10 mg/ml) in buffer was diluted with 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol to about 0.5 mg/ml. Spectra were collected at 1-nm intervals with an average of 5 s/point; each spectrum was the average of three scans. To estimate the secondary structural content, spectra were analyzed by convex constraint analysis and the LINCOMB program (35Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation was performed by heating the sample while monitoring the ellipticity at 220 nm (1°C step size, 2-min equilibration time, 30-s acquisition time). Complete spectra were taken at the beginning (4°C) and ending (98°C) temperatures. pIFF200 (encoding His-tagged wild-type FliI) or pIFF600 (encoding untagged wild-type FliI) was used to transform SJW2702, a nonflagellate fliI null mutant. Both transformants swarmed equally well (Fig. 1) and were comparable to untransformed wild-type strain SJW1103, establishing that the His-tagged FliI protein was fully functional. His-tagged FliI was overproduced under the control of the T7 promoter using pIFF200 and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Following induction by IPTG, the amount of His-tagged FliI increased greatly, comprising more than half of the total cellular protein (Fig. 2, cf. lanes 1 and 2). Most of it formed inclusion bodies, which could be removed by medium speed centrifugation (lane 3). Following high speed centrifugation of the supernatant to remove membrane fragments, about 5% remained in the soluble fraction (lane 4), which could then be purified to homogeneity on a nickel column (lane 6) and concentrated, yielding up to 10 mg from 1 liter of culture. Immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody or anti-FliI antibody (16Dreyfus G. Williams A.W. Kawagishi I. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3131-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed the identity of the protein. The concentrated protein was soluble to at least 30 mg/ml in buffer and was routinely stored at 4°C at >10 mg/ml. FPLC gel filtration chromatography revealed a peak at 53 kDa, corresponding to monomeric FliI; no well defined oligomeric forms of FliI were detected. In the absence of reducing agents, FliI formed dimers. Site-directed mutagenesis of the sole cysteine residue, Cys-52, abolished dimer formation but left FliI function intact (Fig. 1). We conclude that the dimerization has no physiological significance, and also that Cys-52 is solvent-exposed but is not essential for FliI function. The far-UV CD spectrum of His-tagged FliI is shown in Fig. 3a. The high negative molar ellipticity around 220 nm and 208 nm indicates that at 4°C FliI contains considerable amounts of secondary structure (∼22 mol %α helix and, less reliably, 34 mol %β structure). This is in agreement with predictions of secondary structure based on the sequence and with the known structure of the catalytic β subunit of the F1-ATPase (36Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature (London). 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). The melting curve of FliI showed a cooperative transition of a putative subdomain, with a Tm value of 51°C (Fig. 3b), but a stable core structure remained even at 98°C (Fig. 3a). Purified His-tagged FliI was shown to have ATPase activity by two independent assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since the results obtained by the two assays were essentially the same, we routinely employed the malachite green assay because of its simplicity. The FliI protein was essentially pure, as judged by Coomassie staining. To exclude the possibility that there might be small amounts of highly reactive ATPase contaminants, we assayed the activity of purified FliI in situ in native gels. The only major band identified by the ATPase assay co-migrated with the only major band identified by Coomassie staining (Fig. 4). Mutant versions of FliI involving a loss of positive charge (FliI R7C/L12P and FliI K188I) ran slightly faster than wild-type FliI, confirming the presence of the mutation. ATP was the best substrate for the reaction (Fig. 5a). GTP and ITP produced much lower reaction rates, and CTP essentially did not serve as a substrate at all. The reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Vmax at 25°C of 0.2 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein (corresponding to a kcat of 0.16 s−1) and a Km for ATP of about 0.3 mM (Fig. 5b). ATP hydrolysis required a divalent cation (Fig. 5c). When Mg2+ was varied from 0.06 to 10 mM, the data fit well to the Michaelis-Menten equation and yielded a Km for Mg2+ of about 1.1 mM. Mn2+ could substitute, but reaction rates were reduced by about 70%. Zn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ functioned almost as well as Mg2+ at lower concentrations but were inhibitory above 2.5 mM. No ATP hydrolysis was detected when Ca2+ was used. Maximal activity of FliI was observed around pH 8 (Fig. 5d), where it was about 2-fold higher than at the standard assay pH of 7. Activity decreased abruptly at acidic pH and above pH 9.5. At acidic pH, denaturation and aggregation occurred, but protonation or deprotonation of critical residues may also have affected activity. ADP was a competitive inhibitor, with a Ki of 0.26 mM (Fig. 5e). We tested inhibitors of the P-, V-, and F-type ion-translocating ATPases, of the SecA component of the general secretory pathway, and of the ATPase component of the Type I secretory pathway (Table II); none of these compounds had an inhibitory effect on FliI.Table II.Effect of ATPase inhibitors on FliI ATPase activityCompoundFliI ATPase activitySpecific foraP, phosphorylation type ATPase (formerly known as E1E2 type); V, vacuolar type ATPase; F, F0F1 type ATPase; A, SecA componentof the general (Type II) secretory pathway of bacteria; I, ATPase of the Type I bacterial secretory pathway.Reference%None100Vanadate (0.4 mM)130P, I11Koronakis V.

Open table in a new tab MY644 is a temperature-sensitive fliI mutant (8Vogler A.P. Homma M. Irikura V.M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3564-3572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jones C.J. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1327-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature of 30°C, MY644 cells swarmed, although not as well as wild-type cells (Fig. 6a). In liquid medium, they were significantly less motile than wild-type cells; few cells had more than one flagellar filament long enough to be visible by high intensity dark-field microscopy (32Macnab R.M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1976; 4: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar), and even these failed to form a flagellar bundle. At the restrictive temperature of 42°C, MY644 cells had almost no swarming ability (Fig. 6b), whereas wild-type cells swarmed even better than at 30°C, presumably because of a combination of higher torque generation, faster growth, and softer agar. The fliI allele in MY644 was found to cause the mutation L12P near the N terminus. When SJW2702 (fliI null) was transformed with the pET-based plasmid pIFF203 bearing the mutant allele from MY644, swarming was similar to that of MY644 and showed the same temperature-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 6). We also made the mutation L12P in the wild-type fliI allele; SJW2702 transformed with the resulting plasmid (pIFF204) behaved identically to cells transformed with pIFF203, establishing that the L12P mutation alone was responsible. Placing the L12P allele in the pTrc99A vector to give plasmid pIFF703 improved swarming at both temperatures (Fig. 6), indicating a dosage effect (see below). In liquid medium, cells transformed with pIFF703 and grown at the permissive temperature were seen to be well flagellated (5-8 flagella/cell) and highly motile. A double mutation at the N terminus, R7C/L12P, had a more severe effect on motility than did the L12P mutation alone (Fig. 1). Flagellation, motility, and swarming were improved when the allele was expressed from the pTrc99A-based plasmid pIFF705. The temperature sensitivity associated with the L12P mutation persisted in the double mutant. His-tagged versions of these mutant proteins were purified. FliI L12P"
https://openalex.org/W2021927710,"HC11 mammary epithelial cells have been used to characterize molecular events involved in the regulation of milk protein gene expression. Treatment of HC11 cells with the lactogenic hormones prolactin, insulin, and glucocorticoids results in transcription of the β-casein gene. Prolactin induces a signaling event which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the mammary gland factor, Stat5, a member of the family of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat). Here we show that HC11 cells express two Stat5 proteins, Stat5a and Stat5b. Phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analysis of Stat5a and Stat5b immunoprecipitated from phosphate-labeled HC11 cells revealed that both proteins were constitutively phosphorylated on serine. Lactogenic hormone treatment resulted in the appearance of a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide in both Stat5 proteins. Consistent with this observation, a Western blot analysis of Stat5a and Stat5b showed that lactogenic hormones induced a rapid, transient increase in phosphotyrosine which paralleled the binding of Stat5 to its cognate recognition sequence in the β-casein gene promoter. Lactogenic hormone treatment of the HC11 cells also led to a rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. We examined the role of this pathway in β-casein transcription using a specific MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059. Concentrations of PD98059 which completely abrogated lactogen-induced MAP kinase activation did not affect the phosphorylation state of Stat5, its DNA binding activity, or transcriptional activation of a β-casein reporter construct. This indicates that the MAP kinase pathway does not contribute to lactogenic hormone induction of the β-casein gene.

INTRODUCTIONMammary gland differentiation requires the coordinated action of growth factors and hormones that promote morphological development and milk protein production in the lactating gland (1Topper Y. Freeman C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In order to understand the molecular events contributing to mammary cell differentiation, in vitro cell culture systems have proven invaluable. The HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell line, a clonal derivative of the COMMA-D line (2Danielson K.G. Oborn C.J. Durban E.M. Butel J.S. Medina D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) is a useful model system for studying mammary cell differentiation. Treatment of HC11 cells with the lactogenic hormones glucocorticoids, insulin, and prolactin leads to rapid stimulation of β-casein gene transcription (3Ball R.K. Friis R.R. Schoenenberger C.A. Doppler W. Groner B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The β-casein promoter binds numerous transcription factors (4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R. Groner B.

Stat family members are activated in response to cytokines whose receptors are associated with tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase family. Following ligand binding and receptor aggregation, Stats are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the receptor-associated Janus kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation mediates the specific binding of Stats to IFN-γ activated (GAS)-like sites, leading to activation of target genes (reviewed in 12Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

It has been suggested that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is responsible for the cytokine induced serine phosphorylation of Stat1α (20Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 21David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar).In order to investigate the mechanism of Stat5 activation in mammary epithelial cells, we have examined the phosphorylation status of Stat5a and Stat5b in resting and in lactogen-treated HC11 cells. Both Stat5 proteins were constitutively phosphorylated on serine. Treatment of HC11 cells with lactogenic hormones led to a rapid increase in their phosphotyrosine content. Lactogenic hormone treatment of the HC11 cells also led to a rapid activation of the MAP kinase pathway. We examined the role of this pathway in β-casein transcription using a specific MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059 (22Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of HC11 cells with PD98059 led to a repression of lactogenic hormone-induced MAP kinase activity but had no effect on the phosphorylation status of Stat5, on its DNA binding activity, or on lactogenic hormone-induced transcriptional activation of the β-casein promoter luciferase construct. These data demonstrate that MAP kinase activation is not involved in the transcriptional induction of the β-casein gene mediated by the lactogenic hormones.DISCUSSIONStat5 is activated by numerous cytokines and growth factors in diverse cell types (36Gouilleux F.

Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the role of the MAP kinase pathway in lactogen-induced β-casein promoter function and Stat5 phosphorylation. We also present here the first phosphopeptide analysis of Stat5 proteins in lactogenic hormonetreated mammary epithelial cells. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) in competent HC11 cells before lactogen treatment, Stat5a and Stat5b are constitutively phosphorylated on serine; 2) in response to lactogenic hormones, Stat5a and Stat5b yield one phosphotyrosine-containing tryptic peptide; 3) ERK2 MAP kinase is activated in response to lactogenic hormones, but its inhibition with PD 98059 has no effect upon Stat5 phosphorylation, DNA binding, or lactogenic hormonestimulated β-casein transcription.The intracellular signaling molecules activated by prolactin have been examined most extensively in mammary cells and in Nb2 lymphoma cells, which are dependent upon prolactin for growth (39Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of Nb2 cells with prolactin leads to an elevation in Ras-GTP levels and Raf-1 kinase activation (40Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. Rui H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3512-3518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Clevenger C.V. Torigoe T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5559-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also a rapid appearance of ERK1 in the nucleus of these cells (42Rao Y.-P. Buckley D.J. Buckley A.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1235-1244PubMed Google Scholar). In Nb2 cells inhibition of the MAP kinase signaling pathway with broad range kinase inhibitors leads to an inhibition of cell growth (43Buckley A.R. Buckley D.J. Gout P.W. Liang H. Rao Y.-P. Blake M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 98: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 44Cary G.B. Liberti J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mitogenic effect of prolactin depends on MAP kinase activity. Here we show that prolactin, which is a mitogen as well as a lactogen for mammary cells (1Topper Y. Freeman C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), activates the MAP kinase pathway. However, the lactogenic effect of prolactin, i.e. its ability to induce β-casein transcription, does not require MAP kinase activity. Interestingly, we observed that basal as well as lactogen-induced β-casein promoter activity was elevated in PD98059-treated cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that MAP kinase activity might have a negative effect upon β-casein gene transcription. We have previously reported that HC11 cells transformed by the Ha-ras and the v-raf oncogenes, potent activators of the MAP kinase pathway, no longer synthesize β-casein in response to lactogenic hormones (45Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Harwerth I.-M. Ciardiello F. Salomon D.S. Yamamoto T. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4027-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Happ B. Hynes N.E. Groner B. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, prolactin-induced Stat5 DNA binding activity was also impaired in the Ha-ras and v-raf transformed HC11 cells (46Happ B. Hynes N.E. Groner B. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the negative modulation of β-casein transcription by the MAP kinase pathway.While it is clear that phosphorylation on one specific tyrosine residue is necessary for Stat DNA binding, whether or not this tyrosine phosphorylation is sufficient to promote transcriptional activation is not yet clear. Due to the diversity of signals which lead to Stat activation as well as the numerous genes whose transcription is stimulated in response to Stat activation, it is unlikely that there will be a simple answer. Experiments examining the IFN-γ-responsive Stat1α were the first to explore the role of multiple signaling pathways and transcriptional activation of Stat target genes. The COOH terminus of Stat1α, as well as Stat3 and Stat4, has a consensus recognition motif for phosphorylation by MAP kinase -PXS/TP- which, for Stat1α and Stat3, is phosphorylated in response to IFN treatment (20Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). A mutant Stat1α in which the serine in the consensus MAP kinase site was changed to alanine binds DNA as well as wild type Stat1α. However, transcriptional activation of an IFN-γ-responsive gene was reduced in cells expressing the mutant Stat1α (20Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). These results show that serine phosphorylation is important for full transcriptional activation of Stat1α. Indirect evidence suggests that MAP kinase might be responsible for this phosphorylation, since it has been shown that ERK2 associates with the α chain of the IFN-α/β receptor and that ERK2 and Stat1 are coimmunoprecipitated after IFN-β treatment (21David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar).Stat3 is phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine following treatment of cells with both INF-α and interleukin-6 (17Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 18Zhang X. Belnis J. Li H-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The interleukin-6-induced serine phosphorylation, which is sensitive to the broad spectrum serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7, has been reported to influence the formation of stable Stat3 homodimers on some GAS-like sites (18Zhang X. Belnis J. Li H-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The H7-sensitive kinase responsible for the phosphorylation is apparently not on the MAP kinase pathway (47Lütticken C. Coffer P. Yuan J. Schwarts C. Caldenhoven E. Schindler C. Kruijer W. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and may be protein kinase C (48Yang C.-H. Shi W. Basu L. Murti A. Constantinescu S.N. Blatt L. Croze E. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8057-8061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). IFN-α-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 occurs on the serine residue in the consensus MAP kinase site. Mutation of this serine had no effect on the DNA binding activity; however, there was a 2-fold reduction in IFN-α induced transcription (20Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy in the results concerning the DNA binding of Stat3 is not clear but could reflect, e.g., a difference in the serine residue that is phosphorylated in response to IFN-γ and interleukin-6.Stat5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine in interleukin-2-stimulated T cells (35Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and in liver cells from growth hormone-treated rats (49Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In T cells, serine phosphorylation leads to an H7-sensitive reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of Stat5. The DNA binding of Stat5 was not affected in H7 treated cells, although its ability to function as a transcriptional activator was decreased. The H7-sensitive kinase, although not yet identified, is evidently neither MAP kinase nor S6 kinase (35Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Using a more specific inhibitor, the data presented here corroborate those findings. However, β-casein transcription is not reduced in H7-treated HC11 cells2 (50Tourkine N. Schindler C. Larose M. Houdebine L.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20952-20961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The difference in transcriptional sensitivity of the target promoters to H7 treatment could reflect the different cytokines used to activate Stat5, differences in the site of serine phosphorylation as well as the promoter examined.Here we demonstrate that Stat5a and Stat5b are phosphorylated on serine in competent, serum-starved HC11 cells and that this phosphorylation is not influenced by lactogenic hormones. The kinase responsible for this serine phosphorylation is currently unknown. It is unlikely to be MAP kinase for two reasons: serum-starved HC11 cells have very low basal MAP kinase activity (24Marte B.M. Graus-Porta D. Jeschke M. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar, 32Merlo G.R. Graus-Porta D. Cella N. Marte B.M. Taverna D. Hynes N.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar) (this report), and treatment of the cells with PD98059 further reduces basal activity (Fig. 1B). We have previously reported that treatment of the HC11 cells with lactogenic hormones, in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor CGP41256, negatively affected Stat5 DNA binding and transcriptional activation of the β-casein gene promoter (27Marte B.M. Meyer T. Stabel S. Standke G.J.R. Jaken S. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro treatment of nuclear extracts from lactating mammary glands with protein kinase C (51Marti A. Jehn B. Costello E. Keon N. Ke G. Martin F. Jaggi R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1213-1223PubMed Google Scholar) or casein kinase II (9Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Ball R.K. Groner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) resulted in enhanced Stat5 DNA binding making it possible that both protein kinase C and casein kinase II directly phosphorylate Stat5. Interestingly, growth hormone-induced serine phosphorylation also modulates the DNA binding of Stat5 (49Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These results suggest that serine phosphorylation of Stat5, which in our experiments is present before lactogenic treatment, could, together with tyrosine phosphorylation, promote optimal DNA binding activity of Stat5.The induction of milk protein gene expression in the mammary gland requires multiple signals including peptide and steroid hormones as well as those emanating from the extracellular matrix (52Streuli C.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 203-212Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 53Roskelley C.D. Srebrow A. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In primary cultures of mammary gland cells, prolactin-dependent Stat5 DNA binding and transcriptional activation of milk protein genes is only observed in cells plated on a laminin-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) (54Streuli C.H. Edwards G.M. Delcommenne M. Whitelaw C.B.A. Burdon T.G. Schindler C. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21639-21644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This implies that there is a hierarchy of signaling in mammary cells and that the cell contact with the ECM disposes them to respond to lactogenic hormones. The HC11 cells appear to have retained this characteristic of primary mammary cells. Growing cultures of HC11 cells deposit an ECM which influences their ability to produce β-casein in response to lactogenic hormones (55Chammas R. Taverna D. Cella N. Santos C. Hynes N.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1031-1040PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the fact that growing cultures of HC11 cells contain Stat5,4 its binding activity cannot be stimulated by lactogenic hormones 4N. Cella and I. Beuvink, unpublished results. (7Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102PubMed Google Scholar). This may in part be due to the lack of an appropriate matrix and may reflect the results seen with the primary mammary cells. We find it noteworthy that in the competent cultures, that is, HC11 cells that have deposited the appropriate ECM and are primed to respond to lactogenic hormones, the Stat5 proteins are phosphorylated on serine. It will be interesting to see if ECM influences the serine phosphorylation status of Stat5 in the HC11 cells. INTRODUCTIONMammary gland differentiation requires the coordinated action of growth factors and hormones that promote morphological development and milk protein production in the lactating gland (1Topper Y. Freeman C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In order to understand the molecular events contributing to mammary cell differentiation, in vitro cell culture systems have proven invaluable. The HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell line, a clonal derivative of the COMMA-D line (2Danielson K.G. Oborn C.J. Durban E.M. Butel J.S. Medina D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) is a useful model system for studying mammary cell differentiation. Treatment of HC11 cells with the lactogenic hormones glucocorticoids, insulin, and prolactin leads to rapid stimulation of β-casein gene transcription (3Ball R.K. Friis R.R. Schoenenberger C.A. Doppler W. Groner B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The β-casein promoter binds numerous transcription factors (4Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Altiok S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7303-7310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1223-1232PubMed Google Scholar). One of these factors, which is indispensable for hormonal induction of β-casein transcription, binds to a conserved sequence present in the promoter of casein genes from different species (9Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Ball R.K. Groner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This factor is the mammary gland factor or Stat5, 1The abbreviations used are: Statsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionGASinterferon-γ activated siteMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAP kinase kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseECMextracellular matrixIFNinterferon. a member of the Stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) family (10Wakao H.

Develop. 1995; 5: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Stat family members are activated in response to cytokines whose receptors are associated with tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase family. Following ligand binding and receptor aggregation, Stats are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the receptor-associated Janus kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation mediates the specific binding of Stats to IFN-γ activated (GAS)-like sites, leading to activation of target genes (reviewed in 12Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar).Binding of prolactin to its receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, leads to Janus kinase-2-mediated phosphorylation of Stat5 on tyrosine (14Rui H.

In COS cells transfected with mammary gland factor-Stat5 mutants, it has been shown that phosphorylation of Tyr-694 is essential for its DNA binding and transcriptional activation (16Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine, Stats are also phosphorylated on serine (17Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M.

https://openalex.org/W2001679980,"The mitochondrial KATP channel (mitoKATP) is highly sensitive to ATP, which inhibits K+ flux with K1/2 values of 20-40 μM. This raises the question, how can mitoKATP be opened in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP? We measured K+ flux in liposomes reconstituted with purified mitoKATP and found that guanine nucleotides are potent activators of this channel. ATP-inhibited K+ flux was completely reactivated by both GTP (K1/2 = 7 μM) and GDP (K1/2 = 140 μM). These ligands had no effect in the absence of ATP. The K1/2 for ATP inhibition exhibited quadratic dependence on [GTP] and [GDP], consistent with two binding sites for guanine nucleotides. We also found that palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA inhibited K+ flux through reconstituted mitoKATP with K1/2 values of 260 nM and 80 nM, respectively. This inhibition was reversed by GTP (K1/2 = 232 μM) as well as by the K+ channel openers cromakalim (20 μM) and diazoxide (10 μM). Inhibition of mitoKATP by long-chain acyl-CoA esters, like that of ATP, exhibited an absolute requirement for Mg2+ ions.

We have recently shown that ATP inhibition of K+ flux through mitoKATP is reversed by submicromolar levels of K+ channel openers (5Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J.

K+ flux through the MgATP-inhibited channel is restored to full activity by GTP and GDP, neither of which has any effect in the absence of MgATP. GTP and GDP are competitive with ATP, and their reversal of ATP inhibition exhibits hyperlinear kinetics consistent with two guanine nucleotide binding sites. We also report that palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA inhibit mitoKATP with high potency, and this inhibition is also reversed by GTP and by the potassium channel openers, cromakalim and diazoxide. Inhibition by long-chain acyl-CoA esters, like inhibition by ATP, exhibits an absolute requirement for Mg2+ ions and is immediately reversed upon chelation of Mg2+. From these findings, we infer that GTP and long-chain acyl-CoA esters may be the physiological regulators of mitoKATP and that this channel may play a role in vivo in regulating fatty acid oxidation.

This mutant LHR produces a 4.5-fold increase in basal cAMP when expressed in COS-7 cells. To better understand the normal role of Asp<sup>578</sup> in the LHR we studied the effect of seven other amino acid substitutions at this position. No agonist binding or response was detected with the Asp<sup>578</sup>→Pro mutant. Agonist binding affinity was unaffected by the other substitutions and estimated receptor concentrations ranged from 11 to 184% of wild type. Substitution of Asp<sup>578</sup> with Asn, a similarly sized, uncharged residue, did not produce agonist-independent activation. In contrast, replacement with Glu, Ser, or Leu caused 4.9-5.6-fold stimulation of basal cAMP. Substitution with Tyr (8.5-fold) or Phe (7.5-fold) had a greater activating effect. Only the Tyr, Phe, and Leu mutants showed constitutive activation of the inositol phosphate pathway. Our data suggest that it is the ability of the Asp<sup>578</sup> side chain to serve as a properly positioned hydrogen bond acceptor, rather than its negative charge, that is important for stabilizing the inactive state of the LHR.

https://openalex.org/W2090457292,"It is unclear how receptor/ligand families that are evolutionarily closely related achieve functional separation. To address this question, we focus here on the newly discovered Orphanin FQ, a peptide homologous to the opioid peptide Dynorphin, and its receptor, the Orphanin FQ receptor, which is highly homologous to the opioid receptors. In spite of this high degree of homology in terms of both ligands and receptors, there is little direct cross-talk between the Orphanin FQ system and the endogenous opioid system. Thus, the opioid peptides show either relatively low affinity or no affinity toward the Orphanin FQ receptor; conversely, Orphanin FQ has no affinity toward any of the opioid receptors. We sought to investigate the molecular basis of such discrimination by attempting to reverse it and endowing the Orphanin FQ receptor with the ability to bind opioids. We report that by mutating as few as four amino acids, we can produce a receptor that recognizes pro-Dynorphin products with very high affinity and yet still binds Orphanin FQ as well as the wild-type receptor. This suggests that the Orphanin FQ receptor has developed features that specifically exclude the opioids and that these features are distinct from those required for the high affinity binding of its own endogenous ligand.

The three major types of opioid receptors, μ, δ, and κ, have been cloned and shown to belong to the seven transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled family (1Uhl G.R. Childers S. Pasternak G. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 89-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Reisine T. Bell G. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, several laboratories have cloned a protein highly homologous to these opioid receptors but that, nevertheless, does not bind with high affinity any known opioid peptides or alkaloids (3Meunier J.-C.

Interestingly, it is a 17-amino acid peptide with a significant degree of sequence homology to DynA-(1-17). This novel peptide has been termed Nociceptin by Meunier et al. (3Meunier J.-C. Mollerau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C. Moisand C. Alvinerie P. Butour J.-L. Guillemot J.-C. Ferrara P. Monsarrat B. Mazarguil H. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Costentin J.

We shall refer here to the ligand as Orphanin FQ and to its receptor as the Orphanin FQ receptor. It is clear from ongoing anatomical studies that Orphanin FQ and its receptor represent a novel and distinct peptidergic system with a unique anatomical distribution within the central nervous system 1A. Mansour, S. Burke, H.-P. Nothacker, O. Civelli, H. Akil, and S. J. Watson, manuscript in preparation. and the gastrointestinal system 2D. Bagnol, A. Mansour, H. Akil, and S. J. Watson, manuscript in preparation.. Behavioral results have already demonstrated a novel profile for Orphanin FQ in pain and place preference tests and in patterns of tolerance development (5Devine D.P. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Akil H. Brain Res. 1996; 727: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Devine D.P. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Akil H. Neurochem. Res. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Orphanin FQ has at its amino terminus the sequence Phe-Gly-Gly-Phe, which only differs from the common opioid core (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe) by a single OH group. Yet, since the N-terminal tyrosine is critical for the binding of all opioid peptides (7Schwyzer R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 297: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), this change is sufficient to preclude Orphanin FQ from binding to any of the opioid receptors. Conversely, reciprocal events must have taken place to preclude the opioid peptides from being recognized by the Orphanin FQ receptor. Thus, this system offers a most interesting example of how, through evolution, sets of receptors and their endogenous ligands can diverge to achieve a clear separation of function. In addition, the existence of the Orphanin system provides an excellent opportunity to address the issue of the structural requirements of an opioid receptor. Based on the examination of the similarities and differences between the three types of opioid receptors, we can suggest some elements common to all of them that may help define an opioid binding pocket and other elements that may be critical for the discrimination by ligands between receptors, i.e. the structural features of high affinity and of selectivity. To date, the body of evidence suggests that some specific residues near the interface of the extracellular loop and the α-helical transmembrane domains may play important roles in ligand binding through ionic or hydrogen bonding interactions (8Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 9Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A. Seidleck B.K. Blaschak C.J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1089-1094PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular loops, which are highly divergent, clearly play a role in ligand selectivity, especially for the peptides, allowing them to differentiate between the κ, μ, and δ receptors (11Wang J.B.

Pharmacol. 1996; 311: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, most of the mutagenesis studies aiming at defining a common opioid binding pocket rely on loss of binding as an indicator of a potential role of a given residue in ligand interaction. This is often difficult to discern from a loss of binding due to a nonspecific conformational distortion of the receptor, which points to the critical nature of the residue but does not necessarily implicate it in direct ligand interactions. A complementary approach would be to endow a receptor, previously incapable of opioid binding, with the ability to bind opioid ligands. We, therefore, undertook to use the Orphanin FQ receptor as our starting point and attempted to endow it with opioid binding properties. One question of interest was whether or not the same structural elements responsible for excluding the opioids from binding the Orphanin FQ receptor would also be critical for the high affinity binding of Orphanin FQ to its own receptor. The cDNA encoding the rat Orphanin FQ receptor was cloned in our lab (GenBank™ accession number U05239). Its coding region is identical to the clone that other groups reported. The preparation of monoiodinated Tyr14-Orphanin FQ was performed according to Reinscheid et al. (16Reinscheid R.K. Ardati A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14163-14168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A double-stranded plasmid mutagenesis protocol was used to make the Orphanin FQ receptor mutants (17Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 200: 81-88Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The locations of these mutations are also indicated in Fig. 1. A mammalian expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, courtesy of Dr. Michael Uhler (18Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Stofko R.E. Seasholtz A.F. Uhler M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was used to express the chimeric and wild-type receptors in COS-1 cells. Twenty-five μg of CsCl purified plasmid DNA were transfected into each 100-mm dish of COS-1 cells using the method of Chen and Okayama (19Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). Ligand binding assay of the membrane preparation of the transfected cells was performed according to Goldstein and Naidu (20Goldstein A. Naidu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature. We chose to use this binding condition instead of a buffer containing 5 mM Mg2+ (16Reinscheid R.K. Ardati A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14163-14168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) in order to make our data more comparable with the opioid receptor binding data in the literature since the presence of 5 mM Mg2+ would reduce the binding affinity of DynA-(1-17) by about 5-fold in our hands. To avoid peptide degradation, a mixture of protease inhibitors was added to the binding buffer. The final concentration of each component in the mixture is as follows: 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM iodoacetamide. Around 50,000 dpm of iodinated Tyr14-Orphanin FQ, which corresponds to a final concentration of approximately 50-80 pM, was added into each tube. In the competition studies, duplicates of nine different concentrations of ligand were used to compete with labeling iodinated Orphanin FQ peptide. Receptor binding results were analyzed with the LIGAND program (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). We first characterized the binding profile of the Orphanin FQ receptor, using 125I-labeled Tyr14-Orphanin FQ as the labeling ligand, and examining the binding (or lack of such) of various endogenous or exogenous opioids under a standard opioid receptor binding condition (20Goldstein A. Naidu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). The results in Table I show that, with one exception, none of the opioid ligands tested could displace the binding of 125I-Orphanin FQ with concentrations up to 1000 nM under the testing conditions used. The only deviation from this pattern is the binding of DynA and some of its fragments, which displaced 125I-Orphanin FQ binding in the range of 10-100 nM. While these affinities are substantial, they are approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than the affinities of Dynorphin A and its fragments to the κ receptor, as the latter are in the subnanomolar range under the same assay condition (20Goldstein A.

This was based on the argument that if a residue is critical for defining a common opioid core that is distinct from the Orphanin FQ binding site, it should be present in all opioid receptors and absent in the Orphanin FQ receptor.

Toxicol. 1992; 32: 167-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we focused on the residues that are near the top half of the proposed transmembrane domains. In our first round of study, seven mutations were individually introduced into the Orphanin FQ receptor (Fig. 1). Of these mutations, three (TM2 LL-TT; TM3 TVIA-IVIS; and TM4 SA-VT) did not bring about any significant changes in either Orphanin FQ binding or competition by a number of opioid peptides and alkaloids (data not shown). A fourth mutation that converted a leucine to a serine in transmembrane one (TM1 L-S) destroyed the binding of iodinated Orphanin FQ. However, there were three mutations that showed a substantial increase in the affinity of the new construct toward DynA and other opiate drugs that were screened (the non-selective alkaloid bremazocine, the κ-selective agonist ethylketocyclazocine, the partially μ-selective antagonist naltrexone, and the highly δ-selective antagonist naltrindole). 1) A Thr302 to Ile (T-I) mutation near the top of TM7 substantially increased the binding affinity of DynA-(1-13) and naltrindole. 2) A bank of three residues, VQV276-278 in TM6 of the Orphanin FQ receptor, when mutated to IHI, also increased the affinities of the screening ligands including DynA, 1The abbreviation used are: DynDynorphin by one order of magnitude. It should be noted that this region contains the histidine site in the opioids that was previously proposed to be critical to opioid binding (9Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A. Seidleck B.K. Blaschak C.J. Wang J.B. Uhl G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20548-20553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dynorphin 3) Most strikingly, an Ala213 to Lys (A-K) mutation brought the affinity of bremazocine, naltrexone, and naltrindole to 10−8 and DynA-(1-13) to 10−9 M ranges. This Ala213 is located near the predicted top of TM5, adjacent to extracellular loop 2 (EL2). Interestingly, the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 1, which is also closely related to the opioid receptor family but does not recognize opioid ligands, has an Ile residue instead of a Lys residue at this position, also showing a deviation from the three opioid receptors. The results from this first round of study suggested that we had identified some critical residues that are important in preventing opioids from binding the Orphanin FQ receptor and that may conceivably be important in forming the opioid pocket in the context of the opioid receptors. Interestingly, none of them interfered with the binding of Orphanin FQ itself, suggesting their role in selectivity but not high affinity binding of this peptide to its receptor. To test this idea further, we carried out the next round of study, extending the findings in two directions. 1) We combined the mutations at each of the three sites identified above, such that we created dual and triple mutants. 2) We tested a larger number of ligands, focusing primarily on the endogenous opioids, as we were most interested in the discrimination among the naturally occurring ligands. All studies were repeated 3 times. The results, displayed in Table II, demonstrate again that single mutations at these sites were able to yield receptors with excellent affinity for the Orphanin FQ. In addition, one of the double mutants shown (VQV-IHI + T-I) was also capable of recognizing Orphanin FQ with excellent affinity. By contrast, when the A-K mutation was combined with either of the others or with both, binding affinity of Orphanin FQ was lost (not shown). This appears to result from a change in binding affinity toward Orphanin FQ rather than from a more fundamental loss in protein expression, folding, or membrane insertion. This can be ascertained because the double or triple mutant receptors that included the A-K change acquired the ability of being labeled with the δ-opioid ligand, [3H]-naltrindole (not shown).Table II.Binding profile of Orphanin FQ receptor mutantsReceptoraThe receptors were labeled with 50 to 80 pmol125I-Tyr14-Orphanin FQ.

Open table in a new tab The mutants displayed in Table II demonstrate that the combination of the mutations at the T-I and VQV-IHI sites (i.e. a total change of four residues) yielded a receptor that now recognizes both Orphanin FQ and DynA-(1-17) with subnanomolar affinity. This construct also binds the highly κ-selective fragment of Dynorphin, DynA-(1-13), with subnanomolar affinity, whereas it has intermediate affinity toward DynA-(1-8), which has lesser selectivity across the κ and δ receptors (20Goldstein A. Naidu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Leucine-enkephalin, which represents DynA-(1-5), but is highly δ-selective, is still unable to bind this mutant receptor. Interestingly, other pro-Dynorphin products known to be κ-selective, including α-neoendorphin and DynB exhibit nanomolar affinities for this construct, whereas the endogenous opioid β-endorphin, which is μ- and δ-selective and does not bind κ, remains unable to bind this construct. Finally, it is clear that this construct requires the N-terminal tyrosine of the opioids, as the non-opioid DynA-(2-17) is unable to bind either this construct or the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor. The results of this series of studies have shown the following. (a) The wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor strongly discriminates against all the endogenous opioid ligands except DynA and some of its fragments. These latter peptides exhibit appreciable affinities to the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor, albeit 30-100-fold lower than their affinities for the κ opioid receptor. (b) By changing as few as four amino acids in the Orphanin FQ receptor, it is possible to create a protein that simultaneously recognizes, with nanomolar or better affinities, the Orphanin FQ peptide and the κ-selective members of the pro-Dynorphin family. (c) The entire set of constructs continues to discriminate against the non-κ endogenous opioids. (d) These constructs, like the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor, appear to require an N-terminal phenyl residue for high affinity binding as des-Tyr Dynorphin, a non-opioid form of Dynorphin A, fails to recognize them. These findings suggest that, in the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor, a handful of residues are sufficient to prevent the binding of the κ-selective opioids to the Orphanin FQ receptor. Yet these residues are, at least in part, distinct from those that are required for high affinity binding of Orphanin FQ since the latter continues to bind when they are mutated. The binding profile of the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor reveals a pattern of selectivity that favors pro-Dynorphin A and its fragments. Moreover, the observed pattern is reminiscent of the interaction of these same peptides with the wild-type κ receptor. Thus, the longer forms, DynA-(1-17), DynA-(1-13), and DynA-(1-11), exhibit the highest affinities toward the Orphanin FQ receptor while the shortened forms DynA-(1-7) and DynA-(1-5) (or leucine-enkephalin) exhibit a substantial loss in affinity to that receptor. This is very similar to the behavior of the DynA peptides toward the κ receptor, suggesting that the C-terminal tail of the DynA fragments may be largely responsible for their limited affinity toward the Orphanin FQ receptor. Using the message-address concept (7Schwyzer R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 297: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 23Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) as applied to the opioid peptides, we can see that multiple messages exist in the C-terminal half of DynA-(1-17). One of these messages, DynA-(8-13), promotes the binding with the Orphanin FQ receptor; however, another message, found in the DynA-(14-17) region, appears to discriminate against the Orphanin FQ receptor as evidenced by the observation that DynA-(1-13) has better affinity than DynA-(1-17) toward the Orphanin (but not the κ) receptor. It should be noted here that the C-terminal part of the Orphanin FQ peptide was also found to be important for binding and biological activity (16Reinscheid R.K. Ardati A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14163-14168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since none of the opioid peptides tested including DynA and its fragments showed truly high affinities toward the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor, we would suggest that the binding pocket formed by the transmembrane domains of the Orphanin FQ receptor selects against the binding of the N-terminal opioid core Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe. Furthermore, the same wild-type receptor selects against all the opioid alkaloids tested. Thus, the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor has structural features that discriminate against the vast majority of opioid drugs and opioid peptides. The mutation of the bank of three residues in TM6 with histidine at the center brought about a significant change in the binding profile of the Orphanin FQ receptor, moving it substantially toward a κ opioid profile and thereby confirming an important role of this region of TM6 in the binding of opioids to their receptors. The threonine-isoleucine single point mutation in TM7 was even more effective at improving the affinity toward the κ-selective endogenous ligands deriving from the pro-Dyn precursor. However, the most remarkable single change was the A-K mutation at the interface of TM5 and the second extracellular loop. This residue endowed the Orphanin FQ receptor with an opioid profile that included not only binding the pro-Dynorphin peptides but greatly improved affinity toward several small alkaloids (data not shown). This mutation also demonstrates that, while the histidine in TM6 is important for opioid binding, it is not critical to the binding of some ligands since the A-K mutant achieves good binding affinities in the absence of the TM6 histidine. Interestingly, none of these mutations interfered with the binding of Orphanin FQ itself. When the mutations were combined, one of the constructs (VQV-IHI + T-I) retained the ability of binding Orphanin FQ while exhibiting affinities for the pro-Dyn peptides comparable with those seen with the κ receptor. Thus, this construct represents the creation of a true pro-Dyn/Orphanin dual receptor. It is notable that, although the residues chosen for mutations were conserved across all three opioid receptors, they only enhanced the binding of pro-Dyn-derived κ-selective peptides. Indeed, the affinity of the double mutant toward these peptides is fully predicted by the κ profile and the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor profile, with DynA-(1-17) and DynA-(1-13) showing extremely high affinities, DynA-(1-8) showing intermediate affinity, and leucine-enkephalin showing extremely low affinity. While DynA-(1-17) and DynA-(1-13) already had substantial affinities toward the Orphanin FQ receptor, and while α-neoendorphin (another pro-Dyn product) also exhibited affinity in the 100 nM range, another pro-Dyn derived peptide, DynB, had an affinity to the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor close to the micromolar range. Yet DynB exhibited a hundred-fold increase in binding the double mutant, showing that our mutations enhanced the binding of pro-Dyn products regardless of their starting affinities for the wild-type receptor. Nevertheless, it is evident that among the endogenous opioid peptides tested, it is only the κ-selective products of pro-Dyn that show any improvement with these mutations. We interpret these observations to mean that the sites we mutated may be necessary for binding of opioids in general, but they are obviously not sufficient. A key element critical for discrimination in favor of κ ligands must be already present in the Orphanin FQ receptor. We suggest that this element may be the highly negatively charged second extracellular loop. While the EL2s of the κ- and the Orphanin FQ receptors are clearly divergent in terms of strict peptide sequence, they share the distinct feature of possessing a large number of negative charges. Work from our laboratory and that of others has shown that this second extracellular loop of opioids is critical in discriminating between the endogenous peptides and endowing them with κ versus δ selectivity (11Wang J.B.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We had previously argued that these extracellular loops may not discriminate via direct point to point interactions but via general patterns of attractions and repulsion based on their general secondary structures and hydrophobic properties. The present findings tend to support this view. It is notable that the analog of DynA that lacks the N-terminal tyrosine is incapable of binding either the wild-type Orphanin FQ receptor or any of the mutants. This indicates that the phenyl group present in both Orphanin FQ (Phe) and in all the endogenous opioid peptides (Tyr) is critical for interactions with this receptor. However, the present studies do not allow us to pinpoint the exact site of this interaction nor the site that allows a possible discrimination between a Phe and Tyr in the N-terminal position. It should be noted however that the conversion of Phe1 to Tyr1 in the context of the Orphanin FQ sequence is not sufficient to endow it with opioid properties in spite of the fact that such a change now reconstitutes the critical Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe core, 4O. Civelli, R. K. Reinscheid, and F. J. Monsma, unpublished data. emphasizing again the complex nature of peptide receptor binding selectivity. It was not possible to predict, a priori, whether a given set of mutations would simultaneously endow the Orphanin FQ receptor with opioid recognition and rob it of Orphanin FQ binding or whether these two events could be separated. The present results clearly demonstrate that discrimination against opioids resides at somewhat different sites from the key sites of Orphanin FQ recognition, as evidenced by the fact that we created a dual receptor that could recognize both Orphanin FQ and the peptidergic κ ligands. However, the sites may not be completely separable as the combination of the AK mutation with others, while leading to opioid alkaloid binding (data not shown), substantially decreases the binding of Orphanin FQ. In summary, we have shown that a small number of specific residues are responsible for excluding κ peptide ligands from binding to the Orphanin FQ receptor. Since the introduction of these residues in the Orphanin FQ receptor is sufficient to endow it with the ability to bind κ-selective endogenous peptides, we would propose that these very residues are critical for peptide binding in the context of the opioid receptors. However, we also suggest that other elements of these receptors, such as the extracellular loops, participate in binding selectivity. The reported results demonstrate the value of using related members of a given receptor family to understand the structural basis of high affinity and high selectivity ligand binding. They also demonstrate how small but coordinate changes during evolution of the receptor and the ligands may be sufficient to derive an entirely novel neurotransmitter system. We thank Linda M.

Genaro A.M. Boscá L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Hortelano S. Genaro A.M. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24937-24940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, a role for PKC activation in the control of iNOS expression has been reported in the synergistic action of phorbol esters and IFN-γ in murine peritoneal macrophages and in the cell line J774, as well as in astrocytes and microglia cells (15Jun C.D. Choi B.M. Hoon R. Um J.Y. Kwak H.J. Lee B.S. Paik S.G. Kim H.M. Chung H.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3684-3690PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sands W.A. Bulut V. Severn A. Xu D. Liew F.Y. Eur. J.

Rim G.N. Kim H.M. Chung H.T. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1994; 1: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, priming with taxol of RAW 264.7 cells favors iNOS induction via a PKC-dependent mechanism, but treatment with phorbol esters alone has no effect on NO synthesis (19Jun C.D. Choi B.M. Kim H.M. Chung H.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6541-6547PubMed Google Scholar). This cellular diversity in iNOS expression in response to phorbol esters might be due to multiple mechanisms, among them the requirement of a precise pattern of expression of PKC isotypes (20Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). The view emerging from these studies is that PKC engagement might be involved as part of the intracellular signaling that promotes iNOS expression and, in some cases, constitutes a self-sufficient pathway to accomplish NO synthesis. Indeed, the structure of the murine iNOS gene has been analyzed, a 1.8-kb fragment of the promoter region has been characterized, and it contains most of the transcriptional motifs involved in the transactivation of iNOS including two critical κB sites among other consensus binding sequences (21Xie Q-w. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 22Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Because some PKC isotypes have been reported to activate κB motifs (24Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 25Hirano M. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hosaka M. Ohno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we have investigated in this work whether ectopic expression of various phorbol ester-responsive PKC isotypes in RAW 264.7 cells can promote iNOS induction. Our results show that expression of PKC-ϵ is sufficient to induce iNOS synthesis in RAW 264.7 cells through a mechanism that involves the transactivation of response elements located in the 1.8-kb region of the iNOS promoter. Materials and chemicals for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad or from Amersham Corp. Metabolites and biochemicals were from Sigma or from Boehringer Mannheim. Serum and media were from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD).Tabled 1 RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC and correspond to a murine macrophage cell line. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% FCS, and antibiotics (50 μg/ml of penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin). Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from Swiss mice following a published method (13Hortelano S. Genaro A.M. Boscá L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Rat hepatocytes, murine splenocytes and B cells, and human neutrophils were isolated and purified as described previously (14Hortelano S. Genaro A.M. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24937-24940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Genaro A.M. Hortelano S. Alvarez A. Martínez-A C. Boscá L. J. Clin.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) fused to a promoterless CAT reporter gene (p1.NOS-CAT), was a generous gift from Dr. Q.-w. Xie and C. Nathan (Cornell University, NY). A (κB)3-CAT plasmid construct that contains three copies of the κB motif from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat enhancer with the conalbumin promoter was used to measure κB binding activity (27Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Díaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). kSV2-CAT plasmid was used as a reference for maximal efficiency of the transfection (28Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). The pCO2 vector (Dr. S. Goodbourne, St. Georges Hospital, London) was used to express the PKC isotypes (24Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and they were referred to as pPKC-α, -β1, -δ, and -ϵ. Plasmids directing expression of constitutively active isotypes were referred to as pPKC-α* and pPKC-β1*, respectively (see Table I). Plasmids were purified using Qiagen columns (Hilden, FRG), and only those preparations that once diluted contained less than 30 pg/ml of endotoxin using the Limulus polyphemus test were used. Additionally, to evaluate the stimulatory capacity of the plasmid preparations to mediate iNOS expression due to bacterial product contamination, cells were electroporated in the absence of plasmids and challenged with an equivalent amount of plasmid upon culture. Under these conditions PKC plasmids never induced an NH4− release higher than 10% over the basal value. The cell layer was trypsinized, and macrophages were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PBS (3 × 106 cells/ml) and kept at 4°C. Plasmids were added to the cells at the indicated concentration and incubated at 4°C for at least 5 min prior to electroporation (0.4 kV, 500 microfarad of capacitance) in a BTX electroporator. Cells were maintained for a further 5 min at 4°C and then transferred to RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FCS. After two h of seeding to select adherent cells, the dishes were washed twice with PBS and maintained for 24 h in culture medium (phenol red-free medium plus 5% FCS). To follow NO release, the medium was changed, and stimuli (usually 50 ng/ml PDBu) were added. Cell incubation was continued for up to 48 h. When cells were transfected by lipofection (DOTAP reagent from Boehringer Mannheim), it was done following the recommendations of the supplier manufacturer. Total RNA (2-4 × 106 cells) was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis in a 0.9% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde, the RNA was transferred to a Nytran membrane (NY 13-N; Schleicher & Schuell, FRG), and the levels of iNOS mRNA were determined using an EcoRI-HindII fragment from the iNOS cDNA (1Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar, 5Nathan C. Xie Q-w. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Readyprime labeling kit (Amersham). The membranes were exposed to x-ray films (Hyperfilm, Amersham), and the intensity of the bands was measured by laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). Hybridization with an 18 S ribosomal probe was used as an internal standard. NO was measured as the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate in the incubation medium. Nitrate was reduced to nitrite with nitrate reductase (30Terenzi F. Díaz-Guerra M.J.M. Casado M. Hortelano S. Leoni S. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6017-6021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nitrite was determined spectrophotometrically with Griess reagent (30Terenzi F. Díaz-Guerra M.J.M. Casado M. Hortelano S. Leoni S. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6017-6021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by adding 100 μl of 1 mM sulfanilic acid and 100 mM HCl (final concentration) to 850 μl of culture medium. After incubation for 5 min, the absorbance at 548 nm was measured, and 50 μl of naphthylenediamine (1 mM in the assay) were added. The reaction was completed after 15 min of incubation, and the absorbance at 548 nm was compared with a standard of NaNO2. The amount of nitrate produced from NO release was below 20% of the nitrite measured. The cell layers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 200 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (lysis buffer). The extract was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied to a DEAE column (500-μl gel) to partially purify the enzyme (31Díaz-Guerra M.J.M. Sanchez-Prieto J. Boscá L. Pocock J. Barrie A. Nicholls D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 970: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The activity was assayed in a final volume of 250 μl using myelin basic protein peptide (MBP) or the peptide ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV (β-PSS) as substrates following previously described methods (31Díaz-Guerra M.J.M. Sanchez-Prieto J. Boscá L. Pocock J. Barrie A. Nicholls D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 970: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Marais R.M. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cultured RAW 264.7 cells (3-4 × 106) were washed twice with PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer (see above), and after centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 15 min, the proteins present in the supernatant were size separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and incubated with several anti-PKC-specific antibodies (33 and references herein) or with an iNOS antibody (Transduction Laboratories). PKC isotypes or iNOS were revealed by ECL following manufacturers instructions (Amersham). In experiments investigating the effect of PKC isotypes on the expression of the transfected p1.NOS-CAT promoter (21Xie Q-w. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) or (κB)3-CAT construct (27Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Díaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were cotransfected with both plasmids and incubated with the indicated stimuli for 24-48 h. After two washes of the cell layer with ice-cold PBS, the plates were treated with 0.5 ml of 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 4°C, and the cells were scraped off the dishes. The cell extract was submitted to three cycles of freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the soluble protein was measured. Aliquots of the supernatant (150-200 μl) were normalized for protein (200 μg) and heated at 65°C for 10 min. CAT activity was measured in a final volume of 250 μl by the synthesis of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol following the thin layer chromatography method (28Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of acetylated substrate, the silica spots were scraped off the matrix, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical differences (p < 0.05) between mean values were determined by one-way analysis of the variance followed by Student's t test. In experiments using x-ray films (hyperfilm), different exposure times were used to ensure that bands were not saturated. Incubation of cultured RAW 264.7 cells with LPS promoted a large release of NO to the medium, whereas exposure of cells to phorbol esters failed on their own to trigger an effective NO synthesis, and only a low response (6% of the effect of LPS) was observed (Fig. 1). Contrary to this behavior and in agreement with previous work (13Hortelano S. Genaro A.M. Boscá L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Hortelano S. Genaro A.M. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24937-24940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation of primary cultures of rat peritoneal macrophages or isolated hepatocytes with PDBu produced a NOx− release that was 83 and 71%, respectively, of the response elicited after LPS treatment. This PDBu-dependent NOx− synthesis was absent in other cells such as isolated splenocytes, B cells, or human neutrophils. The different behavior observed between RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages in the expression of iNOS in response to phorbol esters suggests the existence of cell-specific signaling pathways in these two cell types, either because of a distinct distribution of the PKC isotypes prevailing in each cell type or because of a divergent signaling mechanism downstream of the PKC network. Taking advantage of this inability of RAW 264.7 cells to display a significant PDBu-dependent NOx− synthesis, we studied whether a transient expression of PKC isotypes after transfection with plasmids harboring distinct PKC isoenzyme constructs might restore a PKC-dependent induction of iNOS. To do this, RAW 264.7 cells were transfected by electroporation with plasmids encoding the phorbol ester responsive wild-type α, β1, δ, and ϵ isoforms of PKC, and the release of NOx− was followed from 24 to 48 h after transfection (Fig. 2). Also, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding constitutively active forms of PKC (α* and β1* isotypes), and the release of NOx− was followed either in the absence or in the presence of 50 ng/ml of PDBu. As Fig. 2 shows, transfection with pPKC-ϵ resulted in a substantial NOx− synthesis that was barely affected by addition of PDBu. To ensure that this NOx− synthesis effectively corresponded to the expression of iNOS, cells were collected at the end of the incubation period, and the presence of iNOS was assessed by Western blot (Fig. 2, inset). Also, the nature of the NOS present in PKC-transfected cells was determined following the mRNA levels corresponding to iNOS. Only cells transfected with PKC-ϵ exhibited a substantial increase in the mRNA levels of iNOS in samples collected at 18 and 24 h after transfection (Fig. 3). Similar results in NOx− synthesis were obtained when cells were transfected by lipofection (DOTAP reagent) with pPKC-α, -α*, and -ϵ (Table II).Fig. 2Transfection of RAW 264.7 cells with pPKC-ϵ induces iNOS expression and the release of NO. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg/ml of the indicated plasmids. Cells were stimulated in the absence (open bars) or in the presence of 50 ng/ml of PDBu (hatched bars) 24 h after transfection. The amount of NOx− released to the medium was measured 18 h after stimulation as indicated under “Materials and Methods” using Griess reagent. Plasmids encoding constitutively active PKC isotypes are represented with an asterisk. Results show the mean ± S.E. of four experiments.

After homogenization of the cells, total RNA was extracted and analyzed (5 μg) by Northern blot using a probe specific for iNOS.

One explanation of this result is that there may be a high over-expression of the enzyme in the transfected cells. To test this idea, cells were transfected with increasing amounts of pPKC-ϵ plasmid followed by the addition of PDBu. As Fig. 4 shows, when cells were transfected with low amounts of plasmid, a gain in sensitivity to PDBu stimulation was observed; however, this was not the case when cells were transfected with concentrations of plasmid higher than 10 μg/ml. Fig. 4 also shows that addition of the plasmid to the cells after electroporation was unable to trigger NO synthesis, discounting a potential contribution of bacterial cell wall products from the plasmid preparation to the induction of iNOS. The previous results suggest that some PKC isotypes are key regulators for the control of iNOS expression, at least in RAW 264.7 cells. Therefore, it can be proposed that the absence of response of RAW 264.7 cells to PDBu might be attributed to a low content of PKC-ϵ or perhaps to an inappropriate intracellular localization of the enzyme. On analysis, the level of the PKC-ϵ in RAW 264.7 cells was practically undetectable by Western blot when compared with other cell types such as 3T3 cells (Fig. 5A). When cells were transfected with the panel of pPKC plasmids used, PKC-ϵ was only evident in cells transfected with pPKC-ϵ (Fig. 5B). Moreover, this overexpressed PKC-ϵ enzyme was active since the total PKC activity with MBP as substrate was notably increased as was the phosphorylation of a more “preferred” substrate of PKC-ϵ, β-PSS (Fig. 5C). The preceding results suggest that some isotypes of PKC are sufficient to trigger an efficient expression of iNOS. To further investigate the mechanisms involved in the response of iNOS to PKC activation, we used a cotransfection assay in which both PKC isotypes and a 1.8-kb fragment of the promoter region of iNOS (21Xie Q-w. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) linked to a CAT reporter gene were expressed. As Fig. 6A shows, CAT activity was present in cells transfected with either 10 or 20 μg/ml of plasmid harboring PKC-ϵ. Moreover, these results also show the absence of transactivation when iNOS promoter-transfected cells were stimulated with phorbol esters, whereas treatment with LPS elicited a marked increase in the reporter activity, therefore, reflecting the inability of the endogenous PKC to mediate a significant transactivation of this promoter region of the iNOS gene. The ability of the different pPKC plasmids to express CAT activity, upon cotransfection with the iNOS promoter, is shown in Fig. 6B. CAT activity was negligible when cells were transfected with pPKC-α and -δ, whereas a small effect was observed in cells harboring the β1 isotype (Fig. 6B). Because the activation of the κB sequences located in the 1.8-kb fragment of the iNOS promoter plays an important role in the transactivation of the gene (21Xie Q-w. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 22Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol.

As Fig. 7 shows, 24 h after transfection with vectors directing the expression of PKC-α* and -ϵ isotypes, a clear increase in CAT activity was observed in cells expressing PKC-ϵ (10.2-fold increase), whereas CAT activity was minimal in cells transfected with PKC-α*. When cells transfected with PKC expression vectors were incubated with PDTC, an inhibitor of IκB degradation (34Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), CAT activity and NOx− synthesis were abrogated in agreement with the expected results using this NF-κB activation inhibitor. As a control, stimulation with LPS of cells transfected with the (κB)3-CAT vector induced a large CAT activity confirming the effect of LPS on κB activation in these cells (21Xie Q-w. Whisnant R.

The Rhizobium meliloti lipid A backbone, like that of Escherichia coli, is a β1′-6-linked glucosamine disaccharide that is phosphorylated at positions 1 and 4′. Rhizobium leguminosarum lipid A lacks both phosphates, but contains aminogluconate in place of the proximal glucosamine 1-phosphate, and galacturonic acid instead of the 4′-phosphate. A peculiar feature of the lipid As of all Rhizobiaceae is acylation with 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid, a long hydroxylated fatty acid not found in E. coli. We now describe an in vitro system, consisting of a membrane enzyme and a cytosolic acyl donor from R. leguminosarum, that transfers 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid to (Kdo)2-lipid IVA, a key lipid A precursor common to both E. coli and R. leguminosarum. The 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid moiety was detected in the lipid product by mass spectrometry. The membrane enzyme required the presence of Kdo residues in the acceptor substrate for activity. The cytosolic acyl donor was purified from wild-type R. leguminosarum using the acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA as the assay. Amino-terminal sequencing of the purified acyl donor revealed an exact 19-amino acid match with a partially sequenced gene (orf*) of R. leguminosarum. Orf* contains the consensus sequence, DSLD, for attachment of 4′-phosphopantetheine. When the entire orf* gene was sequenced, it was found to encode a protein of 92 amino acids. Orf* is a new kind of acyl carrier protein because it is only ∼25% identical both to the constitutive acyl carrier protein (AcpP) and to the inducible acyl carrier protein (NodF) of R. leguminosarum. Mass spectrometry of purified active Orf* confirmed the presence of 4′-phosphopantetheine and 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid in the major species. Smaller mass peaks indicative of Orf* acylation with hydroxylated 20, 22, 24, and 26 carbon fatty acids were also observed. Given the specialized function of Orf* in lipid A acylation, we suggest the new designation AcpXL.

Lipid A, the hydrophobic moiety that attaches lipopolysaccharide to the membrane, is of special interest because it is essential for bacterial growth (6Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1980; 125: 1-8Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). R. leguminosarum lipid A contains an acylated aminogluconate in place of the proximal glucosamine 1-phosphate, and a galacturonic acid residue in place of the 4′-phosphate (Fig. 1) (23Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most remarkably, R. leguminosarum lipid A appears to lack acyloxyacyl residues, as judged by the absence of myristate, laurate, and other common short acyl chains (23Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, lipid As of R. leguminosarum and most other Rhizobiaceae contain an unusual, long hydroxylated acyl moiety, 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid, not found in enterobacterial lipid A (26Bhat U.R. Mayer H. Yokota A. Hollingsworth R.I. Carlson R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. Busch M. Mayer H. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1991; 41: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The exact location of the ester-linked 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid moiety in R. leguminosarum lipid A is uncertain (23Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is apparently not attached to one of the R-3-hydroxy acyl chains (Fig. 1), assuming that acyloxyacyl moieties containing 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid have the same chemical reactivities as ordinary acyloxyacyl groups (23Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wollenweber H.-W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The function of 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid is not known. Its length is about twice that of the normal fatty acids that are usually attached to enterobacterial lipid As. Other examples of related, long chain oxygen-containing fatty acids are 25-hydroxyhexacosanoic acid in Pseudomonas carboxydovorans (27Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. Busch M. Mayer H. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1991; 41: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and 27-keto-octacosanoic acid in Legionella (29Zähringer U. Knirel Y.A. Lindner B. Helbig J.H. Sonesson A. Marre R.

The enzymes catalyzing these reactions are the products of the htrB and msbB genes, respectively (31Clementz T. Bednarski J. Raetz C.R.H.

They have a remarkable requirement for the Kdo domain, as they do not acylate lipid IVA (30Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Kelly T.M. Raetz C.R.H. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4646-4655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA may function as an acceptor for the 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid moiety. In preliminary experiments (39Brozek K.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1376Google Scholar), described in the accompanying manuscript (62Brozek K.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32112-32118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we observed a putative acylation reaction of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA in crude extracts of R. leguminosarum. We now demonstrate that this reaction requires both a membrane component and a cytosolic factor, and that it indeed represents the addition of 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid to (Kdo)2-lipid IVA. It occurs in extracts of several strains of R. leguminosarum and R. meliloti, but not E. coli. The R. leguminosarum cytosolic factor has been purified, cloned, and sequenced. It is a new member of the acyl carrier protein family, designated AcpXL, that functions in transfers of long hydroxylated fatty acids. AcpXL is distinct from both the constitutive acyl carrier protein (40Platt M.W. Miller K.J. Lane W.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5440-5444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AcpP, involved in synthesis of 12-18 carbon acyl chains and from the inducible acyl carrier protein (41Geiger O. Spaink H.P.

Aqueous dispersions of these lipids were stored at −20°C, and they were subjected to sonic irradiation in a bath sonicator for 2 min prior to use.Assay of (Kdo)2-lipid IVA AcylationThe conditions for observing the acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA (formation of product a) were optimized. Reactions contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10 μM (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA, at approximately 20,000-50,000 cpm/nmol, in 10 μl. Crude extracts, membranes, and cytosolic fractions were present at the concentrations indicated. Acylation reactions were carried out at 30°C for 60 min, or as otherwise indicated. Following incubation, 5-μl samples were withdrawn and spotted onto thin-layer chromatography plates that were then developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v). Exposure to imaging screens at room temperature was carried out overnight. Extent of conversion of substrate to product(s) was measured using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager operated with ImageQuant software.Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisPolyacrylamide gels of 15% were cast in a Bio-Rad Protean II apparatus, according to the conditions of Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206038) Google Scholar), but without SDS. Samples were not denatured or reduced prior to loading in glycerol-containing buffer. Gels were run at constant current of 25 mA, using a buffer consisting of 3.1 g of Tris base and 14.4 g of glycine per liter. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue.Chemical Hydrolyses of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA and Its Acylated Derivative (Product a)Acylation reactions (10 μl) were set up as described above, except that carrier-free (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA was used (1 × 107 cpm/nmol), the chemical concentration of which was about 0.2 μM. Reaction RI contained no membranes or cytosolic factor. Reaction RII contained 0.1 mg/ml 8401 membranes, and 0.3 mg/ml of DEAE-purified cytosolic factor (see below). Reaction RIII contained a system for generating (Kdo)2-[lauroyl]-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA as a control, using 45 μg/ml of an extract that overproduces HtrB but lacks MsbB (32Clementz T. Bednarski J.J.

Acylation reactions were incubated at 30°C for 60 min. Three 1-μl portions were withdrawn from each reaction. Each 1-μl portion was subjected to a different treatment. (a) For mild base hydrolysis, 1 μl of reaction mixture was combined with 9 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and 1 μl of 1.25 M NaOH. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, after which time 1 μl of 1.25 M HCl was added. After mixing, a 5-μl portion was applied to a thin-layer plate. (b) For acid hydrolysis, 1 μl of reaction mixture was combined with 9 μl of 0.1 M HCl in a 0.65-ml Microfuge tube, which was sealed with a boiling clip. The tube was floated in a boiling water bath for 30 min. Next, 0.8 μl of 1.25 M NaOH and 1 μl of 10% SDS were added. The latter helped recover all the radioactivity from the tube, without affecting the hydrolysis. A 5-μl sample was then"
https://openalex.org/W2048335195,"Aziridinylbenzoquinones are a group of antitumor agents that elicit cytotoxicity by generating either alkylating intermediates or reactive oxygen species. The mechanism of toxicity may not always, however, involve profound damage of cellular constituents, but may involve a cytostatic effect through interference with the cell cycle. In this context, we have examined the induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (WAF1, CIP1, or sdi1), whose overexpression suppresses the growth of various tumor cells, in human tumor cells metabolizing 3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DZQ) and its C2,C5-substituted derivatives: 2,5-bis-(carboethoxyamino) (AZQ) and 2,5-bis-2(-hydroxyethylamino) (BZQ).Both DZQ and AZQ were effectively activated by HCT116 human colonic carcinoma cells; the activation of the former involved largely a dicoumarol-sensitive activity, whereas that of the latter appeared to be accomplished primarily by one-electron transfer reductases. BZQ was not a substrate for the dicoumarol-sensitive enzyme in HCT116 cells. Cellular activation of the first two quinones was associated with formation of oxygen-centered radicals as detected by EPR in conjunction with the spin trap 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. The redox transitions of DZQ involved hydroxyl radical formation and were strongly inhibited by catalase, whereas those of AZQ showed a strong superoxide anion component sensitive to superoxide dismutase. These signals were suppressed by N-acetylcysteine with concomitant production of a thiyl radical adduct. This suggests an effective electron transfer between the thiol and free radicals formed during the activation of these quinones.DZQ and AZQ induced significantly the expression of p21 in HCT116 cells, but a 10-fold higher concentration of AZQ was required to achieve the level of induction elicited by DZQ. BZQ had little effect on p21 expression. p21 induction at both mRNA and protein levels correlated with the inhibition of either cyclin-dependent kinase activity or cell proliferation. p21 induction elicited by the above quinones was inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, whereas the non-sulfur analog, N-acetylalanine, was without effect. Catalase and superoxide dismutase did not effect p21 induction by aziridinylbenzoquinones in HCT116 cells, thus suggesting that extracellular sources of oxygen radicals generated by plasma membrane reductases have no influence in the expression of this gene. Hydrogen peroxide, a product of quinone redox cycling, elicited an increase of p21 mRNA levels in HCT116 and K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. The latter lacks p53, one of the activators of p21 transcription, thus suggesting that p21 expression can be accomplished in a p53-independent manner in these cells.This study suggests that p21 induction is mediated by an increase in the cellular steady-state concentration of oxygen radicals and that the greater effectiveness in p21 induction by DZQ may be related to its efficient metabolism by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase activity in HCT116 cells.

Acta. 1995; 1263: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), up-regulating p21 expression by anti-cancer agents could be effective in arresting the cell cycle and beneficial to cancer treatment. In this context, the production of reactive oxygen species inherent in the activation of some anticancer agents may be of relevance for p21 induction and the subsequent effects on the cell cycle. Aziridinylbenzoquinones are a group of potential antitumor compounds with both quinone and aziridine moieties: it is still not clear whether they elicit their cytotoxic effects through the formation of reactive oxygen species or of strong alkylating agents. Reports on DNA strand breakage (mediated by free radicals) and/or DNA covalent binding (mediated by electrophiles) abound in the aziridinylbenzoquinone literature. This study was aimed at gathering information on the molecular mechanisms inherent in the activation of p21 during the metabolism of several aziridinylbenzoquinones by HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells. A comprehensive approach to elucidate this mechanism(s) involved (a) characterization of the cellular activation of these quinones, (b) measurement of the ensuing steady-state concentration of oxygen radicals, and (c) establishment of a relationship between the latter and expression of p21 at mRNA and protein levels. The cellular effects of these quinones are expected to be an expression of both their functional group chemistry and mode of activation. The former led us to investigate aziridinylbenzoquinones with different substitution patterns at C2 and C5: 3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DZQ), 2,5-bis-(carboethoxyamino)-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (AZQ), 1The abbreviations used are: AZQ2,5-bis(carboethoxyamino)-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinoneBZQ2,5-bis-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinoneDZQ3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinoneDMPO5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxideGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salineMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxide. and 2,5-bis-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (BZQ) (see Structures Structure 1, Structure 2, Structure 3). The latter is also of interest because most cancer cells and preneoplastic nodules, among them HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells, overexpress NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase), a two-electron transfer flavoprotein (25Cadenas E.

Human colonic carcinoma HCT116 cells (ATCC CCL247) and human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells (lacking p53; ATCC CCL243) were grown in McCoy's 5A medium or RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biocell Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA). Cells were seeded 24 h before drug treatment. All quinones were dissolved in Me2SO. Control cultures were treated with Me2SO alone. In experiments with cells supplemented with N-acetylcysteine or N-acetylalanine, the pH values of these compounds were adjusted to 7.4 before the addition. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cell numbers were counted in hemacytometer by light microscopy. Extraction of total RNA (20 μg/lane) from HCT116 cells and Northern blot analysis were carried out by standard procedures (26Ausubel F.M. Brent B. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1993Google Scholar). Human p21 probe was prepared by the polymerase chain reaction as described (27Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar) using human genomic DNA from HCT116 cells. Human GAPDH cDNA was used as control probe to determine the relative amount of RNA loaded. GAPDH cDNA was prepared from the plasmid with human GAPDH cDNA insert in Escherichia coli (ATCC 57090) by using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). 5 × 106 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer as described (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and the amount of protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). 50 μg of total protein was loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis at 120 V for 5-6 h, the protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with monoclonal p21 antibody or purified p34cdc2 antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The levels of antigens were analyzed by sensitized chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). The cell lysate was prepared as described for immunoblot analysis. 150 μg of total protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation with cdc2 or cyclin A antibody (PharMingen). The immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-agarose, washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 4 μg of histone H1, 30 μM ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1) was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction products were analyzed on a 12% acrylamide gel, quantified by autoradiography (Instant Imager Electronic Autoradiography; Packard Instrument Co.), and exposed to a Kodak X-AR film. HCT116 cells in exponential growth were harvested by trypsinizing, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), sonicated for 1 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to obtain the homogenates. Protein was determined by the Lowry method (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell homogenates (2.17 ± 0.03 mg of protein/ml) were mixed with 80 mM DMPO, 2% DMSO, 1 mM NADH, and 100 μM quinone in the absence or presence of 20 μM dicoumarol. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer with the following settings: microwave frequency, 9.80 GHz; microwave power, 20 mW; sweep width, 100 G; receiver gain, 1 × 106; modulation amplitude, 0.86 G; time constant, 1.3 s; sweep rate, 20 G/min. HCT116 cell homogenates were prepared as described above. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase activity was measured by cytochrome c reduction (ϵ = 21 mM−1 cm−1) as described (30Lind C. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 77 μM cytochrome c, 200 μM NADH, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.7 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 0.1% DMSO, and 10 μM quinone in the absence or presence of cell homogenate (1-10 μg of protein/ml). Cellular Activation of Aziridinylbenzoquinones—NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, a two-electron flavoprotein overexpressed in most cancer cell lines and preneoplastic tumors is expected to play an important role in the bioactivation of aziridinylbenzoquinones (25Cadenas E.

The specific activity of this oxidoreductase in HCT116 cells is ∼390 nmol/min/mg of protein (measured as the dicoumarol-sensitive reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol) (33Traver R.D. Horikoshi T. Danenberg K.D. Stadlbauer T.H.W. Danenberg P.V. Ross D. Gibson N.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 797-802PubMed Google Scholar). The dicoumarol-sensitive reduction of DZQ by HCT116 cell homogenates was 374 nmol/min/mg of protein, a value that represented 72% of the overall reducing activity of HCT116 cells. That of AZQ was only 8.6 nmol/min/mg of protein, indicating that quinone reductases other than NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase were largely (∼95%) involved in the metabolism of AZQ (Table I). These activities were also measured in the presence of superoxide dismutase in order to distinguish the fraction of cytochrome c reduced by hydroquinone, semiquinone, or O2−˙. Superoxide dismutase had little effect on cytochrome c reduction, suggesting that most of the hemoprotein was reduced primarily by hydroquinones and/or semiquinones.Table I.Enzyme-mediated quinone activation and p21 inductionQuinone+d[cytochrome c2+]/dtaValues were obtained from assays with different cell homogenate concentrations at fixed quinone concentration per duplicate.

Open table in a new tab In summary, DZQ was reduced by a dicoumarol-sensitive activity at a rate ∼43-fold higher than AZQ, whereas BZQ was not a substrate for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase. This is in agreement with previous observations obtained with HT29 cells (31Gibson N.W. Hartley J.A. Butler J. Siegel D. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 531-536PubMed Google Scholar). EPR in conjunction with the spin trap DMPO revealed a strong signal when HCT116 cell homogenates were incubated with DZQ (Fig. 1). This signal was ascribed to the DMPO-CH3 adduct (aN = 16.4 and aH = 23.52 G) originating from HO· attack on the quinone solvent (Me2SO) and subsequent trapping of ·CH3 by DMPO (Reaction R1).Fig. 1Formation of oxygen radicals during the metabolism of DZQ and AZQ by HCT116 cell homogenates. Experiments carried out with DZQ (left panel) or AZQ (right panel): a, control, cell homogenate (2.17 ± 0.03 mg of protein/ml) in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, was supplemented with 100 μM quinone (dissolved in 2% Me2SO) and 80 mM DMPO; b, simulated spectrum of a corresponding to the DMPO-CH3 adduct for DZQ or a composite of DMPO-OOH and DMPO-CH3 adducts ((DMPO-OOH)/(DMPO-CH3) = 3.3) for AZQ; c, as in a in the presence of 0.1 μM superoxide dismutase; d, as in a in the presence of 1 nM catalase; e as in a in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This observation suggests that HO· is indeed formed during the metabolism of DZQ by HCT116 cells. The faster reaction of HO· with Me2SO (to yield ·CH3) than with the spin trap itself explains the prevalence of the DMPO-CH3 adduct. The occurrence of HO· in this system is further supported by the inhibitory effect of catalase on the EPR signal. Both catalase and superoxide dismutase abolished the EPR signal (Fig. 1). Metabolism of AZQ by HCT116 cells yielded a composite of superoxide (DMPO-OOH: aN = 14.2 and abH = 11.3 G, aγH = 1.25 G) and methyl (DMPO-CH3: aN = 16.4 and aH = 23.52 G) radical adducts (34Buettner G.R.

The contribution of the former adduct to the overall EPR signal was abolished by superoxide dismutase. The generation of HO· by AZQ was ∼3-fold lower than that by DZQ, in agreement with the enzymic reduction of the quinones (Table I). The differences in the EPR signals obtained during the metabolism of DZQ and AZQ by HCT116 cells are an expression of their functional group chemistry and the type of activation. AZQ is predominantly reduced by quinone reductases other than NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, whereas the latter enzyme appears largely responsible for the activation of DZQ (Table I). The occurrence of O2−˙during AZQ metabolism appears consistent with a univalent activation of the quinone. Conversely, the absence of this radical adduct during DZQ metabolism may be rationalized as a predominant role of O2−˙as a propagating species (oxidizing the hydroquinone to semiquinone). BZQ did not produce any detectable oxygen-centered radicals in the cell homogenates within the limits of our assay procedures, but a strong semiquinone signal was detected in the absence of the spin trap (Fig. 2a). This quinone itself, in PBS buffer and in the absence of cell homogenates, produced a semiquinone signal (Fig. 2b), whose intensity was enhanced upon addition of NADH (Fig. 2c). It may be surmised that BZQ is mainly reduced nonenzymically to a “stabilized” semiquinone. N-Acetylcysteine is a powerful reductant, which has been used as an intracellular antioxidant in several experimental models (18Datta R. Hallahan D.E. Kharbanda S.M. Rubin E. Sherman M.L. Huberman E.

Med. 1989; 6: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). The effect of N-acetylcysteine on the EPR signal observed during the metabolism of AZQ by HCT116 cells is shown in Fig. 3: a new signal (hyperfine splitting constants: aN = 15.0 and aH = 16.8 G) (36Cadenas E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) ascribed to the N-acetylcysteinyl radical was obtained. This is consistent with the one-electron oxidation of the thiol by the free radicals formed during the redox transitions of AZQ (or DZQ, not shown) and subsequent trapping of the thiyl radical by DMPO (Reaction R2).RSH+HO·→RS·+H2O REACTION 2 p21 induction at mRNA level in HCT116 cells was measured by Northern blot analysis. Our p21 probe hybridized with a single band around 2.1 kilobases, which is consistent with human p21 mRNA (12El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Lery D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lind D. Mercer E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). Treatment of HCT116 cells with DZQ elicited a concentration- and time-dependent increase of p21 mRNA levels (Fig. 4). p21 protein level was significantly elevated while the level of p34cdc2 protein, one of the cyclin-dependent kinases, remained unchanged following the treatment with 0.4 or 1.0 μM DZQ for 15 h (Fig. 5A). The cdc2-associated H1 kinase activity was strongly suppressed following the above treatments (Fig. 5B). The histone H1 kinase activities of the cyclin-dependent kinases associated wtih cyclin A (immunoprecipitated by cyclin A antibody) were also substantially inhibited (Fig. 5C). These results are in agreement with the role of p21 in inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Fig. 6 shows that the increase of p21 mRNA levels elicited by the three quinones differed markedly: DZQ produced the highest response (a 6-fold increase) over a narrow concentration range, possibly determined by the toxicity of the quinone at high doses (see below). AZQ significantly elevated (∼3-fold) p21 mRNA levels, but higher concentrations than those used with DZQ were required. Conversely, BZQ produced no obvious dose-dependent response on p21 mRNA. The effect of N-acetylcysteine on free radical production by the above quinones suggested an effective transfer of the radical character from an oxygen-centered radical to a less reactive sulfur-center radical (Reaction R2; Fig. 3). The exposure of HCT116 cells to N-acetylcysteine caused a small increase at constitutive levels of p21 mRNA (Fig. 7, A and B). The thiol completely inhibited the DZQ-mediated p21 induction, partially inhibited that mediated by AZQ, and had no effect on cells treated with BZQ (Fig. 7B). The effect elicited by N-acetylcysteine appears to be dependent on its free thiol group, because N-acetylalanine, a non-thiol analog, failed to elicit any significant inhibition of p21 induction (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Effect of N-acetylalanine on p21 induction by HCT116 cells during the metabolism of aziridinylbenzoquinones. Assay conditions were the same as in Fig. 7 but in the absence and presence of 30 mM N-acetylalanine (NAA) (instead of N-acetylcysteine).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further elucidate if oxyradicals mediate p21 induction by quinones, the HCT116 cells were treated with H2O2, a membrane-permeable product of quinone redox cycling (37Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar): ∼2-fold increase in the amount of p21 mRNA was observed (Fig. 9A). H2O2 also led to an increase at p21 mRNA level in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells lacking p53 (one of the activators of p21 transcription) in which p21 mRNA was elevated following the treatment of DZQ (Fig. 9B). These enzymes, when present in the medium surrounding intact cells, did not have any effect on p21 induction. This suggests that extracellular sources of oxygen radicals generated by plasma membrane reductases have no influence on the expression of this gene. Cell proliferation was also inhibited by DZQ and AZQ at the same concentrations required to induce p21. Similar to what was observed with p21 induction (Fig. 6), BZQ did not elicit any obvious effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 10A). To determine whether inhibition of cell proliferation was a transient phenomenon, cells were counted at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h following their exposure to 0.4 μM DZQ (Fig. 10B). Cells were still proliferating at the early stage of the exposure. After 24 h, cell proliferation was completely inhibited by"

Bio-Gel P-2 (fine) from Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, was used in a desalting column of dimensions 5 cm × 0.5 m. Calorimetric data were collected using a Model 4209 Hart Scientific microtitration calorimeter (Pleasant Grove, UT). The voltage to the instrument was regulated with a Citadel power conditioner, Model LC630, from Best Power Technology, Inc.

The large scale, partial depolymerization of heparin was carried out on 10 g of heparin. The large scale depolymerization was carried out to only 10% reaction completion to increase the percentage of oligosaccharides containing intact ATIII binding sites. This partial digestion of heparin provided a maximum concentration of oligosaccharides of intermediate molecular weight (1500-2000) and contained substantial anti-factor Xa activity (24Linhardt R.J.

In a sterile hood, 10 g of heparin was prepared in 200 ml of 250 mM calcium acetate, 2.5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM Tris, pH 7.10, and filter sterilized using a 0.22-μm syringe into a sterile polyethylene container. The reaction was carried out at 30°C, and heparin lyase I (60 units) was added at three times (0, 19, and 48 h). A portion of this aliquot was used to monitor the reaction by diluting it in 1 ml of 0.03 M HCl and measuring the absorbance at 232 nm. When the reaction reached 10% digestion (96 h), the mixture was removed from the water bath and heated to 100°C for 2 min. The depolymerized heparin sample contains oligosaccharides of various sizes as well as buffer salts. The sample, containing 10 g of depolymerized heparin, was pressure filtered in 2-100 ml volumes. A controlled pore 10,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane using a 200 ml stirred pressure filtration cell was used with an N2 gas pressure of 35 p.s.i. Pressure filtration concentrated the retentate to a 20-ml volume. This volume was readjusted to 100 ml with deionized distilled water, and pressure filtration was repeated 3 times. Both the retentate (40 ml) and the filtrate (640 ml) were collected and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried retentate (oligosaccharides >10,000) was salt free and contained approximately two-thirds the oligosaccharide mass. The filtrate (oligosaccharides <10,000) contained buffer salts, and it was assumed to contain the remaining one-third of the oligosaccharide mass. Gradient PAGE confirmed that these two fractions were mixtures of oligosaccharides with the molecular weight dispersions expected (21Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight heparin oligosaccharides (Mr <10,000) obtained from pressure filtration were fractionated on a Sephadex G-50 (superfine) column (4.8 cm × 1 m) eluted with 200 mM sodium chloride at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Oligosaccharide mixture (750 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized, distilled water and applied to this column, and 200 fractions were collected (10 ml/tube) and absorbance was measured at 232 nm. The fraction number was plotted versus absorbance affording a chromatograph that showed a partial separation of disaccharide through tetradecasaccharides. This separation was repeated 4 times giving a reproducible profile that permitted the combination of like fractions. Three fractions, consisting of hexasaccharides, octasaccharides, and decasaccharides were collected, and each fraction was evaporated to dryness. The sized oligosaccharide mixtures were desalted by GPC on Bio-Gel P-2 column (5 cm × 0.5 m) eluted with water at 6 ml/min. The eluent was collected, and the fractions containing oligosaccharides having absorbance at 232 nm were combined. The volume was reduced using a rotary-evaporator, and the samples were freeze-dried. The desalted, sized oligosaccharide mixtures were light yellow colored powders and were stored at −60°C. Gradient PAGE confirmed the oligosaccharide size in each mixture (21Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Charge separation of sized oligosaccharide fractions was carried out by semi-preparative SAX-HPLC using a linear gradient of sodium chloride at pH 3.5. The column was pre-equilibrated with 0.2 M sodium chloride, pH 3.5. The desalted oligosaccharide mixture (50-100 mg) was applied and eluted using a 180-min linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.9 M sodium chloride, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 232 nm at 0.5-1.0 absorbance units full scale. After each separation, the column was washed with 2.0 M sodium chloride, followed by a water wash and reequilibrated with 0.2 M sodium chloride solution of pH 3.5. Each sized oligosaccharide mixture was applied multiple times to the same column, and each resulted in nearly identical elution profiles. The major peaks were pooled, freeze-dried and desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 column. Each peak, corresponding primarily to a single oligosaccharide (as demonstrated by analytical SAX-HPLC performed at this stage in the purification) was again applied to the semi-preparative SAX-HPLC column (using a newly optimized gradient), and its fractionation and desalting was repeated. From 10 gm of heparin, 9.7, 4.0, and 5.4 mg of oligosaccharides 1, 2, and 3 were obtained. Each purified oligosaccharide was freeze-dried and stored at −60°C. Purified oligosaccharides were analyzed by analytical SAX-HPLC to confirm their purity. The SAX-HPLC column was equilibrated with 0.2 M sodium chloride at pH 3.5. Each oligosaccharide sample (10-100 μg) was analyzed using a 120-min linear gradient of 0.2-2 M sodium chloride at pH 3.5 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 232 nm at 0.02 absorbance units full scale. Sample purity was confirmed by the presence of a single symmetrical peak. The purity of each oligosaccharide was confirmed by the presence of a single symmetrical peak on analysis using CE. The sample was separated and analyzed using a freshly prepared fused silica capillary (75 μm i.d., 375 μm o.d., 65 cm long). Reverse polarity analyses were carried out for 25 min at 18 kV using 20 mM phosphoric acid buffer adjusted to pH 3.48 with a saturated solution of dibasic sodium phosphate (25Pervin A. Al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The pure oligosaccharide samples were dissolved in 2H2O (99.9%) filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and freeze dried to remove exchangeable protons. After exchanging the sample three times, the sample was dissolved in 2H2O (99.996 atom %) containing 0.03% 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanoic acid sodium salt as internal reference. 1D 1H NMR experiments were performed on 5-mm broad band probe with standard Varian software at 298 K on 700 μl samples at 1-6 mM. Spectral width/block size were 6 K and 48 K, respectively. Chemical shifts were determined relative to the internal reference. Proton assignments for all of the heparin oligosaccharides were made from 2D COSY and multiple relayed COSY experiments carried out using standard Varian software at 298 K. The number of the data points in F1 and F2 dimensions were 512 and 2048, respectively, and were obtained with 32 scans. The free induction decays were Fourier transformed onto a data matrix of 2 × 1 K with a phase-shifted sine-bell window function (26Linhardt R.J. Wang H. Loganathan D. Bae J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2380-2387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NOESY experiments used a π/2-t1 -π/2-τm - π/2-FID pulse program with 512 F1 increments and with 2048 data points for F2 acquired with 32 scans. The free induction decays were Fourier transformed onto a data matrix of 2 × 1 K with a phase-shifted sine-bell window function. The mixing times were 150-500 ms with the strongest nuclear Overhauser effects observed at a mixing time of 300 ms. Calorimetric data were collected at 25°C, and the instrument was calibrated as described previously (27Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For all titrations, ten 10-μl injections of decasaccharide (0.5 mM) were pipetted automatically into the reaction cell containing 1 ml of the 20 μM ATIII in buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, at 250 s intervals from a 100-μl syringe while stirring at 75 rpm. In all experiments, the thermal reference cell contained 1 ml of water. Integration of the thermogram peaks was carried out using the software supplied with the calorimeter (Hart Scientific). The total corrected heats were obtained after subtraction of the control heats of dilution for the ligand at each injection. In all control experiments, the ligand was simply diluted into buffer with ATIII omitted. The corrected heats were fitted using a non-linear least squares algorithm that minimized the sum of squared residuals while varying ΔH, n, and Ka as described previously (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar, 29Connelly P.R. Varadarajan R. Sturtevant J.M. Richards F.M.

Oligosaccharide structures were examined using enzymes of known specificity to confirm the structures deduced by NMR spectroscopy. Oligosaccharides were further treated with heparin lyases I, II, and III, and the products formed were analyzed by CE. The identity of the oligosaccharide products were identified by co-migration with oligosaccharides that had already been characterized in our laboratory (21Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Each oligosaccharide sample (three vials each containing 50 μg in 40 μl of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was treated overnight with 50 m-units of heparin lyase I, heparin lyase II or heparin lyase III at 30°C. After reaction completion, each sample was heated at 100°C for 1 min to inactivate the enzymes. The oligosaccharides were converted into their disaccharide, tetrasaccharide, or hexasaccharide components depending on their structure and the specificity (31Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J.

Porcine intestinal mucosal heparin was treated with heparin lyase I, and the reaction was terminated prior to its completion. The oligosaccharide products formed when 10% of the heparin lyase I susceptible linkages had been cut was rich in hexasaccharide, octasaccharide, and decasaccharide components and contained approximately 95% of the heparin anti-factor Xa activity but <30% of the heparin anti-factor IIa activity (24Linhardt R.J. Grant A. Cooney C.L. Langer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7310-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, while most ATIII binding sites were intact (Fig. 1), they were primarily in oligosaccharides smaller than the hexadecasaccharides required for anti-factor IIa activity (5Bourin M.-C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Fractionation of this oligosaccharide mixture by gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 2a) affords sized oligosaccharide fractions. The hexasaccharide, octasaccharide, and decasaccharide fractions, expected to contain intact pentasaccharide ATIII-binding sites, were collected, desalted, and fractionated by SAX-HPLC. The chromatographs obtained (Fig. 2b) contained multiple peaks. Each was collected, desalted, and freeze-dried. SAX-HPLC, using a shallow salt gradient, was used to purify each fraction to homogeneity. Oligosaccharide purity was assessed at 90% or greater using analytical SAX-HPLC and reversed polarity CE. NMR spectroscopy was next used to determine the structure of oligosaccharides 1, 2, and 3. 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy of each purified oligosaccharide was used as a preliminary means to locate the potential ATIII-binding site containing oligosaccharides through the presence of a triplet at ∼4.5 ppm, characteristic of the signal for the H-3 of the critical GlcNpS3S6S residue (Fig. 3). Three such oligosaccharides, corresponding to peaks 1, 2 and 3 (see Fig. 2 legend), were obtained.Table II.Chemical shifts (ppm) and coupling constants (Hz) of ATIII binding site octasaccharide (2)ΔUAp2SGlcNpS6SIdoApGlcNpAc6SGlcApGlcNpS3S6SIdoAp2SGlcNpS6SH-15.5085.4225.0095.3864.6345.4555.2025.347J1,22.03.4<13.98.03.3<13.7H-24.6263.2933.7843.9313.3843.4544.3293.254J2,3<110.73.710.49.410.37.010.6H-34.3173.6434.1113.7873.6884.5084.2143.650J3,44.39.94.3NDbND, not determined because of overlap with other peaks.9.29.3ND9.5H-45.9893.8334.2223.7843.7844.0214.0743.757J4,59.0ND9.28.69.32.910.4H-5−a−, not present.4.0654.7564.1193.7574.3214.7564.110J5,6a4.54.54.34.3H-6a−4.343−4.328−4.432−4.411J6a,6bNDbND, not determined because of overlap with other peaks.ND−11.5−11.5H-6b−4.22−4.22−4.32−4.32J5,6b8.98.18.59.1N-acetyl methyl−−−2.048−−−−a −, not present.b ND, not determined because of overlap with other peaks. Open table in a new tab The 1D spectra of 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 3) showed that each oligosaccharide contained a single IdoAp (H-1, 5.0 ppm), GlcAp (H-1, 4.7 ppm), and ΔUAp2S (H-1, 5.5 ppm) residue. Octasaccharide 2 and decasaccharide 3 showed an anomeric signal at 5.2-5.3 ppm with an integration of 1H and 2H, demonstrating the presence of one and two IdoAp2S residues, respectively. The integrals of the H-1 signals, corresponding to the GlcNp residues (5.3-5.5 ppm) were 3H, 4H, and 5H for oligosaccharides 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Thus, the 1D 500 MHz spectra (Fig. 3) show 6, 8, and 10 anomeric (H-1) signals, indicating that 1, 2, and 3 are a hexasaccharide, octasaccharide, and decasaccharide, respectively. Failure to observe additional, extraneous, anomeric (H-1) signals confirmed the high level of purity of these three oligosaccharides. 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy was next used to assign each 1D spectra and establish the structure of these three purified oligosaccharides. Since the cross-peaks observed in 2D 1H multiple relayed COSY are due to indirect scaler (through-bond) coupling, the spin system present in each saccharide residue can be assigned. The position of the saccharide residues (sequence) were established by NOESY. Here the cross-peaks result from dipolar (through-space) coupling of spatially adjacent nuclei. COSY and NOESY spectra for octasaccharide 2 and decasaccharide 3 are presented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5. 2D-relayed COSY, taken using a 32-msec mixing time, was used to determine positions of the sulfate groups of the critical GlcNpS3S6S residue in octasaccharide 2 and decasaccharide 3. The structure of this saccharide was unambiguously established by H"

Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulates the expression of the SERCA1 isoform, which is essential for fast skeletal muscle fiber phenotype. We have cloned and studied the first 962 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the rat SERCA1 gene. This sequence was tested for T3-regulated expression in transient transfection experiments using COS7 cells and for binding of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) α in mobility shift assays. A construct of the 5′-flanking region and a reporter gene was unresponsive to T3 in the absence of co-transfected thyroid hormone receptor. In the presence of TRα, a T3 induction ratio of almost 4.0 was found, and this induction ratio was doubled with co-transfection of an RXR expression plasmid. Analysis of progressive 5′-deletion fragments of the sequence indicated multiple regions involved in T3 responsiveness. Three regions, R1, R2, and R3, were identified that bound TR complexes in mobility shift assays and conferred T3 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. The most potent of these thyroid hormone response elements, R3, increased the 2-fold background T3 stimulation of the thymidine kinase promoter to nearly 6-fold. Detailed analysis of this element showed that four TR-binding half-sites, comprising two independent thyroid hormone response elements, interact cooperatively to give the maximal T3 response. T3 regulation of SERCA1 expression is mediated by a complex thyroid hormone response element that may serve to provide a greater range of response in interaction with nuclear receptor partners or cell-specific transcription factors.

https://openalex.org/W2067127415,"The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates the transfer of high density lipoprotein cholesteryl esters to other lipoproteins and appears to be a key regulated component of reverse cholesterol transport. Earlier studies showed that a CETP transgene containing natural flanking sequences (−3.4 kilobase pairs (kbp) upstream, +2.2 kbp downstream) was expressed in an authentic tissue distribution and induced in liver and other tissues in response to dietary or endogenous hypercholesterolemia. In order to localize the DNA elements responsible for these effects, we prepared transgenic mice expressing six new DNA constructs containing different amounts of natural flanking sequence of the CETP gene. Tissue-specific expression and dietary cholesterol response of CETP mRNA were determined. The native pattern of predominant expression in liver and spleen with cholesterol induction was shown by a −3.4 (5′), +0.2 (3′) kbp transgene, indicating no major contribution of distal 3′-sequences. Serial 5′-deletions showed that a −570 base pairs (bp) transgene gave predominant expression in small intestine with cholesterol induction of CETP mRNA in that organ, and a −370 bp transgene gave highest expression in adrenal gland with partial dietary cholesterol induction of CETP mRNA and plasma activity. Further deletion to −138 bp 5′-flanking sequence resulted in a transgene that was not expressed in vivo. Both the −3.4 kbp and −138 bp transgenes were expressed when transfected into a cultured murine hepatocyte cell line, but only the former was induced by treating the cells with LDL. When linked to a human apoA-I transgene, the −570 to −138 segment of the CETP gene promoter gave rise to a relative positive response of hepatic apoA-I mRNA to the high cholesterol diet in two out of three transgenic lines. Thus, 5′-elements between −3,400 and −570 bp in the CETP promoter endow predominant expression in liver and spleen. Elements between −570 and −370 are required for expression in small intestine and some other tissues, and elements between −370 and −138 contribute to adrenal expression. The minimal CETP promoter element associated with a positive sterol response in vivo was found in the proximal CETP gene promoter between −370 and −138 bp. This region contains a tandem repeat of a sequence known to mediate sterol down-regulation of the HMG-CoA reductase gene, suggesting either the presence of separate positive and negative sterol response elements in this region or the use of a common DNA element for both positive and negative sterol responses.

https://openalex.org/W1970941018,"Bax, a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, has been shown to accelerate apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal, γ-irradiation, and the chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide. The mechanism by which Bax promotes apoptosis is poorly understood. Bax forms homodimers which have been suggested to act as accelerators or inducers of cell death. However, the requirement for homodimerization of Bax to promote cell death remains unclear. We performed site-directed mutagenesis of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 in Bax to determine the regions of Bax required for homodimerization and to define the role of Bax homodimers in cell death induced by chemotherapy drugs. Bax proteins expressing alanine substitutions of the highly conserved amino acids glycine 108 (G108) in BH1, tryptophan 158 (W158) in BH2, and glycine 67 and aspartic acid 68 (GD67-68) in BH3 as well as deletion of the most conserved amino acids in BH1 (Δ102-112) and BH2 (Δ151-159) and deletion of BH3 (Δ63-71) maintained their ability to accelerate chemotherapy-induced cell death. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Bax with deletions in BH1 and BH2 still associated with wild-type Bax while deletion of BH3 disrupted Bax homodimerization. These results demonstrate that Bax does not require the conserved regions of homology, BH1, BH2, or BH3, to accelerate chemotherapy-induced cell death. Furthermore, our results established BH3 as a region required for Bax homodimerization in mammalian cells and demonstrate that monomeric forms of Bax are active in accelerating cell death induced by chemotherapy agents."

A monoclonal antibody specific for a mucin sugar epitope and a polyclonal serum directed to peptide epitopes in a MUC gene-encoded recombinant protein, detected identical bands in three out of seven strains of T. cruzi. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed these results. When expressed in eukaryotic cells, the MUC gene product is post-translationally modified, most likely, through extensive O-glycosylation. Gene sequencing showed that the central domains encoding the repeated sequences with the consensus T8KP2, varies in number from 1 to 10, and the number of Thr residues in each repeat could be 7, 8, or 10. A run of 16 to 18 Thr residues was present in some, but not all, MUC gene-derived sequences. Direct compositional analysis of mucin core proteins showed that Thr residues are much more frequent than Ser residues. The same fact occurs in MUC gene-derived protein sequences. Molecular mass determinations of the 35-kDa glycoproteins further extend the heterogeneity of the family to the natural mucin molecules.

All parasite SA acceptors described so far in the TS reaction are glycoconjugates containing a Thr/Ser- and Pro-rich protein core (9Previato J.O. Jones C. Xavier M.T. Wait R. Travassos L.R.

The main SA acceptors in epimastigotes (insect vector replicative form of T. cruzi) and metacyclic forms (insect-derived infective stage) are mucin-type, glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, glycoproteins migrating in the 35-50-kDa range depending on the parasite strain (10Schenkman S.

Mucins of both developmental stages have different biological properties even though they are recognized by the same mAbs (12Mortara R.A. da Silva S. Araguth M.F. Blanco S.A. Yoshida N. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4673-4678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs directed to parasite mucins, as well as the purified glycoconjugates, inhibit entry of metacyclic forms into host cells (14Yoshida N. Mortara R. Araguth M.F. Gonzales J.C. Russo M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mucin carbohydrate structure is the same for both stages within the same strain, but they differ in the lipid nature of the GPI anchor (15Serrano A.A. Schenkman S. Yoshida N. Mehlert A. Richardson J.M. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27244-27253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the trypomastigote form (the cell-derived infective stage in the mammalian host), glycoproteins sharing the stage-specific epitope Ssp-3, which is dependent on parasite sialylation, are the main SA acceptors (8Schenkman S. Eichinger D. Pereira M.E.A. Nussenzweig V. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 499-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 11Schenkman S. Jiang M.-S. Hart G.W. Nussenzweig V.

These molecules migrate as a broad band of 60-200 kDa on SDS-PAGE and are involved in cell adhesion and invasion too. While oligosaccharides from epimastigotes and metacyclics mucins are similar even among different strains, they clearly differ from those Ssp-3-containing mucins of trypomastigotes, even in the same strain (5Almeida I.C.

We have recently identified in T. cruzi genes whose overall structure resembles those coding for mammalian mucins (16Reyes M.B. Pollevick G.D. Frasch A.C.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). T. cruzi mucin-like genes are characterized by a highly polymorphic central domain flanked by conserved 5′ and 3′ regions. Central domains are rich in codons for Thr and Pro residues organized in tandems of variable number of repeat units coding for the consensus sequence T8KP2. Other genes have central domains rich in codons for Thr, Ser, and Pro residues that are not organized in tandem repeats. Although these results point to the existence of a highly variable family of these genes in T. cruzi, there has been so far no biochemical association between the identified gene family and mucin-type glycoproteins. In this paper we present evidence that the products encoded by the putative mucin gene family are indeed the core proteins of T. cruzi mucin-type glycoproteins, and that diversity among these genes and glycoproteins is greater than previously thought. T. cruzi epimastigotes were grown in brain heart infusion (BHT) medium (18Cazzulo J.J. Franke de Cazzulo B.M. Engel J.C. Cannata J.J.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To purify mucin glycoproteins, BHT was supplemented with 10 mg/ml hemin and used without fetal calf serum, as described previously (13Previato J.O. Jones C. Gonçalves L.P.B. Wait R. Travassos L.R.

The pAT vector is derived from pKG5 (a gift from Dr. Keith Gould) and contains a 250-base pair fragment encoding the peptide signal and 39 amino acids from the N-terminal of the mature antithrombin III (27Prochownik E.V. Markham A.F. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8389-8394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vector pKG5 contains the pBR322 replication origin, the ampicillin resistance gene, the neomycin resistance gene expressed from the thymidine kinase promoter, and a polylinker downstream of the SV40 early promoter. Both chimeras were introduced in Vero cells by the calcium phosphate procedure (28Graham F.L. Van Der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) or in E. coli by calcium chloride method, respectively (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In the case of transfected Vero cells, after 10 days of drug selection, neomycin-resistant colonies were pooled and seeded in 75-cm2 flasks. For Western blot experiments, cells were grown on 10-cm plates. Parasites were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 50 μM E64 and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), at a density of 106 parasites/μl. Lysates were extracted for 30 min on ice and then mixed with reducing cracking buffer before loading on gels. About 5 × 107 epimastigotes or 108 cell-derived or metacyclic trypomastigotes were loaded on each lane. Vero cells were scraped from culture plates (about 6 × 106 cells/plate) and directly dissolved in reducing cracking buffer with DNase (100 μg/ml). In all cases, conventional SDS-PAGE was performed (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) on 10% polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Life Technologies, Inc.), reacted with the appropriate antisera, and developed with 125I-Protein A (DuPont NEN). mAb 10D8 is a monoclonal antibody directed to a carbohydrate epitope on the 35-50-kDa parasite mucins, kindly provided by Dr. Nobuko Yoshida (12Mortara R.A. da Silva S.

Anti-SAPA is a polyclonal serum raised in rabbit against the repeat-containing region of the SAPA protein (26Pollevick G.O. Affranchino J.L. Frasch A.C.C. Sánchez D.O. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) expressed in pGEX-1 (Pharmacia). Epimastigotes of the CA-1/72 cloned stock of T. cruzi were resuspended in lysis buffer at a final density of 108 parasites/ml and incubated for 30 min on ice. The lysate was then clarified for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and aliquots of 1 ml were incubated for 2 h with 1/50 dilution of mAb 10D8. Immunoconjugates were precipitated using Protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) following standard protocols (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blot. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using 100 ng of total genomic DNA of Y, CL-Brener, Tulahuén M, or Tulahuén 0 as template with oligonucleotides P1 and P2 as described previously (17Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resulting products were cloned in EcoRV-digested pBluescript KS(+) II (Stratagene) or pT7Blue (Novagen) and sequenced using synthetic primers by the dideoxy chain termination method (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) with a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemicals). Frozen epimastigotes forms, grown without fetal calf serum, were thawed, extracted with cold water, and centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was extracted with 45% (v/v) aqueous phenol at 75°C. The aqueous layer was dialyzed, freeze-dried, dissolved in water, and applied to a column (2 × 100 cm) of Bio-Gel P-100 (100-200 mesh). The excluded material was lyophilized, extracted three times with chloroform, methanol, water (10:10:3, v/v/v), and then boiled in 80% aqueous ethanol. The resulting insoluble product was dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), containing 0.9% NaCl, and applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column (1.5 × 30 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The bound material was eluted with 0.1 M methyl-α-D-mannopyranoside followed by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-6 DG column (2.5 × 100 cm) (33Previato J.O. Andrade A.F.B. Pessolani M.C.M. Mendoça-Previato L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The mucin-like glycoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15% acrylamide gel and stained by the periodate Schiff reagent (34Fairbanks G. Stek T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6171) Google Scholar). Mucin-like glycoproteins were analyzed for neutral sugars, N-acetylated amino sugars, phosphorus, and lipids, as described previously (9Previato J.O. Jones C. Xavier M.T. Wait R. Travassos L.R. Parodi A.J. Mendoça-Previato L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7241-7250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis of mucin-like glycoproteins was determined after acid hydrolysis in 5.6 N HCl, 110°C, 22 h, in an autoanalyzer by the method of Fauconnet and Rochemont (35Fauconnet M. Rochemont J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF-MS) was performed to mucin-like glycoproteins of Y, CL, G, and Tulahuén strains. The positive and negative ion MALDI/TOF mass spectra were obtained for solution (2 μg/μl H2O/CH3CN, 7:3) of the mucin-like glycoprotein samples, diluted 1:10 in a solution (10 mg/ml H2O/CH3CN, 7:3) of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. One μl of this solution was deposed on the target and evaporated before analysis. Spectra were recorded with a Finnigan Mat Vision 2000 time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with a viewing unit, in the linear mode with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV. Laser was pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) with an irradiation time of about 3 ns. In a previous work we have described a putative mucin gene family, which we called MUC-like genes in analogy with MUC genes from mucins in vertebrates (17Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To identify the products of these genes we have now used an antiserum directed against a recombinant protein (anti-MUC.M/76) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb 10D8) specific for a carbohydrate epitope present in T. cruzi mucins (see “Materials and Methods”). Western blots of T. cruzi cell extracts from different parasite strains, as well as from the epimastigote, trypomastigote, and metacyclic forms, from a single parasite cloned stock, were probed with both antisera. Three out of seven T. cruzi strains or cloned stocks analyzed (CA-1/72, SylvioX-10/7, and Tulahuén 0) gave positive signals with both antibodies (Fig. 1 and not shown). The main signals obtained with anti-MUC.M/76 correspond with the bands detected by mAb 10D8. These broad bands are all in the range from 35 to 50 kDa, with small differences between strains. Both antibodies failed to detect 35-50 kDa bands in strains Y, CL-Brener, and RA (Fig. 1 and not shown). Strain Tulahuén M was the only case in which there was a positive signal with anti-MUC.M/76, but not with the mAb 10D8 (not shown). In these experiments, filters probed with anti-MUC.M/76 were exposed 10 times longer than those probed with mAb 10D8 to achieve the same signal intensities. Longer exposures of Western blots probed with anti-peptide antibodies are expected since most amino acid epitopes in mucins are shielded by their O-linked oligosaccharides. Yoshida and co-workers (12Mortara R.A. da Silva S. Araguth M.F. Blanco S.A. Yoshida N. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4673-4678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that mAb 10D8 recognize the same 35-50-kDa mucin bands in epimastigote and metacyclic stages of T. cruzi and that these molecules are absent in bloodstream trypomastigote stage. So, we probed these three stages of the parasite with mAb 10D8 and anti-MUC.M/76. As can be seen in Fig. 2, both antibodies detected the same bands in extracts obtained from epimastigotes and metacyclic forms of the SylvioX/10 strain, but not in cell-derived trypomastigote extracts (Fig. 2). A further indication that antibodies directed to the carbohydrate and protein epitopes recognize the same T. cruzi molecules was obtained from immunoprecipitation experiments. A total parasite extract of epimastigotes from the cloned stock CA-1/72 was immunoprecipitated with mAb 10D8. The immunoprecipitates were run in SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with anti-MUC.M/76. mAb 10D8-immunoprecipitated molecules were recognized with anti-MUC.M/76 serum. (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In a control experiment, mAb 10D8 was used to probe the Western blots of the immunoprecipitated material (Fig. 3B). In both cases, the immunoprecipitated bands coincided with those detected in total lysate (Fig. 3, lanes 3). We conclude from these experiments that 10D8, a mAb specific for a carbohydrate epitope in a biochemically characterized group of T. cruzi mucins, and anti-MUC.M/76, a serum directed to a protein encoded by a MUC-like gene family member, recognize the same parasite glycoconjugates. As further evidence that MUC-like genes encode potentially glycosylatable proteins, we expressed MUC.M/76 gene in eukaryotic cells. Two DNA constructs were made, one for control expression in E. coli and the other for expression in Vero cells. Both constructs contained an open reading frame with the Thr/Pro-rich amino acid repeat domain and the C terminus from the putative T. cruzi mucin gene MUC.M/76. These sequences are preceded by an in frame molecular tag made up of the highly antigenic amino acid repeats (SAPA) from the trans-sialidase gene (26Pollevick G.O. Affranchino J.L. Frasch A.C.C. Sánchez D.O. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This tag was included to allow detection, in short times of exposure, of the expressed product in Vero cells. Three different experimental results showed that the proteins expressed in Vero cells were modified as compared with the one expressed from the same DNA sequence in E. coli. First, antibodies directed to the tag detected the expected protein product both in bacteria and in Vero cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4). However, the product in Vero cells has a considerably larger size and runs as a diffuse band, as expected for a highly glycosylated protein. Second, antiserum against the recombinant MUC.M/76 protein detected the protein expressed in bacterial extracts but not the one in transfected Vero cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4). This result is expected if the protein epitopes are not accessible to the antibodies. Third, the protein expressed in Vero cells, but not the one in E. coli, remains in the aqueous phase after phenol extraction (Fig. 5), a method commonly used to isolate mucins. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that, in mammalian cells, this T. cruzi mucin core protein is highly glycosylated.Fig. 5Phenolic extraction of MUC.M/76 expressed in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. A, E. coli expressing recombinant MUC.M/76-SAPA (lane 1, aqueous phase of phenolic extraction corresponding to 10 times more cells than lane 2; lane 2, total lysate).

Both panels were probed with anti-SAPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown the existence of two different types of mucin genes in different strains of T. cruzi (17Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One group whose central domain is composed of repetitive elements and a second group with nonrepetitive central domains. Interestingly, all those strains which were shown to have genes with repeats (from Southern blot or sequence data, 17Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and not shown) were recognized in Western blots by mAb 10D8 and anti-MUC.M/76. On the contrary, those strains which do not seem to have repeat-containing mucin genes were negative in Western blots. To investigate whether there was a correlation between having Thr/Pro-rich repeats and a specific glycosylation pattern containing the 10D8 epitope, we further studied genes from some strains that did not react with both sera. Taking advantage of the conserved nature of the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of this gene family, we used primers annealing to those regions in polymerase chain reactions with genomic DNA as template. We identified and sequenced open reading frames from Y, Tulahuén M, CL-Brener, and Tulahuén 0 strains. Fig. 6 shows a comparative scheme of the proteins deduced from these genes with their relevant features. As can be seen, they do contain amino acid repeats rich in Thr and Pro. Consequently, we might exclude that detection of the same parasite products by mAb 10D8 and anti-MUC.M/76 can be due to any correspondence between repeat-containing genes and the 10D8 epitope. Nevertheless, except for Tulahuén 0 gene (MUC.T0-1) which is very similar to MUC.M/76 gene, they have striking differences which make them unique. All isolated genes have a central region coding for a high number of potentially O-glycosylatable threonine residues organized in tandems of repeats, flanked by conserved 5′ and 3′ regions. Y strain gene (MUC.Y-1) has three repeat units in its central domain differing in the number of Thr residues (Fig. 6), at variance with most of the repeat-containing genes sequenced so far which have the consensus T8KP2. After the repeat units, MUC.Y-1 has a run of 16 Thr residues, that is not present in any previous sequences reported so far. Tulahuén M gene (MUC.TM-1) has a single canonical repeat, followed by a run of 18 Thr and 1 Ser. Finally, the gene from CL-Brener (MUC.CL-1) has one repeat with 7 Thr residues, one with 8 Thr, and a run of 17 Thr interrupted by 1 Ala. It is clear from these results that mucin gene diversity among T. cruzi strains is really much more considerable than described before (17Di Noia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blot probing of some strains, looking for the mAb 10D8 epitope, showed the occurrence of nonreacting strains (see above). In order to obtain further information about the nature and diversity of mucin products in these nonreacting strains, we analyzed purified mucin-type glycoproteins by MALDI/TOF-MS. We also determined the amino acid and sugar composition of these glycoproteins purified from Y and G strains, whose oligosaccharides and TS acceptor nature have been already described (9Previato J.O.

Although they possess common tertiary structures, they bind different RNA stem loops and thus provide useful models of specific protein-RNA recognition. Although the RNA-binding site of MS2 coat protein has been extensively characterized previously, little is known about Qβ. Here we describe the isolation of mutants that define the RNA-binding site of Qβ coat protein, showing that, as with MS2, it resides on the surface of a large β-sheet. Mutations are also described that convert Qβ coat protein to the RNA binding specificity of MS2. The results of these and other studies indicate that, although they bind different RNAs, the binding sites of the two coat proteins are sufficiently similar that each is easily converted by mutation to the RNA binding specificity of the other. The coat proteins of the RNA bacteriophages Qβ and MS2 are specific RNA binding proteins. Although they possess common tertiary structures, they bind different RNA stem loops and thus provide useful models of specific protein-RNA recognition.

INTRODUCTIONThe coat proteins of the RNA bacteriophages play dual roles in the viral life cycle. In addition to serving as the major structural proteins of the virus particles, they act as translational repressors of viral replicase synthesis. This latter function is the result of coat protein interaction with an RNA stem loop which contains the replicase ribosome-binding site. The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 is the most intensively studied of the RNA phage coat proteins. Its binding target on viral RNA has been thoroughly characterized (1Romaniuk P.J. Olwary P.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), coat protein itself has been subjected to detailed genetic analysis of its RNA binding function (2Peabody D.S. J. Biol.

The coat proteins of related phages are less well characterized, but, since some bind different RNAs, they provide opportunities to understand the basis of RNA binding specificity. The RNA binding targets of the coat proteins of MS2 and Qβ are shown in Fig. 1. The two coat proteins are about 25% identical in amino acid sequence and possess highly similar tertiary structures. Thus they utilize a common structural framework to bind structurally distinct RNAs.We previously reported genetic analyses of the MS2 coat protein RNA-binding site utilizing a two-plasmid system in which coat protein expressed from one plasmid (pCT119) translationally represses synthesis of a replicase-β-galactosidase fusion protein from the second plasmid (pRZ5). We constructed an equivalent two-plasmid system for Qβ coat protein in order to similarly dissect its RNA-binding site. Here we describe this system and its application in identifying amino acid residues important for the interaction of Qβ coat protein with its RNA. We also describe the isolation and characterization of specificity mutations that confer to Qβ coat protein the ability to bind the MS2 translational operator.DISCUSSIONOur genetic approach to dissection of the Qβ RNA-binding site relies on translationally repressing the synthesis of a hybrid replicase-β-galactosidase protein. We initially constructed pRZQ for this purpose. It contains a synthetic version of the wild-type Qβ operator. Unfortunately, pRZQ was not susceptible to efficient translational repression by Qβ coat protein expressed from pQCT119. We did not know how to explain this behavior, but noticed the presence of two AUG triplets (at −9 and −4 in Fig. 1B) in addition to the replicase initiation codon (at +1). Since translational repression is the result of competition between coat protein and ribosomes for binding of the operator RNA, we speculated that the extra AUGs might somehow tip the balance in favor of ribosome binding. This was the reasoning behind the construction of pRZQ5, which contains nucleotide substitutions that preserve the required RNA secondary structure, but destroy the two extra AUGs (see Fig. 1). These changes confer the desired capacity for translational repression. This is not the result of any difference in affinity of the two operator RNAs for coat protein, since their binding behaviors in vitro are indistinguishable (Fig. 2).Do these observations imply that the extra AUGs are bound by ribosomes? N-terminal sequence analysis of the replicase protein suggests that the AUG at +1 is the bona fide translation initiation codon (19Weiner A.M. Platt T. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3242-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the AUG at −9 is in the replicase reading frame and could potentially lead to the synthesis of a protein three amino acids longer, we are unaware of any evidence for the existence of such an elongated product in Qβ-infected cells. Since pRZQ produces about 50% more β-galactosidase than pRZQ5 2F. Lim, M. Spingola, and D. S. Peabody, unpublished observations. it is possible that the −9 AUG is utilized for translation initiation in this system. On the other hand, the AUG at −4 cannot produce an elongated protein, since it resides in the −1 reading frame and is followed, after two codons, by a nonsense triplet. Since pRZQ5 simultaneously inactivates both of the extra AUGs, we cannot distinguish their relative contributions to inhibition of repression. Moreover, we do not know whether the behavior of pRZQ means that the operator is poorly repressed in intact Qβ RNA in infected cells. Placement of the operator in the unusual context of pRZQ may have altered its function, perhaps somehow making the extra AUGs more susceptible to ribosome binding.We previously reported the identification of amino acid residues making up the RNA binding site of MS2 coat protein. Their side chains reside on one surface of a large β-sheet. The location and make-up of the RNA-binding site was confirmed by the x-ray structure of the MS2 RNA-protein complex (7Valegard K. Murray J.B. Stockley P.G. Stonehouse N.J. Liljas L. Nature. 1994; 371: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the current study we applied a similar genetic strategy to identify the amino acid constituents of the Qβ RNA-binding site. Given that MS2 and Qβ coat proteins are evolutionary relatives and possess homologous amino acid sequences, we assumed that Qβ coat protein would have high structural similarity to MS2, and would probably utilize a similar β-sheet surface for RNA binding. These expectations were confirmed by the mutational analyses reported here and by the x-ray structure of Qβ coat protein which Lars Liljas and colleagues kindly made available to us while this manuscript was in preparation. Table I shows the nucleotide and amino acid substitutions that resulted in the repressor-defective phenotype. Table II and Fig. 4 show that these substitutions also caused defects in RNA binding in vitro. As with MS2, the RNA-binding site mainly resides on the surface of the coat protein β-sheet, although some loop residues are also implicated. Most of the essential Qβ amino acids occupy positions that are structurally equivalent to important RNA-binding site residues of MS2 coat protein. The degree of conservation of these residues is shown in Table I which lists, in parentheses, the equivalent MS2 residues in those cases where a clear structural homologue is readily identified. Nearly all these amino acids are conserved between the two proteins. Fig. 5B shows the locations of the amino acid residues identified by genetic analysis as important for RNA binding by MS2 coat protein. A similar map of the Qβ-binding site, based on the studies reported here, is shown in Fig. 5A. Fig. 5C is a superposition of Fig. 5, A and B, and shows the degree of amino acid identity in residues required for RNA binding by the two proteins. The conserved aspects of the two sites may represent portions of coat protein structure required for binding of structurally similar parts of the operators.It is possible, for several reasons, that the Qβ RNA-binding site includes residues not identified by this analysis. For example, some types of mutations could be absent in our mutational library. However, sequence analysis of 32 mutations in 21 repressor-defective assembly-defective mutants revealed a wide spectrum of different substitution types (not shown). Therefore, it seems unlikely that any amino acid residue whose identity is crucial for RNA binding is missing from this analysis, but, of course, we cannot rule out the possible existence of mutational cold spots which would lead to under-representation of certain mutants. It is also possible that certain residues play a dual role, functioning both in RNA binding and in protein folding or stability. Mutants with substitutions at these sites will not have passed our screen for capsid formation. Although we obtained multiple isolates of all but one of the repressor-defective mutants, it is also possible that the mutant library contains repressor defects not yet isolated. For these reasons the RNA-binding site could be more extensive than is indicated by the present set of repressor-defective mutations.Unconserved amino acids within the two binding sites presumably account for their differing RNA binding specificities. We isolated four specificity mutants of Qβ coat protein based on their abilities to repress the MS2 operator. Three of them contained multiple amino acid substitutions. This was a consequence of the high mutation rate of the error-prone PCR method we used in generating the mutant library. We restricted our analyses to residues 91 and 65. The D91N,A114G and T18S,N22Y,D91N mutants had only the D91N substitution in common, and, of the affected amino acids, Asp91 was the only one present on the surface of the β-sheet where the RNA-binding site resides. The single mutant D91N was constructed to test this assertion, and we found that the translational repressor activity of both of the original mutants was conferred by the D91N substitution alone (Table IV). Similarly, Q65H possessed the translational repressor properties of the T29S,Q65H double mutant. For these reasons only the D91N and Q65H single substitutions were characterized further. Both mutants possess slightly increased affinities for the normal binding target of Qβ coat protein, the Qβ translational operator. This is evident both in the translational repression data presented in Table IV and in the in vitro binding affinities of the proteins for Qβ operator RNA (Fig. 6 and Table V). Thus, D91N binds the Qβ operator 2-fold more tightly than does wild-type Qβ coat protein. Meanwhile, Q65H shows an 8-fold improvement in binding of this RNA. The most dramatic effects, however, are found in the increased affinities for the MS2 operator. D91N and Q65H, respectively, bind the MS2 operator RNA 20-fold and 33-fold more tightly than does wild-type Qβ coat protein.The effects of the D91N substitution are easily rationalized. Asp91 of Qβ coat protein occupies a position which is structurally homologous to Asn87 of MS2 coat protein. Genetic and structural studies identified Asn87 of MS2 as an important site of interaction with RNA (6Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9006-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Valegard K. Murray J.B. Stockley P.G. Stonehouse N.J. Liljas L. Nature. 1994; 371: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It forms a hydrogen bond with the −5 uridine residue in the MS2 operator. On the other hand, Asp91 of Qβ is apparently not required for binding of the Qβ operator, since no substitutions at this site were found in our extensive collection of repressor-defective Qβ coat mutants, and because the D91N substitution itself clearly does not impair binding to Qβ RNA. It is striking that converting Asp91 to its MS2 counterpart dramatically improves activity for the MS2 operator. In fact, Qβ-D91N binds MS2 RNA nearly as well as does MS2 coat protein itself. Clearly, the RNA binding surface of Qβ coat protein is sufficiently similar to that of MS2 that it readily accommodates MS2 RNA, and a single amino acid substitution converts Qβ coat protein to a good repressor of MS2.The effects of the Q65H substitution are not as easily understood. Gln65 in Qβ coat protein occupies a position which is structurally homologous to Thr59 of MS2. Substitutions like T59S or T59A result in repressor defects in MS2 coat protein (3Peabody D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9006-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the MS2 mutant T59Q is not repressor-defective for the MS2 operator.2 Although it is clear from the crystal structure of the MS2 coat protein-RNA complex that Thr59 makes contact with RNA, the contact apparently does not involve the side chain (7Valegard K. Murray J.B. Stockley P.G. Stonehouse N.J. Liljas L. Nature. 1994; 371: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The effects of the Q65H substitution on RNA binding by Qβ coat protein suggest that histidine in this position establishes new contacts with the two RNAs, substantially increasing affinity for both the Qβ and MS2 operators.We have shown that Qβ coat protein easily acquires binding activity for MS2 RNA by mutation. In work being reported elsewhere we show that MS2 coat protein acquires the ability to bind the Qβ operator with similar ease. Thus, the MS2 and Qβ coat proteins are sufficiently similar that their RNA-binding specificities are readily interconverted. Perhaps this is not unexpected given the similarities in the amino acid sequences of their RNA-binding sites. However, some may find it surprising that these similar proteins bind operators with the large apparent structural differences illustrated in Fig. 1. Compared to MS2, the Qβ operator requires a longer base paired stem, a smaller loop, and is relatively indifferent to deletion of the bulged A. In MS2 the critical nature of the bulge is easily reconciled with the structure of the protein-RNA complex where quasi-symmetric interactions between the two halves of the dimer and the As at −4 and −10 are observed. The amino acid residues (Val29, Thr45, Ser47, and Lys61) of MS2 coat protein that form the binding sites for these two As are conserved in Qβ, thus satisfying one of the important requirements for interaction with MS2 RNA. However, given the relative dispensability of the Qβ bulged A and the apparent difference in its spatial relationship to the loop A, the quasi-symmetry of these interactions is likely abolished in the Qβ coat protein-RNA complex. We suspect that the interaction of coat protein with the loop A is conserved between the two phages, but the interaction with the bulged A probably is not. Other contacts must be formed to compensate for this loss. The differences in makeup of the RNA-binding site of the two coat proteins presumably reflect this fact. On the other hand, the similarities of the binding sites might not reflect any significant similarities in the precise modes of interaction of the two RNAs with their respective coat proteins. Experiments currently in progress should determine whether the nature of the interaction with the loop A is a conserved feature in the RNA-protein complexes of MS2 and Qβ.

Optimal ligands are triantennary N-linked glycans which bind with a KD in the nanomolar range. Specificity and affinity of ligand binding are accomplished by the simultaneous interaction of at least three terminal ligand galactoses with three carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) and depend on the spatial organization of the CRDs in the functional receptor complex.The ASGP receptor is a noncovalent hetero-oligomer composed of two homologous polypeptides, generically called HL-1 (hepatic lectin 1) and HL-2, and in the human system H1 and H2. The subunits share 55% sequence identity and consist of an amino-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of 40 and 58 amino acids, respectively, followed by a transmembrane segment of ∼20 residues (4Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 44: 177-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The exoplasmic domain of ∼230 residues contains a carboxyl-terminal CRD of ∼150 amino acids that specifically binds terminal galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine with low affinity (KD in the millimolar range). Simultaneous expression of both subunits is necessary to generate high-affinity binding sites (5McPhaul M. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ligand-receptor cross-linking has revealed that two of the galactoses in the ligand specifically interact with HL-1 and the third with HL-2 (7Rice K.G. Weisz O.A. Barthel T. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18429-18434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding emphasizes the importance of the specific geometric arrangement of the CRDs in the receptor complex for ligand binding. Yet, the underlying hetero-oligomeric organization of the subunits is still poorly understood.Biochemical analyses of the receptor complex have not revealed the exact subunit composition. The ligand-receptor cross-linking experiments indicated a minimum of two HL-1 and one HL-2 subunits in the functional receptor complex (7Rice K.G. Weisz O.A. Barthel T. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. J. Biol.

Sedimentation analysis, gel filtration, radiation inactivation studies, and the relative expression levels (summarized in 8Lodish H.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 16: 374-377Scopus (102) Google Scholar) suggested oligomer sizes between 140 and 260 kDa, corresponding to 3-6 subunits, and a ratio of HL-1:HL-2 of 2-5:1. Chemical cross-linking of receptor subunits produced homodimers and homotrimers of HL-1 as well as heterodimers and heterotrimers (9Bischoff J. Libresco S. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on these results, a minimal model of the ASGP receptor was proposed consisting of a core trimer of HL-1 and an associated HL-2 subunit (8Lodish H.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 16: 374-377Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The polypeptide segment connecting the transmembrane anchor with the CRD contains heptad repeats (10Beavil A.J. Edmeades R.L.

Heptad repeats of the general type (abcdefg)n with hydrophobic residues at a and d positions and hydrophilic residues elsewhere are characteristic for proteins in which subunit oligomerization is mediated by α-helical coiled coils. The presence of heptad repeats in HL-1 and HL-2 suggested that this segment of the subunits is primarily responsible for the oligomerization of the ASGP receptor by forming a coiled coil stalk. In this study, we tested the ability of the stalk domains of the human ASGP receptor subunits, H1 and H2, to form α-helical coiled coil structure and determined their preferred oligomerization state and stoichiometry in vitro.

Heptad repeats of the general type (abcdefg)n with hydrophobic residues at a and d positions and hydrophilic residues elsewhere are characteristic for proteins in which subunit oligomerization is mediated by α-helical coiled coils. The presence of heptad repeats in HL-1 and HL-2 suggested that this segment of the subunits is primarily responsible for the oligomerization of the ASGP receptor by forming a coiled coil stalk. In this study, we tested the ability of the stalk domains of the human ASGP receptor subunits, H1 and H2, to form α-helical coiled coil structure and determined their preferred oligomerization state and stoichiometry in vitro. The results suggest that the functional receptor is a 2:2 heterotetramer."

The two Kdo residues and their linkages appear to be identical in both species. The linkages of heptose in E. coli and of mannose in R. leguminosarum to Kdo are both α1-5. We now characterize a membrane-associated glycosyl transferase in R. leguminosarum extracts that incorporates mannose into nascent lipopolysaccharide, using Kdo2-lipid IVA as the acceptor and GDP-mannose (or synthetic ADP-mannose) as the donor. The mannosyl transferase is associated with the inner membrane. The apparent Km values for GDP-mannose and Kdo2-lipid IVA are 4.3 μM and 7.1 μM, respectively, in the presence of excess co-substrate. Extracts of E. coli do not catalyze GDP-mannose-dependent glycosylation of Kdo2-lipid IVA, but they are active when ADP-mannose is substituted for GDP-mannose. Given the structural similarity of ADP-mannose to ADP-heptose, we examined the possibility that heptosyl transferase I of E. coli (the product of the rfaC gene) catalyzes mannose transfer from ADP-mannose to Kdo2-lipid IVA.

INTRODUCTIONHuman insulin-like growth factor I (hIGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: hIGF-Ihuman insulin-like growth factor IIGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor IGSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionTTRtransthyretinP1 and P2promoters 1 and 2, respectively. is a small basic polypeptide of 70 amino acids, which plays an important role in postnatal development. hIGF-I mediates the growth and differentiation promoting effects of growth hormone (1Daughaday W.H. Hall K. Raben M.S. Salmon W.D. Van den Brande J.L. Van Wyk J.J. Nature. 1972; 235: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Growth hormone is the main regulator of IGF-I gene expression and regulates its expression at the transcriptional level (2Mathews L.S. Norstedt G. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9343-9347Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). IGF-I is expressed by many tissues during development; however, postnatally expression is mainly restricted to liver tissue (3Froesch E.R. Schmid C. Schwander J. Zapf J. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 443-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During puberty and adulthood, the liver is the main endocrine source of circulating IGF-I.The hIGF-I gene is a complex transcriptional unit. The gene consists of six exons together spanning more than 90 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence (4De Pagter-Holthuizen P. Van Schaik F.M.A. Verduijn G.M. Van Ommen G.J.B. Bouma B.N. Jansen M.

Commun. 1991; 175: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression of the gene gives rise to three classes of mRNA, due to alternative splicing and alternative usage of two poly(A) signals. All three classes render the same mature IGF-I polypeptide. In addition, the hIGF-I gene harbors two alternatively used promoters, P1 and P2, located upstream of exon 1 and exon 2, respectively. Differential usage of the promoters has been observed both in vitro and in vivo (7Jansen E. Steenbergh P.H. Van Schaik F.M.A. Sussenbach J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, promoter P1 is the stronger promoter yielding about 80% of all IGF-I transcripts and may be considered to function as a liver-specific promoter, at least postnatally. From studies on other promoters of genes that are highly expressed in liver, it has become apparent that multiple liver-enriched transcription factors work together in a concerted action to achieve high expression levels in adult liver (8De Simone V. Cortese R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Xanthopoulos K.G. Mirkovitch J. Eur. J.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar). Four families of liver-enriched transcription factors have been described to date, i.e. the C/EBP, HNF-1, HNF-3, and HNF-4 families. The expression of the transcription factors belonging to these families is not totally restricted to liver tissue. In all probability, it is the combination of several cis-acting elements, present in the promoter regions of liver specifically expressed genes, to which liver-enriched trans-acting factors of different families can bind, that confers liver specificity and strong stimulation of gene expression.Previously, we have described the involvement of two families of liver-enriched transcription factors in the regulation of hIGF-I gene expression (12Nolten L.A. Van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nolten L.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members belonging to the bZIP family of liver-enriched transcription factors (C/EBPα and C/EBPβ) enhance basal transcription directed by P1 up to 12-fold. Transactivation of P1 by these factors is dependent on the presence of an high affinity C/EBP binding site located at position −119 in P1 (12Nolten L.A. Van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNF-1α, a liver-enriched member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, is also able to transactivate P1 and was shown to be an even stronger transactivator than C/EBP family members. Bandshift experiments revealed that two HNF-1 binding sites are present in P1. The upstream HNF-1 binding site, located between −282 and −270, has a slightly higher binding affinity for HNF-1α than to the downstream HNF-1 binding site, located between −119 and −107. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the latter, downstream binding site is more important for transactivation of P1 by HNF-1α (13Nolten L.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).HNF-3α, HNF-3β, and HNF-3γ belong to a third family of liver-enriched transcription factors. All three proteins are expressed in adult liver tissue, HNF-3α and HNF-3β being more abundant than HNF-3γ (14Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In addition, HNF-3α and HNF-3β are expressed in intestine and lung, whereas HNF-3γ is expressed in intestine and testis, but is absent from lung (15Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Luckow B. Schütz G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 427-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, HNF-3 transcription factors function as activators of liver-specific gene expression (17Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HNF-3α was originally identified as a protein that binds specifically to sequences proven to be functionally important in the liver-specific expression of the transthyretin (TTR) and α1-anti-trypsin genes (18Costa R.H. Grayson D.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Other target sites for HNF-3 proteins have been described in the promoter/enhancer region of the genes encoding α-fetoprotein (19Millonig J.H. Emerson J.A. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HNF-3 binds to DNA as monomers via a divergent helix-turn-helix motif, referred to as the winged helix motif (27Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 28Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the DNA binding domain of HNF-3α, HNF-3β, and HNF-3γ is more than 90% conserved, a large range of DNA sequences can be recognized by these proteins. Subtle changes in the highly conserved DNA binding domain and in a more variable 20-amino acid region located adjacent to the DNA recognition helix may contribute to DNA binding specificity (30Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 31Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recently, the sequence 5′-WRRRYMAAYA-3′ has been proposed as the consensus recognition and binding site for HNF-3 family members (32Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Aim of this study is to investigate whether the members of the HNF-3 family of liver-enriched transcription factors contribute to the expression level of the hIGF-I gene in adult liver.DISCUSSIONRecently, we have described the involvement of two families of liver-enriched transcription factors in the expression of the hIGF-I gene in adult liver (12Nolten L.A. Van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nolten L.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (LAP) activate P1 of the hIGF-I gene up to 12-fold via a high affinity binding site located between positions −119 and −111 relative to the major transcription start site (12Nolten L.A. Van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNF-1α is able to enhance basal transcription in Hep3B cells up to 16-fold. Transactivation is dependent on two HNF-1 binding sites located between −282 to −270 and −119 to −107. The latter site completely overlaps the C/EBP binding site (13Nolten L.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the transcription of a number of liver-specifically expressed genes has been shown to be regulated by the concerted action of members from different families of liver-enriched transcription factors (8De Simone V. Cortese R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we investigated whether family members of the HNF-3 family of winged helix DNA binding transcription factors are also involved in the transcriptional regulation of the hIGF-I gene.Here we show that HNF-3β is a very strong transactivator of P1 in transient transfection experiments in Hep3B, HepG2, and COS-7 cells. Since HNF-3β is able to enhance P1 transcription in both hepatocyte-derived and, to a lesser extent, in non-hepatocyte-derived cell lines, it is likely that transactivation occurs mainly via a direct mechanism and that a co-factor is not absolutely required for the transactivational properties of HNF-3β on P1. Enhancement of basal P1 activity by HNF-3β revealed a linear relation between the amount of expression vector added and the stimulation of basal transcription. No plateau level was reached using quantities of up to 2 μg of expression vector. HNF-3α and HNF-3γ are not able, or were able to a much lesser extent, to enhance the basal transcriptional level of P1 in the three cell lines tested, suggesting that hIGF-I gene expression is significantly influenced by HNF-3β, but not by HNF-3α or HNF-3γ. Differential transactivation by the different HNF-3 family members is described for other genes as well. Region I in the promoter of the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) gene harbors two HNF-3 binding sites. Co-transfection experiments with expression vectors encoding either HNF-3α or HNF-3β had opposite effects. HNF-3α was able to enhance basal activity, whereas HNF-3β had a inhibitory effect on promoter activity (45Sawaya P.L. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22211-22216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the promoter region of the rat cytochrome P450 2C13 (CYP2C13) gene harbors two HNF-3 binding sites, which show different binding characteristics. Site A preferably binds HNF-3β, while site B can be activated by HNF-3α and HNF-3γ (46Legraverend C. Eguchi H. Ström A. Lahuna O. Mode A. Tollet P. Westin S. Gustafsson J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9889-9897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).We have shown that HNF-3β regulates IGF-I gene expression via two different mechanisms. Direct transactivation is observed through binding of HNF-3β to two binding sites in P1 and subsequent enhancement of P1 activity, and indirect activation occurs through the induction of the transcription factor HNF-1α, which in turn can bind and transactivate IGF-I P1. The two HNF-3 binding sites are located in the proximal part of the promoter region and both adhere to the HNF-3 consensus binding sequence 5′-WRRRYMAAYA-3′ (32Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) at 9 out of 10 nucleotides. This consensus binding sequence contains the core sequence 5′-RTAAAYA-3′, which is present in the binding sites of four human fork head homologs (FREAC, fork head-related activators; 31Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), indicating that the right-hand part of the consensus binding sequence is more important for recognition and binding of proteins belonging to the fork head family. The mismatch to the consensus sequence in the upstream HNF-3 binding site in P1 resides in the more conserved part of the consensus binding sequence, at position 10, whereas the downstream site has a mismatch at position 2, which seems less important for binding. However, bandshift experiments with fragments, in which either one or both HNF-3 binding sites were mutated, indicate that both HNF-3 binding sites in P1 possess equal binding affinity for HNF-3β. Moreover, transient co-transfection experiments revealed that mutant reporter constructs, in which one of the HNF-3 binding sites was mutated, could be activated by HNF-3β to a similar extent, approximately 30-40% of the wild type construct. In conclusion, the two HNF-3 binding sites in P1 have similar binding affinities for HNF-3β and are equally important for transactivation of P1 by HNF-3β. DNase I footprinting experiments showed the induction of a DNase I-hypersensitive site within the regions protected by HNF-3β. The induction of DNase I-hyperreactive sites is characteristic of an HNF-3 binding site (32Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 47Rigaud G. Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. Cell. 1991; 67: 977-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The two DNase I-hypersensitive sites (one on each strand) are staggered by 3 base pairs, as has been shown for the TTR site and sites recognized by FREACs (31Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 32Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because the HNF-3 binding sites in P1 of the IGF-I gene are located on different strands, the footprint analysis (as shown in Fig. 5) shows DNase I-hypersensitive sites at different positions within the protected regions.Comparison of the HNF-3 binding sites present in the promoter of the human IGF-I gene with the homologous promoter regions of other species reveals that both sites are well conserved among mammalian and avian species (Table I). The corresponding sequences in the pig and chicken genes are completely identical to the human sequence, whereas in sheep and rat one of the potential HNF-3 binding sites reveals a single mismatch. In the sheep promoter, the upstream HNF-3 binding site contains four consecutive A nucleotides instead of three and in the downstream HNF-3 binding site in the rat, a G is present at position 8 instead of an A, suggesting that only the upstream HNF-3 binding site is capable of HNF-3 binding. The salmon promoter, however, shows a number of mutations in both of the HNF-3 binding sites at positions that seem to be important for binding. The upstream HNF-3 binding site contains a C at position 7, which in all HNF-3 binding sites described so far is an A. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the position of the downstream HNF-3 binding site shows both an aberrant G at position 6 and a T at position 10. The deviation at position 6 in the salmon promoter is identical to the mutation we introduced in the downstream HNF-3 binding site to abolish HNF-3 binding, suggesting that HNF-3 is not able to bind to this site.The promoter region of the HNF-1α gene contains an HNF-3 binding site that contributes to the high level of expression of HNF-1α in hepatocytes (25Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments suggest that HNF-1α expression can be induced in Hep3B cells by HNF-3β overexpression. IGF-I P1 harbors two HNF-1 binding sites that are important in the regulation of IGF-I gene expression (13Nolten L.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNF-1α induction, upon HNF-3β expression, thus may account for the transactivation observed for the HNF-3 double mutant in co-transfection experiments using an HNF-3β expression vector. In agreement with this hypothesis, the basal transcriptional level of the human albumin promoter, which contains an HNF-1 binding site but no HNF-3 binding site, was enhanced by HNF-3β in similar co-transfection experiments.In this report, we have established the important role of HNF-3β in the regulation of IGF-I gene expression. The HNF-3 family members are all expressed in adult liver tissue, HNF-3α and HNF-3β being more abundantly expressed than HNF-3γ (14Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In adult liver, these transcription factors function as activators of liver-specific gene expression (8De Simone V. Cortese R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HNF-3β regulates the transcription of the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1α and is also involved in the establishment and maintenance of its own expression in hepatocytes via a positive autoactivation loop (25Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 26Pani L. Qian X. Clevidence D.E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). P1 of the hIGF-I gene harbors two HNF-3 binding sites. Since the HNF-3 family of transcription factors plays such a dominant role in the regulation of expression of liver-specifically expressed genes, HNF-3β might be the most important regulator of IGF-I gene expression. In addition, the two HNF-3 binding sites in the proximal promoter region of P1 are located in close proximity of the transcription start site, suggesting that HNF-3 may be involved in recruitment of the basal transcription machinery to the IGF-I promoter. Since P1 does not harbor typical proximal promoter elements like a CCAAT or TATA box, nor an initiator element (48Jansen E. Steenbergh P.H. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 78: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), HNF-3 could fulfill this role in the regulation of IGF-I P1 transcription. Since HNF-3 induces a bend of 13° in the DNA upon binding (27Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), simultaneous binding of two HNF-3 proteins to the region of initiation of transcription might induce a distortion in the DNA, thereby facilitating initiation of transcription directed by RNA polymerase II. INTRODUCTIONHuman insulin-like growth factor I (hIGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: hIGF-Ihuman insulin-like growth factor IIGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor IGSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionTTRtransthyretinP1 and P2promoters 1 and 2, respectively. is a small basic polypeptide of 70 amino acids, which plays an important role in postnatal development. hIGF-I mediates the growth and differentiation promoting effects of growth hormone (1Daughaday W.H. Hall K. Raben M.S. Salmon W.D. Van den Brande J.L. Van Wyk J.J. Nature. 1972; 235: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Growth hormone is the main regulator of IGF-I gene expression and regulates its expression at the transcriptional level (2Mathews L.S. Norstedt G. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9343-9347Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). IGF-I is expressed by many tissues during development; however, postnatally expression is mainly restricted to liver tissue (3Froesch E.R. Schmid C. Schwander J. Zapf J. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 443-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During puberty and adulthood, the liver is the main endocrine source of circulating IGF-I.The hIGF-I gene is a complex transcriptional unit. The gene consists of six exons together spanning more than 90 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence (4De Pagter-Holthuizen P. Van Schaik F.M.A. Verduijn G.M. Van Ommen G.J.B. Bouma B.N. Jansen M.

Commun. 1991; 175: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression of the gene gives rise to three classes of mRNA, due to alternative splicing and alternative usage of two poly(A) signals. All three classes render the same mature IGF-I polypeptide. In addition, the hIGF-I gene harbors two alternatively used promoters, P1 and P2, located upstream of exon 1 and exon 2, respectively. Differential usage of the promoters has been observed both in vitro and in vivo (7Jansen E. Steenbergh P.H. Van Schaik F.M.A. Sussenbach J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, promoter P1 is the stronger promoter yielding about 80% of all IGF-I transcripts and may be considered to function as a liver-specific promoter, at least postnatally. From studies on other promoters of genes that are highly expressed in liver, it has become apparent that multiple liver-enriched transcription factors work together in a concerted action to achieve high expression levels in adult liver (8De Simone V. Cortese R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Xanthopoulos K.G. Mirkovitch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Noda C. Ichihara A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1993; 18: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Johnson P.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar). Four families of liver-enriched transcription factors have been described to date, i.e. the C/EBP, HNF-1, HNF-3, and HNF-4 families. The expression of the transcription factors belonging to these families is not totally restricted to liver tissue. In all probability, it is the combination of several cis-acting elements, present in the promoter regions of liver specifically expressed genes, to which liver-enriched trans-acting factors of different families can bind, that confers liver specificity and strong stimulation of gene expression.Previously, we have described the involvement of two families of liver-enriched transcription factors in the regulation of hIGF-I gene expression (12Nolten L.A. Van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nolten L.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members belonging to the bZIP family of liver-enriched transcription factors (C/EBPα and C/EBPβ) enhance basal transcription directed by P1 up to 12-fold. Transactivation of P1 by these factors is dependent on the presence of an high affinity C/EBP binding site located at position −119 in P1 (12Nolten L.A. Van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNF-1α, a liver-enriched member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, is also able to transactivate P1 and was shown to be an even stronger transactivator than C/EBP family members. Bandshift experiments revealed that two HNF-1 binding sites are present in P1. The upstream HNF-1 binding site, located between −282 and −270, has a slightly higher binding affinity for HNF-1α than to the downstream HNF-1 binding site, located between −119 and −107. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the latter, downstream binding site is more important for transactivation of P1 by HNF-1α (13Nolten L.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).HNF-3α, HNF-3β, and HNF-3γ belong to a third family of liver-enriched transcription factors. All three proteins are expressed in adult liver tissue, HNF-3α and HNF-3β being more abundant than HNF-3γ (14Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In addition, HNF-3α and HNF-3β are expressed in intestine and lung, whereas HNF-3γ is expressed in intestine and testis, but is absent from lung (15Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Luckow B. Schütz G. Genomics. 1994; 20: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 427-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, HNF-3 transcription factors function as activators of liver-specific gene expression (17Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HNF-3α was originally identified as a protein that binds specifically to sequences proven to be functionally important in the liver-specific expression of the transthyretin (TTR) and α1-anti-trypsin genes (18Costa R.H. Grayson D.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Other target sites for HNF-3 proteins have been described in the promoter/enhancer region of the genes encoding α-fetoprotein (19Millonig J.H. Emerson J.A. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3848-3856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), albumin (20Herbst R.S. Nielsch U. Sladek F.M. Lai E. Babiss L.E. Darnell Jr., J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2019877029,"Glycosylation plays a crucial role in glycoprotein stability and its correct folding. Murine acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a lysosomal glycoprotein. We studied the functional role of its individual N-linked oligosaccharides needed to maintain enzymatic activity and protein stability. Mutagenized cDNA constructs were heterologously expressed. All six potential N-glycosylation sites were modified. Incomplete glycosylation of the most distant C-terminal site resulted in two isoforms. Oligosaccharides at N-84, N-173, and N-611 were found to be of minor importance for enzymatic activity. The glycosylation defect at N-333 or N-393 reduced the enzymatic activity to 40% and at N-518 to less than 20%. These mutations did not effect the Km value. Glycosylation at N-333 and N-393 mainly contributed to the enzyme stability and prevented degradation at lysosomal acidic pH, whereas the low residual enzymatic activity of mutant ASM deficient in glycosylation at N-518 was caused by protein misfolding. The mutant protein was also prone to proteolysis when trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum/cis-Golgi after brefeldin A application. Insufficiently glycosylated ASM formed a stable complex with BiP, an immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein, and thus remained in the endoplasmic reticulum. 32PO4 labeling revealed that the glycosylation mutants of ASM were phosphorylated predominantly at mannose residues of oligosaccharides linked to N-84, N-333, and N-393.

E.C. 3.1.4.12) is an ubiquitous lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine. In 1987, Quintern et al. (1Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) purified human acid sphingomyelinase from urine to homogeneity. Subsequent discovery of the primary structure enabled functional expression in an eucaryotic cell culture system (2Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). acid sphingomyelinase endoplasmic reticulum phosphate-buffered saline immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein cytomegalovirus endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase N-glycosidase human embryonic kidney. Deficient or reduced ASM activity causes sphingomyelin accumulation known in humans as Niemann-Pick disease sphingolipidosis. Depending on the amount of residual enzymatic activity, the neurovisceral type A or the less severe visceral type B of this autosomal recessive disease is observed (3Graber D. Salvayre R. Levade T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, several mutations in the ASM gene of Niemann-Pick disease patients have been reported, leading to an enzyme of no or drastically reduced activity. Transgenic mice with a disrupted ASM gene exhibit a phenotype comparable to that of Niemann-Pick disease, type A, patients. The neurological symptoms of these mice are accompanied by the loss of Purkinje cells as revealed by histological studies (4Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 5Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Besides the catabolic function of this lysosomal enzyme, involvement of ASM in the ceramide-dependent signal transduction pathway has been discussed controversially (6Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 7Kuno K. Sukegawa K. Ishikawa Y. Orii T. Matsushima K. Int.

As a lysosomal hydrolase, ASM undergoes several posttranslational processing and targeting steps. The N-terminal signal sequence directs the primary translation product into the ER. The signal sequence, which has a length of approximately 45 amino acids for human as well as murine ASM according to the von Heijne prediction (10von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar), is cleaved during this process. In the ER, oligosaccharides are transferred to certain Asn residues and further modified in the Golgi apparatus. The oligosaccharide chains may share a variety of different functions. They are known to contribute to the proper protein folding and to preserve biological activity by stabilizing the protein conformation and protecting against proteolytic degradation (11Halaban R. Moellmann G. Tamura A. Kwon B.S. Kuklinska E. Pomerantz S.H. Lerner A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7241-7245Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Kretz K.A. Carson G.S.

Brossmer R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6250-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oligosaccharides are important for correct targeting of lysosomal proteins. To that end, certain mannose residues are phosphorylated in position 6 by a two-step reaction in the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Such tagged proteins bind to the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in the trans-Golgi network and are transported by coated vesicles to the lysosomes. The aim of the present study was to characterize the functional aspects of the individual oligosaccharides of murine ASM. The enzyme can easily be expressed in a eucaryotic cell system and assayed. ASM activity is particularly stable and seems to be independent of further components. Therefore, it represents a useful model to investigate the various functions of glycosylation. Since ASM is highly conserved between humans and mice, most of the results obtained for the murine protein should be valid also for the human enzyme (14Newrzella D. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1233-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Tissue culture medium and reagents were purchased from Seromed (Berlin, Germany) and Life Technologies, Inc., and the radiochemicals were from Amersham Corp. Restriction enzymes and G418 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Nitrocellulose membranes and P81 membranes used were from Schleicher & Schuell and Whatman, respectively. Brefeldin A, kanamycin, tunicamycin, Freund's adjuvant, and protein A-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma. Endoglycosidases were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The pRc/CMV vector was bought from Invitrogen, and the T7 sequencing kit and the USE site-directed mutagenesis kit were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Anti-BiP antiserum was purchased from Stressgen and Cy3 conjugated anti-rabbit-IgG antibody from Jackson. Glycerol gelatin was obtained from Merck. Murine ASM cDNA (14Newrzella D. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1233-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI site of puc13 (Fig. 1). Using the unique site elimination kit, each individual Asn codon of the six canonical N-glycosylation site (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) was converted to a Gln codon. Multiple mutations were introduced by exchange of cDNA cassettes using the restriction sites indicated in Fig. 1. Each mutated cDNA was controlled by DNA sequencing (T7 sequencing kit). Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were cloned into the HindIII restriction site of the pRc/CMV vector. The full-length coding sequence of murine ASM cDNA without the 5′ terminal part was cloned into the pET8c vector (15Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). Expression in Bl21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli yielded a polypeptide representing the amino acids 100 to 627 of the murine ASM in abundant amounts. The protein was first separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluted with a minimal volume of 0.1% SDS, 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8). It was then precipitated with four volumes of acetone and dissolved in PBS. Polyclonal anti-ASM serum was raised in rabbits by an injection of 200 μg of recombinant protein in combination with Freund's complete adjuvant followed by three booster injections of 100 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant in 2-week intervals. Serum was obtained 5 days after final injection. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. A suspension of approximately 2 × 106 cells was electroporated in culture medium at 450 V, 250 μF in the presence of 15 μg/ml circular plasmid DNA (pRc/CMV constructs) for transient or 1 μg/ml ScaI linearized plasmid DNA for stable expression (electroporator and 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes by Bio-Rad). Transiently expressing cells were cultured for 48 h prior to harvest. Stable expressing cells were plated after electroporation in various dilutions on 100-mm dishes. After 24 h, the medium was supplemented with G418 at a concentration of 450 μg/ml. After 2 weeks of selection, individual cell clones were picked, expanded, and tested for expression by Northern blotting and enzymatic assays of ASM or neomycin phosphortransferase. Transfected HEK293 cells grown to confluency in 60-mm dishes were starved in 1 ml of either methionine-free modified Eagle's medium or PO4-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h prior to pulse labeling with 150 μCi L-[35S]methionine or 250 μCi [32P]orthophosphoric acid for the indicated periods of time. In case of the pulse-chase experiment, cells were incubated for an additional 2 h with normal cell culture medium. After metabolic labeling, cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and extracted in 200 μl of extraction buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM EDTA, and 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.2). For extraction of 32PO4-labeled cells, the buffer also contained 5 mM NaF and 1 mM Na3VO4. Extracts were centrifugated for 15 min at 100,000 × g and then incubated for 1 h with anti-ASM antiserum in a 1:60 dilution and subsequently treated for 1 h with 0.5 volume of protein A-Sepharose diluted 1:10 in extraction buffer. BiP precipitation was carried out using a monoclonal mouse anti-BiP antiserum in a dilution of 1:200. Immunoprecipitated material was washed with three changes of 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.2. All steps were performed at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations from culture medium were performed with 800 μl of medium cleared by ultracentrifugation. Immunoprecipitated material was resuspended (4% SDS, 10%β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.125 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. The gel was analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) when quantitative comparison of the labeled protein was necessary. Tunicamycin or brefeldin A was added at 10 or 2 μg/ml, respectively, to the cells 1 h prior to the labeling. Digestion with Endo F/PNGase F was performed with the immunoprecipitated material resuspended in 20 μl of extraction buffer for 2-3 h at 37°C using 0.1 unit. For Endo H digestion, the immunoprecipitated material was resuspended in 20 μl of acidic buffer (30 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% SDS) and incubated for 13 h at 37°C using 0.002 unit.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) at passage six were suspended in cell culture medium, electroporated at 500 μF and 450 V with 15 μg/ml plasmid DNA, and plated as duplicate sets on 60-mm dishes for 48 h. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with freshly prepared acetone:methanol (1:1) at room temperature for 2 min. After washing with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin and a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-ASM antiserum in PBS for 1 h. After washing with three changes of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS over 10 min, the cells were exposed to a 1:800 dilution of anti-rabbit-IgG antibody conjugated with CY3 in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for another hour. Cells were washed as described above, mounted with glycerol gelatin and coverslips, and viewed with a microscope equipped for epifluorescence (Zeiss). For BiP staining, a polyclonal rabbit anti-BiP antiserum in a dilution of 1:200 was used as a first antibody. Transfected HEK293 cells were washed with PBS and harvested. To determine the ASM activity, the cells were lysated in extraction buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.2). Extracts were assayed as described previously (1Quintern L.E. Weitz G. Nehrkorn H. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using 14C-labeled sphingomyelin (16Stoffel W. LeKim D. Tschung T.S. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with a specific radioactivity of 8000 dpm/nmol. Protein concentrations were determined as described previously (17Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as reference. To determine the neomycin phosphotransferase activity, cells were extracted in detergent-free buffer and incubated with kanamycin and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (18Duch M. Paludan K. Pedersen L. Jørgensen P. Kjeldgaard N.O. Pedersen F.S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were removed from the phosphorylated kanamycin by filtration of the incubation products through two layers of nitrocellulose membrane and two layers of P81 membrane using a filtration manifold (19Platt S.G. Yang N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amount of labeled kanamycin on the P81 membrane was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and served as a relative measurement of neomycin phosphortransferase activity in the cell extracts. The cDNA of murine ASM (14Newrzella D. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1233-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was cloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV to characterize the glycosylation. The minigene is under the control of the CMV promoter. Plasmid DNA was transfected either transiently or stably in HEK293 cells. Because cDNA-derived murine ASM contains six potential N-glycosylation sites at positions N-84, N-173, N-333, N-393, N-518, and N-611, each of these sites was eliminated by exchanging the codons for asparagine to glutamine in the cDNA using site-directed mutagenesis (ΔGS1 to ΔGS6, respectively). Combinations of these mutations were obtained by exchanges of cDNA cassettes using the restriction sites shown in Fig. 1. Mutant ASM cDNAs were subsequently cloned and expressed under the same conditions as the wild type. The importance of the N-linked oligosaccharides for the maintenance of ASM enzymatic activity was evaluated. Extracts of lysed cells producing recombinant ASM were treated with Endo F/PNGase F. This treatment led to a loss of the activity compared to the control incubated without glycosidases. The complete enzymatic deglycosylation was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation after pulse labeling cells for 3 h with [35S]methionine (Fig. 2A). Wild-type murine ASM yielded two distinct polypeptides of 70 and 72 kDa, which were reduced in size to a single ∼60-kDa protein upon deglycosylation with Endo F/PNGase F. This digestion product is completely deglycosylated because its molecular mass is identical to that of the mutant ASM ΔGS(1-6) with all putative N-glycosylation sites deleted. The two distinct polypeptides visible after wild-type ASM immunoprecipitation do not result from successive processing steps during the pulse labeling as they proved to be time-independent in a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 2B). Therefore, a variability in the use of the N-glycosylation sites must be the reason for this mass heterogeneity. A significant portion of ASM activity is released into the cell culture medium upon overexpression of wild-type protein. This activity is associated with a protein slightly larger than the cellular form as determined by immunoprecipitation. The difference in protein mass is most likely due to a further modification of oligosaccharides during the secretion process because this size difference disappears for the nonglycosylated mutant ΔGS(1-6) (Fig. 2C). Nonglycosylated ASM has been demonstrated to be inactive. We, therefore, determined the enzymatic half-life of this lysosomal protein by the administration of tunicamycin. Tunicamycin inhibits N-glycosylation and consequently stops the supply of newly translated functional ASM. The decay of the residual lysosomal enzyme activity of ASM in cell extracts revealed a half-life of about 14 h (Fig. 3). Wild-type ASM and glycosylation site-deficient mutants were expressed transiently in HEK293 cells, and resulting ASM proteins were immunoprecipitated after 4 h pulse labeling with [35S]methionine. Wild-type ASM resulted in two protein bands of 70 and 72 kDa. The loss of every single oligosaccharide group of the mutated ASMs shifted the double band by 2 kDa to a lower molecular mass. Only mutant ΔGS6 that lacked the most C-terminal glycosylation site yielded a single predominant translation product, which corresponded in molecular mass to the lower band of wild-type ASM (Fig. 4A). These results indicated that each of the six canonical sites is in fact glycosylated in the wild-type enzyme. A partial usage of the sixth site (N-611) appears to cause the observed mass heterogeneity in wild-type and in ΔGS1 to ΔGS5. These observations were further confirmed by the investigation of a series of multiple mutated constructs with a decreasing number of functional glycosylation sites. Transient expression, [35S]methionine pulse labeling, and subsequent immunoprecipitation yielded proteins of a stepwise decreasing size due to the successive loss of oligosaccharide chains. Complete removal of all canonical glycosylation sites resulted in a single polypeptide of 60 kDa. This molecular mass is identical to that obtained by treatment of wild-type ASM with PNGase F/Endo F or by expression of wild-type ASM in HEK293 cells in the presence of tunicamycin, a drug inhibiting N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 4B). To investigate the type of the oligosaccharide structure, wild-type and mutant ASM were subjected to Endo H degradation. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from stably overexpressing HEK293 cell clones after 2 h of [35S]methionine pulse labeling and a subsequent chase period of 4 h to ensure completion of oligosaccharide processing. In each case, Endo H digestion resulted in a protein band of 60 kDa corresponding to the completely deglycosylated form, which shows that biantennary complex type oligosaccharide structures are not present in murine ASM expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4C). HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type ASM and the mutant constructs ΔGS1 to ΔGS6. Their ASM activity was assayed. Under the chosen conditions for transfection, cell culture, and extraction, an increase of ASM activity by about 0.2 μmol/h per mg of total cell protein was measured for the wild-type construct. To compensate for variations in the transfection efficiency between the different ASM expression constructs, the neomycin phosphotransferase activity resulting from the neo-resistance gene of the pRc/CMV vector was used as a reference. The residual activity of the various mutant ASMs relative to the wild-type ASM are shown in Fig. 5A. Only oligosaccharides at N-333, N-393, and N-518 seemed to be of major importance for the enzymatic activity. Single elimination of the other sites (constructs ΔGS1, ΔGS2, and ΔGS6) only slightly reduced the activity. However, constructs ΔGS3 and ΔGS4, lacking glycosylation at N-333 and N-393, respectively, exhibited only 40% of wild-type activity, whereas construct ΔGS5, altered in N-518, possessed less then 20% residual activity. The influence of these three glycosylation sites on the enzymatic activity was further investigated. The Km values of all three mutant enzymes were that of the wild-type level of 25 μM. A characteristic loss of ASM activity in extracts from overexpressing cells was observed after preincubation for 20 h at pH 4.5 and 37°C prior to the enzymatic assay. Wild-type ASM activity was reduced to 43%, which is in good agreement with the previously determined in vivo half-life of the enzymatic activity of 14 h. Although the mutant enzymes ΔGS1, ΔGS2, and ΔGS6 behaved in the same manner as the wild-type enzyme, ΔGS3 and ΔGS4 showed a severe loss and ΔGS5 showed a moderate loss compared to the wild-type enzyme during this preincubation (Fig. 5B). The low but quite stable residual activity of ΔGS5 might refer to an incorrect protein folding. This interpretation is further supported by the immunofluorescence and brefeldin A experiments, (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).Fig. 8Subcellular localization of wild-type and glycosylation-deficient ASM. Embryonic fibroblasts of ASM-deficient mice were transfected transiently with ASM expression constructs (A, wild type; B, ΔGS3; C, ΔGS4; D, ΔGS5; E, ΔGS(3-5)). After 48 h, cells were fixed with a methanol/acetone mixture and labeled with rabbit anti-ASM serum followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The fibroblasts in F were labeled with rabbit anti-BiP serum. Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test if this loss of activity is caused by protein degradation, HEK293 cell clones overexpressing wild-type and mutant ASM were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine. The ASM proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts either with or without previous application of the acidic preincubation (Fig. 5, C and D). Neither the amount nor the size of wild-type ASM appeared to be influenced by the preincubation. We conclude that the observed decrease in activity results from conformational changes. The protein amount of mutant ASM ΔGS3 and ΔGS4, however, decreased by approximately 50% during preincubation, indicating an elevated sensitivity to proteases. The severe loss of enzymatic activity of these two mutants cannot be explained exclusively by the reduction in the protein level. Therefore, we assume an additional increase in conformational lability. The degree of protein degradation of mutant ASM ΔGS5 was significantly higher than the concomitant loss of enzymatic activity (see “Discussion”). The mutant ASM in which all three crucial glycosylation sites at N-333, N-393, and N-518 are eliminated was totally inactive, and the polypeptide was nearly completely degraded during the described preincubation. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4B, a protein of about 80 kDa was found to coprecipitate with the ASM in case of mutants in which at least two oligosaccharides (ΔGS(4+5) and further) have been eliminated. Wild-type ASM produced in the presence of tunicamycin also showed a stable association to this protein. In contrast, wild-type ASM and mutants with only one missing oligosaccharide group did not form a complex with this protein, as shown in Fig. 4A. Ig heavy chain binding protein (BiP, grp78) is known to assist in correct glycoprotein folding in the ER (20Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Haas I.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 71-82PubMed Google Scholar). Several insufficiently glycosylated glycoproteins have been reported to associate stably with BiP and are retained in the ER (22Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Hurtley S.M. Bole D.G. Hoover-Litty H. Helenius A. Copeland C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 24Weitz G. Proja R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10039-10044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Williams A.M. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12780-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of BiP and the protein associated with several incompletely glycosylated ASM mutants was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, as shown in Fig. 6. Labeled cell extracts of HEK293 cells transiently expressing completely deglycosylated ASM (ΔGS(1-6)) were incubated with antibodies to either ASM or BiP. Both antibodies precipitated the 60-kDa polypeptide of the unglycosylated ASM as well as the 78-kDa protein corresponding to BiP. The important role of the glycosylation site at N-518 is further supported by the experiment shown in Fig. 7. Wild-type and several mutant ASMs were immunoprecipitated from the corresponding [35S]methionine pulse-labeled cell clones after administration of brefeldin A. Brefeldin A is a drug known to inhibit the vesicular transport through the Golgi apparatus (26Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki A. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except for ΔGS5, all tested ASM variants were slightly reduced in size and accumulated when trapped in ER/cis-Golgi. Apparently, the trapped protein undergoes an intense oligosaccharide trimming. The increase in protein amount is probably due to the inhibited secretion because no ASM protein was found in the cell culture medium of overexpressing cells after brefeldin A treatment (data not shown). However, in the case of construct ΔGS5, mutant protein is hardly detectable when expression was performed in the presence of brefeldin A. This indicated that the incorrectly folded glycoprotein is immediately degraded when retained in ER/cis-Golgi. The stable complex of incompletely glycosylated ASM to BiP is retained in the ER, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy. We overcame background problems by the ubiquitously expressed endogenous ASM by using embryonal fibroblasts of ASM-deficient mice for transient transfection (4Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the accumulation of wild-type ASM in the lysosomes but localization of ASM ΔGS(3-5) and of BiP in the ER (Fig. 8). Also ΔGS3 and ΔGS4 were found in lysosomes, but considerable amounts of ΔGS5 were retained in the ER. We finally addressed the function of the individual oligosaccharides of murine ASM in lysosomal targeting. Since each mutant devoid of a single glycosylation site showed significant amounts of intracellular enzymatic activity, the targeting signal is not connected to an individual oligosaccharide. HEK293 cells transiently expressing the mutants ΔGS3 and ΔGS4 secreted considerable ASM enzymatic activity into the cell culture medium. We, therefore, investigated the respective double mutant ΔGS(3+4). No intracellular activity was detectable, but a significant activity was found in the culture medium. The mutant retained a mannose-6-phosphate tag, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of 32PO4 pulse-labeled protein (Fig. 9A). The tag remaining in the mutant enzyme is either not sufficient for recognition by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor or the absence of the intracellular activity of this mutant results from a strongly impaired lysosomal protein stability. To determine the distribution of phosphorylated mannose residues to the individual oligosaccharides, HEK293 cell clones stably expressing wild-type and mutant ASM (WT, ΔGS1 to ΔGS6) were extracted after either [35S]methionine or 32PO4 pulse labeling under comparable conditions. Labeled ASM of each extract was quantified after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 9B). Fig. 9C shows the ratio of 32PO4 to [35S]methionine-labeled ASM for each investigated construct deduced from two independent sets of experiments. Compared to the wild-type, the mutants ΔGS1, ΔGS3, and ΔGS4 exhibited a reduced degree of phosphorylation. This indicated that the respective oligosaccharides were predominant targets for tagging by mannose-6-phosphate. Mutant ΔGS5 also showed an extensively reduced phosphorylation compared to the wild type. However, since this protein is rapidly degraded, insufficient folding and improper molecular structure rather than the elimination of a putatively mannose-6-phosphate tagged oligosaccharide might be the reason for this poor degree of phosphorylation. Therefore, the participation of oligosaccharide at N-518 in mannose-6-phosphate targeting cannot be deduced by this approach. ASM is a heavily glycosylated lysosomal protein. We report here on the various functional aspects of its oligosaccharides. Murine wild-type ASM appears as a 70/72-kDa glycoprotein with five to six N-linked oligosaccharides attached. Glycosylation site N-611, which is not conserved between murine and human ASM and therefore should be less important, was found to be only partially used. Elimination of all oligosaccharides led to a 60-kDa polypeptide. Therefore, each oligosaccharide chain contributes an apparent mass of approximately 2 kDa to the molecular mass of the protein. A loss of oligosaccharides during late processing steps cannot be excluded, although not observed during the labeling periods of up to 4 h. Because the cDNA-derived polypeptide without the signal peptide (amino acids 45 to 627) yields a 63-kDa polypeptide, an additional early proteolytic cleavage of an approximately 3-kDa peptide is required to yield the final polypeptide core. In fact, a weak additional protein band of 75 kDa is visible in Fig. 2B (chase, 0 h). The absence of this protein band in the other immunoprecipitation experiments might result from the relatively early processing of this product during the long labeling periods. This processing step is in agreement with the observations of Hurwitz et al. (27Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Vielhaber G. Moczall H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5440-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these authors observed an additional 57-kDa early product that did not occur in our experiments. Variations in the Endo H accessibility of the oligosaccharides observed in this study and by Hurwitz et al. (27Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Vielhaber G. Moczall H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5440-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might be due to the different cell types chosen for expression. It has been reported that in different tissues different oligosaccharide structures are produced (28Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Thomas J.R. Opdenakker G. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7644-7662Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). N-linked oligosaccharides are known to affect the catalytic activity of the glycoproteins in many cases. It has frequently been observed that the N-linked oligosaccharides of a protein do not have a profound site-specific effect (24Weitz G. Proja R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10039-10044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Machamer C.E. Florkiewicz R.Z. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell.

Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12193-12198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the quantitative expression studies of mutated ASM constructs described here revealed only three of the six N-linked oligosaccharides (N-333, N-393, and N-518) to be of importance for the enzymatic activity. Similar observations have been reported for human chorionic gonadotropin (33Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), simian virus 5 hemagglutinin neuraminidase (34Ng D.T. Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1989-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), human transferrin receptor (25Williams A.M. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12780-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and others (35Dube S. Fisher J.W. Powell J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17516-17521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pique C. Pham D. Tursz T. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 906-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the crucial oligosaccharides (N-333 and N-393) were shown to preserve the conformational stability and prevent its proteolytic degradation. The discrepancy between the reduction of immunoprecipitable mutant ASM ΔGS5 (N-518) and its enzymatic activity suggests that a significant amount of enzymatically inactive mutant ASM deficient in this glycosylation site is retained in the ER and rapidly degraded (Fig. 5). This result is also supported by the intracellular distribution of ΔGS5 visualized by immunofluorescence (Fig. 8D). We conclude that the oligosaccharide linked at N-518 is essential for the correct folding of the protein. BiP (grp78) is an ER-located member of the hsp70 family that is known to be involved in glycoprotein folding. Whereas correctly folded and assembled proteins bind only transiently to BiP (20Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Haas I.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 71-82PubMed Google Scholar), improper folding leads to stable aggregation. BiP-bound proteins are retained in the ER and degraded rapidly. Several examples of insufficiently glycosylated proteins are reported to be malfolded and, therefore, stably associated with BiP (22Dorner A.J. Bole D.G. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Hurtley S.M. Bole D.G. Hoover-Litty H. Helenius A. Copeland C.S. J.

Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12780-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated by immunoprecipitation that insufficiently glycosylated ASM mutants also coprecipitated with BiP and were retained in the ER as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. This is particularly obvious for mutant ASM lacking the glycosylation at N-518 (ΔGS5). This suggests that the glycosylation at N-518 prohibits stable binding to BiP. The faint BiP band in Fig. 6 might be due to the relatively long half-life of BiP (37Haas I.G. Experimentia. 1994; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and the low amount of protein synthesized during the labeling period. Disulfidelinked aggregates as reported for glycosylation-deficient influenza virus hemagglutinin (23Hurtley S.M. Bole D.G. Hoover-Litty H. Helenius A. Copeland C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), human β-hexosaminidase A (24Weitz G. Proja R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) did not occur for the ASM (data not shown). Apart from their influence on protein stability and folding, oligosaccharides of soluble lysosomal glycoproteins are also involved in the correct targeting. Certain oligosaccharides are phosphorylated and subsequently recognized by a Golgi-located mannose-6-phosphate receptor. Although mannose-6-phosphate tagging of cathepsin D has been studied intensively (40Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 41Metcalf P. Fusek M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the common features of a recognition domain responsible for this phosphorylation of lysosomal proteins remains to be determined. Analysis of this phosphorylation is further complicated by the finding that frequently several oligosaccharides of a protein become tagged to a certain extent and, therefore, contribute to the lysosomal targeting. Correspondingly, at least three oligosaccharides of the ASM (N-84, N-333, and N-393) were shown to be phosphorylated to a certain degree. The determination of the distribution of mannose-6-phosphate tags among the oligosaccharides of lysosomal proteins might contribute to a better understanding of this targeting mechanism. Because ASM is highly conserved between humans and mice, it is likely that the respective oligosaccharides of the human ASM have analogous functions.

https://openalex.org/W1506331512,"The events leading to the formation of β-amyloid (βA4) from its precursor (βAPP) involve proteolytic cleavages that produce the amino and carboxyl termini of βA4. The enzyme activities responsible for these cleavages have been termed β- and γ-secretase, respectively, although these protease(s) have not been identified. Since βA4 is known to possess heterogeneity at both the amino and carboxyl termini, β- and γ-secretases may actually be a collection of proteolytic activities or perhaps a single proteolytic enzyme with broad amino acid specificity.We investigated the role of cathepsin D in the processing of βAPP since this enzyme has been widely proposed as a γ-secretase candidate. Treatment of a synthetic peptide that spans the γ-secretase site of βAPP with human cathepsin D resulted in the cleavage of this substrate at Ala42-Thr43. A sensitive liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry technique was also developed to further investigate the ability of cathepsin D to process longer recombinant βAPP substrates (156 and 100 amino acids of βAPP carboxyl terminus) in vitro. The precise cathepsin D cleavage sites within these recombinant βAPP substrates were identified using this technique. Both recombinant substrates were cleaved at the following sites: Leu49-Val50, Asp68-Ala69, Phe93-Phe94. No cleavages were observed at putative γ-secretase sites: Val40-Ile41 or Ala42-Thr43, suggesting that cathepsin D is not γ-secretase as defined by these βA4 termini. Under conditions where the βAPP156 substrate was first denatured prior to cathepsin D digestion, two additional cleavage sites near the amino terminus of βA4, Glu−3-Val−2 and Glu3-Phe4, were observed, indicating that cathepsin D cleavage of βAPP is influenced by the structural integrity of the substrate. Taken together, these results indicate that in vitro, cathepsin D is unlikely to function as γ-secretase; however, the ability of this enzyme to efficiently cleave βAPP substrates at nonamyloidogenic sites within the molecule may reflect a role in βAPP catabolism.

Taken together, these results indicate that in vitro, cathepsin D is unlikely to function as γ-secretase; however, the ability of this enzyme to efficiently cleave βAPP substrates at nonamyloidogenic sites within the molecule may reflect a role in βAPP catabolism.

A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). The initial discovery of βA4 as a constituent in AD tissue prompted a number of investigations into the role of β-amyloid in this disease. The physical properties of βA4 combined with the genetic evidence linking mutations around the βA4 domain of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) to early onset forms of the disease (reviewed in 3Lansbury Jr., P. Arzneimittelforschung. 1995; 45: 432-434PubMed Google Scholar and 4Hardy J. Clin. Geriatr. Med. 1994; 10: 239-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provide compelling evidence that this peptide is involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Unraveling the cellular mechanism of βAPP processing and of βA4 production is, therefore, important in understanding the pathogenesis of AD.

The amino acid sequence numbering system used in this report is relative to the βA4 sequence beginning with Asp1. The methionine residue immediately preceding Asp1 is therefore numbered Met0. βA4 is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of a 695-770-amino acid integral membrane protein, the βAPP at two distinct sites near the carboxyl terminus of this molecule. The proteolytic cleavage that generates the amino terminus of βA4 occurs approximately 28 residues extralumenal to the transmembrane domain of βAPP, while that which generates the carboxyl terminus of βA4 takes place within the transmembrane domain. The protease activities that mediate these cleavage events are called β- and γ-secretase, respectively. Cleavage at both the β- and γ-secretase sites produces a soluble form of βA4 that is 40 amino acids long and ends at Val40 (5Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormick R. Wolfert R. Selkoe D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar); however, longer and potentially more pathogenic forms of βA4 that end at Ala42-Thr43, have also been identified (2Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar, 6Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A.

Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whether these various forms of βA4 are produced by a single γ-secretase is not known. A third major cleavage that is not involved in the formation of βA4 occurs within the βA4 domain of βAPP and is generated by a protease activity called α-secretase. A number of recent studies have revealed important clues regarding the proteolytic processing of the βAPP molecule. From these studies, two processing pathways have been proposed. The first is a constitutive secretion pathway that generates soluble forms of βAPP, which are ultimately released by cells expressing the precursor protein (8Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). This pathway involves the primary proteolytic cleavage of βAPP at the α-secretase site located within the βA4 domain (9Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 10Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), releasing the large, soluble extracellular portion of βAPP while simultaneously generating a 10-kDa membrane-associated βAPP carboxyl-terminal fragment (11Oltersdorf T. Ward P.J. Henriksson T. Beattie E.C. Neve R. Lieberburg I. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4492-4497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cleavage event precludes the formation of βA4. A minor cleavage event that also serves to liberate a soluble, albeit shorter extracellular domain of βAPP, occurs at the β-secretase site (12Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Shenk D.B. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear whether the protease responsible for this cleavage is a true component of the secretory pathway, or whether it is involved in the processing of βAPP via a degradative pathway. The second βAPP processing pathway is one that leads to the formation of amyloidogenic carboxyl-terminal fragments of βAPP (13Wolf D. Quon D. Wang Y. Cordell B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Estus S. Golde T.E. Kunishita T. Blades D. Lowery D. Eisen M. Usiak M. Qu X. Tabira T. Greenberg B.D. Younkin S.G.

Science. 1992; 255: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) that appear to be the direct precursors to βA4 itself (17Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Factors that may regulate the processing of βAPP through this amyloid forming pathway include βAPP mutations and the expression of aberrant levels and/or isoforms of βAPP (18Zhong Z. Quon D. Higgins L.S. Higaki J. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This amyloidogenic pathway was initially thought to involve the lysosomal-endosomal system based on the observation that lysosomal inhibitors stabilized amyloidogenic carboxyl-terminal fragments (15Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 16Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J. Younkin S.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16602-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that full-length surface βAPP can be reinternalized (15Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) via a coated-pit mechanism (23Nordstedt C. Caporaso G.L. Thyberg J. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) added further support for the role of the lysosomal-endosomal system. However, the observation that lysosomal inhibitors have little or no effect on βA4 levels suggests that the subcellular site of βA4 production may alternatively involve nonlysosomal compartments such as the trans-Golgi or early endosome (17Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a variety of peptide or protein substrates that span the α-secretase cleavage site, a number of protease activities have been implicated as α-secretase (27Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1994; 1: 263-280Google Scholar), but the true enzyme(s) has yet to be definitively identified. The search for α-secretase is confounded by the possibility that multiple proteases may be involved in cleaving this site (28Zhong Z. Higaki J. Murakami K. Wang Y. Catalano R. Quon D. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 627-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β- and γ-secretases responsible for processing βAPP through the amyloidogenic pathway also remain a mystery despite numerous attempts to identify them. Using a variety of synthetic peptide and recombinant βAPP substrates, a number of proteases have been implicated as candidates for β-secretase based on their ability to cleave at or near the Met0-Asp1 bond of βA4. These proteases include multicatalytic proteases, serine proteases, metalloproteases, and aspartic acid proteases (as reviewed in 27Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1994; 1: 263-280Google Scholar and 29Schenk D.B. Rydel R.E. May P. Little S. Panetta J. Lieberburg I. Sinha S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4141-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Proteases implicated as γ-secretases include multicatalytic protease, prolyl endopeptidase, and cathepsin D (27Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1994; 1: 263-280Google Scholar, 29Schenk D.B. Rydel R.E. May P. Little S. Panetta J. Lieberburg I. Sinha S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4141-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of these enzymes, cathepsin D is of particular interest, since many of the properties associated with this protease favor its role in the amyloidogenic processing of βAPP. The features of cathepsin D relevant to βA4 generation include the following observations. Cathepsin D is an abundant aspartic protease in brain tissue (30Azaryan A. Akopyan T. Buniatian H. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1983; 10: 1237-1246Google Scholar) and is located in and is active within acidic lysosomal and endosomal compartments (31Runquist E.A. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22557-22563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protease is also associated with amyloid deposits in AD tissue (32Cataldo A.M. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3861-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 33Cataldo A.M. Paskevich P.A. Kominami E. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10002-10998Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar), is up-regulated in AD neurons (34Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L. Berman S.A. Li J. Quarless S. Bursztajn S. Lippa C. Nixon R.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and shows an age-related change in activity in human and rodent brain tissue (35Kenessey A. Banay-Schwartz M. DeGuzman T. Lajtha A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Nakanishi H. Tominaga K. Amano T. Hirotsu I. Inoue T. Yamamoto K. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 126: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cathepsin D exists in both a soluble and a membrane-associated form (37Diment S. Leech M.S. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6901-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Williams K.P. Smith J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the latter of which favors its role in processing membrane-associated proteins such as βAPP. Cathepsin D also displays an amino acid specificity consistent with the amino acid sequences in the vicinity of putative β- and/or γ-secretase sites (39van Noort J.M. van der Drift A.C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14159-14164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence against a role of cathepsin D in the formation of βA4 includes the fact that the levels of cathepsin D activity in AD tissue are not significantly different from those of controls (40Mantle D. Falkous G. Ishiura S. Perry R.H. Perry E.K. J. Neurol. Sci. 1995; 131: 65-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that the overexpression of this enzyme in cell culture does not enhance the level of βA4 secretion (41Munger J.S. Haass C. Lemere C.A. Shi G.-P. Wong F. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Chapman H.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine the ability of cathepsin D to function as either a β- or γ-secretase, in vitro assays were developed to study the proteolytic activity of cathepsin D on synthetic peptide substrates that span either the β- or γ-secretase sites (27Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1994; 1: 263-280Google Scholar, 29Schenk D.B. Rydel R.E. May P. Little S. Panetta J. Lieberburg I. Sinha S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4141-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 42Evin G. Cappai R. Li Q.-X. Culvenor J.G. Small D.H. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14185-14192Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 43Ladror U.S. Snyder S.W. Wang G.T. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18422-18428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies showed that cathepsin D is able to cleave these substrates at sites consistent with either a β- or a γ-secretase, better evidence implicating cathepsin D as a secretase enzyme was obtained by studying the in vitro activity of cathepsin D on βAPP itself. The production of amyloidogenic carboxyl-terminal fragments of βAPP starting from a βAPP695 substrate was a demonstration of cathepsin D's ability to cleave βAPP near the β-secretase site and, hence, an illustration of a possible β-secretase activity for this enzyme (44Dreyer R.N. Bausch K.M. Fracasso P. Hammond L.J. Wunderlich D. Wirak D.O. Davis G. Brini C.M. Buckholz T.M. Konig G. Kamarck M.E. Tamburini P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise, cathepsin D was able to further process an amyloidogenic carboxyl-terminal βAPP substrate (corresponding to a β-secretase product), suggesting a γ-secretase activity for the enzyme (42Evin G. Cappai R. Li Q.-X. Culvenor J.G. Small D.H. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14185-14192Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, since the precise cathepsin D cleavage sites were not characterized at the amino acid sequence level and since no βA4 was detected, the ability of cathepsin D to cleave βAPP substrates at relevant sites was not fully established. In this study, we further investigated the potential role of cathepsin D in βAPP processing by developing sensitive in vitro assays for evaluating the proteolytic activity of this enzyme on various βAPP substrates. Improvements in the methods used to detect and to characterize hydrophobic cleavage products has allowed us to identify precise βAPP cleavage sites within the vicinity of the βA4 domain. These cleavage sites provide important clues regarding the function of cathepsin D in βAPP processing. Bovine cathepsin D (EC 3.4.23.5), 15 units/mg of protein, was from Sigma. Human liver cathepsin D (8 units/mg of protein) was either from Calbiochem or purified according to published procedures (45Gulnick S. Baldwin E.T. Tarasova N. Erickson J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Enzyme purity was assessed by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed phase methods. In addition, control assays performed in the presence of the aspartic protease inhibitor, pepstatin, showed complete inhibition of all protease activity, confirming the lack of contaminating protease activities. One cathepsin D unit produces an increase in A280 of 1.0/min at pH 3.0, 37°C measured as trichloroacetic acid-soluble products using hemoglobin as a substrate. The synthetic peptide: Ac-Orn-GGVVIATVI-Orn-NH2 was synthesized by standard solid phase methods on an Applied Biosystems Biosynthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purified to single peak homogeneity by RP-HPLC. This peptide spans the βA4 γ-secretase site (Gly37-Ile45) but is very hydrophobic since it comprises a portion of the transmembrane domain of βAPP. To enhance the solubility of this peptide in the low pH range, ornithine residues were included at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends. The polyclonal antiserum, BC-1, directed to the cytoplasmic domain of βAPP (705-730 of βAPP751 sequence) was described previously (17Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity column was from Eastman Kodak Co. Brij35 and Brij30 were purchased from Sigma. In order to construct the DNA encoding βAPP156 tagged with FLAG at the amino terminus and a bFGF epitope at the carboxyl terminus, a FLAG-βAPP751 was first made by inserting a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the signal sequence of βAPP, a FLAG epitope, and the first three amino acids of βAPP into a KpnI-SmaI-digested pGEM vector containing βAPP751. This insertion added the FLAG sequence immediately 5′ to the βAPP751 sequence. Next, the sequence encoding a bFGF epitope was added to the 3′ end of the βAPP sequence. This was accomplished by first introducing a MluI restriction site at the 3′ end of βAPP751 by in vitro mutagenesis. A double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the bFGF tag was then ligated into this MluI site. This FLAG-βAPP751-bFGF vector was then used to construct a baculovirus FLAG-βAPP156-bFGF expression vector. The FLAG-βAPP751-bFGF plasmid DNA was digested with KpnI and BsmI to remove a 1745-base pair sequence encoding the amino-terminal residues of βAPP751 from Pro4 to Trp602. A 23-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide was ligated into the KpnI-BsmI sites to create a fusion between βAPP751 Pro4-Leu596. This FLAG-βAPP156-bFGF construct was then digested with SmaI-XmnI and the sequence encoding FLAG-βAPP156-bFGF was blunt-end ligated into filled-in NheI-digested baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The chimeric baculovirus expression vector was used to express the βAPP derivative in SF9 insect cells. A 1-liter culture of infected SF9 cells was harvested and lysed in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (reduced) and 5 mM EDTA. The cell suspension was adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100 by dilution with PBS and centrifuged at 27,000 × g, for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was applied to an anti-bFGF affinity column and eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 3.0 containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions containing FLAG-βAPP156-bFGF were immediately neutralized with Tris, adjusted to 0.1 M CaCl2, and applied to an anti-FLAG M1 affinity column. FLAG-βAPP156-bFGF was eluted with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mM EDTA. The βAPP100-FLAG used in this study was expressed and purified as described by Mackay et al. 2E. A. Mackay, A. Ehrhard, M. Moniatte, C. Guenet, C. Tardif, C. Tarnus, O. Sorokine, B. Heintzelmann, C. Nay, J.-M., Remy, J. Higaki, A. Van Dorsselaer, J. Wagner, C. Danzin, and P. Mamont, manuscript in preparation. A 6-μg sample of Ac-Orn-GGVVIATVI-Orn-NH2 was digested with 1 μg (0.008 units) of human cathepsin D in 80 μl of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 3.5, for 2 h at 37°C. The enzyme to substrate molar ratio was 1:200. Following digestion, the sample was immediately analyzed by RP-HPLC on a Hewlett Packard HP 1050Q automated LC system equipped with a Vydac C18 (0.46 × 15 cm) column equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was with a linear acetonitrile gradient (1%/min) at room temperature. Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. A 3-ml sample of purified FLAG-βAPP156-bFGF (90 μg) was diluted to 5 ml with 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 3.5. A 55-μg sample (0.83 unit) of bovine cathepsin D was added to the substrate to yield a final enzyme to substrate molar ratio of 1:5. The mixture was allowed to digest at 37°C for variable time periods. A 2-h digestion period was routinely used after it was found that the major product peaks were present in greatest abundance after this time period. After digestion, a 500-μl sample was immediately subjected to RP-HPLC separation on a Vydac C4 column (0.46 × 5 cm) equilibrated in 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Elution was performed at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a linear acetonitrile gradient (3.75%/min) at room temperature. Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. Urea-denatured βAPP156 was prepared by resuspending 100 μg of βAPP156 in 100 μl of 8.0 M urea. A 50-μl sample was then added to 450 μl of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 3.5, and 3.0 μg (0.05 unit) of bovine cathepsin D were added. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C. Following digestion, a 200-μl aliquot was injected onto a Vydac C18 column (0.46 × 15 cm) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was eluted with an acetonitrile gradient (1.3%/min). Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. A 30-μl sample of purified βAPP100 (24 μg) was diluted to 75 μl with 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 3.5, and digested with a 2.4-μg sample (0.02 unit) of human cathepsin D. The enzyme to substrate molar ratio was 1:30. The mixture was allowed to digest at 37°C for variable time periods. As with the βAPP156 substrate described above, a 2-h digestion period was routinely used after it was found that the major product peaks were present in greatest abundance after this time period. After digestion, a 10-μl sample was subjected to capillary RP-HPLC separation using an HP1050 LC system adapted for capillary HPLC separations as described in Guzzetta et al. 3A. W. Guzzetta, L.-L., Kang, and H.-T. N. Truong, manuscript in preparation. A constant LC flow rate setting of 0.2 ml/min provided a column flow rate of 8 μl/min. The capillary column used in these experiments was a 25 cm × 0.32-mm inside diameter, 5-μm Vydac C18 column (300 Å) (Microtech Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). The column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with acetonitrile at room temperature. Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm using a Kratos/ABI 757 UV detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a capillary UV flow cell (LC Packings, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Peak fractions collected off the RP-HPLC were dried down, redissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated on a 16.5% Tris-HCl-Tricine polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylene difluoride membrane, blocked with blocking buffer (4% (w/v) fish gelatin, 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS) for 1 h, then transferred to blocking buffer containing a 1:300 dilution of BC-1 polyclonal antisera (17Higaki J.

The filter was then developed with an anti-rabbit Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and reacted with the horseradish peroxidase substrate, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories). Peak fractions from the cathepsin D digestion of βAPP156 were collected off a RP-HPLC column (Vydac C4, 0.46 × 15 cm), dried, and subjected to Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer in-line with a 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Alternatively, to reduce sample loss and to enhance sensitivity, capillary RP-HPLC fractions were collected directly onto Porton filters (Beckmen Instruments) and subjected to sequence analysis using an ABI 470A gas-phase sequencer in-line with an Hewlett Packard HP1090 HPLC. This latter technique allowed the direct sequencing of as little as 2-5 pmol of sample. HPLC-mass spectral (LC/MS) analysis was performed using an SSQ 7000 Finnigan MAT mass spectrometer equipped with a Finnigan electrospray source. The spray voltage was set at 4500 volts. For source collision-induced dissociation experiments, the scans were cycled through the following experiments: scan 1, 100-2000 m/z with a scan duration of 2 s, octapole offset 15 volts; scan 2, 100-2000 m/z with a scan duration of 2 s, octapole offset 25 volts; and scan 3, 300-2000 m/z with a scan duration of 2 s, octapole offset 3 volts.

We have previously shown that when cultured macrophages are loaded with cholesterol, they acquire the ability to internalize and lysosomally degrade Lp(a) via interaction between a novel cell-surface receptor activity and the apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) moiety of Lp(a). Herein we explore the cell-surface binding of recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) by foam cells. Whereas the induction of degradation of r-apo(a) by cholesterol loading of macrophages depended on new protein synthesis, the induction of binding of r-apo(a) did not. Furthermore, J774 macrophages bound r-apo(a) in a cholesterol-regulatable and specific manner but degraded r-apo(a) poorly. Thus, the binding and internalization/degradation functions of the receptor activity are distinct. To explore which domains on r-apo(a) interact with the foam cell receptor, we conducted a series of competitive and direct binding and degradation experiments using 12 r-apo(a) constructs that differed in their content of specific kringle subtypes. These data, as well as complementary data with anti-apo(a) monoclonal antibodies, indicated that the region centered around kringle type IV, subtypes 6-7 (KIV6-7) is important in receptor binding. Remarkably, a cholesterol-induced receptor activity with similar structural specificity was also found on Chinese hamster ovary cells. In conclusion, the foam cell Lp(a)/apo(a) receptor consists of a cholesterol-regulatable binding activity and a short-lived component necessary for internalization or lysosomal degradation; the binding activity interacts with a distinct region of apo(a) that is different from that involved in competition for plasminogen binding.

Apo(a) consists of multiple domains called kringles, which are regions of protein folds each stabilized by three disulfide bonds (3McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.-J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y.

The mechanism of Lp(a)-induced atherosclerosis is not known. Several groups of investigators have postulated that the ability of Lp(a) to compete for plasminogen binding sites on cells is important in certain potentially atherogenic processes, such as decreased fibronolysis (9Hajjar K.A.

Another possible clue to the potential atherogenicity of Lp(a) comes from the observation that Lp(a) and apo(a) are often physically in contact with cholesterol-loaded macrophages (foam cells) (13Niendorf A.

In previous work, we have demonstrated that mouse peritoneal and human monocyte-derived macrophages have a receptor activity that can bind, internalize, and lysosomally degrade Lp(a) (17Bottalico L.A.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, the receptor activity is induced by cholesterol loading (17Bottalico L.A. Keesler G.A. Fless G.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8569-8573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and down-regulated by interferon-γ (19Skiba P. Keesler G.A. Li Y. Tabas I. Circulation. 1993; 88: I-272Google Scholar), suggesting possible roles in atherosclerosis and inflammation. The receptor recognizes the apo(a) moiety of Lp(a) and interacts similarly with Lp(a) and a 17-kringle recombinant apo(a) construct (17Bottalico L.A. Keesler G.A. Fless G.M. Tabas I. J. Biol.

We have shown that this foam cell receptor is distinct from the LDL receptor, the scavenger receptor, the LDL receptor-related protein, and plasminogen receptors (17Bottalico L.A. Keesler G.A.

Keesler and I. Tabas, unpublished data. To further elucidate how the foam cell Lp(a)/apo(a) receptor interacts with apo(a), the present study was designed to determine which sites on apo(a) bind to the receptor. By conducting a series of competitive and direct binding and degradation experiments using 12 recombinant apo(a) constructs and two anti-apo(a) monoclonal antibodies, we show that the region centered around KIV6-7 is important in receptor binding. Furthermore, additional studies revealed that the receptor consists of distinct binding and internalization/degradation activities. Finally, we took advantage of a CHO cell line that could be cholesterol loaded to show that this cell type also has a cholesterol-inducible receptor that recognizes the KIV6-7 region of apo(a). The Falcon tissue culture plasticware used in these studies was purchased from Fisher. Tissue culture media and reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum was purchased from Gemini Bioproducts (Calabasas, CA). Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was prepared from fetal calf serum by preparative ultracentrifugation (density, 1.21 g/ml). Na125I (carrier free) was obtained from DuPont NEN. Compound 58035 (3-[decyldimethylsilyl]-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylethyl]propanamide) (21Ross A.C. Go K.J. Heider J.G. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

Stock solutions (10 mg/ml) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Monoclonal antibody 12C11 raised against the apo(a) moiety of human Lp(a) was purchased from Perimmune, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Monoclonal antibody 8B4 raised against human Lp(a) was generously provided by Dr. Gunther Fless, University of Chicago. These monoclonal antibodies were previously shown to recognize Lp(a) and apo(a), but not plasminogen, by immunoblot analysis, but neither had been further characterized before this report. Immunoaffinity chromatography (Table I) was performed by covalently linking anti-apo(a) monoclonal antibodies 8B4 and 12C11 to Affi-Gel-10 matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 200 μg of each antibody was reacted with 1 ml of Affi-Gel-10 in 100 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, for 3 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel. After 3 h, the matrix was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant was removed. All remaining active sites on the matrix were blocked by the addition of 100 mM ethanolamine, pH 7.4, by incubating for 1 h at 4°C. Matrix not linked to antibody (control matrix) was made by incubating the Affi-Gel-10 with ethanolamine only. The control and antibody-conjugated matrices were then washed extensively with NET buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4). Each 125I-kringle construct (6.0 μg, 100-800 cpm/ng) was first incubated with control matrix for 1 h at 4°C; after this initial pre-clearing step, the matrix was pelleted, and aliquots of the supernatant, which contained greater than 99% each of the 125I-recombinant kringle peptides, were incubated overnight at 4°C with each of the two antibody-conjugated matrices. The matrices were then washed extensively in NET buffer with an SDS concentration of 1.0%, followed by several washes in NET buffer containing 1.5 M NaCl. The matrices were re-equilibrated in the original NET buffer (0.1% SDS and 150 mM NaCl), and antibody-125I-kringle complex was disassociated by the addition of NET buffer containing 50 mM glycine HCl, pH 2.5; the eluate was neutralized using NaOH. Recovery of radioactivity during this procedure was greater than 90%.TABLE IInteraction of 125I-r-aop(a) constructs with anti-apo(a) monoclonal antibodies125I-r-apo(a) constructAmount 125I-r-apo(a) pelleted by mAb ·; Affi-Gel complex8B412C11% of total17K6952(KIV2)555516K887KIV5-88414 Open table in a new tab LDL (density, 1.020-1.063 g/ml) from fresh human plasma and β-VLDL (density, <1.006 g/ml) from the serum of cholesterol-fed rabbits (22Tabas I.

All concentrations of lipoproteins are given in terms of their protein content with bovine serum albumin as a standard. All lipoprotein preparations were stored under argon at 4°C and used within 4 weeks. Lp(a) was iodinated using the iodine monochloride method, as described previously (17Bottalico L.A. Keesler G.A. Fless G.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8569-8573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-lipoprotein cholesterol was added to media from a 20 mg/ml stock in ethanol; the final concentration of ethanol (also added to control wells) was 0.25%.

Two days prior to an assay, the cells were harvested from the spinner, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, and plated on 16-mm tissue culture wells in 24-well dishes. Resident mouse peritoneal macrophages from female ICR mice (20-25 g) were plated in 16-mm dishes in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum as described (26Tabas I. Boykow G.C. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CHO-mSRAII cells, which were transfected with a murine macrophage scavenger receptor (class AII) cDNA (27Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Monty Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). These cells were grown in monolayer culture in Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Unless indicated otherwise, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1 h after plating and then incubated for 2 days in DMEM, 10% LPDS alone or containing the indicated sources of cholesterol. Four hours before the beginning of the binding or degradation assay, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with DMEM containing 0.2% BSA in order to remove residual surface-bound lipid. The recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) derivatives used to identify the domains in apo(a) that mediate binding to the macrophage receptor are shown schematically in Fig. 1. All of the apo(a) derivatives illustrated were assembled in the expression vector pRK5, which contains the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and SV40 termination sequences (28Suva L.J. Winslow G.A.

The construction and expression of pRK5ha17, which encodes a 17-kringle form of r-apo(a) (17K in Fig. 1), has been described previously (20Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmids encoding the r-apo(a) derivatives 12K, 6K, KIV6-P, KIV7-P, KIV8-P, and KIV9-P has also been described elsewhere (29Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; PubMed Google Scholar). For the construction of (KIV2)5, the cDNA clone λa6 (3McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.-J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar) was partially digested with BamHI. A fragment encoding four copies of kringle IV subtype 2 was isolated and ligated into the single kringle IV type 2 expression construct (30Sangrar W. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that had been digested with BamHI. An expression plasmid encoding apo(a) kringle IV subtype 10 followed by the kringle V and protease domain sequences was generated as follows: a construct encoding single kringle IV subtype 10 (30Sangrar W. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was digested with AvrII; the resultant 580-bp fragment was replaced with a 1,678-bp AvrII fragment isolated from pRK5ha17, which contains the latter 22 bp of kringle IV subtype 10, followed by sequences encoding the kringle V and protease domains. The resultant expression construct was designated pRK5haIV10-P. An expression plasmid encoding apo(a) kringle IV subtypes 6-7 was constructed using a three-part ligation. A 735-bp EcoRI/AluI fragment (encoding the signal sequence followed by the complete sequence of KIV6 and the first 325 bp of KIV7) was obtained by digestion of KIV6-P (see above) with EcoRI and AluI. In order to obtain the latter 17 bp of kringle IV subtype 7 followed by a stop codon, we digested an expression plasmid encoding single kringle IV subtype 7 with AluI and SalI; the latter construct was generated using overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (30Sangrar W. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The EcoRI/AluI fragment and the AluI/SalI fragment were ligated into pRK5 that had been digested with EcoRI and SalI; the resulting expression plasmid was designated as pRK5haIV6-7. For the construction of a plasmid encoding kringle subtypes 5-8, we utilized the pRK5ha6 construct, which has been previously described (29Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; PubMed Google Scholar). We digested the latter plasmid with HindIII and AluI; this released a 1,509-bp fragment that encodes the latter 242 bp of kringle IV subtype 5, followed by the complete sequence of kringle IV subtype 6, and the first 325 bp of kringle IV subtype 7. In order to obtain the latter 17 bp of kringle IV subtype 7, followed by the complete sequence of kringle IV subtype 8 and a stop codon, we utilized PCR to generate a 365-bp fragment spanning this region; the 5′ PCR primer was designed to anneal to a sequence 5′ to the AluI site in kringle IV subtype 7, while the 3′ PCR primer was designed to anneal to the 3′ end of the kringle IV subtype 8 sequence and contained a stop codon and SalI restriction site. The HindIII/AluI fragment and the AluI/SalI-digested PCR product were ligated into pRKha6 that had been digested with HindIII and SalI; the resultant expression construct was designated pRK5ha5-8. In order to construct an expression plasmid encoding apo(a) kringle IV subtypes 6-8, we utilized a three-part ligation as follows. An expression plasmid encoding KIV6-P (see above) was digested with EcoRI and AluI, giving rise to a 735-bp fragment that encoded the signal sequence, followed by the complete sequence of KIV6 and the first 325 bp of KIV7. In order to obtain the final 17 bp of KIV7, followed by the complete sequence encoding KIV8 with a stop codon at the 3′ end, we digested the plasmid encoding KIV5-8 (above) with AluI and SalI. This fragment (380 bp) and the 735-bp EcoRI/AluI fragment (above) were ligated into pRK5 that had been digested with EcoRI and SalI. The final expression plasmid was designated as pRK5haIV6-8. The r-apo(a) derivatives shown in Fig. 1 were used to stably transfect human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) (31Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen.

Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of each expression plasmid was co-transfected with 1 μg of plasmid encoding the neomycin resistance gene (33Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing cells in the presence of the antibiotic G418 (800 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (20Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressing the various apo(a) derivatives were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (29Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; PubMed Google Scholar). All of the r-apo(a) derivatives, with the exception of (KIV2)5, were purified by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) columns (29Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; PubMed Google Scholar). The r-apo(a) derivative (KIV2)5 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using an anti-apo(a) polyclonal antibody, raised in rabbits (34Koschinsky M.L. Beisiegel U. Henne-Bruns D. Eaton D.L.

Briefly, conditioned medium (OptiMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) from 293 cells expressing (KIV2)5 was applied to a 5-ml immunoaffinity column, and the column was washed with 5 volumes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 135 mM NaCl), followed by 10 volumes of TBS containing 1 M NaCl and final 5 volumes of TBS. Specifically bound protein was eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.3, and 1-ml fractions were collected into 100 μl of 1 M Tris base. Fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). All proteins were judged to be pure by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Following purification, proteins were stored at −70°C and shipped from Kingston to New York on dry ice via overnight courier. Proteins were stored at −70°C prior to use, at which time the integrity of the preparations was verified by SDS-PAGE. The r-apo(a) constructs were iodinated by the IODO-BEAD method (Pierce) as described (18Keesler G.A. Li Y. Skiba P.J. Fless G.M. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μg of each construct was reacted with 200 μCi of carrier-free 125I and one IODO-BEAD for 4 min. Unreacted 125I was removed either by dialysis or by PD-10 gel filtration chromatography (Pharmacia). The 125I-labeled constructs were at least 95% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable, had a specific activity of 100-800 cpm/ng, and were used within 2 weeks of the labeling procedure. After the preincubations described in the text and figure legends, the cells were washed with PBS, incubated for the indicated times with 10 or 25 nM125I-labeled ligand in 0.5 ml of DMEM, 0.2% BSA, and then assayed for binding (cf. Ref. (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) and below) or degradation (17Bottalico L.A. Keesler G.A. Fless G.M.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the binding assay, the cells were cooled for 1 h at 4°C before the addition of ligand and then incubated with 125I-labeled r-apo(a) at 4°C for 3 h, at which point 125I-r-apo(a) binding had reached equilibrium (not shown). The assay was terminated by removing the 125I-ligand and washing the cells twice in succession with each of the following solutions: PBS containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2 (solution I); solution I plus 2% BSA; and PBS. The cells were then solubilized in 0.1 N NaOH, and the amount of cell-associated 125I radioactivity was determined by gamma counting. The data are expressed per mg of cellular DNA, which was determined by a minor modification (36Skiba P.J. Keesler G.A. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23059-23067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method of Labarca and Paigen (37Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal.

Absent error bars signify S.D. values smaller than the graphics symbols. In our previous studies, we assayed the macrophage foam cell Lp(a)/apo(a) receptor assay by measuring internalization and lysosomal degradation of 125I-labeled ligand (17Bottalico L.A. Keesler G.A. Fless G.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8569-8573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Keesler G.A. Li Y. Skiba P.J. Fless G.M. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With this assay, we showed that cholesterol-mediated induction of receptor activity was dependent upon new protein synthesis (18Keesler G.A. Li Y. Skiba P.J. Fless G.M. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further explore this point, we assayed cell-surface binding of 125I-r-apo(a) to macrophages and foam cells. The r-apo(a) used for these studies, called 17K, is shown as the top construct in Fig. 1; it consists of all 10 of the kringle IV (KIV) subtypes, including eight copies of KIV2 (17 KIV domains in all), plus kringle V and the protease domain (20Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As shown previously, the foam cell receptor interacts with the apo(a) moiety of Lp(a), and experiments utilizing 125I-17K have yielded similar results as those using 125I-Lp(a) (17Bottalico L.A. Keesler G.A. Fless G.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8569-8573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Keesler G.A. Li Y. Skiba P.J. Fless G.M. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We first tested whether the binding activity of the receptor was induced by cholesterol loading and, if so, whether the induction required new protein synthesis. The surprising results with mouse peritoneal macrophages are shown in Fig. 2A. The data depicted by the diagonal-hatched bars verify our previous results mentioned above, namely that 125I-17K degradation is induced in mouse peritoneal macrophage foam cells and that the induction is blocked by treatment of the foam cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (18Keesler G.A.

Here we identify the gene encoding the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) as the first example of a gene activated in neuronal cells by Oct-2. The levels of the nNOS mRNA and protein are greatly reduced in neuronal cell lines in which Oct-2 levels have been reduced by an antisense method, although these cells have enhanced levels of tyrosine hydroxylase. Moreover, the nNOS gene regulatory region is activated by Oct-2 expression vectors upon cotransfection into both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and this response is dependent upon a 20-amino acid region within the COOH-terminal activation domain of Oct-2. Of the two closely linked promoters that drive nNOS gene expression, only the downstream 5.1 promoter is activated by Oct-2, whereas the 5.2 promoter is unaffected.

The Oct-2 transcription factor is a member of the POU 1The abbreviations used are: POUPit-Oct-UncnNOSneuronal nitric-oxide synthaseBHKbaby hamster kidneyPCRpolymerase chain reaction. (Pit-Oct-Unc) family of transcription factors that contain a bipartite DNA binding domain consisting of a POU-specific domain and a POU homeodomain (for reviews, see 1Verrijzer C.R.

Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This POU domain allows the Oct-2 factor to bind to the octamer sequence ATGCAAAT, which is found in the promoter and enhancer regions of several cellular genes including those encoding the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulin (for review, see 3Falkner F.G. Moickat R. Zachau H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 13: 7847-7863Google Scholar). The original identification of the Oct-2 factor as being expressed in B lymphocytes and not in other cell types led to the suggestion that this factor plays a critical role in the regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression in B lymphocytes (4Staudt L.H. Singh H. Sen R. Wirth T. Sharp P.A. Baltimore D. Nature. 1986; 323: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 5Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea the immunoglobulin enhancer exhibits a dramatically reduced activity in B cells lacking Oct-2 (6Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Ulmer C. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and knockout mice lacking a functional Oct-2 gene show defects in B cell maturation and response to antigen (7Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J.V. Ye Z.-S. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Moreover, these knockout mice also exhibit a lack of CD36 expression in their B lymphocytes, identifying the gene encoding this factor as another target for activation by Oct-2 in B lymphocytes (8Konig H.

Although Oct-2 is absent in most non-B cells, it was subsequently shown by a number of different laboratories to be expressed in neuronal cells in the brain (9He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1989; 340: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 10Scholer H.R. Hatzopoulos A.K. Balling R.

Neuron. 1992; 841: 541-558Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the single gene encoding Oct-2 is subject to alternative splicing to generate mRNAs encoding different isoforms (14Wirth T. Priess A. Annweiler A. Zwilling S. Oeler B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and this alternative splicing is regulated in a tissue-specific manner (15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, B lymphocytes contain predominantly the Oct-2.1 isoform, which contains a strong COOH-terminal activation domain and therefore has a predominantly stimulatory effect on gene expression (15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, this isoform is present at a relatively lower level in neuronal cells where the Oct-2.4 and 2.5 isoforms predominate (15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since these isoforms lack the COOH-terminal activation domain they have an inhibitory effect on the activity of a number of different promoters (15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the available evidence suggests that in neuronal cells Oct-2 has a predominantly inhibitory effect on gene expression. Thus, the presence of Oct-2 in these cells is associated with an inhibition of the activity of the herpes simplex virus immediate-early gene promoters that contain the octamer-related TAATGARAT motif, which mediates repression by Oct-2 (11Kemp L.M. Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Lillycrop K.A. Dent C.L. Wheatley S.C. Beech M.N. Ninkina N.N. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1991; 7: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown previously that the neuronally expressed tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter is repressed by cotransfection with Oct-2.4 and 2.5 expression vectors (17Dawson S.J. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This effect was dependent upon a specific Oct-2 binding site in the promoter (17Dawson S.J. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) correlating with earlier studies in which mutation of this site within the transfected tyrosine hydroxylase promoter greatly enhanced its activity in neuronal cells (18Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To confirm the idea that the Oct-2 transcription factor can inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in neuronal cells, we recently used an antisense approach to reduce greatly the expression of Oct-2 in the ND7 neuronal cell line (19Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) which expresses high levels of Oct-2 (12Lillycrop K.A. Dent C.L. Wheatley S.C. Beech M.N. Ninkina N.N. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1991; 7: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These antisense cell lines (20Deans Z. Dawson S.J. Buttery L. Polak J.M. Wallace D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) did indeed exhibit greatly enhanced expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, confirming that Oct-2 does inhibit the expression of the endogenous tyrosine hydroxylase gene. In an attempt to identify other targets for regulation by Oct-2 we used immunohistochemistry to screen these cells for altered expression of a number of different neuronal expressed proteins compared with control ND7 cells. In these experiments most proteins showed no alteration in expression, but surprisingly the antisense cells showed decreased expression of the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) protein (20Deans Z. Dawson S.J. Buttery L. Polak J.M. Wallace D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) which is expressed in specific cells within the central nervous system (21Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither parental ND7 cells nor the antisense cells showed any detectable expression of either the inducible NOS or the endothelial NOS, which, like nNOS, can generate nitric oxide from L-arginine. Hence, this effect was specific for nNOS, suggesting that the gene encoding this protein might be a target for positive regulation by Oct-2 in neuronal cells. To confirm this possibility and analyze its mechanism, we have quantitated the Oct-2 mRNA and protein in our antisense cells and characterized the effect of various isoforms of Oct-2 on the two promoters of the nNOS gene. BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, U. K.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and ND7 cells were grown in Lebowitz L-15 medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml streptomycin and penicillin (Life Technologies), and 3 g/liter glucose. The stably transfected ND7 cell lines, 22f and 16e, were routinely grown in normal ND7 growth medium (see above) supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418 (final concentration) to maintain the transfected Oct-2 antisense plasmid. Antisense expression was induced by the addition of 1 μM dexamethasone (final concentration) to growth medium for 24 h. The reporter gene constructs containing different regions of the human nNOS promoter driving the luciferase gene have been described previously (22Xie J. Roddy P. Rife T.K. Murad F. Young A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Oct-2 expression vectors contain different isoforms of Oct-2 under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter and have been described previously (14Wirth T. Priess A. Annweiler A. Zwilling S. Oeler B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Muller-Immergluck A.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). BHK or ND7 cells (1 × 106 cells) grown on a 90-mm plate were transfected with 10 μg of Oct-2 expression vector according to the method described by Gorman (24Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Eynsham U. K.1985: 143-190Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection; after total protein determination (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) an aliquot of cell extract was slot blotted and hybridized with an ampicillin resistance gene probe to determine DNA plasmid uptake (26Abken H. Reifenrath B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were carried out with volumes of cell extract containing equal amounts of DNA plasmid. Total cell protein extracts (100 μg) were separated in a 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotted as described by Dhillon et al. (27Dhillon V.B. McCallum S. Wilks D. Twomey B.M. Latchman D.S. Isenberg D.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The nNos polyclonal antibody was used at a dilution of 1/500 (Affiniti Research Products Ltd., Mamhead, Exeter, U. K.), and the pGp9.5 antibody (Ultraclone, U. K.) was diluted at 1/10,000. All Western blots were quantitated by densitometric scanning. Total cellular RNA was prepared using RNAzolB (Biogenesis, Poole, U. K.) (28Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) and first strand cDNA synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) primed with random sequence hexanucleotides (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) (29Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfard D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 21-27Crossref Google Scholar). An aliquot of total cDNA reaction (1/8) was subjected to PCR amplification. nNOS was amplified using 0.5 μg/μl each of primers NOS1 5′-GCAACAGCGACAATTGAC-3′ and NOS2 5′-CAGACATAAATGTGGCCTCC-3′ (30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 58°C, 30 s at 72°C) for 25 cycles with 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Bucks, U. K.) in a total volume of 100 μl. Rat ribosomal L27 cDNA was amplified from the same cDNA reactions as described above with primers Rib1.5′-ATCGCTCCTCAAACTTGACC-3′ and Rib3.5′-AACTACAACCACCTCATGCC-3′, using an annealing temperature of 56°C for 20 cycles and was used to normalize from small differences in cDNA synthesis between samples. PCRs were analyzed by separation on a 2% agarose gel, Southern blotting, and hybridization with homologous DNA fragments. Quantification was carried out by exposure of Southern blots to PhosphorImager screens for 2 h overnight and scanning by a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager. In previous experiments (20Deans Z. Dawson S.J. Buttery L. Polak J.M. Wallace D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) we obtained two cell lines 16e and 22f, which exhibited decreased levels of the Oct-2 transcription factor compared with the parental ND7 cells. The 22f and 16e cells were obtained by transfection with a construct containing a 5′ region of the Oct-2 mRNA common to all of the different isoforms inserted in the antisense orientation in the expression vector pJ5 (30Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), which contains the dexamethasone-inducible promoter of mouse mammary tumor virus. They thus contain a lowered level of Oct-2 compared with the parental ND7 cells which is reduced further when increased expression of the antisense construct is induced with dexamethasone (20Deans Z. Dawson S.J. Buttery L. Polak J.M. Wallace D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In initial experiments (20Deans Z. Dawson S.J. Buttery L. Polak J.M. Wallace D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) both cell lines demonstrated a reduced proportion of cells staining with an antibody to nNOS compared with the parental ND7 cells. To quantitate the level of nNOS in the antisense cells, we performed quantitative Western blotting using an antibody specific to nNOS. The levels of nNOS in each cell line were then obtained by densitometric scanning and comparison with the levels of the neuronal pGp9.5 protein, which we have shown previously to be present at similar levels in all of the cell lines (20Deans Z. Dawson S.J. Buttery L. Polak J.M. Wallace D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1 both the 22f and 16e cell lines exhibited a dramatically reduced level of the nNOS protein when compared with the parental ND7 cells, which was observed both in the presence and absence of dexamethasone. Hence the antisense cells lines do exhibit a clear decrease in the level of the nNOS protein paralleling their decreased levels of Oct-2. We next wished to investigate whether this fall in nNOS protein was paralleled by a decrease in the nNOS mRNA as would be expected if the Oct-2 factor regulates the transcription of the nNOS gene. We therefore used a reverse transcriptase/PCR method to measure the level of the nNOS mRNA in our cell lines. This semiquantitative method relies on a comparison of the amount of PCR product obtained by amplification of the test mRNA (amplified with specific primers) with that obtained upon amplification of a control mRNA encoding ribosomal L27 protein, which is present at similar levels in all samples. We have used this method previously to measure successfully the level of a number of different mRNAs in neuronal cells (31Kendall G. Ensor E. Brar-Rai A. Winter J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Kendall G. Brar-Rai A. Ensor E. Winter J. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2, using this method we were able to demonstrate a clear decrease in the level of the nNOS mRNA particularly in the 22f cell line where a considerable decrease in nNOS mRNA levels was noted upon dexamethasone treatment to induce enhanced expression of the antisense construct. The larger effect observed in the 22f cell line is consistent with the larger decrease in the Oct-2 mRNA in this cell line compared with the 16e cell line, which we observed in our previous experiments (20Deans Z. Dawson S.J. Buttery L. Polak J.M. Wallace D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hence the lowered level of the nNOS protein in this cell line is indeed paralleled by a decreased level of the nNOS mRNA, suggesting that the Oct-2 factor may indeed affect transcription of the nNOS gene directly. To investigate further the effect of Oct-2 on the nNOS gene, we utilized a construct in which 4.3 kilobases of the upstream regulatory region of the nNOS gene have been linked to a reporter gene encoding the readily assayable luciferase protein (22Xie J. Roddy P. Rife T.K. Murad F. Young A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This construct was cotransfected into both BHK fibroblast cells, which lack endogenous Oct-2 (12Lillycrop K.A. Dent C.L. Wheatley S.C. Beech M.N. Ninkina N.N. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1991; 7: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the parental unmanipulated ND7 cells together with expression vectors encoding the various isoforms of Oct-2. In these experiments (Fig. 3) the nNOS promoter was clearly up-regulated in BHK cells by cotransfection with the Oct-2.1 vector and to a lesser extent with the vector expressing Oct-2.5, whereas the expression vector encoding Oct-2.4 did not appear to have a stimulatory effect. Hence the expression of at least one of the isoforms of Oct-2 can strongly activate the nNOS promoter in a non-neuronal cell line lacking endogenous Oct-2. Interestingly, activation of the nNOS promoter by Oct-2 was also observed in the ND7 cell line, which expresses endogenous Oct-2, although in this case all three of the different isoforms of Oct-2 were able to activate the nNOS promoter strongly. As expected, the promoterless vector containing the luciferase gene was unaffected by any of the forms of Oct-2, confirming that these effects were specific to the nNOS promoter and indicating that this promoter can be activated directly by Oct-2. In previous experiments, it has been shown that different forms of the Oct-2 factor contain both an activation domain (23Muller-Immergluck A.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and an inhibitory domain (16Lillycrop K.A. Dawson S.J. Estridge J.K. Gerster T. Matthias P. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7633-7642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which are located NH2-terminal to the central DNA binding POU domain. In addition, the Oct-2.1 isoform contains a COOH-terminal activation domain that is not present in Oct-2.4 or 2.5. To determine which of the activation domains of Oct-2 was responsible for its ability to stimulate the nNOS promoter the promoter/reporter construct was cotransfected with deletion mutants of Oct-2.1 lacking either the NH2-terminal region (but retaining the POU domain and COOH-terminal region) or lacking the COOH-terminal domain (but retaining the NH2-terminal and POU domains) (23Muller-Immergluck A.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In these experiments (Fig. 3) the NH2-terminal deletion exhibited even stronger activation of the nNOS promoter than did Oct-2.1, whereas the COOH-terminal deletion exhibited virtually no stimulatory effect on the promoter. This suggests therefore that the ability of Oct-2 to stimulate the nNOS promoter is dependent primarily upon the COOH-terminal activation domain, whereas the presence of the NH2-terminal domain, if anything, reduces the ability to stimulate the promoter. To determine the precise region of the COOH terminus involved in activation of the nNOS promoter we used a series of deletion mutants lacking progressively larger numbers of COOH-terminal amino acids (33Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In these experiments (Fig. 4) deletion of the most COOH-terminal 18 amino acids produced some reduction in the activation of the nNOS promoter compared with the effect of intact Oct-2.1. However, deletion of an additional 20 amino acids resulting in a construct lacking the COOH-terminal 38 amino acids totally abolished activation of the nNOS promoter; the same effect was also observed with a construct lacking the COOH-terminal 87 amino acids. Hence the amino acids from 446 to 463 play some role in the induction of the nNOS promoter, whereas loss of the 20 amino acids between positions 426 and 445 of Oct-2 abolishes its ability to activate the nNOS promoter. It has been shown previously that the nNOS gene contains two closely linked promoters located within 300 base pairs of each other (22Xie J. Roddy P. Rife T.K. Murad F. Young A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To determine whether one or both of these promoters were inducible by Oct-2, we utilized constructs that contain either the 300 base pairs of 5′ sequence specific to the nNOS 5.1 promoter (pNOS 5′1b) or 1.8 kilobases of upstream sequence specific to the nNOS 5.2 promoter. These promoter constructs were transfected into BHK and ND7 cells as before. As illustrated in Fig. 5 the nNOS 5.1 promoter was activated by Oct-2.1 more strongly than by Oct 2.5 in BHK cells, whereas it was unaffected by cotransfection with Oct-2.4. Moreover, this promoter was similarly activated by all of the different Oct-2 forms in ND7 cells. The behavior of this promoter thus mimics the behavior of the construct containing both the promoters (compare Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In contrast, the nNOS 5.2 promoter (pNOS L) was unaffected by cotransfection with any of the forms of Oct-2 in BHK cells, although it was activated weakly by Oct-2.1 in ND7 cells. Hence, the effect of Oct-2 on the nNOS gene appears to be mediated by the 5.1 promoter, whereas it has no effect upon the 5.2 promoter. The data presented here identify the nNOS gene as the first example of a neuronally expressed gene that is positively regulated by Oct-2. Thus, the levels of nNOS mRNA and protein fall in our cell lines expressing lowered levels of Oct-2 in contrast to the enhanced levels of tyrosine hydroxylase levels expressed by these cells. Moreover, one of the two promoters that drive the expression of the nNOS gene is strongly stimulated by Oct-2, whereas the other is relatively unaffected. Activity of the two nNOS promoters produces two distinct mRNAs that encode the same protein but differ in their 5′-translated region (22Xie J. Roddy P. Rife T.K. Murad F. Young A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is likely therefore that the use of these two promoters plays some role in the regulation of the nNOS gene in specific situations. In this regard, it is of interest that the reduction of Oct-2 expression in the antisense cell lines had a more severe effect on nNOS protein levels than on the corresponding mRNA levels (compare Fig. 1, Fig. 2), suggesting that Oct-2 may regulate an nNOS mRNA that is translated preferentially compared with the non-regulated mRNA. Whether this is the case or not, it will be of particular interest to compare the expression of Oct-2 in different neuronal cells in vivo with that of the nNOS gene and its different transcripts. Thus, we have shown previously that the Oct-2 gene is expressed in sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (12Lillycrop K.A. Dent C.L. Wheatley S.C. Beech M.N. Ninkina N.N. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. Neuron. 1991; 7: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32Kendall G. Brar-Rai A. Ensor E. Winter J. Wood J.N. Latchman D.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) which also express nNOS (34Aimi Y. Fujimura M. Vincent S.R. Kimura H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 306: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Moreover, both Oct-2 (35Begbie J.L. Wood J.N. Anderson P.N. Latchman D.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 207: 185-186Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and nNOS (36Verge V.M.K. Xu A. Xu X.-J. Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Hokfelt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11617-11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) increase in abundance in dorsal root ganglia neurons following axotomy. Thus, changes in Oct-2 expression following exposure to various stimuli may play a key role in modulating nNOS expression following exposure to such stimuli as well as potentially regulating its basal expression in different neuronal cell types. In this manner, changes in Oct-2 would result in alterations in nNOS expression in response to specific stimuli allowing it to fulfill its important functional roles in the normal and damaged brain (for review, see 37Choi D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9741-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar and 38Edelman G.M. Gally J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11651-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This would parallel the potential role of Oct-2 in regulating tyrosine hydroxylase expression in response to stressful stimuli, although in this case Oct-2 represses tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression rather than activating it. The opposite effect of Oct-2 on the nNOS and tyrosine hydroxylase promoters raises the question of the mechanisms of this effect. In our experiments the strongest activation of the nNOS promoter was observed with the Oct-2.1 form of the factor which contains a functional activation domain. In agreement with the critical role of this domain, its deletion results in a large reduction in stimulation of the nNOS promoter. Previous studies using artificial octamer motif-containing promoters suggested that the 85 amino acids at the COOH terminus of Oct-2 (39Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and in particular the extreme 18 COOH-terminal amino acids (33Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were critical for promoter activation. Our studies using the natural nNOS promoter suggest only a relatively small role for the 18 COOH-terminal amino acids and indicate that the adjacent 20 amino acids within the COOH-terminal region are critical for activation of this promoter. Oct-2.1, which contains these critical amino acids, constitutes approximately 40% of the mRNA in the ND7 cell line (15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is likely therefore to play a key role in the positive effect of Oct-2 on nNOS gene expression, which we observed in this cell line. However, the majority of the mRNA in this cell line encodes the Oct-2.4 and 2.5 isoforms, which lack the COOH-terminal activation domain and in BHK cells seems to have either no or a much smaller stimulatory effect on the nNOS promoter. Interestingly, however, in ND7 cells these forms can also strongly stimulate the nNOS promoter, suggesting that other neuron-specific factors may potentiate the ability of Oct-2.4 and 2.5 to activate the nNOS promoter. Such cell type-specific differences in the effects of different Oct-2 isoforms are not without precedent. Thus, when cotransfected into BHK cells with the herpes simplex virus immediate-early gene promoter Oct-2.1 activates the promoter, whereas Oct-2.4 and 2.5 do not, producing a pattern of effects which is similar to the effects on the nNOS promoter in this cell type. (15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, however, in ND7 cells all of the isoforms of Oct-2 repress the herpes simplex virus immediate-early promoter, accounting for the strong repression of this promoter which is observed in neuronal cells (15Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that such an inhibitory effect of Oct-2.1 on the immediate-early promoter can also be produced in BHK cells artificially expressing Oct-2.4 or 2.5 (40Lillycrop K.A. Liu Y.Z. Theil T. Moroy T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, this effect is dependent upon an interaction between Oct-2.1 and either Oct-2.4 or 2.5, which converts Oct-2.1 from an activator to a repressor of the immediate-early promoter. It is therefore possible that a similar interaction with endogenous Oct-2.1 in the ND7 cells confers upon Oct-2.4 or 2.5 the ability to activate the nNOS promoter in these cells. Alternatively, this effect may be dependent upon another factor expressed in the ND7 cells which allows Oct-2.4 or 2.5 to activate the nNOS promoter despite the absence of the COOH-terminal activation domain present in Oct-2.1. These ideas indicate, however, that the nNOS promoter is likely to have a so far unique architecture that allows it to respond to Oct-2.1 in a positive fashion in neuronal cells even in the presence of Oct-2.4 or 2.5. Upon examination of the 300-base pair region that is unique to the nNOS 5.1 promoter (22Xie J. Roddy P. Rife T.K. Murad F. Young A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 41Hall A.V. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A.H. Arbus A.M. Olson S.L. Lu W.C. Kau C.-L. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we did not identify any sequence closely related to the normal binding site of Oct-2 (ATGCAAAT:3). It is possible therefore that the unique response pattern of the nNOS promoter is produced by a response element that is distinct or only distantly related in sequence to the consensus octamer motif found in most cellular promoters. Alternatively, this unique response may depend on the fact that unlike the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter, the nNOS 5.1 promoter lacks a TATA box (22Xie J. Roddy P. Rife T.K. Murad F. Young A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, we have shown previously that the Oct-2 inhibitory domain that represses transcription of the tyrosine hydroxylase and immediate-early gene promoters can do so only when the target promoter contains a TATA box (42Liu Y.-Z.

Further studies of the nNOS promoter region will obviously be necessary to confirm these possibilities. Whatever the case, it is clear that the data presented here identify the nNOS gene as the first example of a neuronal gene that is positively regulated by Oct-2 and suggest that the Oct-2 transcription factor may play an important role in regulating the vital function of nNOS within the nervous system. We thank Thomas Gerster for the Oct-2 COOH-terminal truncation constructs; Patrick Matthias for the NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants of Oct-2; and Thomas Wirth for the Oct-2.1, 2.4, and 2.5 expression vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2026828802,"An investigation of the effects of a number of inositol trisphosphate analogues on the transient kinetics of Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes was undertaken. All the analogues investigated could release the total Ca2+ content of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) mobilizable Ca2+ store; however, their potencies were substantially reduced compared to Ins(1,4,5)P3. The concentration required to induce half-maximal Ca2+ mobilization was 0.14 μM for Ins(1,4,5)P3, 1.8 μM for 3-deoxyinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (3-deoxyInsP3), 1.0 μM for 2,3-dideoxyinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (2,3-dideoxyInsP3), 24 μM for 2,3,6-trideoxyinositol 1,4,5-trisphopshate (2,3,6-trideoxyInsP3), and 2.9 μM for inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(2,4,5)P3). In all cases and for all concentrations tested, the inositol trisphosphate analogues induced biphasic transient release of Ca2+, which could fit to a biexponential equation assuming two independent processes. The rate constants calculated for the release process were much larger for Ins(1,4,5)P3 than the other inositol trisphosphates (the fast phase rate constant varying from 0.3 to 1.6 s−1 and the slow phase from 0.01-0.5 s−1, at concentrations between 0.03 and 20 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3). The rate constants for all other inositol trisphosphates did not appear to exceed 0.4 s−1 for the fast phase and 0.1 s−1 for the slow phase at their highest concentrations tested. The maximum amplitudes for Ca2+ release by the two phases appeared to be similar for all inositol trisphosphates (approximately 45% for the fast phase and approximately 55% for the slow phase). On comparing the rate constants for Ca2+ release at inositol trisphosphate concentrations for the analogues which all induced the same extent of Ca2+ release, it was apparent that the rates of release were independent of the extent of Ca2+ release. As the extent of Ca2+ release can be related to degree of occupancy of the binding sites, it is evident that different analogues which occupy the binding site of the receptor to the same extent can induce Ca2+ to be released at different rates. We explain this conclusion in terms of partial agonism where inositol phosphates can induce two (or more) occupied states of the channel.

We explain this conclusion in terms of partial agonism where inositol phosphates can induce two (or more) occupied states of the channel. Certain hormones and neurotransmitters induce cells to produce the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), 1The abbreviations used are: Ins(1,4,5)P3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIns(2,4,5)P3inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate3-deoxyInsP33-deoxyinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate2,3-dideoxyInsP32,3-dideoxyinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate2,3,6-trideoxyInsP32,3,6-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIC50concentration causing half-maximal response. which opens an InsP3-sensitive calcium channel (the InsP3 receptor) causing the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F Nature. 1984; 361: 315-321Crossref Scopus (6186) Google Scholar). This then activates a diverse multitude of cellular processes which depend on the cell type (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F Nature. 1984; 361: 315-321Crossref Scopus (6186) Google Scholar). InsP3-induced Ca2+ release is a complex process which, despite considerable study, remains poorly understood. Several studies have demonstrated that the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release is “quantal” in nature where submaximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 are unable to fully discharge the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool unless maximal Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentrations are added (2Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Michelangeli F. Mezna M. Tovey S. Sayers L.G. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mechanism for quantal Ca2+ release induced by Ins(1,4,5)P3 remains unknown, even though this process appears to be adopted by other intracellular Ca2+ channels (4Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B Berridge M.J. Stauderman K.A. Murawsky M.M. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27076-27083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to explain this mechanism have lead to the proposal of several models based on either the existence of heterogeneous Ca2+ stores which contain Ca2+ channels with different sensitivities to InsP3, discharging their Ca2+ in an all-or-nothing manner (5Oldershaw K.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), or homogeneous Ca2+ stores which discharge their Ca2+ in a regulated fashion, possibly controlled by luminal Ca2+, Ca2+ gradients, or limited desensitization (6Irvine R.F.

A more elaborate approach to investigating InsP3-induced Ca2+ release is to study the transient kinetics of this process. Such studies using permeabilized hepatocytes, basophilic leukemia cells, cerebellar microsomes, and purified-reconstituted InsP3 receptors have shown InsP3-induced Ca2+ release to be a relatively fast and biphasic process (9Champeil P.

These studies have therefore proved useful in aiding our understanding into the mechanism of channel opening. The use of InsP3 analogues in studies of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release and binding to the channel have also helped shed light on our understanding of the pharmacological and functional properties of this transport protein (3Michelangeli F. Mezna M. Tovey S. Sayers L.G. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Nahorski S.R. Potter B.V.L. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1989; 10: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Many of these analogues are able to release Ca2+ to the same extent and in a similar manner to Ins(1,4,5)P3, albeit with much lower affinities/potencies and have therefore been classified as “full agonists” (3Michelangeli F. Mezna M. Tovey S. Sayers L.G. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, some inositol phosphate analogues are able to bind to the channel and completely displace bound [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, yet unable to induce Ca2+ release, and these have been classified as “full antagonists” (3Michelangeli F. Mezna M. Tovey S. Sayers L.G. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the effects of a variety of inositol trisphosphate analogues (all of which are full agonists) on the transient kinetics of Ca2+ release with the view to understanding how these ligands influence the mechanism of channel opening. D-myo-Ins(1,4,5)P3, D-myo-3-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P3, D-myo-2,3-dideoxyIns(1,4,5)P3, D-myo-2,3,6-trideoxyIns(1,4,5)P3, Ins(2,4,5)P3, and fluo-3 were all obtained from Calbiochem or Sigma. Chelex 100 was purchased from Bio-Rad, and phosphocreatine, creatine kinase, and ATP were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were of analytical grade. In order to avoid any calcium contamination when using the inositol trisphosphate analogues, all InsP3 analogues were dissolved in double deionized water and treated with Chelex 100 resin prior to use. Rat cerebellar microsomes were prepared as described previously (14Mezna M. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28097-28102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately 20 cerebella were homogenized in 10 volumes of buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μM pepstatin A, and 50 μM benzamidine and then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of the same buffer and again centrifuged as above. The resulting supernatants were pooled and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant gained from this step was then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in approximately 2 ml of the buffer and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Ca2+ uptake and release were measured as described in 14Mezna M. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28097-28102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Typically, 300 μg of rat cerebellar microsomes were suspended in 2 ml of 40 mM Tris/phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 37°C in the presence of 10 mM phosphocreatine, 10 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 1.25 μM fluo-3. The mixture was incubated at 37°C, and Ca2+ uptake was initiated by the addition of 1.5 mM MgATP. Ca2+ transport across the microsomal membrane was followed by monitoring the fluorescence change of fluo-3 in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorimeter by exciting at 505 nm and measuring the emission at 525 nm. When sufficient Ca2+ was taken up, the pump was inhibited by the addition of between 75 and 150 μM orthovanadate (which was found to cause more than 90% inhibition (15Brown G.R. Benyon S.L. Kirk C.J.

When the Ca2+ level reached a new steady state, InsP3 (or the analogues) were added, and fluorescence change was measured. The amount of Ca2+ release was expressed as a percentage of that which was released by 12.5 μg/ml A23187.

Ca2+ uptake by the microsomes was followed in a conventional fluorimeter and inhibited with orthovanadate once sufficient uptake had taken place. It was then transferred to a syringe A of a stopped flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics, Model SX17 MV). Syringe B was filled with InsP3 analogues at a concentration 10 times that required since the mixing ratio of syringe A to syringe B is 10:1. The temperature of the syringe compartment was maintained at 37°C by a circulating water bath. The fluorescence change of fluo-3 was then monitored by exciting the sample at 505 nm and measuring the emission above 515 nm using a cut-off filter. The data were collected, and an average was determined from between 8 and 12 traces. Fluorescence intensities were then correlated to [Ca2+] by comparing the traces to identical experiments carried out in a conventional fluorimeter. The traces were analyzed using nonlinear regression analyses programs supplied by Applied Photophysics and Biosoft. InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in the microsomal preparation under study was shown to be biphasic and fit well to a biexponential equation (Equation 2) which assumes two independent processes. [Ca2+]release=A1(1−exp−k/t)+A2(1−exp−k2t)(Eq. 2) where A1, A2, k1, and k2 are the amplitudes (relative extent of Ca2+ release) and rate constants of Ca2+ release for the fast and slow phases, respectively, and t is the time (s). Over the Ca2+ concentration range for which the IICR was monitored, the fluorescence change when related to [Ca2+] was around the Kd value for Ca2+ binding to fluo-3, and, over this range, the fluorescence was shown to be linearly related to [Ca2+] (linear regression coefficient, r > 0.99). Fig. 1 shows the dose-dependent response of several InsP3 analogues on Ca2+ release. All the analogues acted as full InsP3 agonists with respect to the extent of Ca2+ release since they all appear to give (or approach) the maximal response to that observed with optimal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3. In addition, all the analogues exhibited quantal release behavior. In the preparation used in this study, the maximal extent of Ca2+ release was 23 ± 3% compared with that released by A23187, which was induced by approximately 3-10 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3. The concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 causing half-maximal response (IC50) was found to be 0.14 ± 0.03 μM. The deoxy derivatives of InsP3 were found to be less potent in releasing Ca2+. 3-DeoxyInsP3 had an IC50 of 1.8 ± 0.2 μM, while 2,3-dideoxyInsP3 had an IC50 of 1.0 ± 0.2 μM. The 2,3,6-trideoxyInsP3 was much less potent, requiring greater than 0.3 mM to reach maximal release (IC50 24 ± 2 μM). In addition to the deoxyInsP3 analogues, the isomer Ins(2,4,5)P3 was also shown to have a lower potency than Ins(1,4,5)P3, requiring greater than 30 μM for maximum Ca2+ release (IC50 for Ca2+ release 2.9 ± 0.3 μM). The apparent cooperativity of the extent of Ca2+ release was, however, found to be similar for all analogues tested (Hill coefficients were 1.0 ± 0.2 in all cases). Fig. 2 shows the time-resolved Ca2+ release traces induced by Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2A), Ins(2,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2E), and the three deoxy analogues (3-deoxy-, Fig. 2B; 2,3-dideoxy-, Fig. 2C; 2,3,6-trideoxy-, Fig. 2D). As shown, each individual trace could be fitted extremely well to the biexponential equation (Equation 2), and all χ2 values for these fits were less than 0.1. The resulting rates of Ca2+ release obtained from these fits show that both fast and slow rate constants increase with increasing agonist concentration and in some cases appear to saturate (Fig. 3, A and B). The fast phase rate constants for Ca2+ release with Ins(1,4,5)P3 increases from 0.3 to 1.5 s−1 at concentrations between 30 nM and 20 μM (Fig. 3A) and from 0.02 s−1 to 0.5 s−1 for the slow phase over the same concentration range (Fig. 3B). A Hill coefficient of ≈1.0 was calculated from the rate constants of the fast phase with Ins(1,4,5)P3, which is in agreement with the findings of Finch et al. (18Finch E.A Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), but at variance with the findings presented in 9Champeil P. Combettes L. Berthon B. Doucet E. Orlowski S. Claret M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17665-17673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 10Meyer T. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar. Although the deoxyInsP3 analogues released Ca2+ in a similar fashion to Ins(1,4,5)P3, with the release process in each case also being biphasic, the rate constants for Ca2+ release were, however, much lower than those of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Higher concentrations of the InsP3 analogues were required in order to attain the rate constants for Ca2+ release observed with even the lowest concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 used. When comparing the rate constants for both the fast and slow phases at the maximum concentrations of the analogues used, the values were never greater than 25-30% of those observed with 10 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that the amplitudes (or extent) of Ca2+ release by these analogues also increase with increasing analogue concentrations. These results demonstrate that, in this preparation, the contribution of the fast phase to the total amplitude (or extent) of Ca2+ release by Ins(1,4,5)P3 was ≈45% and the slow phase was ≈55%. The proportions each phase contributes to the total extent of Ca2+ release appears to be independent of InsP3 analogues used since fast and slow phase amplitudes all reached similar levels of release. These results clearly indicate that the contribution each phase has on the total extent of Ca2+ release is predefined, for any particular preparation used, as only a maximum specified extent of Ca2+ can be released in association with any given phase. Since there are differences in the potencies between InsP3 analogues such that different concentrations are required in order to release similar levels of Ca2+, a comparison of the fast and slow rate constants for Ca2+ release at analogue concentrations which release 30% and 80% of the total InsP3-releasable Ca2+ pool was undertaken. Fig. 5, A and B, shows the relationship between the extent of Ca2+ release and the rate constants, both at 30% Ca2+ release or 80% Ca2+ release. This figure clearly demonstrates that there is no direct correlation between the extent of Ca2+ release and the rate constants. Different analogues at concentrations which release the same extent of Ca2+ do so at different rates. The kinetic properties of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel remains something of a mystery despite extensive study. The inability of low concentrations of InsP3 to mobilize all the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores has led to the development of several theoretical models (5Oldershaw K.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem.

Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the hope of gaining further insights into how this channel operates, we employed stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry to study the transient kinetics of Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes using a number of different InsP3 analogues. Our data show good agreement with those of a previous study by Kozikowski et al. (19Kozikowski A.P. Ognyanov V.I. Fauq A.H. Nahorski S.R. Wilcox R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4429-4434Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using these deoxyInsP3 analogues. They investigated the effects of these analogues on the extent of Ca2+ release and their ability to displace [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 and showed that Ins(1,4,5)P3 was the most potent at inducing Ca2+ release, 2,3,6-trideoxyInsP3 was the least potent, and the others were in between. These results demonstrate the importance of hydroxy groups and their positions on the inositol ring, in activating the channel. Detailed analysis of their data showed a direct correlation between Ca2+ releasing ability (concentration required for half-maximal release) and binding ability (measured as the concentration required to half-maximally displace bound [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3) (Fig. 6). This correlation, which was initially reported for several other inositol phosphate analogues (20Stauderman K.A. Harris G.D. Lovenberg W. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar), also holds when comparing our IC50 values for Ca2+ release with the Ki values determined for binding as given in 19Kozikowski A.P. Ognyanov V.I. Fauq A.H. Nahorski S.R. Wilcox R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4429-4434Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar (Fig. 6), even though in these studies the binding measurements were done under experimental conditions different from those for Ca2+ release. Such a correlation has led to the proposal that the potency of all inositol phosphates in opening the channel is directly related to occupancy, and, thus, low efficacy inositol phosphates require higher concentrations in order to occupy the binding site before they induce channel opening. It is therefore widely believed that, for full agonists, the extent of occupancy directly relates to the extent of channel opening and therefore presumably the Ca2+ release process would be similar for all analogues which are occupying the receptor to the same extent. However, it is clear from Fig. 5 that the rate constants for Ca2+ release are not the same for any given extent of release, they are dependent upon the structure of the InsP3 analogue and the concentration used. From this observation it must be concluded that the InsP3 receptor can distinguish between different InsP3 analogues occupying the binding site and alter the rate at which Ca2+ flows through the channel accordingly. One possibility to explain such an observation would be to assume the existence of 2 occupied states of the receptor. This assumption is not inconceivable since some inositol phosphates can act as antagonists, e.g. InsP6 etc. (3Michelangeli F. Mezna M. Tovey S. Sayers L.G. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These inositol phosphates were shown to bind to the receptor displacing [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 without inducing Ca2+ release. Thus, in one state the receptor is occupied by an inositol phosphate antagonist which stabilizes the receptor in an occupied but “unproductive” conformation, while in the other state, stabilized in the presence of Ins(1,4,5)P3, the receptor adopts an occupied and “productive” conformation which leads to channel opening. Presumably these two states exist due to different contacts being made by the inositol phosphates in the binding domain of the receptor. If these two states exist in dynamic equilibrium, it could be envisaged that some inositol phosphates could in fact induce both conformational states at any given time of occupancy, sometimes the ligand would form contacts which lead to channel opening (productive state), and sometimes it would not (unproductive state) (see Scheme 1). Assuming full occupancy, in such a scheme the extent of Ca2+ release would eventually be the same as that observed for Ins(1,4,5)P3, but by virtue of the fact that since some of the time the receptor would be in a productive state, eventually all the mobilizable Ca2+ would be released. However, the rates for Ca2+ release would be slower than those observed for Ins(1,4,5)P3. The rate constants for Ca2+ release would therefore depend upon the forward and backward rate constants for these two states and thus equilibrium constant for the two states induced by a particular inositol phosphate. In such a mechanism, the equilibrium constant for Ins(1,4,5)P3 would be much greater than that for 2,3,6-trideoxyInsP3. As the rate constants for Ca2+ release never reach the values of those observed for Ins(1,4,5)P3, these analogues must therefore be classified as “partial agonists.” Such a model involving two or more occupied states, as outlined here, has also been proposed to explain partial agonism in other types of receptors (22Rang H.P. Dale M.M. J. Neurosci. Pharmacology. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1991: 3-23Google Scholar). Recently, another class of inositol phosphates which includes Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, L-ch-Ins(2,3,5)PS3, and D-6-deoxy-myo-Ins(1,4,5)PS3 (3Michelangeli F. Mezna M. Tovey S. Sayers L.G.

Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 499-503PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to induce Ca2+ release through the InsP3 receptor, but are unable to release Ca2+ to the same extent as seen with maximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3. These analogues have also been classified as partial agonists. Therefore, in order to avoid confusion between these two classes, we suggest that partial agonists of the type which cannot mobilize all the Ins(1,4,5)P3 mobilizable Ca2+ pool be classified as class I, whereas partial agonists, of the type described in this paper which can mobilize all the Ins(1,4,5)P3 releasable Ca2+ pool but whose rates are lower than those observed with Ins(1,4,5)P3, be classified as class 2. The nature of the partial agonism by class 1 is yet to be investigated; however, if we assume that each phase is due to a distinct population of Ca2+ stores which have functionally different InsP3 receptors, it would be tempting to speculate that these agents may selectively affect only one of these two populations.

INTRODUCTIONBase excision repair provides organisms a major line of defense against a multitude of base damage including UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, alkylation, and misincorporation (1Lloyd R.S. Linn S. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Vol. II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 263-316Google Scholar). The initiating cascade of events in base excision repair includes specific site location, damage recognition, and excision of the improper or modified base by a DNA glycosylase. All DNA glycosylases catalyze the breakage of the N-C1′ glycosyl bond linking the damaged base to the sugar phosphate backbone. A subset of these glycosylases has a concomitant apurinic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: APapurinicBSAbovine serum albuminbpbase pair(s). lyase activity, which catalyzes a β-elimination reaction leaving a 3′α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and a 5′ phosphate. This product is then further processed by an endonuclease to create a 3′-OH for polymerization and ligation.T4 endonuclease V has served as the prototype for mechanistic studies of the molecular basis of recognition and catalysis for the glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes, including determination of the active site (2Schrock R.D.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). T4 endonuclease V is a 16-kDa cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase with an associated AP lyase activity. It has been shown that T4 endonuclease V binds DNA through electrostatic interactions and then scans along the helix in a salt-dependent one-dimensional search until a pyrimidine dimer is encountered (6Lloyd R.S. Hanawalt P.C. Dodson M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5113-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme then cleaves the N-glycosyl bond between the base and the sugar on the 5′ side of the dimer and subsequently cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the pyrimidines.The x-ray crystal structure of T4 endonuclease V has been solved and has revealed the presence of a glutamic acid residue (Glu-23) near the active site nucleophile (Thr-2), thus implicating this acidic residue in the reaction chemistry (8Morikawa K.

Recently, building on the vast amount of information obtained on T4 endonuclease V, a unified catalytic mechanism for DNA glycosylases and glycosylase/AP lyases, has been proposed (10Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the initial catalytic process proceeds by a nucleophilic attack at the sugar C1′ of the damaged base (Fig. 1, structure 1). It is proposed that the glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes use an amino group as the attacking nucleophile, resulting in an imino intermediate that can be trapped experimentally by reduction with NaBH4 (Fig. 1, structure 3). Enzymes with only the glycosylase activity use a nucleophile from the medium such as an activated water molecule. Recently, the co-crystal structure of a catalytically inactive T4 endonuclease V mutant (E23Q) with dimer containing DNA has been solved (11Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the crystal structure revealed a sharp kink in the DNA helix at the thymine dimer, and the adenine base opposite the 5′-thymine of the dimer is flipped out of the DNA duplex and into a pocket on the protein surface (11Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Although the biochemistry and structural information on T4 endonuclease V have led to the proposed catalytic mechanism and the identification of two active site groups (the N-terminal amino acid and Glu-23), there are still many gaps in our understanding of glycosylase mechanisms. One of the barriers to obtaining a detailed picture of the interactions of glycosylases with DNA is the relatively fleeting nature of the complexes that are formed. Thus, the production of stable long-lived complexes between DNA repair enzymes and DNA would facilitate an understanding of the interactions that occur prior to catalysis, including site-specific recognition and base flipping. In an effort to design molecules that bind DNA repair proteins in stable long-lived complexes suitable for structural analysis, Schärer et al. (12Schärer O.D. Ortholand J.-Y. Ganesan A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6623-6624Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) presented data on a pyrrolidine-based inhibitor for AlkA, an Escherichia coli DNA glycosylase. The pyrrolidine residue contains a positively charged nitrogen in place of the endocyclic oxygen mimicking a proposed transition state for glycosylases, where a positive charge is accumulated at the O1′/C1′ (Fig. 1, structure 2). Recently, Schärer et al. (12Schärer O.D. Ortholand J.-Y. Ganesan A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6623-6624Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that AlkA binds very tightly to this duplex with an apparent Kd of 16 pM and that this transition state analog also serves as a potent inhibitor for the AlkA-catalyzed reaction.This study utilizes the pyrrolidine inhibitor to make comparative measurements of binding affinities for T4 endonuclease V on a series of related DNA structures to gain insight into the mechanism of specific site recognition. This approach may prove useful to 1) examine the catalytic distinction between glycosylases and glycosylase/AP lyases, 2) determine the structural features of the DNA that mimic the transition state for UV-specific glycosylases, 3) determine the molecular architecture of the reaction intermediates, and 4) determine the structural features of the protein required for differential recognition and catalysis.

One of the barriers to obtaining a detailed picture of the interactions of glycosylases with DNA is the relatively fleeting nature of the complexes that are formed. Thus, the production of stable long-lived complexes between DNA repair enzymes and DNA would facilitate an understanding of the interactions that occur prior to catalysis, including site-specific recognition and base flipping. In an effort to design molecules that bind DNA repair proteins in stable long-lived complexes suitable for structural analysis, Schärer et al. (12Schärer O.D. Ortholand J.-Y. Ganesan A.

The pyrrolidine residue contains a positively charged nitrogen in place of the endocyclic oxygen mimicking a proposed transition state for glycosylases, where a positive charge is accumulated at the O1′/C1′ (Fig. 1, structure 2). Recently, Schärer et al. (12Schärer O.D. Ortholand J.-Y. Ganesan A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6623-6624Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that AlkA binds very tightly to this duplex with an apparent Kd of 16 pM and that this transition state analog also serves as a potent inhibitor for the AlkA-catalyzed reaction.This study utilizes the pyrrolidine inhibitor to make comparative measurements of binding affinities for T4 endonuclease V on a series of related DNA structures to gain insight into the mechanism of specific site recognition. This approach may prove useful to 1) examine the catalytic distinction between glycosylases and glycosylase/AP lyases, 2) determine the structural features of the DNA that mimic the transition state for UV-specific glycosylases, 3) determine the molecular architecture of the reaction intermediates, and 4) determine the structural features of the protein required for differential recognition and catalysis. Base excision repair provides organisms a major line of defense against a multitude of base damage including UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, alkylation, and misincorporation (1Lloyd R.S. Linn S. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Vol. II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 263-316Google Scholar). The initiating cascade of events in base excision repair includes specific site location, damage recognition, and excision of the improper or modified base by a DNA glycosylase. All DNA glycosylases catalyze the breakage of the N-C1′ glycosyl bond linking the damaged base to the sugar phosphate backbone. A subset of these glycosylases has a concomitant apurinic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: APapurinicBSAbovine serum albuminbpbase pair(s). lyase activity, which catalyzes a β-elimination reaction leaving a 3′α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and a 5′ phosphate.

T4 endonuclease V has served as the prototype for mechanistic studies of the molecular basis of recognition and catalysis for the glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes, including determination of the active site (2Schrock R.D.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). T4 endonuclease V is a 16-kDa cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase with an associated AP lyase activity. It has been shown that T4 endonuclease V binds DNA through electrostatic interactions and then scans along the helix in a salt-dependent one-dimensional search until a pyrimidine dimer is encountered (6Lloyd R.S. Hanawalt P.C. Dodson M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5113-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme then cleaves the N-glycosyl bond between the base and the sugar on the 5′ side of the dimer and subsequently cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the pyrimidines. The x-ray crystal structure of T4 endonuclease V has been solved and has revealed the presence of a glutamic acid residue (Glu-23) near the active site nucleophile (Thr-2), thus implicating this acidic residue in the reaction chemistry (8Morikawa K.

Recently, building on the vast amount of information obtained on T4 endonuclease V, a unified catalytic mechanism for DNA glycosylases and glycosylase/AP lyases, has been proposed (10Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the initial catalytic process proceeds by a nucleophilic attack at the sugar C1′ of the damaged base (Fig. 1, structure 1). It is proposed that the glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes use an amino group as the attacking nucleophile, resulting in an imino intermediate that can be trapped experimentally by reduction with NaBH4 (Fig. 1, structure 3). Enzymes with only the glycosylase activity use a nucleophile from the medium such as an activated water molecule. Recently, the co-crystal structure of a catalytically inactive T4 endonuclease V mutant (E23Q) with dimer containing DNA has been solved (11Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S.

In this work, we have examined the molecular mechanisms mediating the induction of apoD gene expression by retinoids in T-47D human breast cancer cells. Northern blot analysis revealed that Ro40-6055, a synthetic retinoid that selectively binds and activates the retinoic acid receptor RARα, induced the accumulation of apoD mRNA in breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The time course analysis demonstrated that apoD mRNA was induced 14-fold over control cells after 48 h of incubation with 10−8M Ro40-6055. As little as 10−11M of this retinoid induced apoD mRNA 5-fold over the control, whereas incubation with 10−7M Ro40-6055 induced maximally 15-fold over control cells. RARα-selective antagonists counteracted the inductive effects of all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, and Ro40-6055 on the expression of apoD, when present at the same concentration as the retinoid agonists. By contrast, RARβ-, RARγ-, and RXR-selective retinoids did not affect apoD gene expression. The retinoid agonist Ro40-6055 had an antiproliferative effect on T-47D cells, with maximal growth inhibition of approximately 60% obtained after 7 days of incubation with 10−7M. This antiproliferative effect could be counteracted by a 100-fold excess of the antagonist Ro41-5253. Treatment of the cells with retinoids that do not bind the nuclear retinoic acid receptors did not affect apoD expression, despite the fact that they did have a strong antiproliferative effect on T-47D cells. On the basis of these results, a role for RARα on apoD gene expression induction by retinoids in breast cancer cells is proposed.

Alaupovic P. FEBS Lett. 1973; 37: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). According to its structural characteristics, apoD is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins, which have a common function of transporting small hydrophobic molecules in different body fluids (2Drayna D. Fielding C. McLean J. Baer B. Castro G. Chen E. Comstock L. Henzel W. Korh W. Rhee L. Wio K. Lawn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16535-16539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific ligand associated with apoD remains unclear, and a variety of substances including cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, heme-related compounds, progesterone, and arachidonic acid have been described as putative ligands for this protein (2Drayna D. Fielding C. McLean J. Baer B. Castro G. Chen E. Comstock L. Henzel W. Korh W. Rhee L. Wio K. Lawn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16535-16539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Peitsch M.C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, the functional role of apoD is also unclear (6Weech P.K. Provost P. Tremblay N.M. Camato R.N. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Rassart E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Milne R.W. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 100-106Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although it is involved in a number of apparently unrelated biological and pathological processes. Thus, in the plasma, apoD mainly associates with high density lipoprotein particles and forms complexes with other apolipoproteins (8Blanco-Vaca F. Via D.P. Yang C. Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1785-1796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (9Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3327-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which has led to the suggestion that apoD may be involved in the early steps of the cholesterol transport from peripheral tissue to the liver (10Francone O.L. Gurakar A. Fielding C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production of apoD also has been correlated with some growth and regeneration processes. In particular, levels of apoD increase severalfold during the regeneration of peripheral nervous tissue in the rat (11Spreyer P. Schaal H. Kunh G. Rothe T. Unterbeck A. Olek K. Muller H.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Boyles J.K. Notterpek L.M. Anderson L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17805-17815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, our finding that apoD accumulates to extremely high concentrations in cyst fluid from women with gross cystic disease of the breast has led to the hypothesis that this protein may be involved in steroid hormone binding and transport in human mammary tissue (13Balbín M. Freije J.M.P. Fueyo A. Sánchez L.M. López-Otín C. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Sánchez L.M. Dez-Itza I. Vizoso F. López-Otín C. Clin.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 95-100PubMed Google Scholar).The relationship of apoD to pathological processes involving the human mammary gland has been extended further by the finding of a subtype of breast carcinomas that are able to produce and secrete this glycoprotein (16Silva J.S. Cox C.S. Wells S.A. Paull D. Dilley W.G. McCarty Jr., K.S. Fetter B.F. Glaubitz L.C. McCarty Sr., K.S. Surgery. 1982; 92: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lea O.A. Kvinnsland S. Thorsen T.

Merino A.M. Sánchez L.M. Tolivia J. Fernández J. Ruibal A. López-Otín C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 310-320PubMed Google Scholar). Because intratumor apoD values are significantly higher in well differentiated carcinomas than in those moderately or poorly differentiated (19Dez-Itza I. Vizoso F. Merino A.M. Sánchez L.M. Tolivia J. Fernández J. Ruibal A. López-Otín C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 310-320PubMed Google Scholar), we have recently examined the possibility that substances with potent differentiating effects, like retinoic acid and other vitamin A derivatives, could be involved in apoD expression by breast cancer cells. In fact, we have found that all-trans-, 9-cis-, and 13-cis-retinoic acid strongly induce the expression of apoD in estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, this increased expression of apoD was accompanied by an inhibition of cell proliferation and a progression through a more differentiated phenotype in these cells, which has led us to suggest that the mechanisms controlling RA-induced growth arrest, cell differentiation, and apoD synthesis may be directly coordinated in human breast cancer cells (20Lpez-Boado Y.S. Tolivia J. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for this marked induction of apoD mRNA by retinoids are presently unknown. However, it seems likely that their elucidation could contribute to clarify the role of these compounds in the biochemical pathways leading to apoD-increased expression in specific conditions, such as growth arrest and cell differentiation of breast cancer cells, as well as in peripheral nerve regeneration processes (11Spreyer P. Schaal H. Kunh G. Rothe T. Unterbeck A. Olek K. Muller H.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Boyles J.K. Notterpek L.M. Anderson L.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Here we examine the possibility that induction of apoD by retinoic acid analogs in breast cancer cells is a direct event mediated by the nuclear retinoic acid receptors. By using a series of receptor-selective agonist and antagonist retinoids, we present evidence for the involvement of a RARα-dependent signaling pathway in the stimulation of apoD gene expression by retinoids in breast cancer cells. We also show that activation of this pathway leads to a significant inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation. Finally, on the basis of the lack of apoD induction by retinoids which do not bind to nuclear retinoic acid receptors but are still able to inhibit cell proliferation, we propose that apoD may be a biochemical marker of RAR-mediated specific pathways of growth arrest in breast cancer cells.RESULTSIn previous work, we showed that retinoids up-regulate the expression of the apoD gene at the transcriptional level in human breast cancer cells. We also showed that the induction of apoD mRNA expression was independent of the de novo synthesis of proteins (20Lpez-Boado Y.S. Tolivia J. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the induction of apoD by RA in breast cancer cells may be a direct event, possibly mediated by nuclear retinoic acid receptors. To determine whether the receptors expressed by T-47D cells are functionally intact and to establish the type of response element that can be transactivated by these receptors, we initially studied the activity of different retinoids in T-47D cells transfected with DNA constructs containing the CAT reporter gene placed under the control of either a RARE or a RXRE (24Husmann M. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Hermann T. Tzukerman M. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4097-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The transactivation of the reporter gene was determined after treatment of the transfected cells with a number of agonistic and antagonistic retinoids (Fig. 1). A 10−8M concentration of all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, and the RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 caused a 15-, 19-, and a 12-fold increase in the transactivation of RARE-tk-CAT, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1A (lower panel). In addition, treatment of the transfected cells with the RARα-selective antagonist Ro41-5253, extensively abolished the transactivation by the retinoids of the reporter gene placed under the control of the RARE. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that concentrations of Ro41-5253 at least 100-fold higher than the concentrations of Ro40-6055 or all-trans-RA were necessary to completely block the transactivation (Fig. 1A and data not shown). We also studied the activity of the different retinoids in T-47D cells transfected with the construct containing the CAT gene under the control of the RXRE element of the cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII-tk-CAT). As shown in Fig. 1B, upon cotransfection with an expression plasmid containing RXRα, treatment of the transfected cells with 10−8M of the RXR-selective retinoid LG100064 produced a significant increment of CAT activity (about 17-fold). By contrast, treatment of the transfected cells with all-trans-RA, the RARα-selective retinoid (Ro40-6055), the RARβ-selective retinoid (Ro48-2249), and the RARγ-selective retinoid (Ro44-4753) did not produce any significant increase in the CAT activity placed under the control of the RXRE (Fig. 1B). In similar experiments in RXRα-transfected cells, the RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 was able to consistently induce CAT expression controlled by the RARE by 12-fold, while the RARβ-selective and RARγ-selective retinoids induced an increase in CAT activity of only 5- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest the existence in T-47D cells of functional retinoid signaling pathways, possibly mediated by different homo- or heterodimeric combinations of the receptors expressed by these breast cancer cells. Thus, the transactivation of the RARE by all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, and the RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 is very likely mediated by RARα, since it can be specifically competed by the RARα antagonist Ro41-5253, although contribution of RARβ- and γ-selective pathways cannot be definitively ruled out. By contrast, the RXRE seems to be exclusively transactivated by the RXR-specific retinoid LG100064, possibly through RXRα homodimers (29Zhang X. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 30Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Ping-Lu X. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).To investigate the mechanism of activation of the apoD gene by retinoic acid, we first evaluated by Northern blot analysis the effect of a number of different agonistic and antagonistic retinoids on the expression of the apoD gene in breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, incubation of T-47D cells with 10−8M concentrations of the RARα-selective agonists Ro40-6055 and Ro40-6973 induced an expression of the apoD gene comparable to that observed with all-trans-RA (1.1 and 0.7-fold, respectively). 9-cis-RA was about a 2-fold more potent inducer of apoD mRNA than the remaining retinoids. In addition, the RARα-selective antagonists Ro41-5253 and Ro46-5471 prevented all-trans-RA-induced accumulation of apoD mRNA, as well as the increase in the levels of apoD mRNA induced by 9-cis-RA and the RARα-selective agonists (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Fig. 2A also shows that treatment of the cells with the retinoid antagonists Ro41-5253 and Ro46-5471 alone did not have any effect on the expression of the apoD gene. After these results, we examined the possibility that retinoids selective for other RAR and RXR pathways could be also effective in apoD induction in breast cancer cells. To do that, T-47D cells were treated with 10−8M concentrations of the RARβ-selective (Ro48-2249) or the RARγ-selective (Ro44-4753) retinoids, and the apoD mRNA levels were examined by Northern blot. However, these retinoids did not have any marked effect on apoD gene expression (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the RXR-selective agonists SR11235, SR11246, and LG100064 were unable to induce apoD expression in T-47D cells (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effect of different retinoids on apolipoprotein D gene expression in T-47D cells. A, RNA blot analysis was performed using 10 μg of total RNA from T-47D cells cultured for 48 h with 10−8M all-trans-RA (t-RA), 9-cis-RA, RARα-selective agonists Ro40-6055 and Ro40-6973, and RARα-selective antagonists Ro41-5253 and Ro46-5471. The filters were hybridized with a 32P-labeled apoD probe under stringent conditions. Autoradiography was carried out for 24 h at −70°C with intensifying screens. Filters were subsequently hybridized to a human actin probe to ascertain the differences in RNA loading among the different samples. B, T-47D cells were treated for 48 h with 10−8M all-trans-RA, Ro40-6055, Ro40-6973, the RARβ-selective retinoid Ro48-2249, the RARγ-selective retinoid Ro44-4753, and the RXR-selective retinoids SR11235, SR11246, and LG100064. The figure represents one of three experiments that gave the same results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the effect of the RARα-selective retinoids on apoD gene expression, T-47D cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence of different concentrations of the RARα-selective agonist Ro40-6055, and total cellular RNAs were purified and analyzed by Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of the T-47D cells with the selective retinoid resulted in the accumulation of apoD mRNA at concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−11M. Incubation of the cells with 10−7M Ro40-6055 resulted in a maximal accumulation of approximately 15-fold over the control cells, whereas concentrations as low as 10−11M still produced an accumulation of apoD mRNA of about 5-fold over the control. Comparable results were obtained upon treatment of the T-47D cells with the other RARα-selective agonist, Ro40-6973 (data not shown). The time course of the induced accumulation of apoD mRNA was also studied in the presence of 10−8M Ro40-6055. As shown in Fig. 3B, there was a consistent increase with time in the steady-state apoD mRNA levels in treated T-47D cells, the maximal effect (about 12-fold over the control) being observed after 48 h and remaining constant for at least 72 h (data not shown). The extent of apoD mRNA accumulation induced by the RARα-selective retinoid was thus comparable to that previously observed for all-trans-RA (20Lpez-Boado Y.S. Tolivia J. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined whether the antagonistic effect of the RARα-selective retinoid Ro41-5253 on the RA-induced accumulation of apoD mRNA was dose-dependent. To this end, T-47D cells were treated for 48 h with 10−6M all-trans-RA and different concentrations of Ro41-5253. As shown in Fig. 4, equimolar concentrations of the RARα-selective antagonist blocked almost completely the induction of apoD mRNA accumulation by all-trans-RA, whereas treatment of the breast cancer cells with concentrations of the antagonist 10- to 100-fold lower than the concentration of RA resulted in lesser antagonism (about 2- and 4-fold lower, respectively).Fig. 3Time course and dose-response of the effect of the RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 on apolipoprotein D mRNA levels in T-47D cells. A, T-47D cells were incubated for 48 h with different concentrations of Ro40-6055, and total RNAs were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. B, T-47D cells were cultured in the presence of 10−8M Ro40-6055 for the indicated times, and total RNA from each culture was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot.

T-47D cells were incubated for 7 days with retinoids, and the total number of cells was determined at the end of the incubation period. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment of the T-47D cells in exponential growth with Ro40-6055 resulted in a marked decrease in cell number that was concentration-dependent. Maximal growth inhibition, with a reduction in cell number of about 60% compared with control was achieved with 10−7M Ro40-6055, while concentrations lower than 10−9M had only a minor effect on cell growth. Similar results were obtained when T-47D cells were incubated with the RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6973 (Fig. 5B). In all cases, differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01). It is interesting that the RARβ-selective agonist (Ro48-2249) also showed antiproliferative activity, although the effect is less remarkable than the one produced by the RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 (Fig. 5C). By contrast, the RARγ-selective agonist Ro44-4753 did not have a significant effect on cell growth at any concentrations tested (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the RARα-selective retinoid antagonist Ro41-5253, which did not have any effect on cell growth (Fig. 5E), nevertheless prevented the antiproliferative effect of the RARα-selective retinoid, when present at concentrations 100-fold higher than Ro40-6055 (Fig. 5F). By contrast, none of the different RXR-selective retinoids assayed displayed significant antiproliferative activity on cell growth (data not shown).Fig. 5Effect of different retinoids on T-47D cell proliferation. 24 h after plating, T-47D cells were incubated for 7 days with different retinoids. At the end of the incubation period, cell numbers were determined with a fluorimetric protein assay. A, T-47D cells were incubated with different concentrations of the RARα-specific agonist Ro40-6055. B, T-47D cells were incubated in the presence of the RARα-specific agonist Ro40-6973. C, T-47D cells were treated with different concentrations of the RARβ-specific agonist Ro48-2249. The effect of 10−7M Ro40-6055 is shown for comparison. D, T-47D cells were incubated with different concentrations of the RARγ-specific agonist Ro44-4753. The effect of 10−7M Ro40-6055 is shown for comparison. E, T-47D cells were treated with different concentrations of the RARα-specific antagonist Ro41-5253. F, T-47D cells were treated with different combinations of Ro40-6055 and Ro41-5253.

The first of these compounds is an arotinoid with strong antiproliferative activity in a number of human cancer cell lines in vitro (31Eliason J.F. Kaufmann F. Tanaka T. Tsukaguchi T. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but does not bind to the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (32Crettaz M. Baron A. Siegenthaler G. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly, the anti AP1- selective retinoid SR11238 is unable to transactivate the RARs despite effectiveness in triggering growth arrest of breast cancer cells (33Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G. Lu X.P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment of T-47D cells with 10−7M Ro40-8757 and SR11238 did not have any effect on the expression of the apoD gene. Cell growth analysis, however, confirmed their potent antiproliferative effect on T-47D cells (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the retinoids Ro40-8757 and SR11238 did not exhibit any transactivating activity of the RARE or the RXRE reporter genes (data not shown). These results provide additional evidence for the occurrence of separable pathways of retinoid-induced growth arrest in breast cancer cells, with apoD mRNA levels being up-regulated only in those cases in which RAR-mediated signaling pathways are involved.Fig. 6Effect of the retinoids Ro40-8757 and SR11238 on cell proliferation and apolipoprotein D mRNA levels in T-47D cells. A, T-47D cells were incubated for 48 h with 10−7M Ro40-8757, SR11238, and all-trans-RA (t-RA), and total RNAs were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Filters were hybridized with an apoD cDNA probe and a β-actin probe to verify equal loading of the samples. B, 24 h after plating, T-47D cells were incubated for 7 days in the presence of different concentrations of Ro40-8757, SR11238, and all-trans-RA. Retinoids were added to the growth medium in dimethyl sulfoxide solutions so that the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was 0.1% in both control and treated cultures, and media were changed every 2 days. At the end of the incubation period, cell number was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 5. The data are expressed as the mean of quadruplicate wells in three independent experiments.

Tolivia J. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this positive effect on apoD expression have not yet been elucidated, it is likely that retinoic acid receptors may be involved. In this work, we have examined the effect of agonistic and antagonistic receptor-selective retinoids, to shed light on the receptor(s) involved in these actions. The results presented herein indicate that the induction of apoD expression by retinoids in the T-47D estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cell line is mediated by a retinoid signaling pathway in which the RARα receptor is involved. Thus, we have found that the RARα-selective retinoids Ro40-6055 and Ro40-6973 (32Crettaz M. Baron A. Siegenthaler G. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) are very strong inducers of apoD expression. Furthermore, the induction of apoD by all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, and the RARα-selective retinoids was completely abolished by the RARα-selective antagonists Ro41-5253 and Ro46-5471. The precise mechanism by which these retinoids exert their antagonistic effect is not completely understood; however, Ro41-5253 competes with RA specifically for binding to RARα (34Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that the antagonist binds to this receptor but it is unable to induce transactivation (34Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 35Keidel S. LeMotte P.

https://openalex.org/W1963968225,"A longstanding goal in the fields of molecular genetics and biochemistry has been to explain how naturally occurring mutations associated with human metabolic disease impair activity of the enzymes involved. This goal is particularly complex for enzymes composed of multiple subunits, because single mutations may exert both intra- and intersubunit effects on holoenzyme structure and function. We have previously applied a yeast coexpression system for human galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, a dimeric enzyme associated with galactosemia, to investigate the impact of naturally occurring mutations on subunit association and holoenzyme function (1Elsevier J.P.

Here we describe the purification and characterization of two heterodimers, R333W/wild type (WT) and Q188R/WT, revealing that although the first exhibits ∼50% wild-type activity, the second exhibits only ∼15% wild-type activity. Neither heterodimer varied significantly from the wild type with regard to apparent Km for either substrate, although Q188R/WT but not R333W/WT heterodimers demonstrated significantly increased thermal sensitivity relative to the wild-type enzyme. These results demonstrate for the first time a partial dominant negative effect caused by a naturally occurring mutation in human galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.

GALT enzymes from a variety of sources, including bacteria, yeast, and human tissues have been isolated and studied in great detail (2Segal S. Berry G. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 967-1000Google Scholar), demonstrating that this enzyme functions with ping-pong kinetics and a double displacement mechanism of catalysis proceeding through a uridyl-enzyme intermediate (3Wong L.-J.

Purified GALT enzymes from bacteria (8Saito S. Ozutsumi M. Kurahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yeast (9Segawa T. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10707-10709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (10Williams V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been shown by a variety of methods to exist as dimers composed of identical subunits. Furthermore, as demonstrated by Frey and colleagues from their work with the Escherichia coli enzyme (11Frey P.A. Wong L.J. Sheu K.F. Yang S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), each GALT subunit contains its own active site. Recently Wedekind and colleagues (12Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) confirmed this point when they reported the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme refined to 1.8 Å resolution. That GALT functions as a dimer raises questions of both fundamental and clinical significance regarding the relationship between dimerization and activity and the impact of naturally occurring mutations on both. Indeed, the allelic heterogeneity observed in patient samples (13Elsas L.J. Langley S. Steele E. Evinger J. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Brown A. Singh R. Fernhoff P. Hjelm L.N. Dembure P.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 630-639PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates that many if not most patients with classic galactosemia are not true molecular homozygotes but rather compound heterozygotes. This observation raises the possibility that allelic combination and not just allelic constitution may play some role in determining GALT holoenzyme function and thereby patient outcome. Previously, we have reported the development of a yeast expression system for human GALT and applied this system to the study of a handful of patient mutations in the homozygous, heterozygous, and compound heterozygous states (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Fridovich-Keil J.L. Langley S.D. Mazur L.A. Lennon J.C. Dembure P.P. Elsas L.J. Am.

Med. 1995; 56: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, we have extended this system to include the coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles of GALT, thereby enabling both structural and functional studies of specific subunits in the context of their various dimer states (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In particular, we have coexpressed wild-type human GALT with each of two naturally occurring mutant alleles, Q188R and R333W, and asked the questions 1) do heterodimers form? and 2) are these heterodimers active? Q188R, which accounts for 60-70% of the mutant GALT alleles identified in Caucasians with classic galactosemia (17Elsas L.J. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Leslie N.D. Int. Pediat. 1993; 8: 101-109Google Scholar, 18Ng W.G. Xu Y.K. Kaufman F.R. Donnell G.N. Wolff J. Allen R.J. Koritala S. Reichardt J.K.V. Hum. Genet. 1994; 94: 359-363PubMed Google Scholar), affects a position predicted by homology with the E. coli enzyme to lie two residues from the active site nucleophile (His186), and far from points of intersubunit contact (12Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, R333W, which has been reported only in isolated cases of galactosemia (19Reichardt J. Packman S. Woo S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 860-867PubMed Google Scholar), affects a residue predicted to lie very close to the subunit interface (12Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that both mutant subunits remain capable of forming abundant albeit inactive homodimers, as well as abundant and active heterodimers with the wild-type subunit (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we report the purification and characterization of both the Q188R/WT and R333W/WT heterodimer pools. Our data demonstrate that despite their respective predicted locations, the R333W/WT heterodimer exhibits ∼50% wild-type activity, whereas the Q188R/WT heterodimer exhibits only ∼15% wild-type activity. In short, the Q188R mutation exerts a partial dominant negative effect on the adjacent subunit, whereas R333W does not. Neither heterodimer varied significantly from the wild type with regard to apparent Km values for either substrate, although Q188R/WT but not R333W/WT heterodimers demonstrated significantly increased thermal sensitivity relative to the wild-type enzyme, presumably reflecting some perturbation of holoenzyme structure by the Q188R mutation. These results are significant because they represent the first demonstration of a dominant negative interaction between subunits encoded by naturally occurring alleles of human GALT. These results also are of potential clinical interest because they add an additional level of complexity to the already long list of potential factors contributing to the heterogeneity of outcome observed for patients with galactosemia. All GALT expression studies were performed using yJFK1, a haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in endogenous GALT due to a deletion in the GAL7 locus (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All procedures including yeast transformations, culture manipulations, extract preparations, and GALT enzymatic assays were performed as described previously (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B.

A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Q188R and R333W mutations were introduced into the human GALT coding sequence as described previously (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L.

Sequences encoding the FLAG epitope tag DYKDDDDK were introduced in frame following a start codon onto the 5′ end of the human GALT coding sequence using the oligonucleotide 5′-GCGGATCCCCCTCAAAAATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACA-AGATGTCGCGCAGTGGAACCG-3′, as described previously for the hexahistidine tag (1Elsevier J.P.

Quimby B.B. Wells L. Mazur L.A. Elsevier J.P. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 56: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All plasmid manipulations were performed using standard techniques (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the bacterial strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Yeast extracts were prepared from 6-liter cultures grown to midlogarithmic phase in YPgal, harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH, 200 mM NaCl, plus protease inhibitors: pepstatin 1 μg/ml, aprotinin 2.1 μg/ml, leupeptin 0.5 μg/ml, antipain 2.6 μg/ml, phosphoramidon 0.6 μg/ml, E64 7.5 μg/ml, chymostatin 0.1 μg/ml, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 170 μg/ml), and transferred to a Biospec Products bead beater containing 100 ml of prechilled acid-washed 0.5-mm glass beads. The suspension was vortex-mixed at 4°C for four cycles of 1 min each at high speed alternating with 4 min on ice. Each lysed cell suspension was then centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 15,000 × g to pellet insolubles. Protein concentrations of both crude yeast extracts and purified protein preparations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 30 ml of lysed cell extract, prepared as described above, was brought to a final concentration of 25 mM imidazole mixed with 2 ml of nickel-NTA resin slurry (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mM imidazole, 200 mM NaCl), and incubated with gentle end-over-end rotation on a GLAS-COL Laboratory Rotator at 4°C for 2 h. Resins were allowed to settle on ice for 10 min, and then each supernatant was removed using a LO-Dose 1/2 cc U-100 insulin syringe with a 28G1/2 Micro-fine IV needle (Becton Dickinson). Each resin was washed three times with 10 ml of wash buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole), and on the final wash each slurry was transferred to a fresh tube, and the supernatant was removed as described above. Protein was eluted from the nickel resin by incubation with 1 ml of elution buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole) at 4°C with rotation for 20 min. The supernatant was collected as described above. This elution step was repeated a second time and then repeated two more times using elution buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole). Finally, the eluted fractions were combined and dialyzed against either standard buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) or FLAG purification buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl). Combined fractions from the nickel-NTA purification dialyzed against FLAG purification buffer were mixed with 500 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel slurry (IBI Inc.) pre-equilibrated with FLAG purification buffer and incubated with gentle end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 3 h as described above. Resins were allowed to settle on ice for 10 min; supernatant was removed as described above. Each resin was washed three times, each with 1 ml of FLAG purification buffer, and on the final wash the slurry was transferred to a fresh tube, and the supernatant was removed as described above. Protein was eluted from the affinity gel at 4°C by incubation with rotation with 500 μl of FLAG purification buffer containing 37.5 μg/ml FLAG peptide (NH2-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-COOH) (IBI Inc.), as described above. The supernatant was collected as described above and dialyzed against standard buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol). Each step of the purification procedure was monitored for total protein, for protein purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern visualized by silver staining, and by kinetic assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 16 μl of each diluted sample (total, 0.8 μg) were mixed with 4 μl of sample buffer (50% sucrose, 10% SDS, 321.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 77.5 mg/ml dithiothreitol, bromphenol blue), heated to 95°C for 5 min, chilled on ice, and then separated by SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 200 V for 45 min using a Life Technologies, Inc. Mini-V 8.10 vertical gel electrophoresis apparatus. Low range prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were included to provide an internal size standard. Following electrophoresis the separated proteins were detected by silver staining using Quick-silver (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Enzymatic analyses of purified proteins were performed using a spectrophotometric coupled assay as described previously (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (20Quimby B.B. Wello L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol.

The standard reaction was performed at 37°C and contained 0.1 M glycyl-glycine buffer, pH 8.7, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM glucose-1,6-diphosphate, 5 μM MgCl2, 0.8 mM NADP, 1.2 mM galactose-1-phosphate, 0.8 mM UDPG, 0.06 μg of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.1 μg of phosphoglucomutase in a total volume of 400 μl. Kinetic constants were assayed in the same way except that to determine the apparent Km for UDPG the concentration of galactose-1-phosphate was held constant at 1.2 mM and the concentration of UDPG was varied from 0.02 to 1.0 mM and to determine the apparent Km for galactose-1-phosphate the concentration of UDPG was held constant at 0.6 mM and the concentration of galactose-1-phosphate was varied from 0.05 to 2.0 mM. Enzyme activity was assayed over at least six different substrate concentrations with each data point performed in duplicate. Control assays, lacking either one or both substrates were routinely included and always gave the expected negative results. Apparent kinetic constants were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Sigma Plot. Kinetic assays on purified proteins were performed immediately following double affinity purification, and no loss of enzyme activity was observed over the course of the experiment. Apparent kinetic constants are reported as averages of three independent enzymatic assays involving preparations from three independent double affinity purifications. GALT enzymatic assays were performed on purified proteins at different temperatures (see Fig. 4, Fig. 5) using a direct assay as described previously (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B.

Activation energy was determined by fitting data points from the ascending slope of each profile to the Arrhenius equation (22Robyt J.F. White B.J. Biochemical Techniques: Theory and Practice. Waveland Press Inc., Prospect Heights1990: 297-298Google Scholar) using Sigma Plot. GALT activity was assayed in three separate experiments at a total of ten different temperatures over a range from 22 to 37.5°C.Fig. 5Energy of activation for human GALT WT/WT homodimers and mutant/WT heterodimers isolated from yeast. WT/WT, Q188R/WT, and R333W/WT human GALT dimers were analyzed for activity over a range of temperatures from 23 to 37.5°C. The energy of activation was determined by fitting data points derived from the ascending slope of each profile to the Arrhenius equation using the Sigma Plot program. The plots illustrated represent data from single experiments for each dimer; activation energies listed represent averages (± S.D.) of data from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To facilitate the recognition and isolation of subunits encoded by specific alleles of human GALT, we have introduced sequences encoding each of two small tags, FLAG (23Hopp T.P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), onto the 5′ ends of both wild-type and mutant coding sequences of the human enzyme. The FLAG epitope, DYKDDDDK, is recognized by a high affinity, commercially available monoclonal antibody, enabling both detection and one-step affinity purification of fusion proteins (M2, IBI). The affinity of proteins containing a hexahistidine tag for a charged nickel resin (nickel-NTA, Qiagen Inc.) similarly enables one-step purification of His6-tagged proteins under nondenaturing conditions. Previously we have shown by activity assays and Western blot analyses of extracts prepared from yeast expressing either untagged (native) or His6-tagged GALT proteins that the His6 tag does not impair either activity or abundance of human GALT expressed in yeast (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Parallel studies were performed on extracts from yeast expressing FLAG-tagged GALT proteins; the ratio of activity to abundance for the FLAG-tagged protein relative to the native protein was 1.06, demonstrating that the FLAG tag, like His6, impairs neither activity nor abundance of human GALT expressed in yeast. Previously we have addressed questions of heterodimer formation and activity using coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles coupled with a nickel affinity purification procedure (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated the specificity of the nickel-His6-GALT interaction and have further demonstrated that no detectable subunit exchange occurs in defined heterodimer preparations following isolation (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analyses of these samples provided qualitative answers to the questions addressed but could not provide true quantitative measures of heterodimer function because these preparations contained a mixture of heterodimers and His6-tagged homodimers. In order to characterize more precisely the biochemical properties of defined heterodimers of human GALT, we have developed and applied a sequential, two-step affinity purification procedure for heterodimers that exploits the specificities of available nickel and antibody affinity resins for fusion proteins carrying the His6 and FLAG tags, respectively (Fig. 1). Using these resins we have purified two GALT heterodimer species, as well as wild-type human GALT homodimers, to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2). Activity assays of the wild-type enzyme demonstrated that it is fully active, with a specific activity statistically indistinguishable from that previously reported for the wild-type human enzyme expressed in yeast (20Quimby B.B. Wello L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26835-26842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Indeed, this value is more than 2-fold greater than any value previously reported for the human enzyme isolated from human cells (10Williams V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Banroques J. Gregori C. Schapira F. Biochim. Biophys.

As a control for specificity of the isolation, equivalent (or greater) volumes of eluate from isolation procedures involving extracts including either His6-WT GALT homodimers alone, or FLAG-WT GALT homodimers alone, also were analyzed (first and second lanes). The doublet pattern apparent in the third, fourth, and fifth lanes presumably reflects differential impact of the two tags (His6 versus FLAG) on GALT mobility through the gel, although this point remains an assumption. Each His6 tagged subunit should include 386 amino acids, whereas each FLAG-tagged subunit should include 388 amino acids. Although the two subunit types should be present in equal amounts in purified heterodimer preparations, if the faster migrating band indeed represents the smaller His6-tagged species, these proteins may react differently with the silver stain than do the FLAG-tagged subunits, thereby perhaps accounting for the differential intensities of the bands in each doublet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the possibility of intersubunit effects on activity by either the Q188R or R333W mutations, kinetic studies were performed comparing purified preparations of each heterodimer species with wild-type homodimers. Sample data are illustrated in Fig. 3. The compiled results of these studies (Table I) demonstrated that although each of the heterodimers is active, the Q188R/WT enzyme has an apparent specific activity that is only 12-16% that of the wild-type homodimer. In contrast, the R333W/WT enzyme has an apparent specific activity ∼50% that of the wild-type homodimer, which is the value expected if there is neither positive nor negative interaction between the mutant and wild-type subunits in the heterodimeric holoenzyme. Mixing experiments involving individually purified preparations of WT/WT homodimers and Q188R/Q188R homodimers demonstrated no “trans-acting” negative impact of Q188R GALT on the wild type, thereby ruling out the possibility that Q188R was impacting heterodimer function via some mechanism other than intersubunit interaction (data not shown). Finally, apparent Km values for both galactose-1-phosphate and UDPG for each of the mutant/WT heterodimers were virtually indistinguishable from those obtained for the wild-type enzyme.Table IKinetic parameters of human GALT WT/WT homodimers and mutant/WT heterodimers isolated from yeastDimerSpecific activityApparentKm galactose-1-phosphate ([UDPG] = 0.6 mM)ApparentKm UDPG ([Gal-1-P] = 1.2 mM)μmol/mg/minmMWild type/Wild type123.75 ± 21.41 (100%)0.73 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.00Q188R/Wild type17.15 ± 2.83 (13.86%)0.60 ± 0.060.17 ± 0.04R333W/Wild type55.48 ± 8.75 (44.83%)0.81 ± 0.090.16 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab As a final measure of GALT holoenzyme structure and function in the presence of the Q188R and R333W mutations, kinetic studies were performed testing each heterodimeric species over a range of temperatures from 22 to 60°C. Purified wild-type homodimers were analyzed in parallel as a positive control. As illustrated in Fig. 4, activity associated with the wild-type homodimer rose steeply as the temperature increased from 22 to 43°C, remained fairly stable until about 47°C, and then declined rapidly as temperature was increased further. Only about 7% of the maximum activity remained at 60°C. A very similar profile was observed for the R333W/WT heterodimer, although peak activity was attained at a slightly lower temperature (∼40°C). However, the entire curve was shifted dramatically to the left for the Q188R/WT heterodimer, such that a temperature optimum was reached at 37.5°C, and only ∼50% maximal activity remained at 43°C, the optimal temperature for the wild-type homodimer. The Q188R/WT heterodimer demonstrated no detectable activity at 60°C. Finally, activation energies of catalysis were estimated for the wild type and both heterodimer species by fitting those points derived from the ascending arms of each temperature profile to the Arrhenius equation (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 5). By this method the activation energy for the wild-type homodimer was estimated to be 3.29 ± 0.18 kcal/mol. Similar results, 3.15 ± 0.34 and 3.02 ± 0.52 kcal/mol, were obtained for the Q188R/WT and R333W/WT heterodimers, respectively. The experiments reported here were designed to investigate intersubunit effects of naturally occurring mutations in human GALT. Our results clearly demonstrate that of the two catalytically null subunits studied, one (Q188R GALT) exerted a negative impact on heterodimer function; the other (R333W GALT) did not. These results, therefore, demonstrate for the first time a partial dominant negative effect caused by a naturally occurring mutation in human GALT. This work both extends and contrasts an earlier report by Nadler and colleagues (28Nadler H. Chacko C. Rachmeler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 976-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), who were the first to observe interallelic complementation in human GALT. Those authors performed pairwise fusions of fibroblasts derived from galactosemic patients and detected GALT activity in 3 of 28 hybrids but in none of the original lines. The GALT activity produced by those hybrid cells was similar to that associated with the normal enzyme in terms of apparent Km values, pH optimum, and electrophoretic mobility on starch gels, but differed in terms of specific activity and thermal stability. It is interesting to note that the negative interactions reported here also impacted specific activity and thermal stability but not apparent Km or activation energy of catalysis. Unlike the work of Nadler and colleagues, however, whose hybrid cells may have expressed GALT from as many as four different and unidentified alleles, the results reported here involved interaction of specified GALT subunits whose molecular defects were known. The observation that different mutations can exert differential impacts on holoenzyme function is not surprising. Studies of a variety of structural and catalytic proteins, including the human hemoglobins (reviewed in 29Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 3417,4029-3484,4078Google Scholar), collagens (reviewed in 29Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Acta. 1994; 1206: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), have shown similar results. What is surprising, however, is that of the two mutations studied here, the one that demonstrated a partial dominant negative effect, Q188R, is predicted by homology with the E. coli GALT structure (12Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to be distal to any points of subunit contact, whereas the mutation that demonstrated no detectable intersubunit effects, R333W, is located very close to the predicted subunit interface. It may be relevant to note, however, that in E. coli, Gln168, which corresponds by homology to Gln188 in humans, contributes to formation of one of the nine strands of an anti-parallel β-sheet that together form the “half-barrel” architecture of the subunit core. The substitution of arginine for glutamine at this position decreases the propensity of the region to form a β-sheet, as predicted by the method of Chou and Fasman (31Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). In contrast, E. coli residue Arg310, which corresponds to Arg333 in the human sequence, is not directly involved in the formation of any major elements of secondary structure predicted for the enzyme (12Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, the Q188R mutation effects a position only two residues from the presumed active site nucleophile, His186, and only four residues from a predicted zinc ligand, His184 (12Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Considering both the catalytic and structural importance of the region, it is perhaps not surprising that the Q188R mutation results in functionally significant perturbations of both the subunit and the holoenzyme. It is interesting to note that a handful of other previously reported mutations in human GALT; V44M, F171S, S192N, H319Q, and A320T (13Elsas L.J. Langley S. Steele E. Evinger J. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Brown A. Singh R. Fernhoff P. Hjelm L.N. Dembure P.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 630-639PubMed Google Scholar), all map to regions within the E. coli structure predicted to participate in formation of the anti-parallel β-strands of the subunit core. Further studies will be required to define those elements of sequence and structure most important for determining both the physical and functional parameters of subunit interaction in the GALT holoenzyme. One potential complication to interpreting the data reported here stems from the fact that both mutant GALT subunits carried His6 tags. We have previously investigated potential impacts of the His6 tag on abundance and activity of the wild type and both mutant forms of GALT and observed no significant effects (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, at least in theory, the partial dominant negative effects that we have attributed here to the Q188R mutation could reflect some combination of effects of the Q188R mutation together with the His6 tag. Two previous observations argue against this possibility: 1) coexpression studies involving untagged wild-type and Q188R GALT subunits showed heterozygote activities depressed relative to those involving other mutations (15Fridovich-Keil J.L. Langley S.D. Mazur L.A. Lennon J.C. Dembure P.P. Elsas L.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 640-646PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) coexpression studies involving overexpression of untagged Q188R GALT subunits, but not R333W GALT subunits, relative to the wild type resulted in depressed levels of GALT activity in crude extracts (data not shown). Although both of these observations suggest that the His6 tag was not functionally significant to the dominant negative effects associated with the Q188R mutation in the study reported here, we cannot formally rule out this possibility. The data reported here suggest that heterodimers involving the Q188R mutation lose activity at significantly lower temperatures than do either wild-type homodimers or heterodimers involving the R333W mutation. Although the data presented here do not distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic events, they do demonstrate clear differences between the dimer populations investigated. Preliminary attempts at strictly kinetic studies of thermal denaturation of the wild-type homodimer 3B. B. Quimby and J. L. Fridovich-Keil, unpublished data. suggested a bi- or multiphasic denaturation profile, significantly complicating these studies. To investigate stability of the homo- and heterodimers included in this study, a number of experiments were performed to reveal potential subunit dissociation in the wild-type enzyme under a variety of conditions. Purified dimers were subjected to conditions ranging from nondenaturing to 1 M NaCl and 5 M urea, with incubation times ranging from 0 to 48 h. Under none of these conditions was any evidence of subunit dissociation observed (data not shown). These results, demonstrating an extremely stable GALT dimer conformation, are fully consistent with previous reports involving both the human (1Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and bacterial (32Ruzicka F.J. Wedekind J.E. Kim J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5610-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) enzymes. Finally, the results reported here raise the obvious question: do human carriers of the Q188R mutation exhibit less detectable GALT activity than do carriers of the R333W mutation or perhaps other mutations in GALT? Previously we have observed and reported subtle evidence from coexpression studies in yeast consistent with this hypothesis (15Fridovich-Keil J.L. Langley S.D. Mazur L.A. Lennon J.C. Dembure P.P. Elsas L.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 640-646PubMed Google Scholar). The situation in humans may be more complex, however. In theory, assuming no differences between wild-type and Q188R or R333W GALT subunits in terms of synthesis, association, or stability, if Q188R/WT heterodimers exhibit 15% wild-type activity and R333W/WT heterodimers exhibit 50% wild-type activity, one would expect to see 32.5% wild-type activity in whole cell lysates from carriers of the Q188R allele and 50% wild-type activity in carriers of the R333W allele. Considering the broad range of activities observed even in the control population (17-45 μmol/g Hb/h (13Elsas L.J. Langley S. Steele E. Evinger J. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Brown A. Singh R. Fernhoff P. Hjelm L.N. Dembure P.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 630-639PubMed Google Scholar)), a very large data set of genotyped and biochemically characterized galactosemia carriers will be required to resolve such a subtle distinction. Nonetheless, the results reported here, coupled with clinical reports of potential ophthalmologic (33Skalka H.W. Prchal J.T. Arch.

It is the method of choice when the structural modification requires, for example, a noncoded amino acid. The process involves specific and limited protein fragmentation, structural manipulation of the target sequence, and subsequent religation of fragments to give the mutant holoprotein. We suggested and demonstrated that mutagenesis and semisynthesis could be used synergistically to achieve protein engineering goals otherwise unobtainable, if mutagenesis was used to shuffle methionine residues in the yeast cytochrome c sequence (Wallace, C.

These residues can not only be sites of specific cleavage by CNBr but also of spontaneous peptide bond synthesis between fragments in noncovalent complexes, which greatly facilitates the semisynthetic process. We have now used an informed “methionine scan” of the protein sequence to discover other useful sites and to characterize the factors that promote this extraordinary and convenient autocatalytic religation. Of eight sites canvassed, in a wide range of settings, five efficiently provoked peptide bond synthesis. The principal factor determining efficiency seems to be the hydropathy of the religation site.

INTRODUCTIONThe ability to engineer protein structure became generally available with the development of site-directed mutagenesis (1Smith M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 423-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) by virtue of its combination of simple chemistry and genetic manipulation, and the exploitation of the replicative fidelity and efficiency of living organisms. Before this breakthrough, structural manipulation had been undertaken at the level of the protein, rather than the gene that encodes it, by total synthesis or semisynthesis. These chemical methods suffered a number of limitations, sufficient enough that their use has been relatively restricted, although of late methods to avoid many of the difficulties have evolved. For a full discussion of these developments, see Kent (2Kent S.B.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), Muir and Kent (3Muir T.W. Kent S.B.H. Curr.

Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our focus has been on processes that we term autocatalytic fragment religation (AFR). 1The abbreviations used are: AFRautocatalytic fragment religationMOPS3-(N-morphilino)propanesulfonic acidTMPDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochlorideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. There are many cases of complexation of peptides derived from limited proteolysis reactions to give structures with native-like conformation and, often, function. While the retained functionality itself implies that such complexes adopt the native fold, in some cases the implication has been verified by x-ray crystallography and spectroscopic techniques (12Wyckoff H.W. Tsernoglou D. Hanson A.W. Knox J.R. Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 305-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most studies have examined two-fragment noncovalent complexes (13Wallace C.J.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but examples with three (14Juillerat M.A. Taniuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2697-2711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or four fragments (15Vogel K. Chmielewski J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11163-11164Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are known. One remarkable aspect of these complexes is that the close proximity of the termini at the breakpoints necessitated by the native fold can catalyze the spontaneous reformation of the missing peptide bond(s), in thermodynamically favorable circumstances. Normally, reaction between ionized carboxylate and ammonium groups is disfavored, but in the case of CNBr fragments, where the C-terminal residue is homoserine lactone, it is not. Hence, for some proteins, incubation under renaturing conditions of a mixture of the cleavage products not only leads to complexation, but peptide bond formation too. Aminolysis of the lactone is a slow process (16Wallace, C. J. A., (1976) Chemical Studies on Cytochrome c. Ph.D. thesis, University of Oxford.Google Scholar), so that peptide bond formation between noncomplexing fragments is not detectable, but the proximity effect in a complex gives a many thousandfold rate enhancement, and makes it competitive with hydrolysis. In other words, complex formation effectively converts an intermolecular reaction into an entropically favorable intramolecular reaction. An analogous, but more complicated, process has been developed by us to utilize complexes of tryptic fragments (17Proudfoot A.E.I. Rose K. Wallace C.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8764-8770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Cytochrome c was the protein in which this type of spontaneous peptide bond formation was first observed (18Corradin G. Harbury H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3036-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Corradin G. Harbury H.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 61: 4100-4106Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the religation of chemically manipulated or totally synthetic CNBr fragments 1-65 or 66-104 with the native partner has been the source of over 100 informative engineered analogs of the cytochrome (6Wallace C.J.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), based overwhelmingly on the horse structure. The relative infrequency of methionine residues, in cytochrome c as in other proteins, is both an aid to limited fragmentation and a hindrance to flexibility in cleavage sites, so much so that interesting residues can be inaccessible for semisynthesis. In addition, it is clear from the examples where spontaneous religation does not occur that subtle structural reasons dictate that some natural locations of methionine residues are not conducive to peptide bond formation. Thus, it occurred to us that we might use mutagenesis of the native protein to manipulate the distribution of noncrucial methionine residues and so prepare it for a subsequent convenient and facile semisynthesis, and that this synergy would permit engineering of the cytochrome in ways neither technique alone would permit. Additional benefits would arise from the use of the yeast sequence: it has become the paradigm for structure-function studies for cytochrome c, and the C102T mutant form (the “wild-type” structure in this study, see below) is far easier to crystallize for structural determination by x-ray diffraction. 2G. D. Brayer, personal communication.The first trial of this strategy involved replacement of a pre-existing methionine in the yeast sequence. Located at position 64, this residue is susceptible to the CNBr cleavage reaction, but the resulting two-fragment complex does not undergo spontaneous religation. Replacing Met64 with Leu, and Ser65 by Met, as in the horse protein, led to AFR with a comparable efficiency, and permitted the creation of a semisynthetic analog, a chimera of the yeast and horse sequences, of Saccharomyces cytochrome c (20Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Hibiya Y. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21355-21357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Hibiya Y. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. 1992: 209-217Crossref Google Scholar). At the same time a similar approach was used to make various CNBr fragments of Barnase for complementation studies (22Sancho J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but religation was not noted. 3A. R. Fersht, personal communication.There are a number of reasons for extending that initial study. Choosing to insert the new methionine at the position corresponding to that which works in horse maximizes the chances of success, and proves the principle, but does not provide new information on the structural circumstances in which the spontaneous religation is promoted or repressed. This can only be had by canvassing a number of novel sites representative of varied conformational contexts, to show this is a general, rather than specific phenomenon, and hopefully to obtain clear predictive data on the relationship between site location and efficiency. We also wanted a range of evolutionary conservation to explore the importance of this factor in site selection. Finally, we wished to make functioning AFR systems that would open up new regions of the sequence for engineering by semisynthesis.We have therefore developed six novel mutants of the yeast protein that provide a partial “methionine scan” of the sequence between residues 25 and 75 and subjected them to intense physicochemical and biological characterization as well as determining the capacity of two-fragment complexes derived from them to undergo the desired spontaneous resynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll yeast iso-1-cytochrome c mutants were prepared by using recombinant techniques as described below. Hexokinase, cyanogen bromide, 3-(N-morphilino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD), and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) were obtained from Sigma. ATP was from Boehringer Mannheim. Other chemicals were obtained from Baker (Toronto, Canada), BDH (Toronto, Canada), Fisher, or Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY).MethodsMutant PreparationAmino acid residues at sites selected for CNBr cleavage and homoserine lactone-mediated AFR in yeast iso-1-cytochrome c were replaced by methionine. Mutant cytochromes c were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis method (21Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Hibiya Y. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. 1992: 209-217Crossref Google Scholar, 23Inglis S.C. Guillemette J.G. Johnson J.A. Smith M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutation was carried out on an earlier modified version of the naturally occurring yeast iso-1-cytochrome c gene in which the codon for Cys at position 102 was replaced with that of Thr; the resulting product does not have problems with dimerization and autoreduction during purification that mark the wild-type. This gene shall be called CYC1. The phagemid carrying the CYC1 gene (pING 4) bears all the elements necessary for replication in yeast and bacteria and may be converted into a single-stranded form of DNA for site-directed mutagenesis and nucleotide sequencing (23Inglis S.C. Guillemette J.G. Johnson J.A. Smith M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Met64 was replaced with Leu in this series of mutants in order to limit the number of side cleavages; since this is a naturally variable site, the change is not considered to be significant. Met80 is an essential residue and was not modified. This gene will be referred to as [Leu64] CYC1.Single mutation variants of the [Leu64] CYC1 gene product were subsequently produced. Pro25, Val28, Ile35, Lys55, Leu68, and Ile75 were chosen to be replaced with Met. Throughout this report the vertebrate cytochrome c numerotation is used to conform with general practice. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an N-terminal extension of 5 residues, and hence numbering of this sequence begins at residue −5. The pING 4 phagemids carrying the mutant iso-1-cytochrome c genes were then introduced into a strain of yeast deficient in both types of cytochrome c, GM3C-2 (24Faye G. Leung D.W. Tachell K. Hall B.D. Smith M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Each variant form of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c was expressed in GM3C-2 cells and the recombinant protein purified as described previously (21Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Hibiya Y. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. 1992: 209-217Crossref Google Scholar).Molecular ModelingModeling of the variants of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c was performed on an Iris Indigo (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA), using the programs Insight II and Discover (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). The x-ray crystal structure for the reduced S. cerevisiae iso-1-cytochrome c at 1.23 Å (25Louie G. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 527-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry no. 1YCC).All minimization and dynamics studies were carried out on the wild-type structure and the singly modified variants. The consistent valence force field was used for both energy parameters and partial electrostatic charge assignment. A cutoff distance of 12 Å was used, with a switching function applied over the last 1.5 Å. Minimization proceeded as follows: specific side chains were replaced by methionine with atom positions falling as close to previous positions as possible, methionines were then adjusted by hand to avoid any gross steric clashes. The entire structure was then solvated with a 5-Å layer of explicit water molecules. All atoms in the structure were fixed except for the new methionines, and minimization proceeded by steepest descents for 500 iterations. Side chains were then released and minimized by conjugate gradient for 500 iterations. At this point all atoms were released and minimized by conjugate gradient for 500 iterations, after which these structures were subjected to either minimization by conjugate gradient or to dynamics simulations at 300 K, both for 10,000 iterations. Results were analyzed by comparing the behavior of the wild type and the variants to each other.Determination of Physicochemical Properties SpectroscopyUV-visible spectra in the range of 750-250 nm were obtained for all mutants using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. Deviations in the height or position of absorbance bands can give information about how the electronic configuration of mutants might differ from that of the native protein.Oxidation-Reduction PotentialA variation on the “method of mixtures” was used to measure redox potentials of the mutants. This procedure was described in detail by Wallace et al. (26Wallace C.J.A. Corradin G. Marchiori F. Borin G. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Various quantities of potassium ferricyanide and ferrocyanide were added to solutions of cytochrome c in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 in order to make redox buffers of known potential. The state of the redox equilibrium of the cytochrome c was determined spectroscopically by the absorbance of the solution at 550 nm and comparison to similar solutions in fully oxidized and reduced states. Ratios of ferrocytochrome to ferricytochrome were plotted against the known ratios of the ferrocyanide to ferricyanide required to achieve these redox equilibria. Extrapolation to the midpoint of the ferrocytochrome-ferricytochrome equilibrium gives E′m which is equal to the redox potential of the ferrocyanide-ferricyanide couple at the corresponding ratio; this is calculated using the Nernst equation using a value of 0.43 V for E′m for the ferrocyanide-ferricyanide couple.695-nm Band TitrationThe coordination of ferric iron with Met80 results in a charge transfer band at 695 nm, the intensity of which is used as a measure of heme crevice stability. The sensitivity of the bond to chaotropic stress makes its loss one of the earliest structural changes with increasing pH (27Wallace C.J.A. Corthesy B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric titrations of this band were carried out by slowly adjusting the pH of solutions of cytochrome c over the range of pH 6-11. The intensity of the 695-nm band was plotted and the pKa for the transition calculated. The method used was that described by Wallace (28Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Autoxidation TimeCytochromes in phosphate buffer solution were completely reduced by dithionite, which was then removed on a PD10 desalting column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Each sample was eluted with O2-saturated 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, into a 1-ml capacity microcuvette and scanned from 600 to 500 nm at regular intervals. The collapse of the 550-nm absorbance band was followed, and the time taken for it to fall to half of the difference between fully reduced and fully oxidized values was noted.ATP AffinityCytochrome c binds strongly to ATP immobilized on agarose gel at intermediate ionic strengths. The relative changes in ATP affinity of the cytochrome c mutants give information about surface conformation and can be measured by the changes in elution time from a column of such gel. A 0.5- × 5-cm column was loaded with Pharmacia AGATP gel and equilibrated in 10 mM phosphate buffer. Ferricytochrome c was loaded onto the column in a similar buffer solution. A phosphate gradient of 10-200 mM was used as eluant, and eluting material was recorded spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Retention times were reported as the difference between the elution time of the loading volume and the voiding time of the ferricytochrome c. All buffers were pH 7.0. Runs were standardized against yeast iso-1-cytochrome c with the Thr102 modification noted above.High-Performance Liquid ChromatographyA high-performance liquid chromatography system (600E; Waters Associates, Milford, MA) was used to measure elution times of mutants from an SP5PW cation-exchange column using a pH 7.0 potassium phosphate buffer gradient from 40 to 400 mM.Determination of Biological Activity Mitochondrial Succinate Oxidase AssayThe ability of the mutants to promote electron transfer was assayed using the depleted mitochondria-succinate oxidase assay (13Wallace C.J.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rat mitochondria were isolated from hepatocytes by differential centrifugation, and their outer membranes were fractured using osmotic shock, rendering them permeable to proteins. The inner membrane is in a weak association with cytochrome c. Repeated washing with isotonic solutions removed endogenous cytochrome c from the mitochondria but leaves it otherwise intact along with the chemiosmotic processes; this yielded a low base-line level of O2 consumption, as measured by a Clark-type oxygen electrode. The assay proceeds in a buffer including succinate as electron donor, ADP, and hexokinase and glucose to regenerate ADP from the ATP formed. The oxygen electrode was used to measure the increased O2 uptake with repeated cumulative injections of cytochrome c. O2 consumption was plotted against cytochrome c concentration in the reaction chamber; the resulting plot is related to cytochrome activity. It has been proposed that the electron transfer being measured is between cytochrome reductase and cytochrome c (28Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Cytochrome Oxidase AssayCytochrome oxidase was purified from beef heart using the method of Darley-Usmar et al. (29Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D.C.1987Google Scholar). Oxidase was separated using a combination of differential centrifugation and precipitation with ammonium sulfate, dialyzed, and solubilized. The assay follows changes in oxygen consumption using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. 1.05 g of MOPS and 0.3 ml of Tween 80 at pH 7.5 were dissolved in 100 ml of distilled H2O. 440 mg of ascorbate and 1.5 mg of EDTA were mixed in 5 ml of distilled H2O and titrated to pH 5.0. 59 mg of TMPD recrystallized in 80% acidified ethanol were added to 5 ml of distilled H2O. 70 μl of ascorbate solution and 20 μl of TMPD were added to 5 ml of the MOPS buffer in the reaction chamber. 5 μl of purified cytochrome oxidase was added, and a base-line oxygen consumption was established. Incremental amounts of cytochrome c were added, and the oxygen consumption was plotted against the cytochrome concentration in the chamber. The resulting curve represents the activity of cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase.AFR Studies Cleavage of MutantsCNBr cleavage of this series of mutants was performed using techniques similar to those described earlier (20Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Hibiya Y. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21355-21357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Hibiya Y. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. 1992: 209-217Crossref Google Scholar, 26Wallace C.J.A. Corradin G. Marchiori F. Borin G. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A CNBr-to-protein molar ratio of 7:1 was used in a solution of 88% formic acid; this mixture was allowed to incubate overnight. An exception was the cleavage of the Leu68 mutant, which repeatedly proved refractory to cleavage under these conditions and required a 14:1 molar ratio of CNBr to protein.Fragment IsolationSimilar techniques were applied to the isolation and purification of the desired fragments to those previously outlined (20Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Hibiya Y. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21355-21357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Hibiya Y. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. 1992: 209-217Crossref Google Scholar, 26Wallace C.J.A. Corradin G. Marchiori F. Borin G. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction was stopped by dilution with water. The mixture was immediately placed on a Sephadex G-50 column (900 × 24 mm) with 7% formic acid as eluant. Fragments were identified on the basis of the elution profile drawn from absorbance at 280 nm. Fragments common to cleavage of all mutants were uncleaved proteins −5 to 103, −5 to 80, and 81 to 103. The remaining three fragments depend on placement of the added methionine: for example, −5 to 25, 26 to 103, and 26 to 80 for the Met25 mutant.In addition, several of the mutants required further purification of desired fragments due to the inability of the G-50 column to separate fragments of similar size completely. Ion-exchange chromatography on a Trisacryl-SP column in a 20-100 mM, pH 7.0 phosphate buffer gradient was required to separate the following fragments: −26 to 103 from −5 to 80, −5 to 35 from 36 to 80, and −5 to 68 from −5 to 80. 7 M urea was added to the phosphate buffer gradient to separate fragments −5 to 80 and 29 to 103 in order to prevent any overlap complex formation that might occur between these two fragments. Immediate desalting on a 1% acetic acid column followed the gradient separation in order to arrest the hydrolysis of the homoserine lactone that occurs under neutral pH conditions and to remove the concentrated urea. Recovered fractions were then freeze-dried.Fragment ReligationWhere possible, equimolar amounts of the peptides to be religated were mixed together. These pairs, which correspond to each of the added methionine residues, are as follows: −5 to 25 and 26 to 103; −5 to 28 and 29 to 103; −5 to 35 and 36 to 103; −5 to 55 and 56 to 103; −5 to 68 and 69 to 103; −5 to 75 and 76 to 103. Small amounts of these mixtures were set aside and tested for ascorbate reducibility. Functional complexes, obtained when the breakpoint is N-terminal to residue Trp59 (30Westerhuis L.W. Tesser G.I. Nivard R.J.F. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1982; 19: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and religated cytochromes are ascorbate-reducible, whereas free heme peptides and nonproductive complexes are not (21Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Hibiya Y. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry III. 1992: 209-217Crossref Google Scholar). The degree of ascorbate reducibility can give information about the tendency of the mixture to reassociate in native-like conformation. The mixtures were then reduced with a few grains of solid sodium dithionite and immediately sealed in airtight glass-walled syringes. After 24-h incubations they were chromatographed on Sephadex G-50. Yields of religated product were calculated from comparing peak areas in elution profiles and from ascorbate reducibility studies of product peaks.Characterization of ProductsThe products were repurified if yields permitted and freeze-dried. Physicochemical and biological viability of the AFR products was determined by the assays described above and compared to both the native yeast protein and to the protein itself before AFR experimentation. INTRODUCTIONThe ability to engineer protein structure became generally available with the development of site-directed mutagenesis (1Smith M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 423-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) by virtue of its combination of simple chemistry and genetic manipulation, and the exploitation of the replicative fidelity and efficiency of living organisms. Before this breakthrough, structural manipulation had been undertaken at the level of the protein, rather than the gene that encodes it, by total synthesis or semisynthesis. These chemical methods suffered a number of limitations, sufficient enough that their use has been relatively restricted, although of late methods to avoid many of the difficulties have evolved. For a full discussion of these developments, see Kent (2Kent S.B.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), Muir and Kent (3Muir T.W. Kent S.B.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Offord (4Offord R.E. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Offord R.E. Hook J.B.

Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The continuing desirability of facile chemical methods stems from their capabilities in areas where molecular biological approaches are themselves limited. These include the stable expression of partial, toxic, or grossly deformed sequences (8Kemp D.S. Carey R.I. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 2216-2222Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the introduction of unnatural side chain structures (9Wallace C.J.A. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3852-3861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the insertion of labeled natural residues at specific sites in a protein (10Stocklin R. Rose K. Green B.N. Offord R.E. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), or the creation of dendrimeric or pennant structures (11Rose K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 30-33Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar).The most troublesome aspect of chemical methods has been the inefficiency of the final peptide ligation step in fragment-condensation synthesis and semisynthesis, and hence we and others have sought ways to improve it (7Wallace C.J.A.

Our focus has been on processes that we term autocatalytic fragment religation (AFR). 1The abbreviations used are: AFRautocatalytic fragment religationMOPS3-(N-morphilino)propanesulfonic acidTMPDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochlorideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. There are many cases of complexation of peptides derived from limited proteolysis reactions to give structures with native-like conformation and, often, function. While the retained functionality itself implies that such complexes adopt the native fold, in some cases the implication has been verified by x-ray crystallography and spectroscopic techniques (12Wyckoff H.W.

Most studies have examined two-fragment noncovalent complexes (13Wallace C.J.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but examples with three (14Juillerat M.A. Taniuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2697-2711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or four fragments (15Vogel K. Chmielewski J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11163-11164Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are known. One remarkable aspect of these complexes is that the close proximity of the termini at the breakpoints necessitated by the native fold can catalyze the spontaneous reformation of the missing peptide bond(s), in thermodynamically favorable circumstances. Normally, reaction between ionized carboxylate and ammonium groups is disfavored, but in the case of CNBr fragments, where the C-terminal residue is homoserine lactone, it is not. Hence, for some proteins, incubation under renaturing conditions of a mixture of the cleavage products not only leads to complexation, but peptide bond formation too. Aminolysis of the lactone is a slow process (16Wallace, C. J. A., (1976) Chemical Studies on Cytochrome c.

Commun. 1974; 61: 4100-4106Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the religation of chemically manipulated or totally synthetic CNBr fragments 1-65 or 66-104 with the native partner has been the source of over 100 informative engineered analogs of the cytochrome (6Wallace C.J.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), based overwhelmingly on the horse structure. The relative infrequency of methionine residues, in cytochrome c as in other proteins, is both an aid to limited fragmentation and a hindrance to flexibility in cleavage sites, so much so that interesting residues can be inaccessible for semisynthesis.

D. Brayer, personal communication.The first trial of this strategy involved replacement of a pre-existing methionine in the yeast sequence. Located at position 64, this residue is susceptible to the CNBr cleavage reaction, but the resulting two-fragment complex does not undergo spontaneous religation. Replacing Met64 with Leu, and Ser65 by Met, as in the horse protein, led to AFR with a comparable efficiency, and permitted the creation of a semisynthetic analog, a chimera of the yeast and horse sequences, of Saccharomyces cytochrome c (20Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Hibiya Y. Smith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21355-21357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wallace C.J.A. Guillemette J.G. Smith M. Hibiya Y. Angeletti R.H.

At the same time a similar approach was used to make various CNBr fragments of Barnase for complementation studies (22Sancho J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but religation was not noted. 3A. R. Fersht, personal communication.There are a number of reasons for extending that initial study. Choosing to insert the new methionine at the position corresponding to that which works in horse maximizes the chances of success, and proves the principle, but does not provide new information on the structural circumstances in which the spontaneous religation is promoted or repressed. This can only be had by canvassing a number of novel sites representative of varied conformational contexts, to show this is a general, rather than specific phenomenon, and hopefully to obtain clear predictive data on the relationship between site location and efficiency. We also wanted a range of evolutionary conservation to explore the importance of this factor in site selection. Finally, we wished to make functioning AFR systems that would open up new regions of the sequence for engineering by semisynthesis.We have therefore developed six novel mutants of the yeast protein that provide a partial “methionine scan” of the sequence between residues 25 and 75 and subjected them to intense physicochemical and biological characterization as well as determining the capacity of two-fragment complexes derived from them to undergo the desired spontaneous resynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2021155163,"The sucrose-induced stimulation of lysine influx in human erythrocytes has been attributed to the removal of a competitive inhibition exerted by Na+ on system y+ (Young, J. D., Fincham, D. A., and Harvey, C. M. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta1070, 111-118). We have reexamined this phenomenon separating the contribution of the two cationic amino acid transporters present in these cells (system y+ and system y+L). NaCl replacement with sucrose increased influx through system y+L, but decreased influx through system y+. We conclude that 1) the inhibition of system y+ is a response to the membrane depolarization that results from chloride removal, and 2) the stimulation of system y+L is due to the enhancement of the negative surface potential. Consistently, lysine influx through system y+L (in sucrose medium) was reduced by Na+, K+, Li+, and choline (K0.5 = 25-34 mM), the effect reaching a maximum at 35-40% of the original flux. Divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) were also inhibitory, but lower concentrations were required (K0.5 1.1-1.8 mM). The finding that sucrose stimulates uptake through changes in the surface potential explains similar effects observed in other cells with various cationic substrates."

Our present data show that two members of this family, the human Gα16 subunit and the murine homologue Gα15, can induce both activation and inhibition of these agonist-induced currents. Although extremely low amounts (10-50 pg) of injected Gα16 subunit cRNA cause modest (∼2-fold) enhancement of ligand-induced Cl− currents in oocytes co-injected with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor cRNA 48 h postinjection, larger Gα16 and Gα15 cRNA injections cause >10-fold inhibition of TRH or 5HT2c receptor responses. The inhibition is analyzed in this study. The inhibited currents are recovered if various Gβγ subunit combinations are also expressed with the Gα subunits. The constitutively active mutant, Gα16Q212L, also causes a strong attenuation of the ligand-induced Cl− currents, but this inhibition is not recovered by co-expression of Gβγ subunits. These results indicate that the free Gα subunit is responsible for the inhibitory signal. Although expression of TRH receptor alone produces maximum responses approximately 48 h after injection, co-expression of TRH receptor with Gα16 results in enhanced responses 6-12 h postinjection, followed by complete attenuation at 36 h. Furthermore, injection of Gα16 cRNA alone at comparable levels gives rise to spontaneous Cl− currents within 6-12 h postinjection, suggesting that the early spontaneous activation underlies the later suppression. Expression of other G protein α subunits of the Gq family, at cRNA levels considerably higher than effective for Gα16, produces both analogous spontaneous Cl− currents and, later, inhibition of ligand-induced Cl− currents. Experiments with direct injection of IP3 and of Ca2+ suggest that this inhibition is consistent with the down-regulation of IP3 receptors.

INTRODUCTIONMany hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors act via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorPLCphospholipase CTRHthyrotropin-releasing hormone. in a wide range of transduction processes. The phosphoinositide cascade, which controls calcium-stimulated processes such as secretion, chemotaxis, and fertilization, is regulated by G proteins. Phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PLC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate to generate two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol in turn activates protein kinase C; IP3 binds to an intracellular IP3 receptor/channel to release Ca2+ stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar and references therein). In mammals, several families of PLC isoforms have been described (2Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The PLC β isoform is regulated by G proteins. All four β isoforms of PLC are activated via the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq family of G proteins: Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, and Gα16, although isoforms appear to vary with respect to potency for activation (4Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 5Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Two isoforms, PLC β2 and PLC β3, can also be activated by Gβγ (6Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Camps M. Carozzi A.

It also has been shown that the Gα and Gβγ subunits bind to different regions of the PLC β enzyme (10Wu D.Q. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The complexity of the molecular components and the functional interaction among them enable many variations in the control and timing of particular signaling pathways. Such specificity of signaling may be important in determining the cell's response to an extracellular signal. The pattern of expression of receptors, G proteins, and effectors may also play an important role in this selectivity process. For instance, the Gα16 and Gα15 subunits show a restricted pattern of expression (12Wilkie T. Scherle P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); conversely, they have a promiscuous behavior with respect to receptor coupling (14Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 15Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Regulatory processes such as short and long term desensitization may also determine the efficiency of signal transduction in a cell.In Xenopus oocytes, activation of PLC by ligand-activated GPCRs produces the opening of a Cl− channel via Ca2+ release from intracellular stores; this system has been extensively used for the study of GPCRs. Many receptors couple to an endogenous pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein when expressed in oocytes (16Blitzer R.D. Omri G. Devivo M. Carty D.J. Premont R.T. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Coteccchia S.

Brain Res. 1988; 4: 75-79Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar); this pathway seems to involve Go. It is still unclear whether the βγ-dependent activation of PLC β accounts for the pertussis toxin-sensitive regulation of PLC. Recent data suggest that the Gβγ dimer regulates the activity of PLC in oocytes (19Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Other receptors, e.g. the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor, activate PLC via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in oocytes (20Moriarty T.M. Sealfon S.C. Carty D.J. Roberts J.L. Iyengar R. Landau E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13524-13530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense experiments show that these G proteins are members of the Gq family. Additionally, the expression level of G proteins influences the selectivity of receptor/G protein coupling (21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promiscuity of receptor/G protein interactions appears with increasing levels of G protein expression, indicating that the level of expression of G proteins and receptors are important for modulating transmembrane signaling.Regulation of the PLC cascade in oocytes is an important step in oocyte maturation and fertilization. For example, it has been shown that G proteins of the Gq family increase in expression level as the oocyte matures and acquires the capacity to respond to IP3 (22Gallo C.J. Jones T.L. Aragay A.M. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the IP3 receptors are localized mostly in the cytoplasm of the oocyte, they are found mostly in the cortical region of the mature egg (23Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the egg, an increase in Ca2+ concentration occurs at fertilization and propagates Ca2+ waves that are required for the prevention of polyspermy and for the induction of cell cycle changes (24Jaffe L.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this study, we present further evidence for regulation of the pathway leading from the activation of G proteins to the activation of Cl− channels. We use this signaling cascade to examine the role of G proteins of the Gq family to GPCR stimulation. We show that overstimulation of PLC, by means of expression of Gα subunits of the Gq family, produces signal inhibition and that this effect is the result of a decreased physiological response to IP3 activation. We suggest that this effect is part of a desensitization process controlling the stimulation of the PLC pathway and that both enhancement and inhibition of signaling through GPCRs can be mediated by the level of G protein expression and/or activity.DISCUSSIONActivation of GPCRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes generates a well characterized second messenger cascade that leads to opening of Ca2+-activated Cl− channels. However, regulation of the sensitivity in this cascade is only partially understood. In the present study, we show that the expression of the human Gα16, or the murine homologue Gα15, produces inhibition of peak inward Cl− currents activated via GPCRs when measured more than 24 h postinjection. This inhibitory effect is likely the result of a desensitization process that blocks the release of Ca2+ from internal stores, due to the prolonged activation of PLC β by free Gα16 subunits. As evidence for such a mechanism, we show that (i) expression of Gα16 or Gα15 inhibits the currents induced by ligands for each of two co-expressed receptors; (ii) co-expression of Gβγ with Gα16 subunits restores this current; (iii) the presence of the activated mutant of Gα16, Gα16Q212L, results in a similar block of the ligand-induced Cl− conductance, but co-injection of Gβγ does not restore the signal; (iv) oocytes injected with Gα16 alone display a spontaneous Cl− conductance at 6-12 h postinjection, after which peak currents decrease; and (v) in oocytes injected with Gα16 and TRH receptor cRNA, agonist produces larger than normal currents at early times postinjection (6-12 h) but a reduced response at later times. These effects suggest that the signaling cascade initiated through a single GPCR can be both enhanced and inhibited depending upon the level of G protein expression and/or activity.The prolonged activation of PLC β by free Gα15 or Gα16 that results in signal inhibition is likely not a peculiarity of Gα16 or Gα15 subunits. Low quantities of other Gα subunit cRNAs enhance transmitter responses (21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but when higher quantities of other Gα subunit cRNAs are injected there is an inhibitory effect analogous to that seen with smaller quantities of Gα16, in agreement with previous observations injecting large amounts of wild-type Gαq (37Guttridge K.L. Smith L.D. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1297-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We suggest that any prolonged stimulation of the PLC pathway in oocytes will result in signal down-regulation.It is at first surprising that the rather small spontaneous currents with 0.5 ng of Gα16 cRNA (60-70-nA peak, at 12 h after injection) represent activation sufficient to desensitize most of the release mechanism. We point out, however, that the spontaneous activation is present for many hours, whereas most experiments on oocytes utilize a single application of agonist, lasting just seconds. Furthermore, the IP3 receptors that mediate the spontaneous currents have presumably been desensitized by the same process that desensitizes the responses to exogenously applied agonists. We do not know whether Ca2+ itself is the desensitizing factor, but previous studies show that neither activation nor desensitization of the Cl− channel response is simply related to the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ (38Parker I. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Ilyin V. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 477: 503-509Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The barely detectable spontaneous responses to 0.05 ng of Gα16 (Table I) were evidently not associated with activation sufficient to desensitize the signaling pathway (Fig. 1B).One important question concerns the mechanism by which the wild-type Gα16 or Gα15 subunit produces this dramatic effect even at relatively low quantities of cRNA injected, while other subunits need to be constitutively active or injected at higher quantities. These two subunits have the peculiarity that they couple to a broad range of GPCRs (14Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). One possibility could be that these G proteins in the oocyte are being activated by endogenous receptors. On the other hand, a lower affinity for endogenous Gβγ subunits or a higher efficiency in activating endogenous PLC β isoforms may account for the unusual effects of Gα16 or Gα15 on the Cl− current response. It is interesting to note that injection of 1-5 ng of the other Gα subunit cRNAs produces an increase in peak current when co-injected with TRH receptor (21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N.

Presumably, above a threshold at which excess Gα subunits can no longer interact with Gβγ and couple to the receptor, the free Gα subunits induce activation of PLC and induce signal desensitization. Because we have no direct measurements of Gα subunit levels, it remains possible that the unusual effects of Gα16 or Gα15 occur simply because unusually large amounts of these Gα subunits are produced in the oocyte.This study shows that Gα16 and Gα15 subunits join the list of pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein subunits that can activate an effector in oocytes, leading to Ca2+ mobilization (21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs for other pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins, including Gαq and Gα11, have been cloned from Xenopus (37Guttridge K.L.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using antibodies against the C-terminal sequence of mouse Gq it has been shown that oocytes express several forms of the Gq family of α subunits (22Gallo C.J. Jones T.L. Aragay A.M. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). There has, however, been some controversy concerning the ability of G proteins of the Gαq family to activate the PLC cascade in the oocytes. Our earlier study showed that responses are enhanced by injection of cRNA for Gαq or Gα11 (21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in other reports Gαq or Gα11 injected into the oocyte has reduced Cl− currents (19Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 41Lipinsky D. Gershengorn M.C. Oron Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results presented here support the idea that the Gα subunit of all members of the Gαq family can couple to GPCRs and activate the oocyte's IP3/Ca2+-induced Cl− conductance. Under certain conditions, this coupling can eventually produce an inhibitory signal that we suggest may be due to the overexpression of G protein α subunits and, therefore, to overstimulation of phospholipase Cβ.IP3 is a key second messenger for the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores. An IP3 receptor isoform has been cloned from oocytes (23Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Previous experiments had shown that injection of IP3 into oocytes renders them unresponsive to subsequent stimulation by either receptor activation or IP3 injection (42Sugiyama H. Ito I. Hirono C. Nature. 1987; 325: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Recently, Honda et al. (43Honda Z. Takano T. Hirose N. Suzuki T. Muto A. Kume S. Mikoshiba K. Itoh K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4840-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that the loss of IP3 sensitivity due to down-regulation of the IP3 receptor is the main reason for the Gαq-induced desensitization of the platelet-activating factor receptor response. The results presented here demonstrate that the presence of wild type Gα16 and Gα15 is enough to produce a similar desensitization effect and extend the observation to the other members of the Gq family. Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of the IP3 receptor plays a pivotal role in the propagation of agonist-mediated Ca2+ transients. This study provides a model to study the mechanism of a more physiological effect like heterologous desensitization, where the activation of several receptors may trigger similar down-regulation responses. The precise mechanism of down-regulation of the IP3 receptor remains unclear.In mammals three different isoforms of IP3 receptors have been identified. There is accumulating evidence that individual isoforms have distinct tissue and subcellular localization, pharmacological properties, and regulation by calcium and phosphorylation (see 36Joseph S.K. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, the type I IP3 receptor is down-regulated in carbachol-stimulated human neuroblastoma cells (44Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 386-393Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 45Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to ascertain how persistent activation of PLC by different G protein α subunits or βγ subunits affects the regulation of agonist-mediated Ca2+ transients in other cellular environments. INTRODUCTIONMany hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors act via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorPLCphospholipase CTRHthyrotropin-releasing hormone. in a wide range of transduction processes. The phosphoinositide cascade, which controls calcium-stimulated processes such as secretion, chemotaxis, and fertilization, is regulated by G proteins. Phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PLC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate to generate two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol in turn activates protein kinase C; IP3 binds to an intracellular IP3 receptor/channel to release Ca2+ stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar and references therein). In mammals, several families of PLC isoforms have been described (2Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The PLC β isoform is regulated by G proteins. All four β isoforms of PLC are activated via the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq family of G proteins: Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, and Gα16, although isoforms appear to vary with respect to potency for activation (4Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 5Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Two isoforms, PLC β2 and PLC β3, can also be activated by Gβγ (6Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Camps M. Carozzi A.

It also has been shown that the Gα and Gβγ subunits bind to different regions of the PLC β enzyme (10Wu D.Q. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The complexity of the molecular components and the functional interaction among them enable many variations in the control and timing of particular signaling pathways. Such specificity of signaling may be important in determining the cell's response to an extracellular signal. The pattern of expression of receptors, G proteins, and effectors may also play an important role in this selectivity process. For instance, the Gα16 and Gα15 subunits show a restricted pattern of expression (12Wilkie T. Scherle P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 15Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Regulatory processes such as short and long term desensitization may also determine the efficiency of signal transduction in a cell.In Xenopus oocytes, activation of PLC by ligand-activated GPCRs produces the opening of a Cl− channel via Ca2+ release from intracellular stores; this system has been extensively used for the study of GPCRs. Many receptors couple to an endogenous pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein when expressed in oocytes (16Blitzer R.D. Omri G. Devivo M. Carty D.J. Premont R.T. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Coteccchia S.

Brain Res. 1988; 4: 75-79Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar); this pathway seems to involve Go. It is still unclear whether the βγ-dependent activation of PLC β accounts for the pertussis toxin-sensitive regulation of PLC. Recent data suggest that the Gβγ dimer regulates the activity of PLC in oocytes (19Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Other receptors, e.g. the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor, activate PLC via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in oocytes (20Moriarty T.M. Sealfon S.C. Carty D.J. Roberts J.L. Iyengar R. Landau E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13524-13530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense experiments show that these G proteins are members of the Gq family. Additionally, the expression level of G proteins influences the selectivity of receptor/G protein coupling (21Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promiscuity of receptor/G protein interactions appears with increasing levels of G protein expression, indicating that the level of expression of G proteins and receptors are important for modulating transmembrane signaling.Regulation of the PLC cascade in oocytes is an important step in oocyte maturation and fertilization. For example, it has been shown that G proteins of the Gq family increase in expression level as the oocyte matures and acquires the capacity to respond to IP3 (22Gallo C.J. Jones T.L. Aragay A.M. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the IP3 receptors are localized mostly in the cytoplasm of the oocyte, they are found mostly in the cortical region of the mature egg (23Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the egg, an increase in Ca2+ concentration occurs at fertilization and propagates Ca2+ waves that are required for the prevention of polyspermy and for the induction of cell cycle changes (24Jaffe L.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this study, we present further evidence for regulation of the pathway leading from the activation of G proteins to the activation of Cl− channels. We use this signaling cascade to examine the role of G proteins of the Gq family to GPCR stimulation. We show that overstimulation of PLC, by means of expression of Gα subunits of the Gq family, produces signal inhibition and that this effect is the result of a decreased physiological response to IP3 activation. We suggest that this effect is part of a desensitization process controlling the stimulation of the PLC pathway and that both enhancement and inhibition of signaling through GPCRs can be mediated by the level of G protein expression and/or activity. Many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors act via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorPLCphospholipase CTRHthyrotropin-releasing hormone. in a wide range of transduction processes.

Both mutants can facilitate the in vitro refolding of rhodanese in an ATP- and GroES-dependent manner, producing yields of recoverable activity comparable to the wild-type chaperonin. Y203W shows some increased hydrophobic exposure and easier urea-induced disassembly compared with wild-type or Y360W, although the unfolding of all the species was similar at high concentrations of urea. Intrinsic fluorescence studies of the two mutants reveal that nucleotide binding (ADP or AMP-PNP (adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate)) induces conformational changes in the tetradecamer that are independent of the presence of the co-chaperonin, GroES. The K1/2 for this transition is approximately 5 μM for both mutants. Energy transfer experiments show that the tryptophan fluorescence of the Y360W mutant is partially quenched (∼50%) upon binding of the fluorescent, hydrophobic probe 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid), while the fluorescence of the Y203W mutant is significantly quenched (∼75%). These results are discussed in relation to the molecular mechanism for GroEL function.

These results are discussed in relation to the molecular mechanism for GroEL function. The molecular chaperones are a class of proteins that have been shown to facilitate the folding and transport of nascent polypeptides in vivo (1Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar, 2Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Hemmingsen S.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1990; 55: 145-153Google Scholar). GroEL from Escherichia coli is a widely studied member of the chaperonins, one class of molecular chaperones that have been found in prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (3Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). GroEL has been demonstrated to promote the in vitro refolding and assembly of many chemically denatured proteins, including rhodanese (4Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The ability of GroEL to interact with a wide variety of proteins is attributed to nonspecific hydrophobic interactions with protein folding intermediates (4Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GroEL is a homotetradecamer (14-mer) of 57.2-kDa monomers. The 14 subunits are arranged as two, stacked heptameric rings (10Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). The 2.8-Å crystal structure reveals a complicated architecture, with each monomer organized into three domains: equatorial (residues 6-133 together with 409-523), intermediate (residues 134-190 and 377-408), and apical (residues 191-376). The inter-heptamer contacts are entirely defined by the equatorial domains, while interactions between monomers within each ring are mediated by the equatorial domains and by conserved regions at the intermediate-apical domain interface (11Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). The apical domains line the opening to a central cavity at both ends of the tetradecamer and contain a region (residues 200-263) that has been implicated as the site of polypeptide and GroES binding by site-directed mutagenesis and the use of the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS, 1The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid)AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateNATAN-acetyltryptophanamideDTTdithiothreitolATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). which becomes photoincorporated between residues 203 and 249 (12Fenton Q.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A more recent crystal structure shows ATPγS bound to a site in the equatorial domain, at the base of the intermediate domain, with Mg2+ and another ion (possibly K+) coordinating the ligation (14Boisvert D.C.

It has been suggested that exposure of the hydrophobic surfaces on the apical domains of GroEL, which account for interaction with substrate and GroES, may need to be triggered by substrate or by other ligand-induced conformational changes (15Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In fact, several studies using cryo-electron microscopy have demonstrated quaternary structural changes in the tetradecamer where the monomers of one ring pivot with respect to the other ring and the apical domains swing outward upon ATP and GroES binding (16Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F. Chen S. auf der Mauer A. O'Hara B.P. Wood S.P. Mann N.H. Barnett L.K. Ellis R.J. Curr.

Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Similarly, recent work showed that a unique proteolytic site for trypsin at Arg-268 becomes exposed in the apical domains of one heptamer upon nucleotide binding (15Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results all confirm the original finding that nucleotides induce asymmetry between the two heptameric rings, and partially explain the finding in terms of structural changes in the oligomer (18Bochkareva E.S. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23869-23871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, use was made of two mutants of GroEL containing single tyrosine to tryptophan replacements (Y203W and Y360W). Changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence for each mutant reveal a conformational change upon nucleotide binding (ADP or AMP-PNP) that is unaffected by the presence of GroES. The results of fluorescence experiments suggest that nucleotide binding to the GroEL tetradecamer results in conformational changes in the apical domain, which are reported by changes in the environment of the tryptophan at 203 or at 360. Since these conformational changes precede binding of the co-chaperonin GroES, it suggests that nucleotides alone can play a critical role in the regulation of the quaternary structure of GroEL. All reagents used were of analytical grade. 4,4′-Bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Tryptophan mutations were constructed in the E. coli groE gene using the method of Stansens et al. (19Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The groE operon was cloned as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment from the plasmid pOF39 (20Fayet O. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) into the plasmids pMc5-8 (19Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), to give the plasmid pMcESL. Gapped duplexes were prepared by annealing purified TthIIII-HpaI-cut (mutant 203) or ClaI-NsiI-cut (mutant 360) pMcESL plasmid DNA with single-stranded DNA of pMa5-8 (19Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The gapped duplexes were hybridized with phosphorylated oligonucleotide 203 (5′-GCTTGTTGATGAACCAAGGAGACAGGTA-3′) or oligonucleotide 360 (5′-GCAGTTTTTCACGGTCCCAGTCAGAAGTTG-3′), and the gaps filled in and ligated as described (19Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The ligation mix was transformed into WK6mutS (19Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were selected and used to transform WK6. Mutants were identified by sequencing DNA from several transformants from this mix; a mutation frequency of approximately 50% was obtained. No other mutations occurred within the gapped region. To test for in vivo function, the plasmids carrying the mutations were transformed into a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutant of GroEL. Growth of the strains at 43°C was identical to the same strain containing pMcESL, whereas no growth took place with pMc5-8 in the same strain. Wild-type GroEL was purified from lysates of E. coli cells bearing the multicopy plasmid pND5 (21Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The purification was by a disassembly/reassembly process as described previously (Method I, in 22Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Y203W and Y360W tryptophan mutants of GroEL were purified from lysates of E. coli bearing the appropriate vectors (see above). The purification utilized the same two first steps as for the wild-type (a DEAE-Sephacel column and gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-400 column). Subsequent purification was essentially as described previously by Mizobata and Kawata (23Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, GroEL and GroES were mixed in equimolar amounts (based on oligomer concentrations) in a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 0.5 mM DTT, and 4 mM ATP. After a 1 h incubation at room temperature, the mixture was subjected to filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM ATP. Fractions containing the GroEL-GroES complex were pooled, concentrated (Centriprep-30) with a buffer change, and applied to the same column (Sephacryl S-200) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA. The fractions containing GroEL were collected, concentrated using a Centriprep-30, and then dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mM DTT. GroEL was then made 10% with respect to glycerol and frozen at −70°C. This purification method produces wild-type GroEL with very low tryptophan content and produced mutants with little or no bound tryptophan contaminants (23Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The co-chaperonin, GroES, was purified from lysates of E. coli cells bearing the multicopy plasmid pND5, using a previously published protocol (24Staniforth R.A. Cortes A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clark A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After purification, GroES was stored at 4°C in 70% ammonium sulfate. Prior to use, GroES was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, the pellet was resuspended in 50 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.0, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The protomer concentration of GroEL was measured under denaturing conditions, and GroES was measured under nondenaturing conditions using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Chaperonin-assisted refolding of the rhodanese was measured as described previously by monitoring the regain of enzyme activity (25Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In all cases, 109 nM urea-denatured rhodanese was refolded using 2.5 μM GroEL (protomer) in addition to the other components of the chaperonin assay mixture. All the fluorescence measurements were made using an SLM 500C fluorometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). For the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, excitation was at either 280 or 290 nm, as indicated in the figure legends. Experiments containing nucleotides were excited at 290 nm, where controls showed that the presence of nucleotides interfered the least with excitation of the tryptophans. Controls with N-acetyltryptophanamide (NATA) showed that nucleotide concentrations below ∼5 mM exhibited negligible inner filter effect. The spectra were therefore not corrected for nucleotide concentration. Fluorescence intensities were measured at the maximum of the spectra (∼348 nm for Y203W and ∼ 352 nm for Y360W), which were scanned from 300 to 400 nm. Excitation for the bisANS experiments was at 394 nm, with the emission monitored at 500 nm. Data were fit using a nonlinear least squares fitting procedure implemented in the software program, SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Where data were fit to a simple binding curve, the following equation was used: Fobs = (nS)/(KD+ S), where Fobs represents the measured intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and S represents the concentration of ligand. The form of the Hill equation employed for fitting the cooperative transitions was: Fobs = Fo− {((Fo− Finf)Sn)/(KD+ Sn)}, where Fobs represents the measured intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, Fo and Finf represent the maximum and minimum fluorescence values taken as the base-line values, and S represents the ligand concentration. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the intrinsic fluorescence of equimolar amounts of the two mutants and NATA in Tris·HCl, pH 7.6. The wavelength maxima are 342 nm for Y203W and 345 for Y360W compared with 352 nm for NATA, a model compound for tryptophan, indicating that the mutants contain partially buried tryptophan residues. The tryptophan content of each mutant was analyzed by comparing spectra in 8 M urea of 2 μM NATA with spectra of 2 μM solutions of the mutants in the same buffer. As previously reported, the wild-type contains very little intrinsic fluorescence, mostly attributable to tyrosines rather than tryptophans (22Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both denatured mutants have spectra comparable to the NATA standard (wavelength maxima and relative intensities: NATA, 352 nm, I = 1; Y203W, 351 nm, I = 1.09; and Y360W, 352 nm, I = 0.84). These results are consistent with the presence of only the single tryptophan residues which were substituted. Both mutants were capable of complementing a groELts mutant strain, indicating that neither of the single tryptophan substitutions disrupted the ability of the chaperonin to function in vivo (data not shown). This suggests that the mutants were capable of interacting with substrates and the co-chaperonin, as well as nucleotides, in vivo. The ability of the mutants to facilitate protein refolding in vitro was also assessed by their ability to arrest the spontaneous folding of rhodanese and by their ability to participate in the complete chaperonin-assisted folding of rhodanese that requires the co-chaperonin GroES as described previously (25Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both mutants as well as the wild-type protein could arrest the spontaneous folding of rhodanese > 96%. The mutants were able to facilitate the refolding of rhodanese in an ATP- and GroES-dependent manner, producing yields of recoverable activity similar to that previously reported with wild-type GroEL (25Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the wild-type GroEL led to 41% refolding in the assay described under “Materials and Methods” (compared with 36% in 25Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22113-22115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), while the mutants gave 30% (Y203W) and 38% (Y360W). The structural stabilities of the mutants were determined by subjecting them to urea disassembly and denaturation, as described previously (26Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the results for both mutants and wild-type GroEL. The data for the wild-type GroEL (shown as closed squares) are consistent with that reported previously and are provided for comparison. The rise in bisANS fluorescence with increasing [urea] to ≈3 M has been ascribed to the disassembly of the GroEL tetradecamers, while the decrease in intensity at higher [urea] correlates with previous observations that GroEL monomers unfold under these conditions. Y203W appears to have more hydrophobic exposure than the other forms, and the subsequent increase occurs at lower [urea]. However, the decrease at high [urea] is very similar for all the species. The effects of nucleotide binding on the urea-induced dissociation of the oligomer are shown in Fig. 2B. Nucleotide binding destabilizes the oligomer, such that it disassembles and the monomers unfold at lower urea concentrations. These results are compatible with those reported for wild-type GroEL liganded by ADP or ATP (26Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To further characterize the effects of nucleotide binding to the mutants, use was made of the recent report that nucleotide binding to wild-type GroEL results in selective trypsin proteolysis at a site in the apical domains (15Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consistent with this previous report for wild type, the mutants were protected from trypsin digestion when liganded by Mg2+ and became susceptible to proteolysis upon addition of nucleotide (data not shown). These results suggest that these mutants of GroEL have the appropriate intrinsic fluorescence properties that would be expected from their tryptophan content, and, although they may show some differences, they retain the essential structural and functional properties of wild-type chaperonin. Previous experiments have shown the binding of hydrophobic probes to GroEL in the presence of various perturbants (26Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or the photoincorporation of bis-ANS into a region of the protein between residues 203 and 249 (13Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To extend these results, energy transfer experiments were conducted using the tryptophan mutants of GroEL and bis-ANS. The tryptophan mutants and bis-ANS are an appropriate donor-acceptor pair for energy transfer because the tryptophan fluorescence has an emission spectrum that overlaps with the excitation spectrum of bis-ANS. Therefore, bis-ANS binding to or appropriately near the region containing the tryptophan should result in quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Fig. 3A shows the results for the Y360W mutant. In the absence of bis-ANS, the tryptophan fluorescence produces a peak with a maximum at 352 nm. Upon addition of bis-ANS to a final concentration of 10 μM, the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched ∼50%. By contrast, Fig. 3B shows the results for the Y203W mutant. Absent bis-ANS, a strong tryptophan fluorescence signal is seen with an emission maximum at 348 nm. But upon addition of bis-ANS, the tryptophan fluorescence is significantly quenched (∼75%). Given the report of photoincorporation of bis-ANS into the region of the apical domain between residues 203 and 249, where mutations of hydrophobic residues affected substrate and/or GroES binding, the results presented here are consistent with bis-ANS binding to the region of the apical domain that lines the opening to the central cavity, allowing for efficient transfer from Trp-203 and moderate transfer from Trp-360 (12Fenton Q.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 13Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The energy transfer for the Y203W was used to construct a binding isotherm based on the amount of tryptophan quenching at increasing bis-ANS concentrations and yielded an apparent KD of ∼3.5 μM (data not shown). This value is consistent with that previously reported for the binding of bis-ANS to GroEL in the presence or absence of various cations and perturbants (15Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since both tryptophan substitutions are in the apical domain of GroEL and since it has been reported that nucleotide binding results in reorientation of the apical domains of at least one heptamer (15Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F. Chen S. auf der Mauer A. O'Hara B.P. Wood S.P. Mann N.H. Barnett L.K. Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the intrinsic fluorescence of each mutant was monitored as a function of nucleotide concentration. Fig. 4 (A and B) shows the results for the Y203W mutant in the presence of ADP and AMP-PNP, respectively. In panel A, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence decreases in a concentration-dependent fashion indicative of ligand binding (filled squares). The transition was fit with the Hill equation (see “Materials and Methods”) for a cooperative transition, yielding a K1/2∼ 3 μM and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 3.54 ± 1.36. The presence of the co-chaperonin, GroES, did not significantly change the observed transition (open circles); K1/2∼ 5 μM and nH = 2.03 ± 0.41. The lack of an effect by the co-chaperonin was consistent with other results showing that increasing amounts of GroES, at a fixed nucleotide concentration, did not change the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of GroEL (data not shown). In panel B (AMP-PNP), both transitions were again indistinguishable (± GroES) within experimental error, with values of K1/2∼ 5 μM and nH = 1.48 ± 0.25 (− GroES) or nH = 1.66 ± 0.28 (+ GroES). Fig. 5 shows the results of the analogous experiments for the Y360W mutant in the presence of AMP-PNP. The experiments were also performed with ADP, producing results indistinguishable from AMP-PNP (not shown). In this case the transitions are best described by a simple binding isotherm (see “Materials and Methods” for equation), with an apparent KD = 5.1 μM (open squares). This value is consistent with that for a similar transition reported by Burston et al., using a pyrene maleimide-labeled GroEL (28Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Again, the presence of GroES did not alter the observed transitions (filled triangles). The differences between the transitions reported by the two mutants suggest that one tryptophan monitors nucleotide binding (Y360W), while the other monitors a subsequent, cooperative structural change upon nucleotide binding (Y203W). Since the presence of the co-chaperonin did not affect the observed transitions, this conformational change apparently precedes (and may allow for) GroES binding. Although the tryptophan mutants of GroEL could facilitate rhodanese refolding in a GroES-dependent fashion, there was a concern that the mutants might not form a stable complex with GroES, which could skew the interpretation of the fluorescence experiments. To be certain that a stable GroES-GroEL complex could be formed with both mutants, GroES was reductively methylated using [14C]formaldehyde, by a previously described procedure (29Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled GroES was used for complex formation in the presence of ADP and the subsequent complexes were detected on native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gels. Both GroEL mutants formed stable binary complexes with 14C-labeled GroES, to the same degree as wild-type GroEL. 2J. Ybarra, personal communication. To better understand the conformational changes in GroEL that result in decreased intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon binding of ADP or AMP-PNP, the quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence by acrylamide was measured. Acrylamide quenching gives an estimation of the exposure of tryptophans in a protein to the bulk solution. Fig. 6 shows the acrylamide quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence for the Y203W and Y360W mutants. The lines in Fig. 6 were obtained by fitting the data to the Stern-Volmer equation, Fo/F = 1 + Kq [Q], where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quenching agent. Kq is the apparent quenching constant and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher. NATA was used as a model compound for tryptophan and served as a positive control in these experiments (closed squares). The curvature of the data, which is apparent for the mutants in the absence of ligand, suggests that there is a static component to the quenching. These data were analyzed in terms of dynamic (KD) and static (KS) contributions using the Kq values at each acrylamide concentration by the method described by Lakowicz (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 270-271Google Scholar). Y360W gave KD = 7.46 M−1 and KS = 0.79 M−1; while Y203W gave KD = 4.99 M−1 and KS = 1.51 M−1. By comparison, NATA gave KD = 14.78 M−1 and KS = 3.58 M−1. In the presence of various ligands (Mg2+, Mg2+, and K+; or K+ and nucleotide-Mg), both mutants gave similar results. Only the data for GroEL in the presence of Mg2+ and K+ are shown (filled circles and open diamonds), but, in each of the three ligand conditions tested, the mutants displayed accessibility of the tryptophans to solvent that was somewhat reduced compared to the unliganded chaperonin which was reasonably well described with only dynamic quenching (Kq = 5.2 M−1 for Y360W and Kq = 4.6 M−1 for Y203W). This degree of solvent accessibility for tryptophans 203 and 360 in GroEL is significant compared to other native proteins, e.g. the Kq for native rhodanese has been reported as 1.0 M−1 (30Aird B.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 31Mendoza J.A. Butler M.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24648-24654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these results, the unliganded GroEL oligomer has greater solvent accessibility of both Trp-203 and Trp-360 compared to any of the Mg2+-liganded states of the protein, which is most apparent in the static quenching components. This is consistent with the reports of divalent cations stabilizing the tetradecamer (26Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Azem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28551-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent conformational changes that nucleotide binding induces, subsequent binding of nucleotide (ADP or AMP-PNP) to a Mg2+-liganded GroEL oligomer does not further alter the solvent accessibility of either tryptophan. By contrast, when the same experiment was performed using KI as the quencher (data not shown), neither of the tryptophan mutants was readily quenched by the I− (Kq∼ 1-2 M−1). The disparity between the results is most likely due to the ionic nature of the iodide, since the experiments with acrylamide and K+ had an approximately equivalent ionic strength of 100 mM KI. Both tryptophans are located in hydrophobic patches of the apical domain which may prevent good quenching by the ionic quencher as compared to the acrylamide. The results presented here support earlier studies that implicate ligand-induced conformational changes in GroEL (15Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Saibil H.R. Zheng D. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Watson G.M.F. Chen S. auf der Mauer A. O'Hara B.P.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by showing that nucleotide binding alone (ADP or AMP-PNP) causes a single transition in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of both mutants. For the Y203W mutant, the cooperative transition is most consistent with models in which nucleotides bind to one of the heptameric rings of a GroEL oligomer, producing a concerted conformational change in the apical domains of that heptamer while preventing nucleotide from binding to the opposite ring. The transition in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the Y360W mutant follows a simple binding isotherm, with an apparent KD of 5.1 μM. The differences between the transitions reported by the two mutants are subtle and could easily be accounted for by minor differences in stability, such that the binding of nucleotide does not produce identical responses in the two proteins. In essence, however, the results are very similar and the mutated residues are in different regions of the protein structure; residue 360 is located close to the hinge region between the intermediate and apical domains of a monomer, and residue 203 is located under the tip of the apical domain facing into the central cavity. Thus, the tryptophan fluorescence transitions might give an indication of how a message can be communicated from the nucleotide binding pocket in the equatorial domains, via the intermediate domains, to the interactive surfaces of the apical domains. Further, it is significant that GroES is not necessary and does not facilitate this apparent conformational change. This result extends the initial observations that nucleotide alone produces an asymmetric GroEL tetradecamer, and it can help explain (along with the ability of nucleotides to differentially modulate the affinity of GroEL for substrate) why some proteins require nucleotide, but not GroES, for their facilitated refolding by GroEL. That GroES does not alter the observed intrinsic fluorescence transitions might at first appear to be contradictory with the view that GroES increases the cooperativity of nucleotide hydrolysis by GroEL (35Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 36Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgeopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gray T. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, this may be an insight into the real effect of GroES in the system, to coordinate ATP hydrolysis and thereby facilitate the inherent ability of nucleotide to modulate the quaternary structure of GroEL. The co-chaperonin is not necessary for the cooperative conformational change induced by nucleotide binding as shown here, and, in fact, GroES appears to bind after the nucleotide binding-induced change, but prior to ATP hydrolysis (28Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Some evidence also suggests that a transient conformational state exists upon nucleotide hydrolysis, which GroES binding would induce due to its ability to coordinate hydrolysis (28Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The design of the experiments herein do not address this possibility. Given recent evidence that substrates affect the cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis by GroEL and the fact that non-native substrates stabilize the tetradecamer, we also cannot rule out the possibility that GroES affects the conformational changes in GroEL differently when the chaperonin is part of a ternary complex with non-native substrate (38Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Mendoza J.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25963-25965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational changes reported by the two single tyrosine to tryptophan mutants appear to be directly relevant to the functioning of the chaperonin based on the ability of the fluorescent, hydrophobic probe, bis-ANS, to quench the tryptophan fluorescence. This probe has been used in a number of studies to report the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on the chaperonin or on non-native substrates (4Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that this probe could be photoincorporated into the region of GroEL between residues 203 and 249 (13Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This is the region of GroEL rich in hydrophobic residues shown to be important for interaction with substrates and GroES (11Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 12Fenton Q.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The ability of this probe to bind and effectively quench the tryptophan fluorescence of the Y203W mutant and to partially quench the fluorescence of the Y360W mutant is consistent with bis-ANS binding within the hydrophobic region revealed by the crystal structure and mutation analysis. In fact, the larger distance of Tyr-360 from the region of photoincorporation explains why the quenching of Y360W is less than that observed for Y203W. The quenching experiments with acrylamide and KI also suggest that these putative sites of interaction do not significantly change their solvent exposure (being only slightly regulated by Mg2+ binding) and that their hydrophobic nature may be such that highly ionic molecules such as I− are prevented from approaching. The results presented here are consistent with the mechanisms of GroEL activity proposed by a number of groups, in which the two heptameric rings of GroEL alternate between high and low affinity states (28Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 38Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 40Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 41Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In these models, the transition from low to high affinity states is determined by nucleotide binding and subsequent binding of non-native protein or GroES. Thus, nucleotides can induce cooperative changes in the GroEL structure that expose sites in the apical domains, allowing for protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1971748533,"The K+-dependent ATPase activity of the H,K-ATPase was irreversibly inhibited by the carboxyl activating reagent, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). The inhibition was first order and displayed a concentration dependence with the K0.5 (DCCD) = 0.65 ± 0.04 mM. KCl protected 70% of the ATPase activity from DCCD-dependent inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner with a K0.5 (K+) = 0.58 ± 0.1 mM KCl. DCCD modification selectively inhibited the K+-dependent rather than ATP-dependent partial reactions including eosin fluorescence responses and ligand-stabilized initial tryptic cleavage patterns of the membrane-associated enzyme. DCCD modification also inhibited the binding of 86Rb+ and the fluorescent responses of the K+-competitive, fluorescent inhibitor 1-(2-methylphenyl)-4-methylamino-6-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline. [14C]DCCD was incorporated into the H,K-ATPase in a time course identical to that describing the inactivation of the K+-dependent ATPase activity of the H,K-ATPase. A component of the [14C]DCCD incorporated into the H,K-ATPase was K+-sensitive where K+ reduced the [14C]DCCD incorporated into the enzyme by 1.6 nmol of [14C]DCCD/mg of protein. Membrane-associated tryptic peptides resolved from the [14C]DCCD-modified H,K-ATPase exhibited various K+ sensitivities with peptides at 23, 9.6, 8.2, 7.1, and 6.1 kDa containing 10-78%, 23-52%, 24-36%, 2%, and 3-4% K+-sensitivity, respectively.The N-terminal sequence of the K+-sensitive, ∼23- and 9.6-kDa peptides was LVNE857, a C-terminal fragment of the ATPase α-subunit. The mass of the smaller peptide limited the residue assignment to the transmembrane M7/M8 domains and an intervening extracytoplasmic loop. An N-terminal sequence, SD840IM, was obtained from a 3.3-kDa, [14C]DCCD-labeled peptide resolved from a V8 digest of the partially purified α-subunit. This mass was sufficient to include LVNE but would exclude M8 and the intervening loop between M7 and M8. Glu857 is a unique residue present in each of the proteolytic preparations of the H,K-ATPase modified by [14C]DCCD.These data provide functional evidence of the selective inactivation of the K+-dependent partial reactions of the H,K-ATPase and show that Glu857 located at the M7 boundary in the C terminus of the pump molecule is a significant site of DCCD modification. These data are interpreted to indicate that this carboxyl residue is important for cation binding function. The K+-dependent ATPase activity of the H,K-ATPase was irreversibly inhibited by the carboxyl activating reagent, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). The inhibition was first order and displayed a concentration dependence with the K0.5 (DCCD) = 0.65 ± 0.04 mM. KCl protected 70% of the ATPase activity from DCCD-dependent inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner with a K0.5 (K+) = 0.58 ± 0.1 mM KCl. DCCD modification selectively inhibited the K+-dependent rather than ATP-dependent partial reactions including eosin fluorescence responses and ligand-stabilized initial tryptic cleavage patterns of the membrane-associated enzyme. DCCD modification also inhibited the binding of 86Rb+ and the fluorescent responses of the K+-competitive, fluorescent inhibitor 1-(2-methylphenyl)-4-methylamino-6-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]quinoline. [14C]DCCD was incorporated into the H,K-ATPase in a time course identical to that describing the inactivation of the K+-dependent ATPase activity of the H,K-ATPase. A component of the [14C]DCCD incorporated into the H,K-ATPase was K+-sensitive where K+ reduced the [14C]DCCD incorporated into the enzyme by 1.6 nmol of [14C]DCCD/mg of protein. Membrane-associated tryptic peptides resolved from the [14C]DCCD-modified H,K-ATPase exhibited various K+ sensitivities with peptides at 23, 9.6, 8.2, 7.1, and 6.1 kDa containing 10-78%, 23-52%, 24-36%, 2%, and 3-4% K+-sensitivity, respectively. The N-terminal sequence of the K+-sensitive, ∼23- and 9.6-kDa peptides was LVNE857, a C-terminal fragment of the ATPase α-subunit. The mass of the smaller peptide limited the residue assignment to the transmembrane M7/M8 domains and an intervening extracytoplasmic loop. An N-terminal sequence, SD840IM, was obtained from a 3.3-kDa, [14C]DCCD-labeled peptide resolved from a V8 digest of the partially purified α-subunit. This mass was sufficient to include LVNE but would exclude M8 and the intervening loop between M7 and M8. Glu857 is a unique residue present in each of the proteolytic preparations of the H,K-ATPase modified by [14C]DCCD.
