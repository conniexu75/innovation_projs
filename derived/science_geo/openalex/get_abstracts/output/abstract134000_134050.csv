https://openalex.org/W2036872212,"Echoplanar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in normal human subjects to investigate the role of the amygdala in conditioned fear acquisition and extinction. A simple discrimination procedure was employed in which activation to a visual cue predicting shock (CS+) was compared with activation to another cue presented alone (CS-). CS+ and CS- trial types were intermixed in a pseudorandom order. Functional images were acquired with an asymmetric spin echo pulse sequence from three coronal slices centered on the amygdala. Activation of the amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex was observed during conditioned fear acquisition and extinction. The extent of activation during acquisition was significantly correlated with autonomic indices of conditioning in individual subjects. Consistent with a recent electrophysiological recording study in the rat (Quirk et al., 1997), the profile of the amygdala response was temporally graded, although this dynamic was only statistically reliable during extinction. These results provide further evidence for the conservation of amygdala function across species and implicate an amygdalar contribution to both acquisition and extinction processes during associative emotional learning tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2052869567,"We have used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize neural responses associated with emotional learning. Employing a classical conditioning paradigm in which faces were conditioned by pairing with an aversive tone (US), we compared responses evoked by conditioned (CS+) and nonconditioned (CS−) stimuli. Pairing 50% of the CS+ with the US enabled us to constrain our analysis to responses evoked by a CS+ not followed by a US. Differential evoked responses, related to conditioning, were found in the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula, regions with known involvement in emotional processing. Differential responses of the amygdalae were best characterized by a time by stimulus interaction indicating a rapid adaptation of CS+-specific responses in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2111916392,"Dendritic spines have been proposed as primary sites of synaptic plasticity in the brain. Consistent with this hypothesis, spines contain high concentrations of actin, suggesting that they might be motile. To investigate this possibility, we made video recordings from hippocampal neurons expressing actin tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP–actin). This reagent incorporates into actin-containing structures and allows the visualization of actin dynamics in living neurons. In mature neurons, recordings of GFP fluorescence revealed large actin-dependent changes in dendritic spine shape, similar to those inferred from previous studies using fixed tissues. Visible changes occured within seconds, suggesting that anatomical plasticity at synapses can be extremely rapid. As well as providing a molecular basis for structural plasticity, the presence of motile actin in dendritic spines implicates the postsynaptic element as a primary site of this phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W2127423108,"The involvement of dorsal frontal and medial temporal regions during the encoding of words, namable line-drawn objects, and unfamiliar faces was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Robust dorsal frontal activations were observed in each instance, but lateralization was strongly dependent on the materials being encoded. Encoding of words produced left-lateralized dorsal frontal activation, whereas encoding of unfamiliar faces produced homologous right-lateralized activation. Encoding of namable objects, which are amenable to both verbal and nonverbal encoding, yielded bilateral dorsal frontal activation. A similar pattern of results was observed in the medial temporal lobe. These results indicate that regions in both hemispheres underlie human long-term memory encoding, and these regions can be engaged differentially according to the nature of the material being encoded."

https://openalex.org/W2087444241,"Ca2+ influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate- (NMDA-) type glutamate receptors plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity in the brain. One of the proteins activated by the increase in Ca2+ is CaM kinase II (CaMKII). Here, we report a novel synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein (p135 SynGAP) that is a major component of the postsynaptic density, a complex of proteins associated with synaptic NMDA receptors. p135 SynGAP is almost exclusively localized at synapses in hippocampal neurons where it binds to and closely colocalizes with the scaffold protein PSD-95 and colocalizes with NMDA receptors. The Ras-GTPase activating activity of p135 SynGAP is inhibited by phosphorylation by CaMKII located in the PSD protein complex. Inhibition of p135 SynGAP by CaMKII will stop inactivation of GTP-bound Ras and thus could result in activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in hippocampal neurons upon activation of NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2013681684,"Oligodendrocyte progenitors originate near the floor plate of the spinal cord, then proliferate and migrate throughout the cord before giving rise to oligodendrocytes. Progenitor cell proliferation stops before birth because the cell cycle slows down, linked to an increase in differentiation and death. Experiments with transgenic mice show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) drives progenitor cell division and suggest that slowing of and exit from the cycle reflects a decline in PDGF signaling. Overexpressing PDGF induces hyperproliferation of progenitor cells and excessive, ectopic production of oligodendrocytes. However, the superfluous oligodendrocytes die at an immature stage of differentiation, leaving a normal complement of myelin-forming cells. Therefore, cell survival controls override proliferation controls for determining the final number and distribution of mature oligodendrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1990779469,"We report a quantitative survey of the population of amacrine cells present in the retina of the rabbit. The cells' dendritic shape and level of stratification were visualized by a photochemical method in which a fluorescent product was created within an individual cell by focal irradiation of that cell's nucleus. A systematically random sample of 261 amacrine cells was examined. Four previously known amacrine cells were revealed at their correct frequencies. Our central finding is that the heterogeneous collection of other amacrine cells is broadly distributed among at least 22 types: only one type of amacrine cell makes up more than 5% of the total amacrine cell population. With these results, the program of identification and classification of retinal neurons begun by Cajal is nearing completion. The complexity encountered has implications both for the retina and for the many regions of the central nervous system where less is known."

https://openalex.org/W2002298833,"Although motion-sensitive neurons in macaque middle temporal (MT) area are conventionally characterized using stimuli whose velocity remains constant for 1–3 s, many ecologically relevant stimuli change on a shorter time scale (30–300 ms). We compared neuronal responses to conventional (constant-velocity) and time-varying stimuli in alert primates. The responses to both stimulus ensembles were well described as rate-modulated Poisson processes but with very high precision (∼3 ms) modulation functions underlying the time-varying responses. Information-theoretic analysis revealed that the responses encoded only ∼1 bit/s about constant-velocity stimuli but up to 29 bits/s about the time-varying stimuli. Analysis of local field potentials revealed that part of the residual response variability arose from “noise” sources extrinsic to the neuron. Our results demonstrate that extrastriate neurons in alert primates can encode the fine temporal structure of visual stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2119214735,"Hippocampal inhibitory cells are diverse. It is supposed that they fall into functionally distinct subsets defined by a similar morphology and physiology. Switching between functions could be accomplished by activating receptors for modulating transmitters expressed selectively by different subsets of interneurons. We tested this hypothesis by comparing morphology, physiology, and neurotransmitter receptor expression for CA1 hippocampal interneurons. We distinguished 16 distinct morphological phenotypes and 3 different modes of discharge. Subsets of inhibitory cells were excited or inhibited by agonists at receptors for noradrenaline, muscarine, serotonin, and mGluRs. Most cells responded to 2 or 3 agonists, and 25 different response combinations were detected. Subsets defined by morphology, physiology, and receptor expression did not coincide, suggesting that hippocampal interneurons cannot easily be segregated into a few well-defined groups."

https://openalex.org/W2169250706,"Syntaxin-1 is a component of the synaptic vesicle docking and/or membrane fusion soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) complex (7S and 20S complexes) in nerve terminals. Syntaxin-1 also forms a heterodimer with Munc18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 in a complex that is distinct from the 7S and 20S complexes. In this report, we identify a novel syntaxin-1-binding protein, tomosyn, that is capable of dissociating Munc18 from syntaxin-1 and forming a novel 10S complex with syntaxin-1, soluble N-etyhlmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment (SNAP) 25, and synaptotagmin. The 130 kDa isoform of tomosyn is specifically expressed in brain, where its distribution partly overlaps with that of syntaxin-1 in nerve terminals. High level expression of either syntaxin-1 or tomosyn results in a specific reduction in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells. These results suggest that tomosyn is an important component in the neurotransmitter release process where it may stimulate SNARE complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W2087447309,"In a temperature-sensitive Drosophila mutant, shibire, synaptic vesicles are completely depleted in nerve terminals after stimulation at 34 degrees C, but upon returning to 22 degrees C, endocytosis resumes. In this study, synaptic vesicles in the boutons of nerve terminals at the mutant neuromuscular junction were loaded with a fluorescent dye, FM1-43, during vesicle reformation at 22 degrees C after complete depletion at 34 degrees C. We found two distinct pools of synaptic vesicles, namely an exo/endo cycling pool, located in the periphery of the bouton, and a reserve pool, located in its center. Cytochalasin D treatment eliminated the reserve pool and reduced synaptic transmission evoked by high frequency stimulation. Thus, the reserve pool may play a crucial role for sustaining high frequency synaptic transmission."

https://openalex.org/W2003271176,"We have investigated the inactivation mechanism of neuronal N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels. Although channels inactivate slowly during square-pulse depolarization, as observed previously, we now find that they inactivate profoundly during a train of action potential (AP) waveforms. The apparent paradox arises from a voltage-dependent mechanism in which channels inactivate preferentially from intermediate closed states along the activation pathway. Inactivation can therefore extend beyond the brief duration of AP waveforms to continue between spikes, as the channel undergoes repetitive cycles of activation and deactivation. The extent of inactivation during a train is strongly affected by the subunit composition of channels. Preferential closed-state inactivation of neuronal calcium channels could produce widely variable depression of Ca2+ entry during a train of APs."
https://openalex.org/W1986116780,"Rapid, voltage-dependent potentiation of skeletal muscle L-type calcium channels requires phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) anchored via an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP). Here we report the isolation, primary sequence determination, and functional characterization of AKAP15, a lipid-anchored protein of 81 amino acid residues with a single amphipathic helix that binds PKA. AKAP15 colocalizes with L-type calcium channels in transverse tubules and is associated with L-type calcium channels in transfected cells. A peptide fragment of AKAP15 encompassing the RII-binding domain blocks voltage-dependent potentiation. These results indicate that AKAP15 targets PKA to the calcium channel and plays a critical role in voltage-dependent potentiation and regulation of skeletal muscle contraction. The expression of AKAP15 in the brain and heart suggests that it may mediate rapid PKA regulation of L-type calcium channels in neurons and cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2079918807,"Using RNA fingerprinting (RAP) strategy and Northern blot analysis, we identified a differentially expressed sequence DOC-2 which is detectable in all normal human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cell cultures but not in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues. Subsequent cloning of DOC-2 from a cDNA library generated from the HOSE cells was carried out using the 3' and 5' RACE approach. A 3268 base pair full length cDNA of DOC-2 was isolated and sequenced. The predicted protein has a length of 770 amino acids. Homology search of all NCBI sequences indicated that the amino acid sequence of DOC-2 shares 93% homology with the mouse p96/mDab2 phosphoprotein and has a phosphotyrosine interacting domain (PID) and multiple SH3 binding motifs. Chromosomal localization by FISH showed that the DOC-2 gene is located on 5p13. Western blot analysis showed that the 105 kDa DOC-2 protein was down-regulated in all the carcinoma cell lines. In-situ immunohistochemistry performed on normal ovaries, and benign, borderline and invasive ovarian tumor tissues showed down regulation of DOC-2 protein particularly in serous ovarian tumor tissues. When DOC-2 was transfected into the ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3, the stable transfectants showed significantly reduced growth rate and ability to form tumors in nude mice. These data suggest that down-regulation of DOC-2 may play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2143389504,"We have cloned a novel K+-selective, inward rectifier channel that is widely expressed in brain but is especially abundant in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. It is also present in a wide array of tissues, including kidney and intestine. The channel is only 38% identical to its closest relative, Kir1.3 (Kir1-ATP-regulated inward rectifier K+ [ROMK] family) and displays none of the functional properties unique to the ROMK class. Kir7.1 has several unique features, including a very low estimated single channel conductance (approximately 50 fS), low sensitivity to block by external Ba2+ and Cs+, and no dependence of its inward rectification properties on the internal blocking particle Mg2+. The unusual pore properties of Kir7.1 seem to be explained by amino acids in the pore sequence that differ from corresponding conserved residues in all other Kir channel proteins. Replacement of one of these amino acids (Met-125) with the Arg absolutely conserved in all other Kir channels dramatically increases its single channel conductance and Ba2+ sensitivity. This channel would provide a steady background K+ current to help set the membrane potential in cells in which it is expressed. We propose that the novel channel be assigned to a new Kir subfamily, Kir7.1."
https://openalex.org/W2060705097,"One model of neuronal polarity (13Dotti C.G Simons K Polarized sorting of viral glycoproteins to the axon and dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture.Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) proposes that neurons and polarized epithelia use similar mechanisms to sort membrane proteins. To explore this hypothesis, we used viral vectors to express proteins in cultured neurons and assessed their distribution using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy. Basolateral epithelial proteins were polarized to dendrites; more significantly, mutations of sequences required for their basolateral targeting in epithelia also disrupted dendritic targeting. Unexpectedly, apical proteins were not polarized to axons but were expressed at roughly equal amounts in dendrites and axons. These data provide strong evidence that targeting of basolateral and dendritic proteins depends on common mechanisms. In contrast, the sorting of proteins to the axon requires signals that are not present in apical proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1980932813,"Presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) modulate the release of transmitter from most central synapses. However, difficulties in recording from presynaptic structures has lead to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying these fundamental processes. By recording directly from presynaptic reticulospinal axons and postsynaptic motoneurons of the lamprey spinal cord, we have obtained electrophysiological and optical evidence that vertebrate presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors modulate neurotransmitter release at this synapse through two distinct mechanisms: (1) mGluR activation in the presynaptic terminal depresses transmitter release by activating a presynaptic K+ current, and (2) mGluR activation enhances transmitter release by amplifying the action potential–evoked presynaptic Ca2+ signal by rapidly releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, this effect is mediated by physiological release of glutamate from the presynaptic terminals. These autoreceptor–mediated processes are likely to generate complex effects on transmitter release evoked by repetitive stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1985328527,"We have studied the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met signaling in the development of sympathetic neuroblasts and neurons. Anti-HGF antibodies reduced the number of sympathetic neuroblasts that differentiated into neurons, but neither anti-HGF antibodies nor HGF affected neuroblast proliferation. Anti-HGF antibodies also reduced the survival of neuroblasts but not sympathetic neurons. HGF greatly enhanced the neurite outgrowth of NGF-dependent sympathetic neurons throughout development. These in vitro effects of anti-HGF antibodies and HGF were abolished by a disabling mutation of Met, the HGF receptor tyrosine kinase. The Met mutation also increased sympathetic neuroblast apoptosis in vivo. Because Met and HGF are expressed in sympathetic ganglia throughout development, it is possible that the multiple effects of HGF/Met signaling on sympathetic neuroblasts and neurons occur in part by an autocrine mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2012448989,"Arterial baroreceptors are mechanosensitive nerve endings in the aortic arch and carotid sinus that play a critical role in acute regulation of arterial blood pressure. A previous study has shown that nitric oxide (NO) or NO-related species suppress action potential discharge of baroreceptors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of NO on Na+ currents of isolated baroreceptor neurons in culture. Exogenous NO donors inhibited both tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive and -insensitive Na+ currents. The inhibition was not mediated by cGMP but by NO interaction with channel thiols. Acute inhibition of NO synthase increased the Na+ currents. NO scavengers (hemoglobin and ferrous diethyldithiocarbamate) increased Na+ currents before but not after inhibition of NO synthase. Furthermore, NO production in the neuronal cultures was detected by chemiluminescence and immunoreactivity to the neuronal isoform of NO synthase was identified in fluorescently identified baroreceptor neurons. These results indicate that NO/NO-related species function as autocrine regulators of Na+ currents in baroreceptor neurons. Modulation of Na+ channels may represent a novel response to NO."
https://openalex.org/W2011402312,"Akt2 encodes a protein-serine/threonine kinase containing a pleckstrin homology domain characteristic of many signaling molecules. Although there has been extensive interest in the mechanism by which the closely-related Akt kinase participates in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated signaling, comparatively little is known regarding the expression and function of Akt2. This manuscript is the first to describe Akt2 mRNA expression in the developing mouse and the activation of AKT2 by insulin. These studies demonstrate that Akt2 is especially abundant in brown fat and, to a lesser extent, skeletal muscle and liver, tissues which are highly insulin-responsive and play a role in glucose metabolism. Endogenous Akt2 expression also is upregulated in fully-differentiated C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting that these murine cell lines represent useful in vitro models for studies of Akt2 function. We show that HA-tagged AKT2 is activated in response to insulin stimulation in vitro and that activation of AKT2 is not induced in cells pretreated with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These data suggest that Akt2 expression is fundamental to the differentiated state of fat and muscle cells and that activation of AKT2 kinase by insulin is mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2064136116,"There is evidence that oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord are derived from a restricted part of the ventricular zone near the floor plate. An alternative view is that oligodendrocytes are generated from all parts of the ventricular zone. We reinvestigated glial origins by constructing chick–quail chimeras in which dorsal or ventral segments of the embryonic chick neural tube were replaced with equivalent segments of quail neural tube. Ventral grafts gave rise to both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In contrast, dorsal grafts produced astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes. In mixed cultures of ventral and dorsal cells, only ventral cells generated oligodendrocytes, whereas both ventral and dorsal cells generated astrocytes. Therefore, oligodendrocytes are derived specifically from ventral neuroepithelium, and astrocytes from both dorsal and ventral."
https://openalex.org/W2077395523,"The developmentally regulated H19 gene displays several remarkable properties: expression of an apparently non-translated mRNA, genomic imprinting (maternal allele only expressed), relaxation of the imprinting and/or epigenetic lesions demonstrated in some tumors. Despite several observations after relaxation of imprinting status of the gene, data on trans and cis-acting factors required for the human H19 gene expression are still missing. As a first approach to address identification of factors involved in the regulation of the gene, we found that cells from a p53 antisense-transfected HeLa clone displayed increased amounts of H19 transcripts when compared to the non-transfected cells. Moreover, a HeLa clone stably transfected with a temperature sensitive (ts) 143 Ala p53 mutant exhibited temperature-dependent regulation of H19 expression. This preliminary indication of the repressing effect of the p53 protein on H19 expression has been confirmed by transient cotransfection experiments in HeLa cells, using luciferase surrogate constructs under the control of the 823 bp sequence immediately upstream of the transcription start point of the H19 gene, and different constructs containing sense, antisense or a ts 143 Ala mutant p53 cDNA. We observed an increase of H19 promoter-driven activity in transient cotransfections with the antisense p53 cDNA and the temperature sensitive mutant p53 at the non-permissive temperature, but a decrease with sense wild-type p53 cDNA. Furthermore, the cotransfection experiments were repeated in a cell line lacking endogenous p53. (Calu 6 cells) and the results provided additional evidence for a down regulation of the expression of the H19 gene by the p53 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2320288944,"Within the tumor-stromal microenvironment a disrupted balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors compromises the integrity of the extracellular matrix and promotes malignancy. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been linked to tumor suppression in studies of genetically altered tissue culture cells and in analyses of clinical specimens in situ. We generated transgenic mice as a model system to test the relationship between TIMP-1 levels in a host organ and susceptibility to experimentally targeted metastasis. Ectopically overexpressed TIMP-1 in the brain resulted in a tissue microenvironment with elevated protein levels of this natural MMP inhibitor. Metastatic challenge provided by lacZ-tagged fibrosarcoma cells permitted high-resolution analysis of metastatic load and pattern. We found that elevated host TIMP-1 imposed resistance to experimental metastasis of fibrosarcoma: In TIMP-1 overexpressing mice, brain metastases were significantly reduced by 75% compared to wild-type littermates. Our findings demonstrate that ectopic TIMP-1 expression efficiently exerts a suppressive effect on metastasizing tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2333904918,"The candidate proto-oncogene BCL3 was isolated through its involvement in the t(14;19) found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell neoplasms. As a member of the IκB family, BCL3 plays a role in the immune response by interactions with the NF-κB family of transcription factors. In order to study the role of BCL3 overexpression in lymphoid malignancies, we generated five lines of Eμ-BCL3 transgenic mice. Transgenic animals develop normally but show splenomegaly and an accumulation of mature B cells in lymph nodes, bone marrow and peritoneal cavity. A hyperresponsive immune system is suggested by the follicular hyperplasia and plasmacytosis in lymph nodes of unimmunized animals, increased incidence of antibodies to self-antigens, and a heightened response to cross-linking of surface IgM. Statistically significant decreases in serum IgM and IgG3, but an increase in IgG1 and IgA were also observed. No lymphoid neoplasms have been identified in transgenic animals. The expansion of B cells in vivo is consistent with the overexpression of BCL3 as being one step in the multi-step process of leukemogenesis. The phenotype also suggests that BCL3 plays a part in B cell proliferation and isotype switching."
https://openalex.org/W2335450429,"Lysophosphatidylinositol (LysoPtdIns) is formed by a constitutively-active phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase A2 in Ras-transformed cells and can stimulate cell proliferation. To evaluate whether LysoPtdIns could function as an autocrine modulator of cell growth, we examined whether LysoPtdIns can be released in the medium of Ras-transformed FRT-Fibro fibroblasts and thyroid cells. Here, we report that LysoPtdIns accumulates in the extracellular space of these lines and reaches levels up to tenfold higher than in the case of normal cells. Moreover, the ionophore A23187 increased the levels of the lysolipid in the extracellular medium. Extracellular LysoPtdIns was rapidly hydrolyzed to inositol 1 : 2-cyclic phosphate. LysoPtdIns induced thymidine incorporation in FRT-Fibro Ha-Ras fibroblasts, whereas inositol cyclic 1 : 2-cyclic phosphate did not affect cell growth per se, nor did it interfere with the LysoPtdIns mitogenic activity. We hypothesize that in Ras-transformed fibroblasts the formation and release of LysoPtdIns may function as an autocrine mechanism that participates in the Ras-dependent stimulation of cell growth."

It is found in T cells (Marth et al., 1985, 1988) and in the mouse brain (Omri et al., 1996; Van Tan et al., 1996). In this report, we describe experiments showing that Lck is present in the mouse retina neurons. Lck gene expression was identified after isolating and sequencing the specific 5' and 3' part of the cDNA obtained by RT-PCR. In adult retina Lck immunoreactivity was most abundant in photoreceptor cells and within the outer plexiform layers. Staining was also observed in the inner nuclear and plexiform layers. In transgenic mice, the disruption of the Lck gene had serious consequences on the organization of the retina causing retinal dysplasia. These mice have partial retinal detachment with infolding and rosette formation in the photoreceptor sheet. These retinal abnormalities observed in Lck deficient mice lead to the loss of normal architecture of the photoreceptor and the inner nuclear layers, and provide an important role of Lck protein in the retina development. The lack of the Lck protein produces a spectrum of retinal pathology that resembles human retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)."
