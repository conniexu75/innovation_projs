In this work, we identified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAH1 (previously known as SMP2) gene that encodes Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase using amino acid sequence information derived from a purified preparation of the enzyme (Lin, Y.-P., and Carman, G. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8641–8645). Overexpression of PAH1 in S. cerevisiae directed elevated levels of Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase activity, whereas the pah1Δ mutation caused reduced levels of enzyme activity. Heterologous expression of PAH1 in Escherichia coli confirmed that Pah1p is a Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase enzyme and showed that its enzymological properties were very similar to those of the enzyme purified from S. cerevisiae. The PAH1-encoded enzyme activity was associated with both the membrane and cytosolic fractions of the cell, and the membrane-bound form of the enzyme was salt-extractable. Lipid analysis showed that mutants lacking PAH1 accumulated PA and had reduced amounts of diacylglycerolanditsderivativetriacylglycerol.ThePAH1-encoded Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase shows homology to mammalian lipin, a fat-regulating protein whose molecular function is unknown. Heterologous expression of human LPIN1 in E. coli showed that lipin 1 is also a Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase enzyme.

In higher eukaryotes, PA phosphatase also plays a role in lipid signaling as part of the phospholipase D-PA phosphatase pathway for the generation of DAG from phosphatidylcholine (7Exton J.H. J.

These enzymes have broad substrate specificity; in addition to PA, they utilize a variety of lipid phosphate substrates including diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, lyso-PA, and isoprenoid phosphates (14Toke D.A.

The DPP1-encoded phosphatase enzyme regulates the cellular levels of PA and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate in vacuole membranes of zinc-depleted cells, but the physiological significance of this regulation is unclear (17Han G.-S. Johnston C.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5338-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the LPP1 gene product controls phospholipid composition in Golgi membranes. Although the DPP1- and LPP1-encoded Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activities may regulate specific pools of PA in the vacuole and Golgi, respectively, they are not responsible for the de novo synthesis of phospholipids and TAG that presumably occurs in the ER.The Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase is postulated to be responsible for the DAG needed for the synthesis of phospholipids and TAG in S. cerevisiae (6Sorger D. Daum G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 61: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membrane-associated forms of the Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase have been purified and characterized with respect to their enzymological and regulatory properties (12Carman G.M. Biochim.

Unlike the Mg2+-independent forms of PA phosphatase, the Mg2+-dependent forms of the enzyme are specific for PA and require Mg2+ ions for catalytic activity (22Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Morlock K.R. McLaughlin J.J. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

However, genes encoding Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase enzymes have not been identified from S. cerevisiae or from any organism (12Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because mutants defective in these enzymes are not available, it has not been established whether the Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatases previously isolated from S. cerevisiae (22Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J.

Lipid analysis of a pah1Δ mutant showed that the Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase is indeed a relevant enzyme responsible for de novo lipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, we showed that lipin 1, a mammalian fat-regulating protein that is homologous to Pah1p (30Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), exhibits Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Yeast cells were grown in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic complete (SC) medium containing 2% glucose at 30 °C as described previously (31Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For selection of yeast cells bearing plasmids, appropriate amino acids were omitted from SC medium. The growth medium used for the analysis of lipids and for testing the inositol excretion phenotype lacked inositol (33Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of the ino1 mutant was used as an indicator of inositol excretion, and the inositol excreting opi1 mutant (34Greenberg M. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Plasmid maintenance and amplifications were performed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α, and protein expression was performed in the strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C, and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to select for the bacterial cells carrying plasmids. For growth on solid media, agar plates were prepared with supplementation of either 2% (yeast) or 1.5% (E. coli) agar. Cell numbers in liquid media were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm. For heterologous expression of yeast PAH1 and human LPIN1, E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells bearing pGH313 and pGH318, respectively, were grown to A600 = 0.5 at room temperature in 500 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). The culture was incubated for 1 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce the expression of His6-tagged Pah1p and lipin 1.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this workStrain or plasmidGenotype or relevant characteristicsSource or Ref.E. coliDH5αF- ϕ80dlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rk- mk+) phoA supE44 λ-thi-1, gyrA96 relA132Sambrook J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) transformations were performed by standard protocols. PCR reactions were optimized as described by Innis and Gelfand (36Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications.

Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and analyzed by automated DNA sequencer.Construction of Plasmids—The plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. The S. cerevisiae PAH1 gene (SMP2/YMR165C) was cloned by PCR. A 3.8-kb DNA fragment that contains the entire coding sequence (2.6 kb) of PAH1, the 5′-untranslated region (0.7 kb), and the 3′-untranslated region (0.5 kb) was amplified from the genomic DNA template of S. cerevisiae strain BY4742. The PAH1 DNA fragments were digested with XbaI/SphI and inserted into plasmid YEp351 at the same restriction enzyme sites. The multicopy plasmid containing PAH1 was named pGH311. The PAH1 gene was used to construct PAH1HA, in which the sequence for an HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was located after the start codon. The 0.7- and 3.1-kb PAH1 DNA fragments that contain the HA tag at the 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, were amplified by PCR. These DNA fragments were digested with XbaI/AatII and AatII/SphI, respectively, and inserted into YEp351 at the XbaI/SphI sites. The multicopy plasmid containing PAH1HA was named pGH312. For expression of PAH1 in E. coli, the entire coding sequence of PAH1 was amplified by PCR using plasmid pGH311 as a template. The PCR product (∼2.6 kb) was digested with HindIII to produce 0.6- and 2.0-kb DNA fragments, which were then digested with NdeI and XhoI, respectively. The NdeI-HindIII and HindIII-XhoI DNA fragments were inserted into pET-15b at the NdeI/XhoI sites. The E. coli expression plasmid containing the His6-tagged PAH1 was named pGH313. For expression of human LPIN1 (accession number NM_145693) in E. coli, the entire coding sequence of the gene was amplified from a full-length LPIN1 cDNA clone (OriGENE Technologies, Inc.) by PCR using primers with add-on restriction enzyme sites (MluI before start codon/XhoI after stop codon). The PCR product (2.7 kb) was digested with MluI, filled with Klenow, and digested with XhoI. The LPIN1 DNA fragment was ligated with pET-15b that was digested with NdeI, filled with Klenow, and digested with XhoI. The E. coli expression plasmid containing the His6-tagged LPIN1 was named pGH318.Construction of the pah1Δ Mutant and the pah1Δ dpp1Δ lpp1Δ Triple Mutant—URA3 DNA (1.4 kb) was amplified from plasmid pRS406 by PCR using primers with add-on restriction enzyme sites. The PCR products were digested with Tth111I and SpeI and inserted into the plasmid pGH311 that was digested with the same restriction enzymes to remove 80% of the PAH1 coding sequence. The resulting plasmid, which contains a 3-kb PAH1 deletion cassette (pah1Δ::URA3), was named pGH317. Deletion of the PAH1 gene in the yeast chromosome was performed by the method of one-step gene replacement (37Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The PAH1 deletion cassette was released from plasmid pGH317 by digestion with XbaI and SphI and used to transform strains W303-1A and TBY1. The resulting transformants were selected on SC-uracil medium. Disruption of the PAH1 gene in uracil prototrophs was examined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using primers that flank the inserted URA3 gene.Preparation of the Cytosolic and Membrane Fractions from S. cerevisiae—All steps were performed at 4 °C. Yeast cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Cells were disrupted with glass beads (0.5 mm diameter) using a Biospec Products Mini-BeadBeater-8 as described previously (38Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate cytosolic (supernatant) from membrane fractions (pellet). The membranes were suspended in the same buffer used to disrupt cells.

E. coli cells expressing His6-tagged Pah1p and lipin 1 were washed once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer and suspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by a freeze-thawing cycle and by two passes through a French press at 20,000 pounds/square inch. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell lysate) was gently mixed with 2 ml of 50% slurry of Ni2+-NTA-agarose for 2 h. The Ni2+-NTA-agarose/enzyme mixture was packed in a 10-ml Poly-Prep column and washed with 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 45 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. His6-tagged proteins were then eluted from the column in 1-ml fractions with a total of 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Enzyme preparations were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 10% glycerol and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and stored at –80 °C.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (41Haid A.

https://openalex.org/W2152976315,"The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (with energies up to 10^15 eV) remains unclear, though it is widely believed that they originate in the shock waves of expanding supernova remnants. Currently the best way to investigate their acceleration and propagation is by observing the gamma-rays produced when cosmic rays interact with interstellar gas. Here we report observations of an extended region of very high energy (VHE, >100 GeV) gamma-ray emission correlated spatially with a complex of giant molecular clouds in the central 200 pc of the Milky Way. The hardness of the gamma-ray spectrum and the conditions in those molecular clouds indicate that the cosmic rays giving rise to the gamma-rays are likely to be protons and nuclei rather than electrons. The energy associated with the cosmic rays could have come from a single supernova explosion around 10,000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2152045320,"A reduced response of older skeletal muscle to anabolic stimuli may contribute to the development of sarcopenia. We hypothesized that muscle proteins are resistant to the anabolic action of insulin in the elderly. We examined the effects of hyperinsulinemia on muscle protein metabolism in young (25+/-2 year) and older (68+/-1 year) healthy subjects using stable isotope tracer techniques. Leg blood flow was higher in the young at baseline and increased during hyperinsulinemia, whereas it did not change in the elderly. Glucose concentrations and muscle uptake were not different between groups at baseline and during hyperinsulinemia. Leg phenylalanine net balance was not different at baseline and significantly increased in both groups with hyperinsulinemia (P<0.05) but to a greater extent in the young (P<0.05). Muscle protein synthesis increased only in the young during hyperinsulinemia. Muscle protein breakdown did not significantly change in either group, although it tended to decrease in the elderly. Changes in muscle protein synthesis were correlated with changes in leg amino acid delivery (R=0.89; P=0.0001) and blood flow (R=0.90; P<0.0001). In conclusion, skeletal muscle protein synthesis is resistant to the anabolic action of insulin in older subjects, which may be an important contributor to the development of sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2022285303,"Sumoylation is an important post-translational modification that provides a rapid and reversible means for controlling the activity, subcellular localization, and stability of target proteins. We have examined the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to tau and α-synuclein, two natively unfolded proteins that define several neurodegenerative diseases. Both brain proteins were preferentially modified by SUMO1, as compared with SUMO2 or SUMO3. Tau contains two SUMO consensus sequences, and mutational analyses identified Lys340 as the major sumoylation site. Although both tau and α-synuclein are targets for proteasomal degradation, only tau sumoylation was affected by inhibitors of the proteasome pathway. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, whose ability to bind and stabilize microtubules is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. Treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, or the microtubule depolymerizing drug, colchicine, up-regulated tau sumoylation. This suggests that SUMO modification may preferentially target a free soluble pool of the substrate. These findings revealed a new, possibly regulatory, modification of tau and α-synuclein that may also have implications for their pathogenic roles in neurodegenerative diseases.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). SUMO isoforms are expressed in humans and display cell type-specific expression levels and distinct, although not exclusive, subcellular localizations (2Su H.-L. Li S. S.-L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Each SUMO paralog is expressed as a precursor protein that undergoes processing by a C-terminal hydrolase (3Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Once cleaved, the mature protein has a diglycine motif exposed at the C terminus and is ready to enter a multistep enzymatic pathway, which is similar but quite distinct from ubiquitination. Mature SUMO proteins are primed in an ATP-dependent manner by the SUMO-activating (E1) enzyme Sua1/hUba2 (4Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 5Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Activated SUMO is then transferred, through a trans-esterification reaction, to a unique conjugating (E2) enzyme, Ubch9 (6Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 47: 297-300Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The final step is the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and the lysine ϵ-amino group of the target substrate. A majority of the acceptor lysine residues are found within a SUMO consensus motif ΨKX(E/D), in which Ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue. Although E1 and E2 are sufficient for SUMO conjugation to various substrates (8Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), it is assumed that SUMO E3 ligases catalyze sumoylation at non-consensus sites, increase the rate of modification, or ensure substrate specificity (10Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 11Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.-S. Dejean A. Melchior F.

Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Sumoylation is a highly dynamic and reversible process as specific proteases can rapidly remove SUMO from their substrates (for review, see Ref. 14Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In contrast to ubiquitin, which mainly tags proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation, covalent modification by SUMO can have a number of functional consequences for the target proteins. For example, sumoylation modulates protein-protein interactions, affects subcellular localization and, in some cases, antagonizes the proteasome pathway by competing with ubiquitin (for review, see Ref. 1Dohmen R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Despite the rapidly growing number of SUMO substrates identified, in most cases, the physiological function and regulation of sumoylation remain elusive and may vary according to the nature of the target. Tau and α-synuclein belong to the family of natively unfolded proteins as they display an extended conformation in vitro with little ordered secondary structure (15Schweers O. Schönbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Both proteins are highly soluble and heat-resistant. They are highly expressed in the brain and are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (reviewed in Ref. 17Goedert M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As with other amyloidogenic proteins, tau and α-synuclein undergo a pathological transition from random coil to a β-pleated sheet conformation that is accompanied by extensive aggregation and fibril formation (18Barghorn S. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1694-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications affect both protein structure and function and may also contribute to protein dysfunction. Tau is a phosphoprotein with up to 30 tightly regulated phosphorylation sites, and hyperphosphorylation is a common feature of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer disease (21Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.-C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4913-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). Similarly, α-synuclein inclusions in the form of Lewy bodies are a pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and other α-synucleinopathies (22Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation (23Okochi M. Walter J. Akihiko K. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J.

Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Besides chemical modifications, proteins can also be modified by the conjugation of other polypeptides such as ubiquitin. It has been shown that both tau and α-synuclein are degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent (25David D.C. Layfield R. Serpell L. Narain Y. Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. J.

Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles are strongly immunoreactive for ubiquitin (31Mori H. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Science. 1987; 235: 1641-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 32Perry G. Friedman R. Shaw G. Chau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3033-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and tau is also a substrate for the CHIP-Hsc70 complex (27Shimura H.

Neurochem. 2005; 94: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Recently, ubiquitination of α-synuclein as well as the sites of the modification within both the soluble and the filamentous forms of the protein have been reported (33Nonaka T. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the sumoylation of these two native unfolded proteins, tau and α-synuclein, and showed that tau undergoes SUMO modification at a defined consensus motif. Additional evidence suggests that there is a dynamic interplay between tau sumoylation and proteasome inhibition. Functional studies involving phosphorylation and microtubule stability indicated that free soluble tau is targeted for covalent SUMO modification. These findings indicated a novel pathway for tau and α-synuclein regulation that may have unique consequences for the cellular regulation of these proteins and possibly their disease-related processes. Plasmids—The plasmids encoding N-terminally HA-tagged (peptide YPYDVPDYA) full-length SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3 were generously provided by Dr R. T. Hay (University of St. Andrews, UK). These correspond to the human protein sequences as described previously (34Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M.P. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

PCR was used to generate His epitope tag (peptide AHHHHHHV), using the corresponding HA-tagged plasmids as templates. All SUMO constructs were cloned into pcDNA3 vectors and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human wild-type tau 4R2N cDNA in bacterial expression vector pBluescript II was subcloned into pcDNA3, and α-synuclein was cloned into pcDNA6. Single mutants Tau (K340R, K385R), α-synuclein (K96R, K102R), and the conjugation-deficient double mutant SUMO1 (G96A,G97A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected in reduced serum medium at ∼50% confluence using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each transfection, cells were incubated in the presence of 5 μg of plasmid DNA encoding tau or α-synuclein, in the presence or absence of 5 μg of His-SUMO isoforms as indicated. Where necessary, pcDNA3 empty vector was used to bring the total amount of DNA to 10 μg. After 20 h of transfection, medium was replaced, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were treated for the final 16 h with 5 μm MG132 (Me2SO), 20 nm okadaic acid (ethanol), or 1 μm colchicine (H2O). Treated cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Purification of His-tagged SUMO Conjugates—Transfected and treated cells were lysed in buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 5 mm imidazole) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were briefly sonicated to reduce viscosity and cleared by centrifugation. The protein content was determined using the Bradford assay. Clarified lysates were mixed with 35 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose prewashed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed by centrifugation once with lysis buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm imidazole and twice with lysis buffer (pH 6.4) containing 10 mm imidazole. His-tagged SUMO conjugates were eluted (lysis buffer, pH 6.4, containing 300 mm imidazole), diluted in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on precast 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Anti-tau antibody CP27 was generously provided by Dr Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY). Anti-α-synuclein antibody (Syn1, clone 42) was purchased from Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blots presented were representative of 3–5 experiments, which displayed comparable results. Sumoylation of Tau and α-Synuclein—Tau and α-synuclein are two natively unfolded proteins frequently found in intracellular filamentous inclusions that define several neurodegenerative diseases. Both proteins are regulated through various post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (21Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.-C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We therefore evaluated whether the two brain proteins, tau and α-synuclein, were sumoylated. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing tau or α-synuclein along with the different His-tagged SUMO isoforms. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, and total His-tagged SUMO substrates were isolated by nickel affinity chromatography. In the presence of SUMO1 and, to a lesser extent, SUMO2 and SUMO3, higher molecular weight tau species were observed (Fig. 1A, arrow). Unmodified tau appeared as a single band at ∼64 kDa. The most intense tau immunoreactive band at ∼98 kDa is compatible with the conjugation of a single SUMO protein (∼20 kDa). An additional higher molecular weight SUMO1- and tau-positive band was also observed (Fig. 1A, arrowhead). This could correspond to conjugation of more than one SUMO molecule to different tau target lysines (multisumoylation) or the extension of a SUMO chain on a single lysine (polysumoylation). Sumoylation of tau was not detected in cells lacking SUMO expression. In addition, co-transfection of tau and the conjugation-deficient SUMO1 GG-AA mutant abolished the higher molecular weight bands, consistent with the loss of a covalent modification (Fig. 1A). For α-synuclein and, in contrast to tau, a single primary sumoylated species at ∼36 kDa was observed when it was co-expressed with the His-tagged SUMO isoforms. Human α-synuclein was modified primarily by SUMO1, and to a lesser extent, by SUMO2 and SUMO3 (Fig. 1B, arrow). The SUMO/α-synuclein derivatives were also specific to the presence of SUMO expression as they were absent from cells transfected with empty vector. No polysumoylation or multisumoylation of α-synuclein was detected, and no bands were observed with the conjugation-deficient SUMO1 GG-AA mutant, suggesting a specific modification. Total SUMO conjugates were visualized using SUMO1- and SUMO2/3-specific antibodies (Fig. 1, C and D). The overall sumoylation by these proteins was comparable, which demonstrates that the observed bands were not the result of differences in expression levels or activity of the transfected SUMO proteins. This indicates a specific SUMO1 conjugation to tau and α-synuclein. Probing total cell extracts for the conjugation-deficient SUMO1 GG-AA mutant revealed that it existed exclusively as a monomeric species, consistent with the loss of tau and α-synuclein modification (Fig. 1C, asterisk). Cumulatively, these results demonstrate that both natively unfolded proteins tau and α-synuclein can be preferentially sumoylated by SUMO1. Mapping SUMO Modification Sites of Tau and α-Synuclein—A majority of SUMO-accepting lysines are defined by the consensus motif ΨKX(E/D), where Ψ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue, K is the target lysine for covalent conjugation, X is any amino acid, and the final amino acid is a glutamate or aspartate (E/D) residue. Tau (VK340SE, AK385TD) and α-synuclein (VK96KD, GK102NE) have two putative SUMO consensus motifs (Figs. 2A and 3A). Mutagenesis was used to examine sumoylation at these sites, and individual lysine-to-arginine mutants were generated. The tau mutants (K340R and K385R) were expressed at similar levels as the wild-type protein (data not shown). The single mutation K385R had no effect on SUMO1 modification of tau (Fig. 2B). This tau mutant was sumoylated to the same extent as the wild-type substrate, suggesting that the consensus motif containing Lys385 is not a target for SUMO1 conjugation. In contrast, sumoylation of the tau K340R mutant was significantly reduced, and virtually no SUMO1 conjugates were observed (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that Lys340 represents one of the major SUMO1 acceptor sites for both mono- and poly/multisumoylation.FIGURE 3Identification of the SUMO modification sites in α-synuclein.

B, modification by SUMO1 of α-synuclein (α-syn) K102R as compared with wild type (WT).

WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether sumoylation of α-synuclein was also the result of a specific consensus motif, similar mutagenesis of the two potential target lysine residues (Lys96 and Lys102) was performed. Co-expression of the K102R mutant α-synuclein resulted in a slight decrease in the level of sumoylation as compared with wild type (Fig. 3B). This suggested that Lys102 may be one site of SUMO1 conjugation, but it is unlikely to be a primary target residue. Despite repeated attempts, the other putative SUMO site, Lys96, could not be directly investigated due to complications with antibody recognition. Lys96 lies within the sequence recognized by the Syn1 antibody, and the K96R substitution disrupted the epitope, which rendered the mutant protein undetectable (data not shown). To resolve this problem, other anti-α-synuclein antibodies such as the monoclonal Ab211 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and a polyclonal antibody raised against human α-synuclein (peptide epitope107APQEGILEDMPVDPDNEAY125) 3V. Dorval and P. E. Fraser, unpublished data. were examined. However, these were not suitable for our particular investigation since both antisera exhibited nonspecific bands in the molecular weight range expected for sumoylated α-synuclein (data not shown). However, the fact that the Syn1 antibody recognizes sumoylated α-synuclein strongly suggests that Lys96 is not a major SUMO target site (Fig. 1). It would be predicted that steric hindrance caused by SUMO1 conjugation at Lys96 would also result in epitope disruption and failure of antigen-antibody recognition caused by the K96R substitution as described above. In addition to Lys96 and Lys102, α-synuclein contains 13 other lysine residues that are localized mainly within the core repeats. It has also been shown that sumoylation is not exclusively restricted to consensus motifs (13Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 43Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol.

This is the case for α-synuclein ubiquitination, which is confined to lysine residues within the N-terminal half of the protein and does not involve either Lys96 or Lys102 (33Nonaka T. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that sumoylation of α-synuclein may be dispersed within the protein sequence, and further investigations are required to map the precise modification sites. However, our findings indicated that Lys102 may be one minor sumoylation target that contributes to this process. Dynamic Interplay between Sumoylation and Proteasome Inhibition—Lysine residues are common targets for several post-translational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. Therefore, it is possible that SUMO conjugation to a target lysine may prevent and/or regulate other modifications at the same site. This paradigm has been reported for the substrates NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) (45Huang T.T. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Wu Z.-H. Miyamoto S.

Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), in which conjugation of SUMO directly antagonizes the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by competing with ubiquitin for a single target lysine. It has been proposed that this provides a new mechanism to regulate protein stability. Tau and α-synuclein can be degraded by the proteasome through ubiquitin-dependent (27Shimura H. Schwartz D.

Given the specific conjugation of SUMO1 to both proteins, it is possible that there is similar competition between the two pathways that could be perturbed by proteasome inhibition. Cells co-expressing tau or α-synuclein and His-tagged SUMO1 were treated with MG132 prior to purification of SUMO1 conjugates. Proteasome inhibition significantly increased the levels of monomeric tau (2.7-fold ± 1.2; n = 3), consistent with a reduced catabolism of the free pool of protein (Fig. 4A).

In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term stress on the onset and severity of cognitive deficits and pathological changes in APPV717I-CT100 mice overexpressing human APP-CT100 containing the London mutation (V717I) after exposure to immobilization stress. We found that chronic immobilization stress accelerated cognitive impairments, as accessed by the Passive avoidance and the Social Transfer of Food Preference (STFP) tests. Moreover, the numbers and densities of vascular and extracellular deposits containing amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and carboxyl-terminal fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP-CTFs), which are pathologic markers of AD, were significantly elevated in stressed animals, especially in the hippocampus. Moreover, stressed animals, also showed highly elevated levels of neurodegeneration and tau phosphorylation and increased intraneuronal Abeta and APP-CTFs immunoreactivities in the hippocampus and in the entorhinal and piriform cortex. This study provides the first evidence that chronic stress accelerates the onset and severity of cognitive deficits and that these are highly correlated with pathological changes, which thus indicates that chronic stress may be an important contributor to the onset and development of AD."

Two genes responsible for the disease, TSC1 and TSC2, have been identified. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins, also called hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have been shown to regulate cell growth through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. TSC1 is known to stabilize TSC2 by forming a complex with TSC2, which is a GTPase-activating protein for the Rheb small GTPase. We have identified HERC1 as a TSC2-interacting protein.

We observed that the interaction of TSC1 with TSC2 appears to exclude TSC2 from interacting with HERC1. Disease mutations in TSC2, which result in its destabilization, allow binding to HERC1 in the presence of TSC1.

Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Mutations in either of the two genes, TSC1 (also called hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin), cause the disorder characterized by benign tumor formation (hamartomas) in various organs and tissues. Complications of hamartomas in critical organs include renal failure, seizures, mental retardation, and autism (1Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of TSC hamartomas is an increase in cell size, implicating TSC1 and TSC2 as negative regulators of cell growth (2Pan D. Dong J. Zhang Y. Gao X.

Recent studies have revealed the molecular mechanism for the tumor suppressor function of TSC1 and TSC2, which form a physical and functional complex (5van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The TSC1·TSC2 complex suppresses cell growth by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, which is a central controller of cell growth. TSC1/TSC2 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward the Rheb small GTPase (6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 573-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Rheb acts upstream of and stimulates mTOR. TSC2 is the catalytic GAP subunit, while TSC1 enhances TSC2 function by stabilizing TSC2. The majority of disease-associated TSC1 mutations identified result in no TSC1 protein being expressed; therefore, the free TSC2 protein in TSC1 mutant cells is unstable (1Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Similarly, many disease-derived TSC2 mutants are unstable due to weakened interaction with TSC1 (8Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 9Nellist M. Sancak O. Goedbloed M.A. Rohe C. van Netten D. Mayer K. Tucker-Williams A. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 13: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism how TSC1 stabilizes TSC2 is largely unclear. In this report, we identified HERC1 as a TSC2-interacting protein. The COOH-terminal region of HERC1 has a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase domain (10Rosa J.L. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HERC1 does not associate with TSC1. Moreover, TSC1 efficiently competes with HERC1 for TSC2 binding. Our study provides a potential biochemical mechanism of TSC1 in TSC2 stabilization by inhibiting the interaction between TSC2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC1. Plasmids and Antibodies—HA-TSC2 and Myc-TSC1 were described previously (8Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Myc-HERC1 deletions were made by PCR cloning fragments into pRK5-Myc. HERC1 antibodies 363 and 410 were described previously (11Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Commercial antibodies include anti-tuberin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-M2 FLAG (Sigma), anti-Myc 9E10, and anti-HA (Covance). TSC2 Pull-down and Mass Spectrometry—One gram of brain tissue was homogenized in 5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. TSC2 protein complexes were immunoprecipitated by anti-TSC2. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by silver stain and mass spectrometry analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—HEK293 cells were transfected with various plasmids. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40-lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. Western blotting was performed to detect co-immunoprecipitated proteins. For ubiquitination assay, cells were transfected with HA-TSC2 constructs and FLAG-Ubiquitin. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 for 3 h prior to lysis. TSC2 proteins were immunoprecipitated, and ubiquitination was detected by anti-M2 FLAG antibody. For protein stability experiments, cultured cells were treated with cycloheximide (40 ng/ml) and chased for various time points. TSC2 Interacts with HERC1, a HECT Domain Containing Ubiquitin E3 Ligase—We sought to identify novel TSC2-interacting proteins. TSC2 antibody was incubated with mouse brain lysates, and immunocomplexes were visualized by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 1A). The TSC2-interacting proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. One protein we identified was HERC1 (Fig. 1A); however, only peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal half of the protein were found in the mass spectra (see supplemental Fig. S1). The mass spectrometry data are consistent with the observation that the HERC1 fragment migrated at ∼200 kDa, whereas the full-length HERC1 is a very large protein of 532 kDa. HERC1 contains two regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC)-like domains (RLD), multiple WD40 repeats, and an E3 ligase HECT domain (Fig. 1B) (10Rosa J.L. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Like TSC2, HERC1 is widely expressed in many tissues. The biological function of HERC1, however, has not been well defined. To confirm the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1, we examined the association between transfected HA-TSC2 and endogenous HERC1 in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-HERC1 antibody revealed a specific interaction between HA-TSC2 and the endogenous HERC1 (Fig. 1C). In addition, we found that two HERC1-specific antibodies (denoted as 410 and 363) co-precipitated endogenous TSC2 (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that TSC2 and HERC1 interact with each other in vivo. TSC1 Inhibits the Interaction between TSC2 and HERC1—To further define the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1, truncation mutants were constructed for HA-TSC2. Cells were co-transfected with the HA-TSC2 truncations and myc-HERC1-(3351-C). Myc-HERC1-(3351-C) was immunoprecipitated, and the presence of the TSC2 truncations was assessed by Western blot analysis. HERC1 was able to interact with COOH-terminal truncations of TSC2, suggesting that the GAP domain of TSC2 is not required for interaction with HERC1 (Fig. 2A). When only the NH2-terminal third (1–608) of TSC2 was expressed, the TSC2 fragment was still able to bind to HERC1 though weaker than the other truncations (Fig. 2A). When the NH2 terminus was deleted, TSC2-(400–1765) could not bind HERC1. Therefore, these data indicate that the NH2-terminal domain of TSC2 is necessary and sufficient for HERC1 binding, although additional sequences outside of residues 1–608 in TSC2 may contribute to the HERC1 interaction. Deletion experiments were also performed to determine the region of HERC1 responsible for interaction with TSC2. The data in Fig. 2B indicate that the COOH-terminal region of HERC1 contains at least two TSC2-interacting domains because both HERC1-(3001–3900) and -(3901-C) were co-precipitated with HA-TSC2. However, HERC1-(3001–3901) showed a weak interaction with TSC2. Therefore, it is possible that HERC1 contains a single TSC2-interacting domain around residue 3900. It is interesting to note that the NH2-terminal region of TSC2 is also responsible for interaction with TSC1 (12Krymskaya V.P. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is well established that the ability to stabilize TSC2 may represent the most important function of TSC1 (5van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 13Benvenuto G. Li S. Brown S.J. Braverman R. Vass W.C. Cheadle J.P. Halley D.J. Sampson J.R. Wienecke R. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6306-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We, therefore, looked at the effect of TSC1 on the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1. The COOH-terminal domain of HERC1 (residues 3901-C) was co-expressed with TSC2 in the presence or absence of TSC1. TSC2 was able to complex with HERC1 in the absence of TSC1 co-transfection. However, when TSC1 was co-expressed, the TSC2-HERC1 interaction was completely inhibited (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 2 and 3 with 4 and 5). In contrast, the presence of HERC1 did not significantly affect the formation of the TSC1·TSC2 complex (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the HERC1-TSC2 interaction is weaker than the TSC1/TSC2 interaction. Nevertheless, the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1 is rather robust. It is worth noting that the expression levels of transfected TSC2 were only ∼2–3 times higher than the endogenous TSC2 protein (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). The above data demonstrate that TSC1 binding to TSC2 excludes HERC1 from TSC2, and HERC1 only binds to the free TSC2. Similar experiments were performed with HERC1-(3351-C). TSC1 also disrupted the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1-(3351-C) (see supplemental Fig. S2, lanes 2–6). Based on the above data, we propose that TSC1 stabilizes TSC2 by preventing the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1. Our model is consistent with the fact that both TSC1 and HERC1 bind to the NH2-terminal region of TSC2. TSC1 Fails to Disrupt the Interaction between HERC1 and the Unstable TSC2 Mutants Found in TSC Patients—We wanted to test whether HERC1 contributes to TSC2 destabilization. Down-regulation of HERC1 by RNA interference had little effect on TSC2 stability (data not shown). This is likely due to the presence of six HERC1 family members (29Garcia-Gonzalo F.R. Rosam J.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1826-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HA-TSC2 was expressed in HEK293 cells alone or in the presence of HERC1-(3901-C). To determine TSC2 stability, cycloheximide was used to block protein synthesis. We observed that HERC1 co-transfection significantly decreased the stability of TSC2 (Fig. 3A). These observations support our model that HERC1 may contribute to TSC2 destabilization. The majority of TSC1 mutations that have been found in TSC patients result in no TSC1 protein production due to deletions or NH2-terminal nonsense/frame-shift mutations (1Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In contrast, many disease-associated missense mutations of TSC2 show a weaker binding to TSC1 and are unstable (8Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 9Nellist M. Sancak O. Goedbloed M.A. Rohe C. van Netten D. Mayer K.

DeClue J.E. Sampson J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2899-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We co-transfected two TSC2 disease mutants with TSC1 and FLAG-ubiquitin and assessed the level of FLAG-ubiquitin on immunoprecipitated TSC2 proteins. The TSC2 R611Q and R905Q mutants were ubiquitinated at levels much higher than the wild type TSC2 (Fig. 3B). These disease mutants were previously shown to have weakened TSC1-binding (8Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). We then assessed whether the TSC2 disease mutants also bind HERC1 in the presence of TSC1. The disease mutants TSC2-R611Q and TSC2-R905Q both interacted with HERC1 as strong as the wild type TSC2 (Fig. 3C). The low intensity of mutant TSC2 in the HERC1 co-immunoprecipitation was due to lower expression levels of mutant TSC2 protein. Interestingly, TSC1 was not effective in inhibiting the interaction between TSC2-R611Q and HERC1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 5–7). Moreover, TSC1 had little effect on the interaction between TSC2-R905Q and HERC1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 8–10). These results are drastically different from the wild type TSC2, that TSC1 potently blocked the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4). The above data reveal a possible biochemical basis of why the disease associated TSC2 mutants are unstable. Our model predicts that TSC1 stabilizes TSC2 even in the presence of HERC1. We tested the effect of HERC1 expression on TSC2 stability when TSC1 was co-expressed. We found that HERC1 could not destabilize TSC2 if TSC1 was co-expressed (Fig. 3D, lanes 1–5). These results are consistent with the observation that TSC1 blocks the association between TSC2 and HERC1. We also examined the TSC2-R611Q mutant. As predicted, TSC2-R611Q was less stable than the wild type TSC2 even in the presence of TSC1 (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, expression of HERC1 further destabilized TSC2-R611Q even when TSC1 was co-expressed (Fig. 3D, lanes 6–10). It is worth noting that HERC1-(3901-C) is unstable, similar to many E3 ligases that have a short half-life. The differences of TSC2-R611Q stability in the presence or absence of HERC1 co-transfection were most dramatic at 1.5 and 3 h after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 3D, lanes 6–8). Within this time range the co-transfected HERC1 protein was still present. These results indicate that HERC1 destabilizes TSC2 only when TSC1 is absent or TSC2 is not associated with TSC1. The role of TSC2 in regulating the mTOR pathway has been intensely studied in recent years (8Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 15Kwiatkowski D.J. Zhang H. Bandura J.L. Heiberger K.M. Glogauer M. el-Hashemite N. Onda H. Hum. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Clearly, the TSC proteins are key players in mTOR regulation and are involved in some of the most basic functions of cellular regulation, such as relaying signals from growth factors, nutrients, and energy levels to the cellular machinery that regulates cell growth and protein translation (2Pan D. Dong J. Zhang Y. Gao X. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Hay N. Sonenberg N.

Genetic mutations in mouse and rat further confirm the tumor suppressor function of TSC1 and TSC2 (15Kwiatkowski D.J. Zhang H. Bandura J.L. Heiberger K.M. Glogauer M. el-Hashemite N. Onda H. Hum.

In Drosophila, mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 leads to a increase in cell size, demonstrating a key function of these proteins in cell growth and cell size regulation (2Pan D. Dong J. Zhang Y. Gao X. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Thomas G. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The interaction between TSC1 and TSC2 results in protein stabilization and formation of a functional complex, in which TSC2 is the catalytic component to stimulate Rheb GTP hydrolysis (6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem.

In contrast, the apparent function of TSC1 is to bind and stabilize TSC2. This model explains why mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 produce almost identical phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse and why TSC1 or TSC2 mutations generate similar symptoms in TSC patients. In TSC1–/– cells, the TSC2 protein level is significantly lower than in wild type cells (24Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Several disease mutations in TSC2 weaken the interaction with TSC1 and decrease TSC2 stability, emphasizing the importance of a functional complex (8Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 9Nellist M. Sancak O. Goedbloed M.A. Rohe C. van Netten D. Mayer K. Tucker-Williams A. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. Eur.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2899-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how TSC1 binding stabilizes TSC2 remained elusive. Our study suggests a possible mechanism that TSC1 stabilizes TSC2 by inhibiting the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1; hence inhibiting TSC2 ubiquitination and degradation (see supplemental Fig. S3). Our data also provide a molecular basis for the instability of disease associated TSC2 mutations that can interact with HERC1 even in the presence of TSC1. Under normal conditions, HERC1 may have a limited effect on TSC2 stability regulation because TSC1 complexes with TSC2 and prevents the interaction between TSC2 and HERC1. Interestingly, phosphorylation of TSC2 by AKT in response to growth factor stimulation weakens its interaction with TSC1 and the phosphorylated TSC2 is unstable (8Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 25Potter C.J. Pedraza L.G. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that HERC1 may interact with and ubiquitinate the AKT-phosphorylated TSC2. Furthermore, HERC1 may also play an important role under some pathophysiological conditions, such as in PTEN mutant tumor cells that have high AKT activity. It is worth noting that HERC1 has been implicated in intracellular trafficking (10Rosa J.L. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Currently, we have no data to exclude the possibility that HERC1 may regulate TSC2 trafficking through ubiquitination and, therefore, indirectly decrease TSC2 stability. PAM, a ring finger-containing E3 ligase, was previously reported to physically and genetically interact with TSC2 (26Murthy V. Han S. Beauchamp R.L. Smith N. Haddad L.A. Ito N. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1351-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutation or deletion of PAM results in changes in cell size. However, a function of PAM toward TSC2 ubiquitination has not been shown. This may be due to the lack of an identified adaptor protein, which the E3 ligase Ring domain (27Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) in PAM may require for TSC2-specific ubiquitination. Both HERC1 and PAM are large proteins over 400 kDa that have an E3 ligase at the COOH terminus. Interestingly, HERC1 and PAM also contain RCC-like domains (RLD) (11Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Murthy V. Han S. Beauchamp R.L. Smith N. Haddad L.A. Ito N. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1351-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RLD domains have been shown to stimulate nucleotide release of small GTPases such as Arf and Rab family proteins as well as Ran (11Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaro S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The formation of these large protein complexes may also suggest a scaffolding role of HERC1 and PAM. It has been reported that the human papilomavirus 16 E6 protein interacts with TSC2 and destabilizes TSC2 (30Lu Z. Hu X. Li Y. Zheng L. Zhou Y. Jiang H. Ning T. Basang Z. Zhang C. Ke Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35664-35670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TSC2 is a Rheb-specific GAP (6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem.

However, the identity of the Rheb GEF is not known; it is tempting to speculate that HERC1 may modulate Rheb activity by acting as a GEF through its RLD domains. Future studies are required to test whether HERC1 could function as a Rheb GEF and to elucidate the role of HERC1 in regulation of cell growth and tumor development. In summary, we have identified HERC1 as a novel TSC2 interacting protein. Our studies suggest a physiological function of HERC1 to regulate mTOR signaling by targeting TSC2 for degradation. This study also reveals a possible molecular mechanism of TSC1 in TSC2 stabilization, by which TSC1 complexes with TSC2 and prevents the association between TSC2 and the HERC1 ubiquitin ligase. Future studies are required to verify this model and to demonstrate the physiological functions of HERC1 in regulation of the TSC-mTOR pathway. Download .pdf (1.48 MB) Help with pdf files"

Interestingly, the VDR is expressed very early in adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that the VDR signaling pathway may play a role in adipocyte biology and function. Indeed, it has been known for a number of years that calcitriol is a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis in this model but with no clear mechanism identified. In this study, we have further defined the molecular mechanism by which the unliganded VDR and calcitriol-liganded VDR regulate adipogenesis. In the presence of calcitriol, the VDR blocks adipogenesis by down-regulating both C/EBPβ mRNA expression and C/EBPβ nuclear protein levels at a critical stage of differentiation. In addition, calcitriol allows for the up-regulation of the recently described C/EBPβ corerepressor, ETO, which would further inhibit the action of any remaining C/EBPβ, whose action is required for adipogenesis. In contrast, in the absence of calcitriol, the unliganded VDR appears necessary for lipid accumulation, since knock-down of the VDR using siRNA both delays and prevents this process. Taken together, these data support the notion that the intracellular concentrations of calcitriol can play an important role in either promoting or inhibiting adipogenesis via the VDR and the transcriptional pathways that it targets. Further examination of this hypothesis in vivo may shed new light on the biology of adipogenesis.

Further examination of this hypothesis in vivo may shed new light on the biology of adipogenesis. The regulation of adipogenesis is a key biologic process that is required for both lipid storage and the development of the endocrine adipocyte. Both of these are key processes that determine the morbidity of obesity. Indeed, obesity is the leading risk for the development of Type 2 diabetes as well as an important contributing risk to heart disease and stroke. Thus, further understanding of the biology of adipogenesis might allow for the development of novel targets for new drugs to modify the function of the adipocyte in vivo. The murine 3T3-L1 cell line has provided an ideal model system to understand adipocyte development. This line differentiates from fibroblast preadipocyte precursors to mature adipocytes when presented with a hormonal mixture that activates a number of key signaling pathways. These pathways induce a regulatory cascade beginning with the induction of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β and δ isoforms (C/EBPβ and -δ), 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; VDR, vitamin D receptor; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; DIM, differentiation mixture; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; VDR, vitamin D receptor; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; DIM, differentiation mixture; siRNA, small interfering RNA. which in turn induce C/EBPα and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ, present as two isoforms, γ1 and γ2) (1Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Once expressed, C/EBPα and PPARγ enhance each other's production and are necessary for terminal differentiation (2Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). In addition, the production of a PPARγ ligand is also necessary to allow PPARγ to activate target genes to allow for differentiation (3Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar). Whereas PPARγ binds the thiazolidinediones, the prostenoid 15-deoxy-Δ12-14-prostaglandin J2, some polyunsaturated fatty acids, and phospholipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid, its natural ligand(s) has remained elusive (4Lehmann J.M.

Using a stably integrated ligand-sensing system, we recently demonstrated that endogenous PPARγ ligand activity is induced as early as 24 h after the induction of differentiation via a cAMP-requiring pathway (9Tzameli I. Fang H. Ollero M. Shi H. Hamm J.K. Kievit P. Hollenberg A.N. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36093-36102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In order to identify pathways that may lead to PPARγ ligand production, we used microarrays to identify genes expressed early in adipogenesis that required cAMP production (data not shown). Using this screen, we identified the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a potential target in this pathway. The VDR, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a key role in mineral homeostasis when bound to its ligand, calcitriol (11Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C.

Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). In addition, the unliganded VDR plays a critical role in hair follicle development, indicating that like other nuclear receptors, such as the thyroid and retinoic acid receptor isoforms, the VDR has unique functions in the presence and absence of its ligand (13Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 14Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Previous work by a number of groups has established that calcitriol is an inhibitor of adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 model (16Kamei Y. Kawada T. Kazuki R. Ono T. Kato S. Sugimoto E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Kawada T. Kamei Y. Sugimoto E. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab.

More recently, work in mice has demonstrated that calcitriol inhibits bone marrow adipogenesis in vivo (19Kelly K.A. Gimble J.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2622-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no specific mechanism for the actions of calcitriol in adipocytes has been described. A recent report has suggested that calcitriol-mediated induction of the ER protein Insig-2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes might lead to the inhibition of adipogenesis by preventing the transcription factor SREBP-1C from reaching the nucleus (20Lee S. Lee D.K. Choi E. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whereas calcitriol inhibits adipogenesis, intriguingly it is the unliganded VDR that is available early in differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. This suggests that the unliganded VDR may play a unique role in the molecular pathways governing adipogenesis, depending upon the availability of intracellular calcitriol. Indeed, the intracellular metabolism of nuclear receptor ligands is a critical determinant of receptor action. A recent striking example is that adipose tissue function can be altered directly by changes in intracellular cortisol levels through the overexpression of 11β-HSD1, which reactivates cortisol in this tissue (21Masuzaki H. Paterson J. Shinyama H. Morton N.M. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. Science. 2001; 294: 2166-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). In a parallel fashion, the intracellular availability of 1 α-hydroxylase, which synthesizes calcitriol from its precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, may be a critical determinant in the action of vitamin D signaling in adipose tissue in vivo (22Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 777-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To further characterize the key role of the VDR-signaling pathway in adipogenesis, we have, in this study, identified the molecular mechanism by which the liganded VDR inhibits adipogenesis and also defined a novel role for the unliganded VDR in promoting lipid accumulation. Further work on defining the molecular targets of the VDR in adipose tissue will yield greater insight into its potential in vivo role. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin during passage. Two days postconfluence (day 0), at initiation of differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were then cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The differentiation mixture introduced at day 0 consists of 1 μm dexamethasone, 1.67 μm insulin, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (DIM), and, depending on the experiment, 10 nm calcitriol. Two days postinduction, medium was changed and supplemented with 0.42 μm insulin (and calcitriol if needed), and at day 4 medium was changed again, unsupplemented except in calcitriol experiments. In experiments where calcitriol was added for short periods of time, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with the medium present in the control 3T3-L1 cells. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with the stably integrated ligand-sensing system (5B2 cells (9Tzameli I.

Twenty-four hours after induction of differentiation with DIM and the indicated ligands, the cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The extent of differentiation was determined by the amount of lipid accumulation at 5 and 7 days by oil red O staining. Briefly, cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, washed with distilled water, and completely dried. Cell were stained with a 0.5% oil red O solution in 60:40 (v/v) isopropyl alcohol/H2O for 30 min at room temperature, washed four times with water, and dried. Differentiation was examined by visual inspection and quantified by elution with isopropyl alcohol and an optical density (OD) measurement at 590 nm. Cell proliferation was determined by incorporation of crystal violet. Briefly, at the indicated time points, cells were aspirated of medium and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed with water, and completely dried. Cells were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 30% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature, washed with water, and air-dried. Crystal violet was then eluted with 10% acetic acid (v/v) and diluted 1:40, and an OD measurement was taken at 590 nm. Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear protein extracts of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were prepared as described (23Hodgson M.C. Astapova I. Cheng S. Lee L.J. Verhoeven M.C. Choi E. Balk S.P. Hollenberg A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA). Equal amounts (20-50 μg) of nuclear protein extracts were loaded onto 10% NuPage gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred with an Invitrogen blot module to nitrocellulose membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mouse anti-PPARγ, rabbit anti-C/EBPβ, rabbit anti-C/EBPα, and goat anti-ETO were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-7273, sc-150, sc-61, and sc-9737, respectively). Rabbit anti-histone deacetylase 1 was purchased from Cell Signaling (catalog no. 2062), and rat anti-VDR was purchased from Affinity BioReagents (MA1-710). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse, rabbit, and rat were from Amersham Biosciences, and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-goat was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Membranes were stripped with 70 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol for multiple probes of the same membrane. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using RNA STAT-60 (TelTest) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and concentration was determined by OD at 260 nm. To demonstrate quality, integrity, and accuracy of OD concentration, 1.5 μg of each sample was run on a 1.5% agarose/ethidium bromide gel and visualized with UV. Taqman assay on demand primer/probe combinations (Applied Biosystems) were used for analysis of VDR, C/EBPβ, and Insig-2 expression (Mm00437297_m1, Mm00843434_s1, and Mm00460121_m1, respectively). Assay on demand-derived quantitative PCRs (25 μl) consisted of 5 ng of RNA (samples diluted to 1 ng/μl), 12.5 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.25 μl of primer/probe, 0.125 μl of MulV reverse transcriptase, and 7.125 μl of RNase-free water. To normalize sample values, 18 S was used as an internal control. The reaction setup for 18 S was the same as above, except that 0.375 μl of forward and reverse primers, 0.125 μl of probe, and 6.5 μl of water was used. Sequence for 18 S primer and probe were as follows: forward primer, AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA; reverse primer, GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAAC; probe, CGCCCGTCGCTACTACCGATTGG. All samples were run in duplicate. Quantitative PCR reactions were run on a MX3000p (Stratagene) with the following conditions: 30 min at 48 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 95 °C at 15 s and 1 min at 60 °C. Template quantity was determined from gene-specific standard curves (50 ng to 0.1 mg of total RNA). Relative mRNA concentrations were determined by dividing the initial template quantity of the target gene by the 18 S initial template quantity. Results shown are pooled from two separate experiments. The data are displayed as mean ± S.E. Significance was determined by Student's t test. RNA Interference—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes 1 day postconfluence (day-1) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Generally, 100 nm (unless otherwise indicated) siRNA was transfected with 4 μl of Lipofectamine/well of a 6-well plate with fresh medium. Each experiment contained equivalent samples transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA pool (Dharmacon) and samples not treated with Lipofectamine. siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes for each gene of interest were purchased from Dharmacon as either a four-duplex pool (Insig-2) or an optimized single duplex (VDR; sense, GAAUGUGCCUCGGAUCUGUUU; antisense, ACAGAUCCGAGGCACAUUCUU). Transfection efficiency was monitored using fluorescence-tagged oligonucleotides (Blockit; Invitrogen) transfected as described above and visualized with a mercury lamp fluorescent microscope. The VDR Is Induced Early in Adipogenesis via a cAMP Pathway—To confirm our microarray data suggesting that the VDR is expressed as early as 6 h after the induction of differentiation with DIM, we analyzed VDR expression via Q-PCR in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, VDR mRNA levels reached their maximum 6 h after the addition of DIM and then declined rapidly. Consistent with its mRNA expression were VDR protein levels in 3T3-L1 nuclear extracts. VDR nuclear protein began to accumulate at 4 h and was maximally present at 12 h. Thereafter, it quickly declined and disappeared 2 days into differentiation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, nuclear protein levels of histone deacetylase 1 were relatively constant during differentiation. We next looked at nuclear VDR protein in response to each component of the differentiation mixture. Whereas dexamethasone and insulin had no effect in inducing the VDR, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine strongly induced the VDR 6 h after its addition (Fig. 1C). This finding is consistent with the cAMP pathway being responsible for the early induction of the VDR in 3T3-L1 cells and with similar effects of this pathway in other cell types on VDR expression (24Jehan F. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Krishnan A.V. Feldman D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 198-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether VDR signaling influences formation of PPARγ ligand activity in 3T3-L1 cells, we analyzed ligand activity in 3T3-L1 5B2 cells that were stably transfected with a PPARγ ligand-sensing system, which activates a β-galactosidase reporter in the presence of a PPARγ ligand (10Baker A.R. McDonnell D.P. Hughes M. Crisp T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Haussler M.R. Pike J.W. Shine J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3294-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 24 h after the addition of DIM, β-galactosidase levels increased by close to 8-fold, consistent with the production of an endogenous PPARγ ligand. Indeed, 500 mm rosiglitazone induced a 4-fold induction of the same reporter. In the presence of DIM and calcitriol, reporter activation was inhibited by ∼40%, consistent with the notion that the VDR-signaling system lies upstream of PPARγ ligand formation. To control for possible squelching, we added calcitriol to the rosiglitazone-treated cells and saw no effect, indicating that liganded VDR was not blocking the liganded Gal4-PPARγ directly or via competition for limiting cofactors. The Liganded VDR Blocks Adipogenesis by Lowering C/EBPβ Levels—To confirm the ability of calcitriol to inhibit adipogenesis, we examined a range of concentrations of calcitriol. Concentrations of calcitriol from 100 nm down to 1 nm were sufficient to inhibit adipogenesis, as shown by the lack of oil red O staining (Fig. 3A). This finding demonstrates that the serum used during DIM-induced adipogenesis contains very little calcitriol, supporting the notion that the VDR expressed early in adipogenesis is unliganded. We next examined the levels of VDR in the presence of calcitriol. As expected, calcitriol acted to stabilize the VDR in nuclear extracts and prevent its degradation, as has been demonstrated previously (26Arbour N.C. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wiese R.J. Uhland-Smith A. Ross T.K. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20082-20086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this effect, the VDR was present throughout most of the adipogenic period. However, a transcriptional component appears to also play a role, since VDR transcription was reinitiated at day 4 and maintained at day 5 (Fig. 3B). Thus, the presence of calcitriol through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms induced the production and stability of the VDR, explaining in part its ability to potently block adipogenesis. To ensure that calcitriol was not blocking mitotic clonal expansion, which occurs in the first few days after DIM addition and appears to be necessary for adipogeneis (28Zhang J.W. Tang Q.Q. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we measured DNA content using crystal violet staining. As shown in Fig. 3C, calcitriol has a small effect on expansion, but the treated cells still go through a near doubling process in the first 48 h, indicating that the liganded VDR is not fully blocking this process. In order to determine the mechanism by which the liganded VDR inhibits adipogenesis, we examined the expression of key members of the transcriptional cascade that induce the adipogenic program. Not surprisingly, both C/EBPα and PPARγ levels were very low in calcitriol-treated nuclear extracts (Fig. 4A). In contrast, C/EBPα accumulation in the nuclear extracts from untreated cells was dramatically enhanced on day 2 after the addition of DIM and stays at high levels throughout the adipogenic program. Similarly, PPARγ expression became noticeable at day 1 and progressively increased during the remainder of differentiation. Thus, calcitriol appears to have its effects upstream of the induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ. We next assessed the protein levels of C/EBPβ in nuclear extracts from calcitriol-treated and control cells. As is shown in Fig. 4B, C/EBPβ protein levels began to increase 6 h after the induction of the adipogenic program, although some basal expression was present at time 0. C/EBPβ protein levels peaked during day 2 and then fell off, presumably after inducing adequate amounts of C/EBPα and PPARγ to maintain effective adipogenesis. In contrast, in calcitriol-treated nuclear extracts, C/EBPβ protein levels rose in a similar fashion to control extracts but were decreased on day 2, suggesting that the liganded VDR functions to block C/EBPβ accumulation and thus prevents full activation of C/EBPα and PPARγ levels. Whereas the data presented highlight the 34-kDa LAP isoform of C/EBPβ, we could also visualize the smaller LIP isoform, which was expressed at lower levels and did not change in proportion with calcitriol treatment. In the same experiments, we also examined C/EBPδ levels. In the DIM-treated extracts, there was little C/EBPδ at time 0, but this progressively increased to a peak at 4 h and then rapidly fell. This early pattern of induction was not changed in the calcitriol-treated nuclear extracts, consistent with calcitriol affecting only C/EBPβ levels. To determine if calcitriol signaling regulates C/EBPβ at the level of transcription, we next looked at C/EBPβ mRNA levels. In control cells, C/EBPβ mRNA was induced strongly 6 h after the addition of DIM in the absence of calcitriol and was maintained until day 2, after which it began to fall toward its basal level (Fig. 4B). In the presence of calcitriol, C/EBPβ mRNA was also induced. However, it was also down-regulated much more quickly beginning at day 1 and progressing through day 2 such that it had returned to basal levels. These data are consistent with the protein levels seen in nuclear extracts. Thus, calcitriol either directly or indirectly negatively regulates C/EBPβ gene expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. We also considered whether calcitriol-VDR signaling may also regulate pathways that may modify C/EBPβ action. Recently, Rochford et al. (29Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the transcriptional corepressor ETO/MTG8 is expressed in preadipocytes and is down-regulated via insulin signaling in early adipogenesis. When overexpressed, ETO/MTG8 is a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis through its ability to directly interact with C/EBPβ and inhibit its action on the C/EBPα promoter. To analyze the role of calcitriol in ETO/MTG8 expression, we looked at ETO/MTG8 levels in nuclear extracts from differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. As described, ETO levels decreased dramatically in the first 12 h after the addition of the differentiating mixture in control cells. In contrast, in the presence of calcitriol (Fig. 5), ETO expression was maintained throughout adipogenesis and increased after day 1. We next considered whether the actions of calcitriol are reversible such that its removal would allow differentiation to resume. As is seen in Fig. 6, the addition of calcitriol to DIM-treated 3T3-L1 cells for as brief a period as 6 h was effective in blocking differentiation. Longer treatments from 12 h up to 3 days are clearly more effective. To control for the addition and removal of calcitriol, we added the ligand for 1 h and saw no effect on adipogenesis (data not shown). Not surprisingly, the effects of short term pulses of calcitriol are mediated by the inhibition of the induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ that would normally occur in DIM-treated cells by day 3 (Fig. 6B). Finally, to determine if the dramatic induction of the Insig-2A isoform by calcitriol could also be playing a role in the ability of the liganded VDR to block adipogenesis, we asked whether Insig-2 lies downstream of calcitriol (20Lee S. Lee D.K. Choi E. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since both Insig-2A and -2B encode the same protein, we first asked whether total Insig-2 mRNA is regulated by calcitriol (30Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). To do this, we used Q-PCR with the assay directed at a coding exon that both isoforms share. Using this assay, we saw only a moderate 2-fold induction in Insig-2 mRNA 24-36 h after the addition of DIM and calcitriol (not shown), suggesting that Insig-2A makes up only a small portion of total Insig-2, with Insig-2B making up the majority. We next used siRNA against Insig-2 to determine whether its induction plays a role in calcitriol action in inhibiting differentiation. To accomplish this, we used an siRNA pool that dramatically reduced Insig-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 7A). As is shown in Fig. 7B, knock-down of Insig-2 is proadipogenic, leading to a substantial induction of oil red O staining 5 days after the addition DIM. However, siRNA directed against Insig-2 has no effect on the ability of calcitriol to inhibit adipogenesis. Thus, the actions of calcitriol do not appear to require induction of Insig-2. The Role of the Unliganded VDR in Adipogenesis—Our data demonstrate that the early expression of the VDR in the adipogenic program occurs in the absence of appreciable amounts of calcitriol present in the medium and serum; thus, the VDR probably acts early in adipogenesis as an unliganded receptor. To determine whether the unliganded VDR plays a role in adipogenesis, we used siRNA to down-regulate its expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Confluent 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with varying amounts of siRNA duplexes 24 h prior to the induction of adipogenesis with DIM. As shown in Fig. 8A, successful knock-down of the VDR can be accomplished using this technique, and levels of the VDR remain low when compared with control cells 24 h after the induction of adipogenesis. We next examined the role of the unliganded VDR in adipogenesis. We allowed groups of the transfected cells with varying amounts of the VDR siRNA to differentiate and performed oil red O staining at day 8. We found that 100 nm siRNA was most effective at decreasing both VDR levels and oil red O staining at day 8 (13% when quantified by optical density after elution in isopropyl alcohol). To further examine the role of the unliganded VDR in adipogenesis, we also wanted to look at the rate of adipogenesis by examining lipid accumulation earlier than day 8. To do this, we again transfected 3T3-L1 cells with either VDR siRNA or scrambled duplexes (and also a mock transfection control) and looked at VDR protein levels at day 1 after the addition of DIM and oil red O staining at day 5. As demonstrated in Fig. 9A, VDR protein levels were significantly reduced at day 1 in cells transfected with VDR siRNA as compared with control cells, and oil red O staining was also decreased by 35% in these cells as compared with control cells. To confirm these data, we repeated the dose-response experiment and stained a"

Here, novel HSP90 inhibitors were used to examine the impact of chaperone elevation on clearance of different tau species in transfected cells using a unique quantitative assay. The HSP90 inhibitors reduced levels of tau phosphorylated at proline-directed Ser/Thr sites (pS202/T205, pS396/S404) and conformationally altered (MC-1) tau species, an epitope that is immeasurable by standard Western blot techniques. The selective clearance of these phospho-tau species and MC-1 tau was mediated via the proteasome, while lysosomal-mediated tau degradation seems to lack specificity for certain tau species, suggesting a more general role in total tau removal. Interestingly, tau phosphorylated at S262/S356 within the tau microtubule binding domain was minimally affected by chaperone induction. Overall, our data show that chaperone induction results in the selective clearance of specific phospho-tau and conformationally altered tau species mediated by the proteasome; however, the apparent stability of pS262/S356 tau may also explain why MARK is able to regulate normal tau function yet still be linked to the initiation of pathogenic tau hyperphosphorylation in AD."

Testosterone, 17β-estradiol, aflatoxin B1, and amitriptyline were shown to display homotropic cooperativity (29Ueng Y.-F. Kuwabara T. Chun Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) (i.e. increasing substrate concentration stimulates oxidation, resulting in sigmoidal velocity versus substrate concentration curves) (30Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 300Google Scholar). Various flavonoids have been shown to act as effectors to stimulate the oxidation of some substrates, resulting in heterotropic cooperativity (30Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 300Google Scholar), and to inhibit the oxidation of others (31Hutzler J.M. Tracy T.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of P450 3A4 with ligands is quite complex and can have a significant effect on the observed in vitro oxidation kinetics. Examples of in vivo cooperativity in animal models have been developed (32Tang W. Stearns R.A. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cooperative behavior is important in prediction of drug-drug interactions in practical settings (33Egnell A.C. Houston J.B. Boyer C.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 2005; 312: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several groups have proposed models to explain the observed cooperativity (34Houston J.B. Galetin A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A rather general consensus is that multiple ligands may interact with P450 3A4 simultaneously, although (i) direct physical evidence is very limited (35Dabrowski M.J. Schrag M.L. Wienkers L.C. Atkins W.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11866-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and (ii) the number of substrate/effector molecules bound and binding sites has not been established. One model, based on steady-state kinetics, has simultaneous occupancy of the P450 3A4 active site with two substrates, which may or may not be identical molecules and which are bound to different domains of the active site (36Shou M. Grogan J. Mancewicz J.A. Krausz K.W. Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin H.V. Korzekwa K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 37Shou M. Dai R. Cui D. Korzekwa K.R.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a three-site model with a distinct effector binding site has been proposed using a similar steady-state kinetic modeling approach (39Kenworthy K.E. Clarke S.E. Andrews J. Houston J.B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1644-1651PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have led to the proposal of a two-substrate/one-effector domain model in which the effector is located in close proximity of the active site (40Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5396-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41He Y.A. Roussel F. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, all of these models are based on steady-state turnover kinetic data and do not provide detailed information on the contributions of the individual steps of the catalytic cycle to the observed cooperativity. We have previously focused on the substrate binding step of the P450 catalytic cycle in an attempt to understand better the mechanisms involved in cooperativity (42Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recent work from two other groups has also been directed toward substrate binding to P450 3A4 using spectral and EPR approaches (43Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 44Roberts A.G. Campbell A.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this work, we have expanded our investigations of ligand binding to P450 3A4 (29Ueng Y.-F. Kuwabara T. Chun Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 42Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) using transient state kinetics and equilibrium methods, including quantitative dialysis and ITC. Ligand fluorescence was used as a direct approach to monitor ligand-P450 3A4 interactions, in addition to UV-visible observations of heme perturbations. Our studies on the interactions of various molecules with P450 3A4 lead us to propose a three-step binding model in which the first step does not perturb the heme spectrum. We have also examined the relevance of the individual steps of ligand binding to reduction of ferric to ferrous P450 subsequent event in the catalytic cycle of P450 3A4. These studies demonstrate that binding of ligands to P450 3A4 is a complex multistep process and that investigation of ligand binding interactions solely with heme spin state changes can be misleading. Chemicals—α-Naphthoflavone, midazolam, flavone, and bromocriptine were purchased from Sigma. Testosterone was obtained from Steraloids (Newport, RI). All other reagents and solvents were obtained from general commercial suppliers. All chemicals were used without further purification. Spectroscopy—Absorbance spectra were recorded using either an Aminco DW2a/OLIS or a Cary 14/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). Fluorescence measurements were made using a DM45/OLIS spectrofluorimeter. Stopped-flow experiments were carried out using an OLIS RSM-1000 instrument. A 4 × 20-mm cell was used for absorbance measurements, and a 4 × 4-mm cell was used for fluorescence measurements. Enzymes—Recombinant P450 3A4 with a C-terminal His5 tag (45Gillam E.M.J. Baba T. Kim B.-R. Ohmori S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (42Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). E. coli recombinant rat NADPH-P450 reductase (46Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and human liver cytochrome b5 (47Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 440: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were prepared as described elsewhere. Protocatechuate dioxygenase was a gift from D. P. Ballou (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Reconstitution System—For the reduction kinetics experiments and for some of the testosterone binding experiments, P450 3A4 was reconstituted freshly before the experiment by mixing the components in the following order: P450 3A4 (0.5 or 2 μm), NADPH-P450 reductase (1 or 4 μm), cytochrome b5 (0.5 or 2 μm), sodium cholate (0.5 mm), and phospholipid mixture (40 μg/ml, prepared as described previously (48Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)). The components were kept at room temperature for 20 min and mixed periodically by gentle shaking. After 20 min, potassium HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4), glutathione (3 mm), and MgCl2 (30 mm) were added, and the reconstituted system was kept on ice until use. Spectral Binding Titrations—Binding affinities of ligands to P450 3A4 were determined (at 23 °C) by titrating 1 μm enzyme with the ligand, in a total volume of 1.0 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Final CH3OH concentrations were ≤2% (v/v). The reference cuvette, containing an equal concentration of enzyme in buffer, was titrated with an equal volume of the vehicle solvent. UV-visible spectra (350–500 nm) were recorded after each addition, and the absorbance differences (at the wavelength maximum and minimum) were plotted against the added ligand concentrations. Spectral dissociation constants (Ks) were estimated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) or DynaFit (49Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) simulation software (Biokin, Pullman, WA). Unless the estimated Ks was within 5-fold of the P450 concentration, a nonlinear regression analysis was applied using the hyperbolic equation ΔA = Bmax[L]/(Ks + [L]), where A is the absorbance difference, Bmax is the maximum absorbance difference extrapolated to infinite ligand concentration, and [L] is the ligand concentration. For the high affinity ligand bromocriptine, a quadratic equation was used to correct for the bound enzyme concentration: ΔA = A0 + (Bmax/2[E])((Ks + [E] + [L]) – ((Ks + [E] + [L])2 – 4[E][L])1/2), with E being the total enzyme concentration and A0 being a coefficient in each analysis and not relevant. Alternatively, DynaFit simulation software was used with a one-step enzyme-ligand binding model, yielding identical results obtained from the hyperbolic or quadratic nonlinear regression analyses. With flavone, the best fit was obtained with the Hill equation ΔA=Bmax[L]n/(Ksn+[L]n), where n is a measure of cooperativity. Binding Kinetics of Ligands to P450 3A4—In the stopped-flow experiments, either the changes in heme spectra were monitored as a function of time (in the absorbance mode), or the fluorescence quenching of ligands was monitored (in the fluorescence mode). One of the drive syringes contained purified P450 3A4, diluted to 2 or 4 μm in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The second drive syringe contained the ligand solution (bromocriptine, dissolved in 0.10 m HCl, was diluted in buffer to the desired concentration, and all other ligands were dissolved in CH3OH with ≤2% (v/v) final CH3OH concentration). All stopped-flow measurements were carried out at 23 °C. Immediately after mixing equal amounts (150 μl) of reagent from both syringes, UV-visible spectra (350–500 nm) were collected in the rapid scanning mode with a 16 × 1-mm scan disk, which is a component of the instrument and is used to acquire spectra rapidly. Depending on the data collection time, between 10 and 1000 scans/s were acquired; generally, averages of four experiments were used in the subsequent data analyses. Time-resolved spectra were collected with at least five ligand concentrations for each ligand. Kinetic traces were extracted from the acquired spectra, utilizing either ΔA390 or ΔA390 – A418 (or ΔA390 – A420) and were analyzed using the manufacturer's software (OLIS), GraphPad Prism, or DynaFit. Binding kinetics of testosterone and bromocriptine to P450 3A4 were also measured using the reconstituted system. In these experiments, one of the drive syringes contained P450 3A4 (2 μm), NADPH-P450 reductase (4 μm), cytochrome b5 (2 μm), and other components of the reconstitution system. The second drive syringe contained the testosterone or the bromocriptine solution. In the fluorescence experiments, after mixing the contents of the drive syringes, emission spectra were collected as a function of time with a midplane photomultiplier tube and using the 16 × 1-mm scan disk. The excitation wavelength was 325 nm for bromocriptine and α-naphthoflavone. In general, an excitation monochromator slit of 1.24 mm was used, corresponding to an 8-nm bandpass. Alternatively, data were collected using a >385-nm long pass filter in the single wavelength mode, and the kinetic traces were analyzed using the OLIS software or GraphPad Prism. Generally, averages of four experiments were used in the subsequent data analyses, and S.E. values indicate the goodness of the fit to the average of the multiple experiments. Anaerobic Experiments—The basic set-up (50Burleigh Jr., B.D. Foust G.P. Williams Jr., C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and recent modifications (51Guengerich F.P. Krauser J.A. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10775-10788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have been described elsewhere. Anaerobic conditions were achieved by connecting the glass tonometers to a gas train via a manifold and alternating between vacuum and argon for 10 cycles. In the reduction experiments, an additional three vacuum-CO cycles were carried out prior to loading the drive syringes. An O2 scrubbing system was included in the glass tonometers consisting of protocatechuate dioxygenase (0.7 μm) and protocatechuate (80 μm, added into the solution after 5 vacuum/argon cycles, through a side arm) (52Patil P.V. Ballou D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The drive syringes and lines of the stopped-flow apparatus were depleted of O2 using an overnight procedure described in detail previously (53Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Reduction Kinetics—The reduction rate of ferric (Fe3+) to ferrous (Fe2+) P450 was measured at 23 °C with the increase in absorbance at 450 nm or the decrease at 390 nm. Glass tonometers (under a positive CO atmosphere and containing the O2 scrubbing system; see above) were used to fill the drive syringes of the stopped-flow instrument, with minimum exposure to the atmosphere. One of the syringes contained an anaerobic solution of P450 3A4 (0.5 μm, reconstituted as described above), and the second syringe contained 0.4 mm NADPH. In some reduction experiments, bromocriptine (10 μm) was also included either in the syringe containing the enzyme or the one containing NADPH. After mixing the components of the two syringes, UV-visible spectra (355–580 nm) were collected, and kinetic traces were extracted at the wavelengths of interest and analyzed further using GraphPad Prism. As in the case of binding kinetics experiments, between 10 and 1000 scans/s were acquired, depending on the data collection time, and generally averages of four experiments were used in the subsequent data analyses. Equilibrium Dialysis—The stoichiometry of bromocriptine binding to P450 3A4 was examined using five-cavity equilibrium dialysis cells (Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, NJ). A dialysis membrane with a 12–14-kDa cut-off was placed between the two halves of the dialysis cell. The solutions (900 μl) were loaded into the cavities using a 1-ml syringe. Both sides contained an equal amount of bromocriptine solution (0–5 μm in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, diluted from a 300 μm bromocriptine stock solution in 0.10 m HCl). In addition to bromocriptine, one side also contained P450 3A4 (1.0 μm). The solutions were equilibrated for 24 h at room temperature with mechanical rocking. After equilibration, 800-μl aliquots were removed from the cavities, and 100 μl of 25% HClO4 was added. The solutions were mixed using a vortex device and centrifuged (2 × 103× g, 10 min), and 750-μl aliquots were removed. The aliquots were diluted to 2.0 ml with H2O, and fluorescence spectra (350–550 nm) were recorded using mirror-coated fluorimeter cuvettes (Starna Cells, Atascadero, CA). The excitation wavelength was 325 nm, and emission at 420 nm was used to quantify the amount of bromocriptine. ITC—ITC titrations were carried out at 25 °C using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Prior to the titration, P450 3A4 was dialyzed twice against 100 volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 4 h. Following the dialysis, the P450 concentration was determined spectrally using the method of Omura and Sato (54Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reference cell of the ITC instrument was filled with dialysis buffer. In a typical experiment, the bromocriptine solution (5 μm in dialysis buffer, diluted from 300 μm bromocriptine stock solution in 0.10 m HCl) in the ITC cell was titrated with P450 3A4 (35 μm) loaded into the ITC syringe. The first injection (2 μl, omitted from analysis) was followed by 25 injections of 10 μl, with 8-min intervals between injections. The cell contents were stirred at 450 rpm to provide immediate mixing. The thermal power (heat per unit time) required to keep the cell temperature constant was monitored with time. The peaks observed in the power versus time plots (thermograms, not shown) were integrated using the ORIGIN software (MicroCal). The heats of dilution were obtained from the saturating part of the thermograms and subtracted from each integrated peak. The total heat change was plotted versus the concentration of P450 added to give a titration curve (binding isotherm), expressed in units of kJ mol–1. Kinetic Modeling of Data—Kinetic binding data were fit to various proposed models using DynaFit software (49Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Rate constants were estimated by globally fitting the kinetic data at six different ligand concentrations to the proposed models. The initial ligand concentrations were allowed to float within 10% of the starting value in the system, and in most cases the concentration adjustment was less than 5%. Sample scripts are included in the supplemental data. Spectral Equilibrium Binding Titrations—Affinities of various ligands with P450 3A4 were first estimated spectrophotometrically by monitoring the heme spectral changes upon the addition of ligands. Ks values were obtained from the titration curves, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ks values estimated previously in this laboratory and the Ks values determined for the new ligands included in this study are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Binding rates and affinities of ligands to P450 3A4LigandConcentration used for initial analysisSoret shiftaFrom Ref. 55.KskabFrom initial analysis.

Open table in a new tab The P450 3A4 substrates testosterone, midazolam, flavone, α-naphthoflavone, and bromocriptine all produced a Type I shift in the heme Soret band, reflecting the displacement of H2O as the sixth ligand and resulting in a low to high spin change in the P450 iron (55Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). Bromocriptine, the most bulky of the substrates studied, had the highest apparent affinity (Ks = 0.4 μm), consistent with a previously reported dissociation constant (16Peyronneau M.A. Delaforge M.

https://openalex.org/W2038583114,"We used directed evolution to enhance the thermostability of glycosyl hydrolase family-11 xylanase from Bacillus subtilis. By combining random point mutagenesis, saturation mutagenesis, and DNA shuffling, a thermostable variant, Xylst, was identified which contained three amino acid substitutions: Q7H, N8F, and S179C. The half-inactivation temperature (the midpoint of the melting curves) for the Xylst variant compared with the wild-type enzyme after incubation for 10 min was elevated from 58 to 68 °C. At 60 °C the wild-type enzyme was inactivated within 5 min, but Xylst retained full activity for at least 2 h. The stabilization was accompanied by evidence of thermophilicity; that is, an increase in the optimal reaction temperature from 55 to 65 °C and lower activity at low temperatures and higher activity at higher temperatures relative to wild type. To elucidate the mechanism of thermal stabilization, three-dimensional structures were determined for the wild-type and Xylst enzymes. A cavity was identified around Gln-7/Asn-8 in wild type that was filled with bulky, hydrophobic residues in Xylst. This site was not identified by previous approaches, but directed evolution identified the region as a weak point. Formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge via Cys-179 was observed between monomers in Xylst. However, the stability was essentially the same in the presence and absence of a reducing agent, indicating that the increased hydrophobicity around the Cys-179 accounted for the stability.

Xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) catalyze the hydrolysis of xylan, a major constituent of hemicellulose. The enzyme is the focus of much attention because of its potential for use in industrial processes, including paper and pulp industries and food and feed industries (1Bajpai P. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 2004; 24: 1-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Polizeli M.L. Rizzattim A.C. Monti R. Terenzi H.F. Jorge J.A. Amorim D.S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 67: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Many efforts have been made to improve the properties of the glycosyl hydrolase family-11 (previously family G) xylanase to handle industrial tasks. In particular, thermostability is a major target of such modifications (3Wakarchuk W.W. Sung W.L. Campbell R.L. Cunningham A. Watson D.C. Yaguchi M. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Georis J. de Lemos Esteves F. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Bougnet V. Devreese B. Giannotta F. Granier B. Frere J.M.

Fenel F. Leisola M. Turunen O. Extremophiles. 2004; 8: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the majority of these studies have been performed by site-directed mutagenesis based on high resolution three-dimensional structures, and solutions that identify functional changes are well beyond our predictive ability with these approaches (8Arnold F.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 125-131Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 9Arnold F.H. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 617-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used a directed evolution technique, an alternative approach to protein engineering that can complement the weaknesses of the site-directed approach (8Arnold F.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 125-131Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Our approach included a global search for weakness using random mutagenesis, an extensive search for the best-fit residue by saturation mutagenesis, and rapid fitness improvement by DNA shuffling. By using these techniques, we attempted to identify positions that confer thermostability and that have not been identified by other methods. Directed evolution does not require three-dimensional structures but does require a quick and sensitive screening system (10Arnold F.H. Moore J.C. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1997; 58: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). From this point of view, the high-throughput screening systems developed for this enzyme are a poor fit except for the clear zone (halo) assay (11Wood P.J. Fulcher R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1983; 31: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). With this assay, xylanase-producing bacteria form a clear zone (halo) around the colonies when grown on agar plates containing xylan (or dye-coupled xylan such as Remazol Brilliant Blue to increase sensitivity). Formation of a complex between the dyes and sugars enables us to detect using the naked eye enzyme-producing colonies as a clear zone. Although these assays are simple and quick, the method is limited since the activity needs to be detected under physiological conditions. Therefore, we first attempted to establish a more flexible high-throughput xylanase activity screening system. To achieve this, we modified the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) 2The abbreviations used are: DNS, dinitrosalicylic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; Xylst, thermostable variant xylanase of B. subtilis. method (12Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22579) Google Scholar) to a 96-well format. We also used a commercial mild detergent, the BugBuster™ reagent (Novagen), for efficient and consistent extraction of enzymes from Escherichia coli. After setting up reliable screening conditions, we applied directed evolution and screened for increased thermostability. We successfully obtained a thermostable variant that retained full activity at 60 °C for more than 2 h, whereas the wild type inactivated in ∼5 min. Reagents—Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Takara BIO (Shiga, Japan); PfuTurbo® was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); DpnI was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA); CircleGrow® was purchased from BIO101 (Carlsbad, CA); BugBuster™ reagent and benzonase nuclease were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI); the Diversify™ PCR random mutagenesis kit was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA); oligonucleotides were purchased from Japan Bio Services (Saitama, Japan); competent E. coli JM109 cells were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Soluble birch wood xylan was kindly provided by Dr. Kazuhiko Ishikawa. Mutagenesis—Plasmid pBsx2, which carries a thermolabile variant (a G510A nucleotide substitution occurs which causes a Met-169 to Ile amino acid substitution) of Bacillus subtilis xylanase (13Paice M.G. Bourbonnais R. Desrochers M. Jurasek L. Yaguchi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 201-206Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), was cloned into pTD-tac (14Date T. Tanihara K. Numura N. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Error-prone PCR was carried out using a Clontech Diversify™ PCR random mutagenesis kit. A mutation condition, which should generate an error frequency of ∼4-5 base substitutions per 1000 bases per gene copy, was used. The reaction mixture contained 40 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0), 16 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 3.75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.64 mm MnSO4, 40 μm dGTP, 1× Diversify™ dNTP mix, 10 μm concentrations each of flanking primers, 1 ng of pBsx2, and 5 units of Taq polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl. The mixture was heated at 94 °C for 30 s followed by 25 cycles of incubation at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min. Products were purified and cloned back into the pTD-tac vector. The plasmid library thus obtained was used to transform competent E. coli JM109. Site-saturation mutagenesis was carried out using a pair of oligonucleotide primers. The sequences of oligonucleotides are listed in Table 1. The target amino acid position was coded by NNK (sense strand) and MNN (antisense strand), where N = A, G, C, or T, K = G or T, and M = A or C. The reaction was carried out following the Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis protocol (15Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pair of primers was mixed in 1 × PfuTurbo buffer, 50 ng of pBsx2, 10 μm concentrations each of primer, 0.2 mm concentrations of each dNTP, and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo® DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl. The solution was heated for 30 s at 95 °C followed by 20 rounds of incubation at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min. After cooling down the mixture to 4 °C, 10 units of DpnI was added to the products and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to digest the template pBsx2. The mixture was used to transform competent E. coli JM109.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences used for site-saturation mutagenesis The target amino acid position was coded by degenerated codon NNK (sense strand, upper sequence) and MNN (antisense strand, lower sequence), where N = A, G, C, T, or K = G or T, and M = A or C.Target sitesOligonucleotide sequences7 and 85′-CCATGGCTAGCACAGACTACTGGNNKNNKTGGACTGATGGGGGCGGTATAGT-3′5′-ACTATACCGCCCCCATCAGTCCAMNNMNNCCAGTAGTCTGTGCTAGCCATGG-3′1695′-CAGTAATTGGGCTTACCAAGTCNNKGCGACAGAAGGATATCAAAGTAG-3′5′-CTACTTTGATATCCTTCTGTCGCMNNGACTTGGTAAGCCCAATTACTG-3′1795′-GCGACAGAAGGATATCAAAGTAGTGGANNKTCTAACGTAACAGTGTGGTAAGAA-3′5′-TTCTTACCACACTGTTACGTTAGAMNNTCCACTACTTTGATATCCTTCTGTCGC-3′ Open table in a new tab DNA shuffling was carried out using the StEP method (16Zhao H. Giver L. Shao Z. Affholter J.A. Arnold F.H. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The reaction contained ∼0.2 μg each of parent plasmid DNA, 1× Taq buffer, 0.2 mm concentrations each of dNTP, 0.15 μm concentrations of each flanking primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then subjected to 80 rounds of thermal cycling at 94 °C for 30 s and 55 °C for 15 s in a Stratagene Robocycler. The product was purified and cloned back into the pTD-tac. The plasmid library thus obtained was used to transform competent E. coli JM109. Library Screening—E. coli JM109 transformants were picked with a sterile toothpick and resuspended in separate wells of a 96-deep well flat-bottom block (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) containing 1.2 ml of CircleGrow® and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After growing the cells at 37 °C for 47 h, we mixed the cell suspension from each well with the BugBuster™, which is formulated with non-ionic detergents that are capable of cell wall perforation without denaturing soluble proteins. To identify optimal conditions for protein extraction, we varied the concentration of the reagent. After the addition of the BugBuster™ reagent, the cell suspension sat for 30 min at room temperature. After a brief centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min), which was sufficient to remove precipitates and to obtain a non-viscous supernatant, activity was measured as described below. As the result, the activity plateaued when 0.2 × BugBuster™ was added to the culture (i.e. a 160-μl aliquot of cell suspension from each well with 40 μl of the BugBuster™). Activity was determined by the DNS method (12Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22579) Google Scholar). Each cell extract (20 μl) was mixed in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.1 m Mes-NaOH (pH 5.7) and 0.1% (w/v) soluble xylan. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 100 μl of stop solution containing 1% (w/v) DNS, 30% (w/v) potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, and 0.4 n NaOH was added. The mixture was heated at 99 °C for 10 min, and activity was determined from the increase of absorbance at 540 nm on a Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader (VersaMax). For the thermostability assay, enzymes were heat-treated, and the residual activity was determined. The thermostability index was defined as the ratio of activities before and after the heat treatment. Enzyme Purification—E. coli JM109 cells harboring wild-type or mutant xylanase genes were grown overnight in LB medium (1.6% Tryptone, 1.0% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The culture was then diluted 1/1000 in a fresh LB medium (1 liter) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside and agitated at 37 °C for 12 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and suspended in 25 ml of BugBuster™ containing 25 μl of benzonase nuclease. Proteins were extracted by agitation at room temperature for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and supernatant was applied to a Resource S® (Amersham Biosciences) column (6.4 mm inner diameter × 3 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5). The column was rinsed with 20 ml of the buffer, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.2 m. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). Then proteins were applied to a TSK gel CM-5PW (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) column (7.5 mm inner diameter × 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The column was rinsed with 20 ml of the buffer, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.4 m. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The concentration of purified protein was determined using the extinction coefficient (ϵ280 = 4.08) as reported previously (17Sung W.L. Luk C.K. Zahab D.M. Wakarchuk W. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thermal Inactivation—Half-lives of thermal inactivation of wild-type and Xylst enzymes were determined by incubating the enzymes (0.1 mg/ml) at 60 or 65 °C in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl and 1 mm DTT. At various time intervals, 10-μl aliquots were removed and diluted into 90 μl of assay solution containing 0.1 m Mes-NaOH (pH 5.7) and 0.1% (w/v) soluble xylan for the measurement of residual activity at 37 °C. Inactivation profiles of wild-type and Xylst enzymes were plotted by incubating the enzymes (0.1 mg/ml) at various temperatures (from 30 to 85 °C) for 10 min followed by determining the residual activity at 37 °C using 10 μl of enzymes in 90 μl of assay solution containing 0.1 m Mes-NaOH (pH 5.7) and 0.1% (w/v) soluble xylan. X-ray Analysis—The initial screening of the crystallization conditions was carried out according to the sparse-matrix sampling method (18Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) using Crystal Screen (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and Wizard and Cryo Screens (DeCODE Genetics, Reykjavik, Iceland). Crystallization was performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method (19McPherson A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) at 20 °C using a 24-well VDX plate (Hampton Research). Before crystallization, wild-type xylanase and Xylst were concentrated to 17.7 and 17.4 mg/ml, respectively. The size of the droplet, which consisted of equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution, was 1 μl. The initial conditions under which crystals appeared were refined by varying the pH of the buffer and the concentration of the precipitant. Diffraction data of the wild-type xylanase crystal were collected at beamline BL6A and the Xylst crystal were collected on NW12 of the Photon Factory, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å. Before data collection, the crystal was soaked in the crystallization solution containing 20% glycerol then mounted on a nylon fiber loop and immersed in liquid nitrogen for freezing. The diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and the CCP4 program suite (21Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Structures of wild-type xylanase and Xylst were determined by a molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 package using the structure of Bacillus circulans xylanase (PDB codes 1XNB) as a search model. CNS (23Brünger A.T.

A randomly chosen 5.0% of the data were used to calculate the free R factor (25Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). High-throughput Screening System for Xylanase Thermostability— Because Miller (12Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22579) Google Scholar) reported the use of DNS reagent to determine the concentration of reducing sugars released, the DNS method has routinely been used in determination of glycosidase activities. In this study we modified the DNS method by downscaling all the reaction components to fit the 96-well format. In addition, for consistent extraction of cytosolic proteins from E. coli with high efficiency and to minimize well-to-well or plate-to-plate fluctuations, we used the BugBuster™ protein-extracting reagent. Although the reagent is usually used in a 1× concentration, we identified that a 0.2× concentration was the best. Increasing the concentration of the reagent had an adverse effect; the extraction efficiency of the enzyme did not increase, whereas the solution became more viscous. Because pipetting viscous solution is highly problematic, it was at least in our case not advantageous to use the regular 1× concentration. To test the validity of our screening system, we performed site-saturation mutagenesis at amino acid position 169. The residue is fully buried in the molecule, and the “solutions” that confer thermostability may be limited; thus, some hydrophobic residues will be accommodated. We previously found that the thermal stability of the enzyme is greatly reduced by altering the wild-type residue Met to Ile. 3K. Miyazaki and M. Takenouchi, unpublished result. We, therefore, used the thermolabile M169I variant and employed saturation mutagenesis to test if our screening was sensitive enough to solve the “problem” correctly. Eight clones were randomly picked from the saturation mutagenesis library to check for the randomness of the library. DNA sequencing revealed that the site was occupied with 2× Asp (GAT), 1× Phe (TTT), Trp (TGG), Lys (AAG), Ala (GCT), Val (GTG), and Ile (ATT), ensuring the randomness of the library. We then screened for activity and thermostability of 360 randomly picked clones. Approximately half of the clones retained the activity (Fig. 1a). We next screened 164 active clones for thermostability by incubation at 55 °C for 5 min (Fig. 1b). Fourteen thermostable clones that showed essentially the same stability were picked and subjected to DNA sequencing. As a result, the position was occupied with Met (5× ATG) or Leu (2× TTG, 2× CTG, and 5× CTT). Taking the different types of codons in Leu-169 variants into account, our screening system is accurate and sensitive enough to identify thermostable variants of xylanase. Directed Evolution—The thermolabile M169I variant was used as a starting enzyme to enhance thermostability by directed evolution. To avoid sacrificing activity at low temperature, which is often seen in naturally thermophilic enzymes (26Arnold F.H. Wintrode P.L. Miyazaki K. Gershenson A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 100-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), simultaneous screening for activity at 25 °C and thermostability at elevated temperatures was performed. At first, error-prone PCR was carried out for the entire sequence of the xylanase gene. A total of 744 clones were screened for thermostability by incubation at 55 °C for 5 min. Five thermostable variants, 2D6, 4C3, 4A6, 4D12, and 6B5, were identified, and their DNA sequences were determined (Table 2). Interestingly, some mutations were localized at three sites. Mutations at 169 were identified in 4A6 (I169V), 4D12 (I169L), and 6B5 (I169M), mutations at residues 7 and 8 were identified in 4C3 (Q7H) and 4A6 (N8Y), and mutations at residues 151/152 were identified in 4A6 (A152T) and 6B5 (N151S). To identify true-positive amino acid substitutions, we then conducted recombination experiments of those variants by DNA shuffling (15Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Thermostable variants of xylanase obtained from the library prepared by error-prone PCR Base substitutions are shown in parentheses.

As for the 2D6/4C3 StEP library, 168 clones were screened for thermostability by incubation at 65 °C for 5 min. Two thermostable variants that surpassed the thermostability of parents were identified. DNA sequencing showed that both variants contained the same mutations, Q7H (21A→C) and S179C (535A→T). As for the 4A6/4D12/6B5 StEP library, 192 clones were screened for thermostability by incubation at 60 °C for 5 min. Two thermostable variants that surpassed the thermostability of parents were identified. DNA sequencing revealed that one variant contained N8Y (22A→T), N151S (452A→G), and I169M (507A→G), and the other contained N8Y (22A→T) and I169M (507A→G). Because the thermostability was nearly the same for the two variants, the latter variant was used for further study. Although the sites 151 and 152 appeared to be a weak point of the molecule, they did not contribute to enhancing stability in the context of other mutations, N8Y and I169M. The mutations might be false positive mutations, and DNA shuffling did not pick such non-adaptive mutations. There were three amino acid substitutions both in 6B5 and 4A6, and the rest of the mutations (N114K and I169M in 6B5; N8Y and I169V in 4A6) might play a more important role in thermostabilization. Next, we employed site-saturation mutagenesis (27Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) to optimize the local sequence at positions 7, 8, and 179. Positions 7 and 8 were regarded as a single site, and we performed two mutagenesis experiments. For positions 7/8, a total of 744 clones were screened for thermostability by incubation at 55 °C for 5 min. Two thermostable variants were identified that contained mutations Q7H (CAT)/N8F (TTT) and Q7L (TTG)/N8V (GTT), respectively. The former variant showed slightly higher stability. As for position 179, 192 clones were screened, and 9 thermostable variants were identified. Of these, seven variants contained the same mutations S179C (all in the TGT codon). The rest of the variants, S179Y (TAT) and S179M (ATG), showed a slightly lower stability. Individually optimized sequences (Q7H, N8F, and S179C) were then recombined by DNA shuffling (16Zhao H. Giver L. Shao Z. Affholter J.A. Arnold F.H. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). As a result of the screening of 192 clones for thermostability by incubation at 65 °C for 5 min, 3 thermostable variants were obtained, all of which contained amino acid substitutions Q7H, N8F, and S179C (one variant contained an additional synonymous mutation, t66a). Based on the triple amino acid substitution variant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert Ile-169 to Met, to obtain a variant Xylst. Thermostability of Purified Enzymes—To determine thermostability, we purified the wild-type and Xylst enzymes. Because the Xylst contained a single Cys residue at a surface of the molecule, we checked the possibility of dimer formation through intramolecular disulfide bridges. Proteins (wild type and Xylst) were incubated in the presence and absence of DTT (1 mm) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2, Xylst formed in part a dimer in the absence of DTT, indicating that the enzyme is prone to forming a dimer upon prolonged incubation. To simplify the inactivation experiments, we added DTT thereafter to both Xylst and wild type. First, the enzymes were heated at various temperatures for 10 min, and residual activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 3, half-inactivation temperatures (the midpoint of the melting curves) shifted ∼10 °C upward for Xylst (wild type, 58 °C; Xylst, 68 °C). At 60 °C, the wild-type enzyme was inactivated, whereas Xylst retained full activity. At 65 °C, the wild-type enzyme completely lost activity, but Xylst retained activity. A slight increase in activity was observed for the Xylst enzyme especially at high temperature around 60 °C. This might be caused by heat activation of the enzyme via structural rearrangement as reported previously (28Ishikawa K. Ishida H. Koyama Y. Kawarabayasi Y. Kawahara J. Matsui E. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17726-17731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Next, half-lives of the enzymes upon heating were determined. As observed in the previous experiment (Fig. 3), the stability of the two enzymes was widely different, and thus, the half-life of the enzymes was not determined under the same temperature. At 60 °C, the wild-type enzyme was inactivated within 10 min (half-life, ∼5 min), whereas Xylst was fully active for at least 2 h (Fig. 4A). At 65 °C, the wild-type enzyme was inactivated rapidly, and the half-life could not be determined (Fig. 4B). The half-life of Xylst was ∼20 min at 65 °C. Temperature Dependence of the Activity—The specific activities of wild-type and Xylst were determined over a range of temperatures from 20 to 85 °C. As shown in Fig. 5, stabilization of Xylst was accompanied by an increase in the optimal temperature of ∼10 °C. The activity of Xylst was slightly lower than that of wild type below 55 °C but higher at elevated temperatures, indicating that the Xylst acquired a thermophilic nature after evolution. In our previous studies of temperature adaptation of psychrophilic subtilisin S41 to a high temperature (27Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we obtained a variant whose activity shifted upward over a wide range of temperature. Crystal Structure Analysis and Possible Explanation for Thermostability—To elucidate the effect of mutation on thermal stability and activity by comparing wild-type xylanase and Xylst on the basis of structural information, we determined their crystal structures. Crystals of wild-type xylanase were grown from 0.1 m imidazole buffer (pH 7.7-7.9), 1.0-1.1 m potassium/sodium tartrate. Xylst was crystallized in a different form under conditions of 0.1 m Mes buffer (pH 5.9-6.1), 1.1-1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 10% dioxane, and 25 mm DTT. In the wild-type crystal, five molecules exist independently in the asymmetric unit of the cell, and two molecules are contained in the asymmetric unit of the Xylst crystal. Their structures were determined by the molecular replacement method and refined against the 20-1.4 Å intensity data for wild-type xylanase and 20-1.9 Å for Xylst. The crystallographic R-factor and free R-factor of wild-type xylanase were 0.197 and 0.217, respectively. The crystallographic R-factor and free R-factor of Xylst were 0.244 and 0.269, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2145194153,"Regarded as a damaging reaction, innate immune response can either improve or worsen brain outcome after injury. Hence, inflammatory molecules might modulate cell susceptibility or healing events. The remyelination that follows brain lesions is dependent on the recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and expression of genes controlling differentiation and myelin production, such as Olig1 and Olig2 bHLH transcription factors. We aimed to determine how innate immunity affects these processes. Here we report that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusion triggered OPC reactivity. Acute inflammation changed the distribution of Olig1- and Olig2-expressing cells following chemical demyelination, enhanced reappearance of transcription signals linked to remyelination and rapidly cleared myelin debris. Although cells expressing Olig1, Olig2, and proteolipid protein were attracted to demyelinated sites in the course of chronic inflammation, myelin loss was not associated with the effects of inflammation on OPC reactivity. In addition, the beneficial properties of brain immunity are broadened to an aggressive model of injury, wherein LPS through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) reduced surfactant-mediated damage while anti-inflammatory treatment enlarged the lesion. In conclusion, TLR4 activation in microglia is a powerful mechanism for improving repair at the remyelination level and protecting the cerebral tissue in presence of agents with strong cytolytic properties."

https://openalex.org/W2052146662,"This huge eruption slowed sea-level rise and ocean warming well into the following century. The 1883 eruption of the volcano Krakatoa in Indonesia has echoed down the centuries in art and in legend. Now an analysis of a suite of 12 climate models shows that Krakatoa also made its presence felt well into the twentieth century in the form of reduced ocean warming and sea-level rise. The changes lasted much longer than was previously suspected and were sufficient to offset much of the ocean warming and sea-level rise caused by more recent human activities. We have analysed a suite of 12 state-of-the-art climate models and show that ocean warming and sea-level rise in the twentieth century were substantially reduced by the colossal eruption in 1883 of the volcano Krakatoa in the Sunda strait, Indonesia. Volcanically induced cooling of the ocean surface penetrated into deeper layers, where it persisted for decades after the event. This remarkable effect on oceanic thermal structure is longer lasting than has previously been suspected1 and is sufficient to offset a large fraction of ocean warming and sea-level rise caused by anthropogenic influences."
https://openalex.org/W2075176477,"The functional significance of protease-activated receptors (PARs) in endothelial cells is largely undefined, and the intracellular consequences of their activation are poorly understood. Here, we show that the serine protease thrombin, a PAR-1-selective peptide (TFLLRN), and SLIGKV (PAR-2-selective peptide) induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein and mRNA expression in human endothelial cells without modifying COX-1 expression. COX-2 induction was accompanied by sustained production of 6-keto-PGF1α, the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin, and this was inhibited by indomethacin and the COX-2-selective inhibitor NS398. PAR-1 and PAR-2 stimulation rapidly activated both ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, and pharmacological blockade of MEK with either PD98059 or U0126 or of p38MAPK by SB203580 or SB202190 strongly inhibited thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced COX-2 expression and 6-keto-PGF1α formation. Thrombin and peptide agonists of PAR-1 and PAR-2 increased luciferase activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells infected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter adenovirus, and this, as well as PAR-induced 6-keto-PGF1α synthesis, was inhibited by co-infection with adenovirus encoding wild-type or mutated (Y42F) IκBα. Thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced COX-2 expression and 6-keto-PGF1α generation were markedly attenuated by the NF-κB inhibitor PG490 and partially inhibited by the proteasome pathway inhibitor MG-132. Activation of PAR-1 or PAR-2 promoted nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p65-NF-κB, and thrombin-induced but not PAR-2-induced p65-NF-κB phosphorylation was reduced by inhibition of MEK or p38MAPK. Activation of PAR-4 by AYPGKF increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK without modifying NF-κB activation or COX-2 induction. Our data show that PAR-1 and PAR-2, but not PAR-4, are coupled with COX-2 expression and sustained endothelial production of vasculoprotective prostacyclin by mechanisms that depend on ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and IκBα-dependent NF-κB activation. The functional significance of protease-activated receptors (PARs) in endothelial cells is largely undefined, and the intracellular consequences of their activation are poorly understood. Here, we show that the serine protease thrombin, a PAR-1-selective peptide (TFLLRN), and SLIGKV (PAR-2-selective peptide) induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein and mRNA expression in human endothelial cells without modifying COX-1 expression. COX-2 induction was accompanied by sustained production of 6-keto-PGF1α, the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin, and this was inhibited by indomethacin and the COX-2-selective inhibitor NS398. PAR-1 and PAR-2 stimulation rapidly activated both ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, and pharmacological blockade of MEK with either PD98059 or U0126 or of p38MAPK by SB203580 or SB202190 strongly inhibited thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced COX-2 expression and 6-keto-PGF1α formation. Thrombin and peptide agonists of PAR-1 and PAR-2 increased luciferase activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells infected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter adenovirus, and this, as well as PAR-induced 6-keto-PGF1α synthesis, was inhibited by co-infection with adenovirus encoding wild-type or mutated (Y42F) IκBα. Thrombin- and SLIGKV-induced COX-2 expression and 6-keto-PGF1α generation were markedly attenuated by the NF-κB inhibitor PG490 and partially inhibited by the proteasome pathway inhibitor MG-132. Activation of PAR-1 or PAR-2 promoted nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p65-NF-κB, and thrombin-induced but not PAR-2-induced p65-NF-κB phosphorylation was reduced by inhibition of MEK or p38MAPK. Activation of PAR-4 by AYPGKF increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK without modifying NF-κB activation or COX-2 induction. Our data show that PAR-1 and PAR-2, but not PAR-4, are coupled with COX-2 expression and sustained endothelial production of vasculoprotective prostacyclin by mechanisms that depend on ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and IκBα-dependent NF-κB activation. The principal mechanism through which serine proteases regulate cell behavior is by activation of a unique family of G-protein-coupled receptors, referred to as protease-activated receptors (PARs) 2The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); COX-1/-2, cyclooxygenase-1/-2; IκBα, inhibitory protein κBα; IKK, IκB-kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL-1α, interleukin-1α; 6-keto-PGF1α, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α; PGI2, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2); Ad, adenovirus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 2The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); COX-1/-2, cyclooxygenase-1/-2; IκBα, inhibitory protein κBα; IKK, IκB-kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL-1α, interleukin-1α; 6-keto-PGF1α, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α; PGI2, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2); Ad, adenovirus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance.

Sci. 2005; 97: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These receptors are activated by the proteolytic activities of their ligands, which unmask a cryptic N-terminal receptor sequence that binds to and triggers receptor function while remaining tethered. Molecular cloning has identified four subtypes of the PAR family that exhibit differential tissue expression as well as selectivity in activation by serine proteases and by peptides that mimic the tethered ligand sequences. PAR-1 is a ubiquitously expressed receptor and is activated by the multifunctional serine protease, thrombin, and by the synthetic PAR-1 peptide TFLLRN. PAR-4 is a second thrombin receptor that binds thrombin with low affinity and can be activated by the polypeptide sequence AYPGKF (3Mason J.C. Lidington E.A. Yarwood H. Lubin D.M. Haskard D.O. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Kataoka H. Hamilton J.R. McKemy D.D. Camerer E. Zheng Y.W. Cheng A. Griffin C. Coughlin S.R. Blood. 2003; 102: 3224-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Signaling through PAR-2, in contrast, is preferentially stimulated by trypsin, tryptase, and membrane-type serine protease-1 (5Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and can be activated independently of proteolysis by the selective PAR-2 peptide SLIGKV. Cellular responses to thrombin and to other proteases are therefore determined in part by the expression of PARs as well as by the differential recruitment of signaling pathways following ligand binding.Endothelial cells respond to PAR-1 activation by thrombin with a number of functional responses including secretion of von Willebrand factor (6Wheeler-Jones C.P. May M.J. Houliston R.A. Pearson J.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), up-regulation of IL-8 synthesis (7Ludeman M.J. Kataoka H. Srinivasan Y. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and expression of adhesion molecules (8Minami T. Sugiyama A. Wu S.Q. Abid R. Kodama T. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thrombin also causes endothelial cell proliferation, which is essential for wound healing and angiogenesis (9Tang H. Low B. Rutherford S.A. Hao Q. Blood. 2005; 105: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, whereas this protease clearly promotes both proinflammatory and prothrombotic events in the vascular wall, thrombin also increases endothelial expression of complement inhibitory proteins (e.g. decay-accelerating factor) (3Mason J.C. Lidington E.A. Yarwood H. Lubin D.M. Haskard D.O. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and enhances the release of vasodilator molecules that have vasculoprotective properties (6Wheeler-Jones C.P. May M.J. Houliston R.A. Pearson J.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Chung A. Wildhirt S.M. Wang S. Koshal A. Radomski M.W. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 2005; 129: 782-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In particular, we have shown that thrombin exposure induces rapid and sustained phases of prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis by human endothelial cells (12Houliston R.A. Keogh R.J. Sugden D. Dudhia J. Carter T.D. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PGI2 contributes to the acute inflammatory response by promoting vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, is a potent antiplatelet agent, and has antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects mediated by paracrine actions on vascular smooth muscle and fibroblasts, respectively (13Shirotani M. Yui Y. Hattori R. Kawai C. Prostaglandins. 1991; 41: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Stratton R. Rajkumar V. Ponticos M. Nichols B. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. FASEB J. 2002; 14: 1949-19451Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The potential effects of PAR-2 activation on endothelial prostanoid production have received little attention, but there is some evidence that PAR-2 can mediate protective anti-inflammatory responses in vivo (15Fiorucci S. Mencarelli A. Palazzetti B. Distrutti E. Vergnolle N. Hollenberg M.D. Wallace J.L. Morelli A. Cirino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 13936-13941Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) as well as contributing to inflammation (16Ferrell W.R. Lockhart J.C. Kelso E.B. Dunning L. Plevin R. Meek S.E. Smith A.J. Hunter G.D. McLean J.S. McGarry F. Ramage R. Jiang L. Kanke T. Kawagoe J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). PAR-2 is strongly induced in endothelial cells following cytokine challenge (17Nystedt S. Ramakrishnan V. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14910-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that activation of this receptor is functionally significant only in the context of inflammation. We have recently shown, however, that human endothelial cells respond to PAR-2 activation with increased prostanoid synthesis without the requirement for cytokine exposure (12Houliston R.A. Keogh R.J. Sugden D. Dudhia J. Carter T.D. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that PAR-2 is also a physiologically relevant receptor. Understanding how signaling through distinct PARs regulates endothelial production of PGI2 therefore has important implications for both normal and pathophysiological control of the vasculature.Prostaglandins are synthesized through the activities of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX), designated COX-1 and COX-2 (18Fitzpatrick F.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme present in most tissues. In contrast, COX-2, the product of a related gene, is strongly up-regulated by cytokines and growth factors (19Pruzanski W. Stefanski E. Vadas P. Kennedy B.P. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 27: 47-56Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Minghetti L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 90-110Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and is now recognized to be constitutively expressed in several tissues (20Minghetti L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 90-110Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Regulation of COX-2 occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are known to be involved in regulating COX-2 expression in response to cytokines (21Dean J.L. Sarsfield S.J. Tsounakou E. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39470-39476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22LaPointe M.C. Isenovic E. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 276-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lin C.C. Sun C.C. Luo S.F. Tsai A.C. Chien C.S. Hsiao L.D. Lee C.W. Hsieh J.T. Yang C.M. J. Biomed. Sci. 2004; 11: 377-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK1/2 and p38MAPK have been implicated in both acute and chronic responses to extracellular stimuli in endothelial cells and we have shown that both of these MAPK families are capable of regulating acute thrombin-stimulated PGI2 synthesis through their direct and indirect effects on Group IV phospholipase A2α activation (24Houliston R.A. Pearson J.D. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1266-C1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also previously shown that COX-2 expression in primary human endothelial cells is enhanced by exposure to thrombin and the PAR-1-selective peptide TFLLRN and have provided evidence that activation of PAR-2 by SLIGKV promotes increased COX-2 expression with kinetics distinct from those evident in thrombin-stimulated cells (12Houliston R.A. Keogh R.J. Sugden D. Dudhia J. Carter T.D. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The signaling events that link PAR-1 and PAR-2 with COX-2 expression and sustained prostanoid production are not defined, but the ERK1/2 and p38MAPK families may play important roles.The COX-2 gene contains numerous cis-acting promoter elements, including NF-κB sites (25Chen J. Zhao M. Rao R. Inoue H. Hao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16354-16359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates expression of numerous genes and can exert protective or detrimental effects, depending upon the cellular context (26Caramori G. Adcock I.M. Ito K. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 11: 1141-1147Google Scholar, 27Brown M. McGuinness M. Wright T. Ren X. Wang Y. Boivin G.P. Hahn H. Feldman A.M. Jones W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H466-H476Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Misra A. Haudek S.B. Knuefermann P. Vallejo J.G. Chen Z.J. Michael L.H. Sivasubramanian N. Olson E.N. Entman M.L. Mann D.L. Circulation. 2003; 108: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is complexed in the cytoplasm with its inhibitory subunit IκBα. Agonist stimulation promotes serine phosphorylation of IκBα, which triggers its proteasomal degradation and subsequently activates NF-κB. NF-κB can also be activated by an alternative mechanism that involves phosphorylation of IκBα on Tyr42 (27Brown M. McGuinness M. Wright T. Ren X. Wang Y. Boivin G.P. Hahn H. Feldman A.M. Jones W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H466-H476Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, optimal induction of NF-κB-dependent genes may require agonist-mediated phosphorylation of NF-κB proteins within their transactivation domain (29Schmitz M.L. Mattioli I. Buss H. Kracht M. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that thrombin and a PAR-2-selective peptide can activate NF-κB in vascular cells (30Bretschneider E. Wittpoth M. Weber A.A. Glusa E. Schror K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Bretschneider E. Kaufmann R. Braun M. Wittpoth M. Glusa E. Nowak G. Schror K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1735-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NF-κB pathway may be an important component of PAR-mediated signaling. However, whereas COX-2 expression in several cell types is at least partly dependent on NF-κB activity, the molecular details of its activation in response to ligand binding to PARs are unknown, and hence its significance as a regulator of endothelial PGI2 synthesis remains to be determined.We have investigated the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying PAR-induced COX-2 expression and PGI2 synthesis in human endothelial cells. We show for the first time that activation of endothelial PAR-1 and PAR-2, but not PAR-4, promotes COX-2 induction and sustained formation of the vasculoprotective mediator PGI2 through mechanisms that require activation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK as well as IκBα-dependent NF-κB activation. We further show that phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB is a component of both PAR-1- and PAR-2-mediated endothelial activation. These findings have important implications for understanding the vascular effects of therapeutic interventions that target COX-2 and upstream activators of NF-κB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human α-thrombin, bovine serum albumin (BSA; fraction V), and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P™) were all purchased from Sigma.

Viruses were propagated in 293 human embryonic kidney cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. Titers of viral stocks were determined by plaque assay on 293 cells. Replication-deficient control adenoviral vector without insert (Ad0) was provided by Drs A. Byrnes and M. Wood (Oxford University). Adenovirus encoding porcine IκBα with a cytomegalovirus promoter and a nuclear localization sequence (AdIκBα) was provided by Dr. R. de Martin (University of Vienna). The adenovirus expressing mutated human IκBα (tyrosine 42 to phenylalanine; AdIκBα Y42F) was from Prof. J. F. Engelhardt (University of Iowa). Efficient infection of cells (>95%) was confirmed using virus encoding bacterial β-galactosidase at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100:1 followed by the addition of the fluorimetric substrate, fluorescein-di-β-galactopyranoside (Sigma) (data not shown).

Although a functional orthologue of lpxK, the gene encoding the lipid A 4′-kinase, is present in Francisella, no 4′-phosphate moiety is attached to Francisella lipid A. We now demonstrate that a membrane-bound phosphatase present in Francisella novicida U112 selectively removes the 4′-phosphate residue from tetra- and pentaacylated lipid A molecules. A clone that expresses the F. novicida 4′-phosphatase was identified by assaying lysates of E. coli colonies, harboring members of an F. novicida genomic DNA library, for 4′-phosphatase activity. Sequencing of a 2.5-kb F. novicida DNA insert from an active clone located the structural gene for the 4′-phosphatase, designated lpxF. It encodes a protein of 222 amino acid residues with six predicted membrane-spanning segments. Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhizobium etli contain functional lpxF orthologues, consistent with their lipid A structures. When F. novicida LpxF is expressed in an E. coli LpxM mutant, a strain that synthesizes pentaacylated lipid A, over 90% of the lipid A molecules are dephosphorylated at the 4′-position. Expression of LpxF in wild-type E. coli has no effect, because wild-type hexaacylated lipid A is not a substrate. However, newly synthesized lipid A is not dephosphorylated in LpxM mutants by LpxF when the MsbA flippase is inactivated, indicating that LpxF faces the outer surface of the inner membrane. The availability of the lpxF gene will facilitate re-engineering lipid A structures in diverse bacteria.

Francisella tularensis is an intracellular Gram-negative pathogen that causes tularemia, a severe and often fatal pulmonary infection of humans and animals (1Ellis J. Oyston P.C. Green M.

Francisella novicida U112 is an environmental isolate that is relatively easy to grow and is much less virulent (3Kieffer T.L. Cowley S. Nano F.E. Elkins K.L.

Immunol. 1992; 5: 201-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon may be due to the unusual structure of the lipid A moiety of Francisella LPS (Fig. 1), which is tetraacylated and lacks the 4′-phosphate residue (6Vinogradov E. Perry M.B. Conlan J.W.

LpxF dephosphorylates the 4′-position of penta- and tetraacylated lipid A species but not of the hexaacylated lipid A normally made by wild-type E. coli. Expression of lpxF in E. coli MLK1067, a strain that synthesizes pentaacylated lipid A because of a mutation in the lpxM gene (30Vorachek-Warren M.K. Ramirez S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture contains 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml E. coli phospholipids, and 10 μm [4′-32P]lipid IVA (3000-6000 cpm/nmol). The reaction was terminated by spotting 5-μl samples onto a silica TLC plate. The plate was developed in the solvent of chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). After drying and overnight exposure of the plate to a PhosphorImager screen, product formation was detected and quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), equipped with ImageQuant software. Expression Cloning of the F. novicida 4′-Phosphatase Gene lpxF—Recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Typically, 50 μg of genomic DNA was partially digested with 4 units of SauIIIAI in 200 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was then incubated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate the enzyme. The products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and the 2-6-kb DNA fragments were excised and purified using the gel extraction kit. Plasmid pACYC184 was opened with BamHI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The 2-6-kb DNA fragments were then ligated into pACYC184 at 16 °C overnight in a 25-μl reaction mixture, containing 200 ng of genomic DNA fragments, 200 ng of pACYC184 vector, and 2 units of T4 DNA ligase (26Wang X.

E. coli XL1-Blue cells were transformed by electroporation with the ligation mixture, and chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were selected on LB plates. About 15,000 colonies were pooled using a cell scraper and transferred into 250 ml of fresh LB broth, containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells were grown to saturation, and then 2-ml stocks adjusted to 16% glycerol were prepared and stored at -80 °C. To screen for the 4′-phosphatase gene, a glycerol stock of the library was diluted to obtain about 200 colonies per LB plate, containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The single colonies were inoculated into 6 ml of LB broth and grown overnight. Next, 1-ml portions of the overnight cultures were stored as glycerol stocks. The remaining 5-ml portions of the overnight cultures were pooled into groups of five. Cell-free extracts were then prepared from the pools and assayed for 4′-phosphatase activity. A total of 200 pools was assayed over the course of 3 weeks. The individual clones from one pool (out of a total of two positive pools) with measurable 4′-phosphatase activity were recovered and grown individually to late log phase in 50 ml of LB broth containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cell-free extracts of these cultures were again assayed for 4′-phosphatase. Only one positive clone expressing the 4′-phosphatase activity was found and was designated as XW4. The hybrid plasmid (pXYW4) present in XW4 was isolated using the Qiagen Spin Miniprep kit. Its F. novicida DNA insert was sequenced by using the Terminator Cycle system and an ABI Prism 377 instrument at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility. Using the program ORF Finder (40Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Federhen S. Lash A.E. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Sequeira E. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), we identified a putative open reading frame in the 2.5-kb insert that is distantly related to members of the nonspecific acid phosphatase family (29Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), as judged by BLASTp analysis (41Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar). This potential open reading frame contains a 669-bp DNA fragment and starts with TTG. It was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET28b vector behind the T7lac promoter. The forward primer was 5′-GCGCGCCATGGCAAGATTTCATATCATATTAGGTT-3′. It was designed with a clamp region, an NcoI restriction site (underlined), and a match to the coding strand starting at the putative translation initiation sites. The reverse primer was 5′-GCGCGCCTCGAGTCAATATTCTTTTTTACGATACATTAGTG-3′, which was designed with a clamp region, an XhoI restriction site (underlined), and a match to the anti-coding strand including the stop codon. The PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase and plasmid pXYW4 as the template. Amplification was carried out in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 100 ng of template, 250 ng of primers, and 2 units of Pfu polymerase. The reaction was started at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 55 °C), and extension (45 s at 72 °C). After the 25th cycle, a 10-min extension time was used. The reaction product was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. The desired band was excised and gel-purified. The PCR product was then digested using NcoI and XhoI and ligated into the expression vector pET28b that had been similarly digested and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The ligation mixture was transformed into XL1-Blue cells, and the kanamycin-resistant colonies were selected on LB plates. The plasmid pET28b-LpxF was isolated and transformed into NovaBlue cells after the structure of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Massive overexpression of 4′-phosphatase activity was observed in membranes of NovaBlue/pET28b-LpxF, but not of NovaBlue/pET28b. To construct pWSK29-LpxF, pET28b-LpxF was digested using XbaI and XhoI, and the insert was ligated into the vector pWSK29 (42Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) that had been similarly digested and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The ligation mixture was transformed into XL1-Blue cells, and ampicillin-resistant transformants were selected on LB plates. The plasmid pWSK29-LpxF was isolated from a positive clone and transformed into MLK1067 (lpxM) to obtain MLK1067/pWSK29-LpxF. The strains and plasmids constructed in this study are summarized in Table 1. Isolation of Lipid A Species from 32P-labeled Cells—Typically, 20 ml of LB broth cultures were labeled with 5 μCi/ml 32Pi, starting at an initial A600 of 0.02. The 32P-labeled cells were grown to A600 of 1.0, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of a single-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture (43Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar), incubated at room temperature for 60 min, and centrifuged to collect the pellets. The lipid A is covalently attached to the LPS in the insoluble pellets. To recover the lipid A, the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 12.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 1% SDS, and heated at 100 °C for 30 min (35Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The suspension was converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of chloroform and water. After thorough mixing, the two phases were separated by centrifugation, and the upper phase was washed once with a fresh pre-equilibrated lower phase. The lower phases were pooled and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried lipids were re-dissolved in chloroform and methanol (4:1, v/v). The 32P-labeled lipid A species were spotted onto a TLC plate (10,000 cpm/lane), which was developed in the solvent of chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). After drying, the plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager Screen overnight. To isolate 32P-labeled hexaacylated or pentaacylated lipid A for use as 4′-phosphatase substrates, the plates were exposed to x-ray film to locate the relevant lipid A species. The compounds were scraped off the plates, and the silica chips were extracted with a single-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture for 1 h at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged. The supernatant was passed through a Pasteur pipette fitted with a small glass wool plug and converted into a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system. The two phases were separated by centrifugation. The lower phase, containing the 32P-labeled lipid A, was dried, and the 32P-labeled lipid A was resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, with sonic irradiation in a bath apparatus and used for the in vitro 4′-phosphatase assay, as described above. Preparation of 4′-Dephospho-pentaacylated Lipid A and Its 1-Diphosphate Derivative—The 4′-dephospho-pentaacylated lipid A and its 1-diphosphate derivative were isolated from the strain MLK1067/pWSK29-LpxF and analyzed by using MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry. The cell pellets from 1 liter were extracted for 1 h at room temperature with a single-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture consisting of chloroform, methanol, and water (1:2:0.8, v/v) and centrifuged. To recover the lipid A, the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 12.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 1% SDS and heated at 100 °C for 30 min (35Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Experiments were designed to test whether treatment with deflazacort and L-arginine (a substrate for NO synthase, NOS) would change the extent of fiber injury induced by 24 h of voluntary exercise. The impact of exercise-related injury to induce a secondary regenerative response by muscle was also examined as corroborating evidence of muscle damage. Dystrophic mdx mice were treated for 3 wk with placebo, deflazacort, or deflazacort plus either L-arginine or N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a NOS inhibitor). Deflazacort, especially combined with L-arginine, spared quadriceps muscle from injury-induced regeneration (myf5 expression) compared with placebo treatment, despite an increase in membrane permeability immediately after exercise (assessed by Evans blue dye infiltration). Deflazacort alone prevented the typical progressive loss of function (measured as voluntary distance run over 24 h) that was observed 3 months later in placebo-treated mice. Therefore, combined deflazacort plus L-arginine treatment spared mdx dystrophic limb muscle from exercise-induced damage and the need for regeneration and induced a persistent functional improvement in distance run. Results suggest a potential new treatment option for improving the quality of life for boys with DMD."
https://openalex.org/W1982355483,"Statins exert pleiotropic, cholesterol-independent effects by reducing isoprenylation of monomeric GTPases. Here we examined whether statins also reduce isoprenylation of gamma-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins and thereby affect beta-adrenergic signaling and regulation of force in cardiac myocytes. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM) were treated with atorvastatin (0.1-10 micromol/l; 12-48 h) and examined for adenylyl cyclase regulating G-protein alpha- (Galpha), beta- (Gbeta), and gamma- (Ggamma) subunits and cAMP accumulation. Engineered heart tissue (EHT) from NRCM was used to evaluate contractile consequences. In atorvastatin-treated NRCM, a second band of Ggamma3 with a lower apparent molecular weight appeared in cytosol and particulate fractions that was absent in vehicle-treated NRCM, but also seen after GGTI-298, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor. In parallel, Gbeta accumulated in the cytosol and total cellular content of Galphas was reduced. In atorvastatin-treated NRCM, the cAMP-increasing effect of isoprenaline was reduced. Likewise, the positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline was desensitized and reduced after treatment with atorvastatin. The effects of atorvastatin were abolished by mevalonate and/or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate or squalene. Taken together, the results of this study show that atorvastatin desensitizes NRCM to beta-adrenergic stimulation by a mechanism that involves reduced isoprenylation of Ggamma and subsequent reductions in the cellular content of Galphas."
https://openalex.org/W2045591568,"Current efforts on expanding minimally invasive techniques into the realm of oncological surgery are hindered by lack of accurate visualization of tumor margins and failure to detect micro metastases in real time. We used a systemic delivery of a herpes viral vector with cancer-selective infection and replication to precisely differentiate between normal and malignant tissue. NV1066 is a genetically modified, replication-competent herpes simplex virus carrying a transgene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). We tested the potential of NV1066 in delineating tumor tissue in vitro and in vivo in a wide range of cancers and whether NV1066-induced GFP expression can detect small foci of tumors and metastases in in vivo models using an operating endoscope with fluorescent filters. Our findings indicate that NV1066 can be used for real-time intraoperative imaging and enhanced detection of early cancers and metastases. We demonstrate that a single dose of NV1066, administered either locally (intratumoral or intracavitary) or systemically, will detect loco-regional and distant disease throughout the body. Such cancer selectivity is confirmed in 110 types of cancer cells from 16 different primary organs. Fluorescence-aided minimally invasive endoscopy revealed microscopic tumor deposits unrecognized by conventional laparoscopy/thoracoscopy. Furthermore, NV1066 ability to transit and infect tumor and metastases is proven in syngenic and transplanted tumors in different animal models, both immunocompetent and immunodeficient. Cancer-selective GFP expression is confirmed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. These studies form the basis for real-time, intraoperative diagnostic imaging of tumor and metastases by minimally invasive endoscopic technology."

https://openalex.org/W2005705236,"The folding of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depends on a quality control mechanism mediated by the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. During this process, continuous glucose trimming and UDP-glucose-dependent re-glucosylation of unfolded glycoproteins takes place. To ensure proper folding, increases in misfolded proteins lead to up-regulation of the components involved in quality control through a process known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Reglucosylation is catalyzed by the ER lumenal located enzyme UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, but as UDP-glucose is synthesized in the cytosol, a UDP-glucose transporter is required in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. Even though such a transporter has been hypothesized, no protein playing this role in the ER yet has been identified. Here we provide evidence that AtUTr1, a UDP-galactose/glucose transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana, responds to stimuli that trigger the UPR increasing its expression around 9-fold. The accumulation of AtUTr1 transcript is accompanied by an increase in the level of the AtUTr1 protein. Moreover, subcellular localization studies indicate that AtUTr1 is localized in the ER of plant cells. We reasoned that an impairment in AtUTr1 expression should perturb the calnexin/calreticulin cycle leading to an increase in misfolded protein and triggering the UPR. Toward that end, we analyzed an AtUTr1 insertional mutant and found an up-regulation of the ER chaperones BiP and calnexin, suggesting that these plants may be constitutively activating the UPR.

Most of the proteins synthesized in the ER are glycoproteins that contain the oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. This structure is co-translationally transferred to the protein and immediately trimmed to GlcMan9GlcNAc2 (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

The chaperones calnexin and calreticulin bind this monoglucosylated form retaining the glycoprotein in the ER, facilitating its folding (4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). To release the protein from the chaperone, the glucose residue is removed by glucosidase II, and if the protein is correctly folded, it can exit the ER (2Trombetta S. Simons J. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5D′Alessio C. Fernández F. Trombetta S. Parodi A. J. Biol.

However, if the protein is misfolded, it is recognized by UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) and reglucosylated, thereby allowing its re-association with calnexin and calreticulin (6Fanchiotti S.

Therefore, UGGT plays an essential role in quality control by allowing the re-entry of the glycoprotein into the folding cycle. UGGT is located in the lumen of the ER and utilizes UDP-glucose as substrate. However, UDP-glucose is synthesized in the cytosol and needs to be translocated into the lumen. The protein involved in this process likely belongs to the family of nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs). Although several NSTs have been described in eukaryotes (10Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), most of them have been related to protein glycosylation and polysaccharide biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus and no NST involved in supplying the substrate for UGGT has yet been described. Under certain circumstances there is an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER which triggers a mechanism known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). During this process, the expression of a large set of genes, in particular chaperones involved in quality control, is induced (11Cox J. Chapman R. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 12Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Functional genomic analysis of the UPR in Arabidopsis thaliana showed an increase in the expression of genes related to protein folding, glycosylation, vesicle trafficking, and protein degradation (14Martínez I. Chrispeels M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 15Kamauchi S. Nakatani H. Nakano C. Urade R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3461-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The biggest group of up-regulated genes is ER chaperones such as BiP, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), calnexin, and calreticulin. Interestingly, microarray analysis showed that one of the up-regulated genes corresponded to AtUTr1, a nucleotide sugar transporter. Norambuena et al. (16Norambuena L. Marchant L. Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. Silva H. Orellana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32923-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) identified and characterized AtUTr1, a nucleotide sugar transporter from A. thaliana. Upon expression in yeast, AtUTr1 was able to transport UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, with the transport of UDP-glucose being 200 times higher than UDP-galactose. In addition, analysis of the AtUTr1 protein sequence shows a KKXX motif in the C terminus, a sequence that has been described as an ER retention signal for membrane proteins (17Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Based on these findings we hypothesized that AtUTr1 may be involved in quality control in the ER. To provide evidence supporting this hypothesis, we exposed Arabidopsis plants to a treatment that induced the UPR and then performed a quantitative analysis of the AtUTr1 transcript. The results showed an accumulation of both the AtUTr1 transcript and protein upon induction of the UPR. To analyze whether the location of this nucleotide sugar transporter was consistent with a role in quality control, its subcellular distribution was assessed using a GFP-tagged protein and immunodetection upon subcellular fractionation. The results of both approaches are consistent with an ER location of AtUTr1. Furthermore, if AtUTr1 plays a role in supplying the substrate to UGGT, a lack of its expression may perturb the calnexin/calreticulin cycle leading to an accumulation of misfolded protein and triggering the UPR. Toward this end we characterized an Arabidopsis insertional mutant in the AtUTr1 gene that shows less incorporation of UDP-glucose into ER vesicles and observed that the expression level of the chaperones BiP and calnexin are constitutively up-regulated, while the expression of other genes is not. Thus we propose that AtUTr1 is a UDP-glucose transporter that provides the substrate for UGGT, forming part of the quality control mechanism present at the ER. Plant Growth Condition—Sterile seeds of wild type and atutr1 mutant (ecotype Landsberg-erecta) were germinated in a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle at 23 °C in Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) containing 1% sucrose (w/v). For the UPR studies, plants were grown as described by Martínez and Chrispeels (14Martínez I. Chrispeels M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Seeds were germinated in 13 ml of liquid MS medium and cultured with gentle shaking for 6 days. The seedlings were treated for 5 h with or without 10 mm of dithiothreitol (DTT). For subcellular fractionation and RNA expression analysis, plants were grown in soil. Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration was performed in Nicotiana tabacum (Xanthi NN) leaves. Cloning of AtUTr1-GFP—AtUTr1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from the A. thaliana cDNA library pFL61 (American Type Culture Collection) using platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers flanking the coding region, designed from the genomic sequence. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-TCTAGGATCCTAATGGAGGTCCATGGCTCC-3′ containing a BamHI restriction site (underlined sequence). The reverse primer was 5′-AGGGAAGATCTCTCCACTCTTTTGCTTCTTCTT-3′ containing a BglII restriction site (underlined sequence) deleting the original stop codon. A unique amplification product of the expected size (1 kb) was obtained. The PCR product was sequenced and digested with BamHI and BglII. The DNA fragment was cloned in the plant expression vector pCD3–326 to generate pCD3–326 AtUTr1-GFP. The AtUTr1-GFP fusion was excised using BamHI and SacI and cloned in the binary vector pBEL-103.

Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 392-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method according to the manufacturer′s instructions (Pierce). The distribution of RGP and xyloglucan fucosyltransferase was determined by Western blot using 30 μg of protein separated by SDS-PAGE and transfered onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The immunoblot was performed using a polyclonal antisera raised against RGP or xyloglucan fucosyltransferase (kindly donated by K. Dhugga and W. D. Reiter, respectively) following standard procedures (25Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Edelstein S.J. Bollag D.M. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 184-197Google Scholar).

Immunodetection of AtUTr1—A synthetic peptide (YQIYLKWKKLQRVEKKKQKS) from the C-terminal sequence of AtUTr1 was synthesized by Bio-Synthesis Inc., coupled to Blue Carrier, and used to immunize rabbits. The antiserum obtained was purified using the synthetic peptide coupled to a cyanogen bromide-Sepharose-activated matrix (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The affinity-purified antibody was characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was able to detect in the Western blot a single band of the expected size. For Western blot analysis, 30 μg of proteins from subcellular fractions, or from plants treated with DTT, were denatured in Laemmli buffer at 60 °C for 20 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Actin was used as a control for protein loading in Western blot analysis. Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from plantlets and flowers was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis in an agarose gel containing formaldehyde and capillary transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences) using 10× SSC. Hybridization and all the other procedures were done as described by Orellana et al. (27Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A specific 32P-radiolabeled probe against AtUTr1 was prepared from the 3′-untranslated region by PCR. An AtUTr1 EST (APD06f05) kindly donated by E. Asamizu was used as template. The forward primer was 5′-CAAAAGAGCTCAAGTTTTTCCCTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TTTGGGTACCCCAAAATTCAAATC-3′. The DNA probes for BiP, calnexin, and AtUTr2 were generated by random priming of PCR fragments using an oligolabeling kit (Fermentas). The amplicons for BiP, calnexin, and AtUTr2 were produced using the following primers: BiP, 5′-ATGGCTCGCTCGTTTGGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGTTTCCTGTCCTTTTGAA-3-′ (reverse), calnexin, 5′-ATGAGACAACGGCAACTATT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCCTGAGGACGGAGGTACT-3′ (reverse); AtUTr2, 5′-CACATTTATCGGTCAAGTCTCCGTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGCAGGAGGCGATGGTGATAGAGAAGA-3′ (reverse). Real-time PCR—mRNA content for AtUTr1, calnexin, BiP, and AtUTr2 was quantified using the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostic). Real-time PCR reactions were run in 20 μl final volume and contained 50 ng of cDNA, 1× Master CYBR Green mix, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer. The primers used were the same described above. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA isolated from plants treated with or without 10 mm DTT. The absolute standard curves for each gene were generated by diluting the plasmid carrying the gene of interest from 10,000 to 0.01 pg. The threshold cycle number (CT) from each sample was referred to the absolute standard curve to estimate the content of the corresponding cDNA. The amount for each cDNA was normalized against the amount of the actin cDNA estimated on each sample. Experiments were performed in triplicate. AtUTr1 Mutant Identification and Characterization—A gene trap line containing a transposon insertion (Ds element) in the first exon of the AtUTr1 gene was identified from the Sundaresan collection (28Sundaresan V. Springer P. Volpe T. Haward S. Jones J.D. Dean C. Ma H. Martienssen R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 29Parinov S. Sevugan M. Ye D. Yang W. Kumaran M. Sundaresan V. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The seeds were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center. The Ds insertion was confirmed by PCR using primers for the AtUTr1 gene (5′-ATGCAAGATGCTCGAACC-3′) and the left border of the Ds element (5′-ACGGTCGGGAAACTAGCTCTAC-3′). For Southern blot analysis 4 μg of genomic DNA were digested using EcoRI, BglII, and HindIII. The fragments were fractionated by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel and then denaturated and neutralized. The hybridization was performed at 65 °C using an AtUTr1 or a GUS probe (cDNAs) radiolabeled by random priming oligolabeling kit (Fermentas). The genomic DNA was prepared as described by Silva et al. (30Silva H. Yoshioka D. Dooner H. Klessig D.F. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). UDP-glucose Uptake Assays in ER-derived Vesicles—ER vesicles were obtained as described above. For the uptake assays, 50 μg of protein corresponding to the ER vesicles from the wild type and atutr1 plants were incubated with 1 μm UDP-[3H]glucose (0.1 μCi) in a medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm MgCl2 (STM buffer) for 3 min. To stop the reaction, the vesicles were diluted in cold STM buffer and filtered through 0.7-μm glass fiber filters. Subsequently the filters were washed with 10 volumes of cold STM buffer and dried, and the radioactivity was determinated by liquid scintillation counting. Co-expression Analysis of AtUTr1, BiP, and Calnexin—The accession number for each gene (At2g02810, At5g42020, and At5g61790, respectively) was used to perform a co-expression analysis using the A. thaliana co-response data base module of CSB.DB. The matrix utilized contains all the genes analyzed for a set of abiotic stress experiments. The results are grouped automatically by function using the MAPMAN program. AtUTr1 Responds to the UPR—We analyzed the expression of the AtUTr1 gene in 6-day-old plants treated with DTT, a treatment that is known to trigger the UPR given its interference in the formation of disulfide bonds (31Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that plants treated with DTT increased the expression of AtUTr1 as well as the expression of the chaperones BiP and calnexin, two genes up-regulated under this treatment (32Denecke J. Goldamn M.H. Demolder J. Seurinck J. Botterman J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fontes E.B.P. Shank B.B. Wrobel R.L. Moose S.P. O'Brian G.R. Wurtzel E.T. Boston R.S. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The expression of actin showed no change, confirming that the treatment was specific. To obtain more accurate and quantitative information of the changes in AtUTr1 transcript levels caused by DTT, we performed real-time PCR analysis. The results of this experiment showed a 9-fold increase in the AtUTr1 transcript amount in plants exposed to DTT (Fig. 1B), confirming the result obtained by Northern analysis. To study whether the changes in transcript levels correlated with an increase in the accumulation of the protein, we performed Western blot analysis using an AtUTr1 peptide affinity-purified antibody. The results showed that seedlings treated with DTT had an increase in the amount of the AtUTr1 protein whereas actin levels did not change under these conditions (Fig. 1C). All these results strongly suggest that AtUTr1 is an UPR up-regulated gene. Expression of AtUTr1 Is Related to Genes Involved in Protein Folding—In plants grown under different conditions, the analysis of genes that show the same profile of expression as the AtUTr1 gene may provide information regarding the cellular processes in which they are involved. Using the data base module of CSB.DB (34Steinhauser D. Usadel B. Luedemann A. Thimm O. Kopka J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3647-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and genome chip expression profiles obtained from different plant growth condition (35Craigon D. James N. Okyere J. Higgins J. Jotham J. May S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 575-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a co-expression analysis was carried out. The results indicate that expression of AtUTr1 strongly correlates with the expression of BiP, calnexin, and other chaperones or proteins related to stress (data not shown). In addition, the largest set of genes co-expressing with AtUTr1, BiP, and calnexin at the same time correspond to proteins related to stress and redox regulation (Fig. 2). As a control, the expression of AtUTr2, a Golgi-localized UDP-galactose transporter (36Norambuena L. Nilo R. Handford M. Reyes F. Marchant L. Meisel. L. Orellana A. Planta. 2005; 222: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was analyzed. However, its expression pattern did not show any correlation with the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in protein folding (data not shown). AtUTr1 Is Localized at the Endoplasmic Reticulum—Since AtUTr1 transports UDP-glucose (16Norambuena L. Marchant L. Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. Silva H. Orellana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32923-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and responds to the UPR, we hypothesized that this protein could be in the ER. To investigate its subcellular location, we constructed a chimera by fusing the green fluorescent protein to the C terminus of AtUTr1. This chimeric protein was capable of incorporating UDP-galactose into microsomes from tobacco leaves infiltrated with AtUTr1-GFP, indicating that the fusion protein was functional. Since most of the nucleotide sugar transporters identified to date are localized in the Golgi apparatus, the distribution of AtUTr1-GFP expressed in epidermal cells of tobacco leaves was compared with the pattern of both ER and Golgi markers. The distribution of soluble GFP was also analyzed (Fig. 3A). The results showed that AtUTr1-GFP has a reticulated distribution (Fig. 3D), resembling that obtained for GFP-HDEL, an ER located protein (Fig. 3B). In contrast, GONST1-YFP, a Golgi-localized GDP-mannose transporter (18Baldwin T.C. Handford M.G. Yuseff M.I. Orellana A. Dupree P. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2283-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), showed a punctate pattern (Fig. 3C). The fluorescent dots were motile and sensitive to brefeldin A (data not shown). These results suggest that AtUTr1 is located at the ER and not at the Golgi apparatus. To confirm the localization of AtUTr1, we performed subcellular fractionation of Arabidopsis plants and analyzed the location of AtUTr1 using an affinity-purified peptide antibody raised against the C terminus of AtUTr1. Upon homogenization of the tissue, the organelles were separated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and fractions enriched both in ER and Golgi membranes were obtained. The signal detected by the antibody against AtUTr1 (Fig. 4A) showed the same distribution as the ER marker (Fig. 4C), distinct from the distribution of the two Golgi markers (Fig. 4B). These results, along with those obtained using the AtUTr1-GFP fusion protein, strongly suggest that AtUTr1 is indeed located at the ER. An AtUTr1 Insertional Mutant (atutr1) Shows Up-regulation of UPR-related Genes—If AtUTr1 provides the UDP-glucose required for the re-glucosylation of misfolded glycoproteins, the absence of AtUTr1 should produce an alteration in the normal folding process in the ER. Thus, an increase in misfolded proteins may occur, triggering the UPR. To investigate this hypothesis we searched for mutants in AtUTr1. A gene trap line containing an insertion of the Ds element in the AtUTr1 gene was characterized (Fig. 5A) (28Sundaresan V. Springer P. Volpe T. Haward S. Jones J.D. Dean C. Ma H. Martienssen R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 29Parinov S. Sevugan M. Ye D. Yang W. Kumaran M. Sundaresan V. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The analysis of this line using PCR indicated that the Ds insertion was in the first exon of the AtUTr1 gene. Southern analysis showed changes in the pattern of atutr1 genomic DNA digested with EcoRI, consistent with the insertion of the Ds element in this region (data shown as supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, PCR analysis and the observation that 100% of the plants obtained upon self-pollination were resistant to kanamycin, the selection marker, indicated that the AtUTr1 insertion line was homozygous (data not shown). The analysis of the number of insertions by Southern blot analysis, detecting the GUS gene present in the Ds element, revealed a single band indicating that a single insertion was present in atutr1 (data shown as supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, the F2 population obtained from the backcross showed that 72% of the plants were able to grow in kanamycin, whereas 28% of the plants were sensitive to the antibiotic. This segregation ratio, together with the molecular analysis indicated the presence of a single Ds insertion in the genome of atutr1. Northern blot analysis showed that AtUTr1 was not expressed in the atutr1 mutant (Fig. 5B). Finally, UDP-glucose uptake assays were performed in ER-derived vesicles obtained from wild type and atutr1 plants (Fig. 5C). The result showed that ER-derived vesicles obtained from atutr1 plants had a decreased uptake of UDP-glucose compared with the wild type. To test the hypothesis that the UPR could be activated in the atutr1 mutant, we analyzed the expression of BiP. Northern analysis showed that the BiP transcript was much more abundant in the atutr1 mutant whereas the level of the actin transcript or the UDP-galactose transporter AtUTr2 transcript was similar in wild-type and mutant plants (Fig. 6A). To quantify the magnitude of the changes in gene expression of chaperones involved in quality control, we carried out real-time PCR experiments. The results showed that BiP was 2.8-fold and calnexin 1.9-fold more abundant in the atutr1 mutant compared with the wild type plants (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the level of the AtUTr2 transcript was the same in both the mutant and the wild type. Thus, BiP and calnexin are overexpressed in the mutant, suggesting that atutr1 plants have the UPR constitutively activated. The results presented in this paper show that AtUTr1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is up-regulated under conditions that induce the UPR. In addition, an Arabidopsis mutant in the AtUTr1 gene exhibits a decreased incorporation of UDP-glucose into the ER and up-regulation of chaperones involved in quality control. This is the first report of a nucleotide sugar transporter located at the ER and linked to the UPR. Hence, we propose that AtUTr1 is a UDP-glucose transporter involved in quality control at the ER. Quality control of glycoproteins in the ER depends on their retention within the organelle by calnexin and calreticulin (recently revised (see Ref. 46Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar)). During this process glycoproteins undergo a continuous glucosylation/deglucosylation of the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide linked to asparragine. A key player in this process is UGGT, the enzyme that recognizes unfolded glycoproteins and transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide. The glucosylated glycoprotein is then retained by calnexin and calreticulin until glucosidase II cleaves off the glucose, releasing it from these lectins. If the released glycoprotein is not completely folded, UGGT adds glucose again to the oligosaccharide, maintaining this cycle until the glycoprotein is properly folded (37Sousa M. Ferrero-García M. Parodi A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Most of the members of the calnexin/calreticulin pathway have been characterized in Arabidopsis (38Boyce J. Coates D. Fricker M. Evans D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39Huang L. Frankling A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6560-6566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nelson D.E. Glaunsinger B. Bohnert H.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 41Boisson M. Gomord V. Audran C. Berger N. Dubreucq B. Granier F. Lerouge P. Faye L. Caboche M. Lepiniec M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1010-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) suggesting that the ER quality control process for glycoproteins may occur as in other eukaryotes. To date, no UGGT activity has been reported in plants. However, a gene showing high similarity to UGGT genes from other species exists in Arabidopsis suggesting that a functional ortholog may be present in this plant. UGGT is located in the lumen of the ER and uses UDP-glucose as substrate (7Fernández F. Trombetta S. Hellman U. Parodi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this nucleotide sugar is synthesized in the cytosol, so it has to be transferred into the ER lumen. Until now, no evidence has been provided for transport of UDP-glucose into the ER in plants. However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae transport of UDP-glucose has been measured (42Castro O. Chen L. Parodi A. Abeijon C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, ScHut1, a gene encoding for a UDP-galactose transporter located in the ER, has been identified in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, AtUTr1 and ScHut1 are orthologues. However, there is currently a lack of evidence for the presence of UGGT in S. cerevisiae, so it is likely that glycoproteins do not go through the calnexin/calreticulin cycle in this organism. Thus, ScHut1 may not play a role in quality control in this organism. In contrast, the calnexin/calreticulin cycle is active in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and a gene with 30–35% identity to ScHut1 is present in its genome. Curiously, a mutant in this gene (SpHut1) is unable to survive under stress conditions such as in a reducing environment. However, the precise function and subcellular localization of SpHut1 are unknown (43Nakanishi H. Nakayama K. Yokota A. Tachikawa H. Takahashi N. Jigami Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fact that AtUTr1 transports UDP-glucose and is located at the ER makes it a good candidate for being involved in the deliver of UDP-glucose during quality control of glycoproteins in the ER. In addition, the up-regulation of AtUTr1 in conditions that trigger the accumulation of misfolded proteins suggests that the influx of UDP-glucose into the ER is an important step in quality control. Moreover, it also suggests that the incorporation of this nucleotide sugar into the ER is limited by the transporter rather than the availability of substrate in the cytosol. Recent functional genomic studies using microarrays have indicated that AtUTr1 is up-regulated by the UPR along with several other genes (14Martínez I. Chrispeels M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 15Kamauchi S. Nakatani H. Nakano C. Urade R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3461-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, our quantitative analysis is in agreement with the microarray data. When we looked for regulatory motifs, we found that the AtUTr1 promotor region contains the cis element ERSE (endoplasmic reticulum stress element) CC-N12-CCACG, which is recognized by AtbZIP60, a transcription factor described as part of the transduction pathway involved in the ER stress response (44Iwata Y. Koizumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5280-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The functional genomic data available also helped us to provide additional evidence for the role of AtUTr1 in quality control. Thus, an analysis of gene co-response data, including the results of a number of microarray experiments aimed at pinpointing changes in gene expression upon abiotic stress, indicated that AtUTr1 co-expressed mainly with ER chaperones and genes related to stress. These results provide further support for AtUTr1 playing a role in the protein folding process in the ER. Additional evidence for the role of AtUTr1 in quality control came from our studies in the Arabidopsis insertional knock-out mutant. Since the results showed that atutr1 mutant plants incorporate less UDP-glucose into ER vesicles, we hypothesized that a decrease in the delivery of UDP-glucose into the ER lumen may alter the UGGT/calnexin-calreticulin cycle, leading to an accumulation of unfolded glycoproteins, resulting in activation of the UPR. The expression of both BiP and calnexin was up-regulated in the mutant, whereas the expression of AtUTr2, a UDP-galactose transporter located in the Golgi (36Norambuena L. Nilo R. Handford M. Reyes F. Marchant L. Meisel. L. Orellana A. Planta. 2005; 222: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was unaffected. The fact that the expression of both chaperones increases in the mutant strongly suggests that the absence of AtUTr1 produces a decrease in the influx of UDP-glucose into the ER, reducing the reglucosylation of glycoproteins and perturbing the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, leading to the triggering of the UPR. The lack of AtUTr1 seems to result in the constitutive activation of the UPR suggesting that these plants are continuously under stress. However, the AtUTr1 mutant did not show any visible morphological phenotype, even when the plants were grown under conditions such as reducing environment (DTT), darkness, high temperature, high concentration of sucrose, and osmotic stress (data not shown). These results suggest that Arabidopsis may have another ER-located NST supplying UDP-glucose into the ER, allowing the plant to cope with the lack of AtUTr1. Alternatively, an NST capable of transporting UDP-glucose may recycle from the Golgi into the ER, as has been shown for a UDP-galactose transporter (45Sprong H. Degroote S. Nilsson T. Kawakita M. Ishida M. Van der Sluijs P. Van Meer G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3482-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These possibilities may be alternatives to supply the substrates to UGGT and keep the plants growing apparently normal. Since AtUTr1 was described as a UDP-galactose/glucose transporter (16Norambuena L. Marchant L. Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. Silva H. Orellana A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32923-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we speculated whether its function is related only to protein folding or whether it is also able to transport UDP-galactose into the ER for galactosylation of glycoconjugates in vivo. However, as far as we are aware, no other glucosylation or galactosylation reactions take place in the ER in Arabidopsis. Therefore, despite its ability to transport UDP-galactose, we believe that the main role of AtUTr1 in plants is to provide UDP-glucose for UGGT.

Nectins have three Ig-like domains in the extracellular region, and the first one is essential in cell-cell adhesion and plays a central role in the interaction with the envelope glycoprotein D of several viruses. Five Nectin-like molecules (Necl-1 through -5) with similar domain structures to those of Nectins have been identified. Necl-1 is specifically expressed in neural tissue, has Ca2+-independent homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity, and plays an important role in the formation of synapses, axon bundles, and myelinated axons.

Nectins are a novel family of Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecules and comprise four members, termed Nectin-1 to Nectin-4 (2Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T.

All Nectins have an extracellular region of three Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail region (see Fig. 1) (2Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W.

Nectin-1 has been confirmed to serve as a receptor for all α-herpes viruses tested so far, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) 3The abbreviations used are: HSV, herpes simplex virus; Necl, nectin-like; Ig, immunoglobulin; TSLL1, TSLC1-like; EGS, ethyleneglycol bis-succinimidylsuccinate; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; mJAM, murine junctional adhesion molecule; MAGUK, the membrane-associated guanylate kinase; SeMet, seleno-methionyl; JAM1, Junctional adhesion molecule-1. type 1, HSV type 2, and pseudorabies virus, facilitating their entry and cell-cell spread (10Campadelli-Fiume G.

Furthermore, the V domain of Nectin-1 has been demonstrated to play a central role in the interaction with the envelope glycoprotein D of HSV, pseudorabies virus, and bovine herpes virus-1 (12Cocchi F.

Therefore, the V domain plays an essential role not only in homophilic and heterophilic trans-interactions but also in the process of virion entry (12Cocchi F. Lopez M. Menotti L. Aoubala M.

Five molecules with an extracellular region containing three Ig-like domains, one transmembrane region, and one cytoplasmic region have so far been identified and are called Nectin-like molecules (Necls) (Fig. 1) (2Takai Y.

They include Necl-1 (Necl-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3/IGSF4B), Necl-2 (Necl-2/IGSF4/RA175/SgIGSF/TSLC1/SynCAM1) (14Urase K. Soyama A. Fujita E. Momoi T.

Of these Necls, we focus here on Necl-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3/IGSF4B, from now on referred to as Necl-1. Necl-1 was first sequenced, cloned, and submitted to GenBank™ by our laboratory (accession no. AF062733 (human), in 1998; accession no. AF195662 (mouse), in 1999). TSLL1 was identified as a TSLC1-like gene (19Fukuhara H. Kuramochi M. Nobukuni T. Fukami T. Saino M. Maruyama T. Nomura S.

Kavalali E.T. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2002; 297: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Necl-1 shares Ca2+-independent homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with Necl-2, Nectin-1, and Nectin-3, but not with Necl-5 or Nectin-2 (21Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Itoh S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Ohtsuka T. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unlike the Nectins, Necl-1 does not bind afadin but instead binds membrane-associated guanylate kinase family members (MAGUK) that contain the L27 domain, including Dlg3, Pals2, and CASK (21Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Itoh S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Ohtsuka T. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RNA blot and in situ hybridization analysis showed that Necl-1 is specifically expressed in the nervous system, in a variety of brain regions, including the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus amygdala, olfactory bulb, and medulla (21Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Itoh S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Ohtsuka T. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It localizes at the contact sites between two axon terminals, between an axon terminal and an axonal shaft, and between an axon terminal and glia cell processes in the cerebellum. Necl-1 most likely forms homo-trans-dimers at these sites (21Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Itoh S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Ohtsuka T. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the peripheral myelinated nerve fibers, Necl-1 localizes at the contact sites between the cellular processes of Schwann cells at the nodes of Ranvier, where it most likely forms homo-trans-dimers (21Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Itoh S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Ohtsuka T. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, because Necl-1 localizes at the axonal plasma membrane covered with Schwann cell plasma membrane, Necl-1 may form hetero-trans-dimers with other cell adhesion molecules, which remain unknown, at these sites (21Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Itoh S. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Ohtsuka T. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1267-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To date, no crystal structure has been reported for any portion of any of Necls and Nectins. To shed more light on the structure and function of Necl-1, we have crystallized the V domain. Here we describe its structure to 2.4-Å resolution and compare it with other known adhesion molecules. The protein was crystallized as a dimer, and a dimeric form was also observed in solution by size-exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking experiments, suggesting the first Ig-like domain of Necl-1 is sufficient for the homophilic interaction. A mutation in Phe82 disrupted the formation of the dimer, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are very important for dimer formation and suggesting that Phe82 may act as a key residue in the adhesion activity of Necl-1. Based on the crystal structure and previous studies, we also propose a V to V model for homophilic adhesion of Necl-1 at synapses. These studies reveal the architecture of this important class of adhesion molecules and provide fundamental insight into trans-cellular recognition mediated by Necl-1. Protein Expression and Purification—The human necl-1 gene was identified from a large-scale sequencing of human brain. The identification of full-length human necl-1 cDNA in our laboratory has been described by Zhou and colleagues (22Zhou Y. Du G. Hu X. Yu S. Liu Y. Xu Y. Huang X. Liu J. Yin B. Fan M. Peng X. Qiang B. Yuan J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1669: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A fragment containing the coding sequence of Ig-like V domain (corresponding to residues 25-135) was generated by PCR and then cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET32a (Novagen) with a His tag at the N terminus. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and overexpressed. Bacterial cells were homogenized by sonication in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then loaded onto a nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid column (Qiagen), equilibrated with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then digested with 500 μg of thrombin protease for 16 h at 4 °C. The target protein was washed down and further applied to Resource Q anion-exchange chromatography columns and Superdex-200 size-exclusion (Amersham and Biosciences). The purified concentrated protein (25 mg ml-1) was stored in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, NaCl 100 mm at 193 K. The authenticity of the recombinant Ig-like V domain was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. The l-SeMet-labeled Ig-like V domain protein was also expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The cells were diluted with adaptive medium (20% LB medium, 80% M9 medium) and grown at 310 K to an A600 of 0.6-0.8. The cells were harvested and resuspended in M9 medium, transferred into restrictive medium (1% glucose), and then cultured to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 before inducement. l-SeMet at 60 mg liter-1; lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine at 100 mg liter-1; leucine, isoleucine, and valine at 50 mg liter-1; and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were added, and the incubation continued at 289 K for 20 h. The l-SeMet-labeled Ig-like domain protein was purified and stored under the same condition as the native protein. A point mutation in one site of interest was introduced by PCR. A mutant of Necl-1 Ig-like V domain (residues 25-135), in which residue Phe82 was substituted with Ser, was constructed. The mutant DNA construct was verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. There were no significant variations in expression levels or in purification patterns for the derivative in comparison to wild-type Necl-1 Ig-like V domain (residues 25-135). Gel-filtration Experiments—The molecular weights of both wild-type and mutant proteins were estimated by gel filtration. All gel-filtration experiments were performed using the same Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) with the same AKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences) under identical conditions, using 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, as an elution buffer, flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1, fraction size of 0.5 ml, sample volume of 1 ml, concentration of protein samples of 5 mg ml-1, and detection by absorbance at 280 nm. Chemical Cross-linking of the Ig-like V Domain Protein—The gelfiltration purified proteins (including wild-type and mutant proteins) were concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (5-kDa cut-off). Proteins were cross-linked with ethylene glycol bis-succinimidylsuccinate (EGS) (Sigma). The reactions were incubated for 2 h on ice at different concentrations of EGS, respectively (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm EGS), and quenched with 50 mm glycine. Cross-linked samples were analyzed under reducing conditions by 15% SDS-PAGE. Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein solutions of Ig-like V domain of Necl-1 and l-SeMet-labeled protein used for crystallization contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mg ml-1 protein. Crystals optimized for x-ray diffraction were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique with reservoir solution containing 4 m sodium formate. 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 200 μl of reservoir solution at 291 K. The SeMet derivative crystal was grown from the same conditions. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data for l-SeMet-labeled Ig-like V domain protein were collected using radiation of wave-lengths 0.9788, 0.9793, and 0.9700 Å on beamline 3W1A at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The crystal was flash-frozen, and data were collected at 100 K to 2.4-Å resolution using a MAR charge-coupled device detector. Data were indexed and integrated using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, part A. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and scaled and merged using SCALEPACK. The crystal belongs to space group C2221 with unit-cell parameters a = 77.1 Å, b = 77.5 Å, and c = 102.2 Å. The Matthews coefficient suggests the presence of two molecules in an asymmetric unit with an estimated solvent content of 47% (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). Structure Determination, Refinement, and Analysis—The Ig-like V domain structure was solved by the MAD technique using l-SeMet-labeled protein. The Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility data sets were sufficient to solve the phase problem and yielded clear experimental electron density maps. One selenium position was determined, and initial phases were calculated by the program SOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Following density modification by RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), the resulting electron density map was of sufficient quality that the entire model, with the exception of several residues at the termini, could be built. The program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) was used for manual rebuilding of the model, and further refinements by simulated annealing, energy minimization, B factor refinement, and water-picking were performed using crystallography NMR software (CNS) (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55744) Google Scholar). Comparison of three-dimensional structures was carried out using the DALI server (30Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Structure figures were created using the program MOLSCRIPT (31Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Structure of the Monomer—The structure of the N-terminal domain of Necl-1-(37-141) was solved by the MAD method (Table 1). It contains two β-sheets with a total of nine β-strands (Fig. 2), which classifies it as an Ig-like domain of the variable type (V-set) (32Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). The nine strands sequentially labeled A (Asp43-Val51), B (Thr55-Asp61), C (Leu70-Ser73), C′ (Leu80-Phe82), C″ (Lys85-Arg86), D (Ile93-Ser98), E (Glu102-Ile107), F (Gly116-Ile122), and G (Arg128-Leu137). A, G, F, C, C′, and C″ form one β-sheet, and B, D, and E form the other β-sheet. All strands are antiparallel, except the A strand and the C-terminal part of the G strand, which are parallel. A cysteine bridge from Cys60 to Cys120 connects the two sheets. A type II β-turn from Val51 to Gly54 connects the A strand and the B strand, and two type I β-turns from Asn90 to Ile93 and Thr99 to Glu102 connect the C″ and D strands, D and E strands, respectively. The loop between strand C and C′, residues Asp74 to Glu77, form a 310 helix. There is a 310 helix (Asp39-Gln42) extended at the N terminus that does not participate in β-sheet formation. Only one salt bridge (Arg92-Asp114) was observed in the monomer. The crystal structure confirms the prediction that Necl-1 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily.TABLE 1Data processing, MAD phasing and refinement statisticsData collection statisticsSpace groupC2221Unit cell (Å)a = 77.1, b = 77.5, c = 102.2Se-MetCrystalPeakEdgeRemoteWavelength (Å)0.97880.97930.9000Resolution (Å)50-2.4 (2.49-2.4)50-2.4 (2.49-2.4)50-2.4 (2.49-2.4)Unique reflections12,35212,34312,314Total reflections100,96190,77597,985Rsym (%)aRmerge = ∑h∑l|Iih-〈Ih〉|/∑h∑I〈Ih〉, where <Ih> is the mean of the observations Iih of reflection h.5.3 (18.9)5.4 (19.1)8.2 (35.3)Completeness (%)100 (100)100 (100)99.9 (98.6)<I>/<σ>36.4 (9.7)36.4 (9.3)19.2 (3.5)Phasing statisticsSe atoms found1 per monomer (total 4)Initial phasesResolution (Å)50-2.4Figure of merit (FOM)0.66Centric0.69Acentric0.66Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)50-2.4No. of reflections in working set23,098No. of protein atoms1,614No. of waters196Rwork/Rfree (%)bRwork = ∑(∥Fp(obs)|-|Fp(calc)∥)/∑|Fp(obs)|; Rfree = R factor for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations.22.7/27.4Average B factors (Å2)Chain AChain BProtein main chain21.722.2Protein side chain24.224.8Water29.8r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)0.009r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.6a Rmerge = ∑h∑l|Iih-〈Ih〉|/∑h∑I〈Ih〉, where <Ih> is the mean of the observations Iih of reflection h.b Rwork = ∑(∥Fp(obs)|-|Fp(calc)∥)/∑|Fp(obs)|; Rfree = R factor for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations. Open table in a new tab Structure of the Dimer and Its Formation—There are two monomers (molecule A and molecule B) in one asymmetric unit with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å for the 104 Cα atoms (Fig. 3A). Using the program SURFACE (33Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5345) Google Scholar, 34Chothia C. Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), we calculate the surface areas buried upon dimer formation as 1405 Å2 (702.5 Å2 per monomer). Further analysis revealed that two almost identical clusters of residues are responsible to the majority of the interactions at the dimer interface (Fig. 3B). The most prominent feature of the hydrophobic pocket consists of two anti-parallel aromatic rings of Phe82 from C′ β-strand, and the side chains of Lys85 from C″ β-strand of A, B molecules. Five other amino acid residues from A and B molecules are also involved in the hydrophobic interaction (Table 2 and Fig. 3B). These interactions are supported by eight hydrogen bonds between A and B molecules (Table 2 and Fig. 3B). The interaction interface is further stabilized by eight hydrogen bonds via water molecules (Table 2 and Fig. 3B). However, no salt bridge was observed in the dimer formation.TABLE 2Residues involved in dimer formationDirect hydrogen bonds in the A-B interfaceAtom from monomer AAtom from monomer BDistanceÅSerA68 OGArgB89 NH22.75GlnA71 OE1ThrB79 OG12.66GlnA71 NE2ThrB79 OG13.20ThrA79 OG1GlnB71 OE2.67ThrA79 OG1GlnB71 NE23.35AlaA76 OGlnB77 OE13.36PheA123 OArgB89 NH23.21PheA123 OArgB89 NE3.14Water-mediated hydrogen bondsAtom from monomer ADistanceWaterDistanceAtom from monomer BÅÅGlnA71 NE22.82S82.84ThrB79NThrA79 N2.85S222.82GlnB71 NE2ThrA79 N2.85S332.82GlnB71 NE2LysA85 NZ2.78S662.75PheB82 OAlaA87 O2.46S152.74PheB123 OArgA89 N2.77S682.97ThrB124 OThrA124 O2.79S852.94ArgB89 NThrA124 O2.53S1332.94ArgB89 N Open table in a new tab Analysis of these amino acid residues found that all these residues involved in dimer interaction are mainly located to the C-C′-C″-D β-strands and intervening loops in Necl1 V domain, except Ser68 is located in the B-C loop and Phe123, Thr124, and Met125 are located in the F-G loop (Figs. 3 and 4B). Two further experiments demonstrated that the V domain dimer is physiologically relevant: (i) the purified protein elutes at the expected molecular mass for a dimer (∼32 kDa) by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5A) and (ii) chemical cross-linking further demonstrated that the V domain of Necl-1 forms a dimer (Fig. 5B). Phe82 Is a Key Residue for the Dimerization of the Necl-1 V Domain—Analysis of the dimer suggests that hydrophobic interactions provide the crucial force to maintain the dimer form of the Necl-1 V domain (Fig. 4A) and that Phe82 should play an important role in the adhesive activity of Necl-1. To test our hypothesis, Phe82 was mutated to Ser. When the molecular size of the mutated protein was examined by gel filtration, the protein eluted as a monomer at ∼16 kDa. This is in contrast to the wild-type form, which elutes as a dimer at ∼32 kDa (Fig. 5A). This result was further confirmed by subsequent chemical cross-linking with EGS. From the chemical cross-linking experiments, the dimer bands were clearly seen for the wild-type protein, although a monomer band was also observed. In contrast, no dimer band could be observed for the Phe82 → Ser mutant even in high concentrations of cross-linker (Fig. 5B). We also observed an interesting phenomenon whereby the wild-type protein could form a dimer even without EGS, but the dimer was completely abolished when the sample was heated (Fig. 5B). These results strongly suggest that: (i) the Necl-1 V dimer can exist under physiological conditions; (ii) hydrophobic interactions are the main force to maintain the dimer formation; and (iii) Phe82 is a key residue for the dimerization of Necl-1 V domain. Necls and Nectins May Share Similar Cell-Cell Adhesive Mechanism—There is some disagreement regarding the classification of Necl-5/PVR/CD155 in previous studies. In the review by Takai and colleagues, Necl-5/PVR/CD155 was categorized in the Nectin-like family (2Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), whereas it was categorized in the Nectin family in other articles (35Reymond N. Imbert A.M. Devilard E. Fabre S.

However, our phylogenetic analysis showed that Necl-5/PVR/CD155 is closer to the Nectin family than the Nectin-like family (22Zhou Y. Du G. Hu X. Yu S. Liu Y. Xu Y. Huang X. Liu J. Yin B. Fan M. Peng X. Qiang B. Yuan J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1669: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but its cytoplasmic tail does not bind to afadin. Therefore, we propose that it may be more rational to re-categorize Necl-5/PVR/CD155 into a new subfamily, which we have tentatively designated Nectin-related molecules, based on their homology to Nectin molecules but inability to bind to afadin (22Zhou Y. Du G. Hu X. Yu S. Liu Y. Xu Y. Huang X. Liu J. Yin B. Fan M. Peng X. Qiang B. Yuan J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1669: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment shows that the full-length Necl-1of human and mouse share 87.3% identity at the amino acid level, and their V domains are almost identical except for the substitution of one Thr by Ser (Fig. 6A), which indicates the high conservation of Necl-1 in evolution. The V domains of different Necl-1 to Necl-4 share identities ranging from 36 to 65%. Residues involved in salt bridge formation (Arg92-Asp114)inthe monomer are completely conserved. Further analysis indicates that the majority of residues in the dimer interface are highly conserved in the V domains of different Necl members (Fig. 6B), which leads to the suggestion that these molecules form similar dimeric structu"
https://openalex.org/W1987007640,"Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (C-P4H) α-subunit is of regulatory importance in the assembling of C-P4H tetramers, which are necessary for the hydroxylation of procollagen chains. Change in collagen expression by hypoxia or iron diminishment is a significant issue in extracellular matrix remodeling. It was proposed that C-P4H-α (I) is regulated at the posttrancriptional level under these conditions. Here we report that the induction of C-P4H-α (I) in human fibrosarcoma cells HT1080 by the iron chelator 2,2-dipyridyl is predominantly caused by an enhancement of mRNA stability. This effect is mediated by an increased synthesis and binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A2/B1, which interacts with a (U)16 element located in the 3′-untranslated region of C-P4H-α (I) mRNA. Luciferase reporter gene assays depending on C-P4H-α (I) 3′-untranslated region and co-transfection with hnRNP-A2/B1 provide evidence that the (U)16 element is necessary and sufficient for posttranscriptional control of C-P4H-α (I) synthesis under the analyzed conditions. Further indication for the significance of hnRNP-A2/B1 in C-P4H-α (I) induction was obtained by micro array experiments. In a data set representing 686 independent physiological conditions, we found a significant positive correlation between hnRNP-A2/B1 and C-P4H-α (I) mRNAs. Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (C-P4H) α-subunit is of regulatory importance in the assembling of C-P4H tetramers, which are necessary for the hydroxylation of procollagen chains. Change in collagen expression by hypoxia or iron diminishment is a significant issue in extracellular matrix remodeling. It was proposed that C-P4H-α (I) is regulated at the posttrancriptional level under these conditions.

Collagen turnover is a central issue for maintaining of the extracellular matrix, which influences cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and migration, as well as extracellular matrix remodeling during growth, differentiation, morphogenesis, wound healing, and many pathologic states, such as fibrosis (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar).One of the most important factors in collagen synthesis is the collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which is necessary for proline hydroxylation of procollagen chains. The hydroxylation is required for correct folding of the triple-helical structure of procollagen molecules. The activity of C-P4H depends on Fe2+ ions, 2-oxoglutarate, oxygen, and ascorbic acid (2Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T.

The β-subunit is synthesized in large excess over the α-subunit and is identical to the enzyme and chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (4Myllyharju J.

In the recent past, it has become increasingly clear that the regulation of mRNA turnover can be a crucial step in the adaptation of gene expression to alterations of environmental conditions (8Wang Y.

Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S. Nicolin A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 356-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although the nonamer UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) has been proposed to form the optimal binding site for ARE-binding factors, a variety of AUUUA clusters and also oligo(U) tracts are targets (13Lagnado C.A.

In general, AREs are known as destabilizing elements controlling immediate early genes, but they do not act solely as mRNA destabilization determinants. The nature of ARE-binding proteins determines whether the mRNA stability is increased or decreased.In this study, we present data that C-P4H-α (I) mRNA is stabilized by interaction of RNA-binding proteins hnRNP-A2/B1 with a U(16) element within the 3′-UTR. mRNA stabilization by this phenomenon seems to be the key mechanism responsible for P4H induction under hypometabolic conditions caused by diminishment of Fe2+ ions by the iron chelator 2,2-dipyridyl.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and RNA/Protein Isolation—Human fibrosarcoma line HT1080 (ATCC, passages 16–21) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose; PAA Laboratories GmbH) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 15 mm Hepes, and 2 mmol/liter glutamine at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Before use in experiments, cells were maintained in a medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum for at least 24 h. Measurements started with the application of fresh medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum. For 2,2-dipyridyl (2,2-DP, Sigma) treatment, the iron chelator was dissolved in ethanol and supplemented to a final concentration of 100 μm 2,2-DP and 0.1% ethanol. Control cells were also supplemented with ethanol (0.1% final concentration). For RNA and protein isolation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. RNA was prepared using RNA-Bee (Biozol Diagnostica Vertrieb GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein extracts (10,000 × g supernatants, S10) were isolated using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics)).RT-PCR—Primers were designed to bridge at least one intron. PCR conditions were used as follows: 3 min 95 °C, cycles: 30 s 95 °C, 30 s annealing, 30 s 72 °C, final elongation for 2 min at 72 °C; 2.5 mm MgCl2. The primers were as follows: C-P4H-α (I), forward, 5′-CCACAGCAGAGGAATTACAG, reverse, 5′-ACACTAGCTCCAACTTCAGG; actin, forward, 5′-TGAAGTGGTACGTGGACATC, reverse, 5′-GTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGC; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward, 5′-CACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGAG, reverse, 5′-GCAGGAGGCATTGCTGAT; hnRNP-A2/B1, forward, 5′-GTTATGGAGGAGGAAGAGGA, reverse, 5′-CGTAGTTAGAAGGTTGCTGG.Western Blotting—Protein extracts (30 μg/sample) were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond™-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot transfer cell. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% BLOT-QuickBlocker (Chemicon). Following the blocking step, the membranes were incubated in 1% blocking solution containing a primary antibody (anti-C-P4H-α: Acris Antibodies GmbH, AF0210; anti-hnRNP-A2/B1: Acris Antibodies GmbH, BM4520) for 1.5 h. The membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween and incubated with an anti-mouse secondary-antibody (Promega) for 1 h. Bands were detected using the ChemiGlowTM West detection kit (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Membranes were stripped for 5 min with distilled water, 5–15 min with 0.2 m NaOH, and 5 min with distilled water and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody (Chemicon) to detect relative β-actin levels as loading control.mRNA Stability—To test mRNA stability, cells were incubated for 18 h with or without the iron chelator 2,2-dipyridyl (100 μm). Native cytosolic extracts were isolated using a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Nonidet P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mix) at 0–4 °C. Following the isolation step, the native extracts were incubated at room temperature up to 4 h. RNA was prepared using RNA-Bee (Biozol Diagnostica Vertrieb GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol and reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers. The estimation of mRNA concentration was performed by RT-PCR. To compare the RNA decay under control conditions and in the lack of iron ions, mRNA levels were adjusted to equal amounts at the starting point (0 h).C-P4H-α (I) UTR-dependent Reporter Gene Constructs—For reporter gene assays, the luciferase vector pGL3-promoter (Promega, constitutive SV40 promoter) was used. The vector-specific 5′- and 3′-UTRs of luciferase mRNA were replaced by the human C-P4H-α (I) UTRs (GenBank™ gi:63252885). The 5′-UTR of C-P4H-α (I) mRNA (133 nt) was cloned using the vector-specific HindIII (5′-end) and NcoI (3′-end) restriction sites and the 3′-UTR (999 nt, including the poly-A signal) using the vector-specific XbaI (5′-end) and BamHI (3′-end) restriction sites. These restriction sites were added to the UTR sequences by primer extension. 3′-UTR variants correspond to: 3′-A, first 500 nt of 3′-UTR; 3′-B, terminal 522 nt of 3′-UTR. Deletion of the U-rich element was performed by PCR technique. Modified vectors were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting vector constructs represent constitutively transcribed luciferase transcripts with or without the specific C-P4H-α (I) UTRs/UTR variants.C-P4H-α (I) UTR-dependent Reporter Gene Assays—HT1080 cells were cultured in 96-well plates (μClear Platte 96K, Greiner Bio-One GmbH) and were co-transfected with the firefly luciferase pGL3-promoter vector (Promega), as well as its transformed variants, and the Renilla-luciferase phRL-TK vector using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 h, the transfection medium was removed, and measurements started after the addition of fresh medium. Co-transfection with expression vectors encoding RNA-binding proteins (hnRNP-A2/B1, pReceiver-M02 vector, GeneCopoeiaTM, Inc., Ex F0171-M02; hnRNP-E1, pGS5 vector, gift from A. Ostareck-Lederer, Martin Luther University, Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Halle, Germany) was used in a ratio of 1:3 (firefly luciferase vector:hnRNP expression vector). Luciferase activity was detected using the Dual-GloTM luciferase assay system (Promega) and a luminometer (Labsystems Luminoscan RS) programmed with individual software (Luminoscan RII, Ralf Mrowka). The co-transfection with the Renilla-luciferase expression vector served as a control.RNA-Protein Interaction Studies—In vitro transcripts representing the 5′- or 3′ -UTR of C-P4H-α (I) mRNA were radioactively labeled using[α-32P]uridine-, [α-32P]cytosine-, [α-32P]adenine-, or [α-32P]guanosine-5′-triphosphate (800 Ci/mmol, MP Biomedicals Germany GmbH).UV Cross-linking Experiments—1–2 ng of [α-32P]U/C/A- or [α-32P]GTP-labeled in vitro transcripts representing 100,000 cpm were incubated with 35 μg of cytosolic protein extract for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, and 2 units/μl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) in the presence of rabbit rRNA (0.5 μg/μl). For competition assays, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled in vitro transcripts was added. Then the samples were exposed to UV light (255 nm, 1.6 J, UV-Stratalinker) on ice, treated with RNase A (30 μg/ml final concentration) and RNase T1 (750 units/ml final concentration) for 15 min at 37 °C, and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.mRNA Level Correlation Study—Normalized human mRNA expression levels for hnRNP-A2/B1 mRNA/C-P4H-α (I) mRNA were obtained from the Stanford Microarray data base as used in Stuart et al. (17Stuart J.M. Segal E. Koller D. Kim S.K. Science. 2003; 302: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar), which contains a collection of different independent investigations. The difference of the sum of all microarrays in the data base and the number of data points used for the correlation analysis in this study results from the fact that some entries for hnRNP-A2/B1 and C-P4H-α (I) were missing in the microarray data sets. Regression and correlation analysis was performed using the math module of the open source/GPL program xmgrace, and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level.Statistical Analysis—Autoradiographic signals were scanned and quantified using the Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Results appear as means, and in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, error bars represent the standard deviation (S.D.). Data were analyzed using the Student's t test, and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level.FIGURE 2Influence of 2,2-dipyridyl on C-P4H-α (I) mRNA stability.

Relative values were normalized to the influence of hnRNPs on the original pGL3-promoter vector. hnRNP-A2/B1 co-transfection leads to a significant increase in C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR-dependent luciferase activity (p < 0,01), and the influence is abolished by deletion of the U(16) element. hnRNP-E1 shows no significant influence on C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR-dependent luciferase activity, independently of whether the U(16) element is present or not. n = 8, **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSHuman HT1080 fibroblasts were treated with or without 100 μm 2,2-DP, and synthesis of P4H-α (I) was analyzed at the mRNA and protein level. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the lack of Fe2+ ions resulted in an ∼4-fold increase at the mRNA level and an ∼6.5-fold increase at the protein level after 18 h. The analysis of time-dependent C-P4H-α (I) mRNA decay confirmed that the elevated mRNA concentration was not only attributed to an increase at the transcriptional level but also to an enhanced mRNA stability (Fig. 2). The mRNA half-life time under control conditions is 1.9 h (±0.3 h, S.D.) but was elevated after 18 h of Fe2+ diminishment to 4.2 h (± 0.8 h, S.D.). The data indicated that in response to the lack of Fe 2+ ions, the C-P4H-α (I) mRNA stability increased about 2-fold. Interestingly, we did not observe an alteration in C-P4H-α (I) mRNA half-life time after 7 h of 2,2-DP treatment, indicating the requirements of trans-acting factors that have to be induced. However, the mRNA turnover of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 2B), C-P4H-β, or C-P4H-α (II) (data not shown) was not altered under the same conditions. To confirm the posttranscriptional regulation of C-P4H-α (I) expression, we performed UTR-dependent reporter gene assays (pGL3-promoter vector) in which the 5′- and/or 3′-UTR of luciferase mRNA were replaced by specific 5′- and 3′-UTRs of C-P4H-α (I) mRNA or by artificial 3′-UTR variants (for a schematic illustration, see Fig. 3A). The transcription rate is controlled by the constitutive SV40 promoter. Therefore, differences in luciferase activity depend only on posttranscriptional control, mediated by the UTRs, and involve mainly mRNA stability and translational efficiency.2,2-DP treatment neither changed luciferase activity resulting from the original pGL3-promoter vector (control) nor changed luciferase activity in the case when luciferase mRNA contains the C-P4H-α (I) 5′-UTR. By contrast, the C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR significantly enhanced luciferase activity (Fig. 3B), indicating a 3′-UTR-mediated posttranscriptional control. Interestingly, the combination of 5′- and 3′-UTR showed a significantly stronger increase in luciferase activity. This observation correlated with a higher increase at C-P4H-α (I) protein level when compared with the mRNA level after 18 h of 2,2-DP treatment. These data indicated the involvement of translational control in the adaptation of C-P4H-α (I) expression in response to Fe2+ diminishment. Polysomal gradient analyses, however, indicated that translational control is of minor importance (data not shown). Thus, the 3′-UTR-mediated posttranscriptional control in the lack of Fe2+ ions correlated mainly with an increased mRNA stability and is attributed to the 3′-terminal ∼500 nt of the 3′-UTR (called 3′-B, Fig. 3B). We concluded that the enhanced mRNA stability is attributed to a cis-element within the terminal half of the 3′-UTR.Further experiments concentrated on the investigation of C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR-protein interaction, with the aim to detect possible mRNA stabilization factors. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, UV cross-linking assays revealed that two 3′-UTR-binding proteins with a molecular mass of ∼36 and ∼38 kDa showed an increased binding behavior in response to 18 h of Fe2+ diminishment. These trans-acting factors were identified by affinity chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses as RNA-binding proteins hnRNP-A2 and hnRNP-B1. Both proteins represent splicing variants resulting from one gene. Western blotting analyses showed that the concentrations of both proteins were elevated under Fe2+ deficiency after 18 h (Fig. 5B), which correlated well with the increased binding seen in cross-linking experiments (Fig. 4A). The enhanced protein concentrations of the RNA-binding proteins hnRNP-A2 and -B1 can be attributed to an elevated mRNA concentration (Fig. 5A). We did not observe a significant increase in hnRNP-A2/B1 mRNA stability (data not shown), indicating that the induction of hnRNP-A2/B1 expression in response to Fe2+ diminishment is controlled mainly at the transcriptional level.FIGURE 4Interaction of 3′-UTR of C-P4H-α (I) mRNA with cytosolic proteins and identification of hnRNP-A2/B1 as 3′-UTR-binding proteins.

UV cross-linking signals depend on the direct interaction of trans-acting factors with cis-acting elements. The observed signal intensity depends on the quality and quantity of nucleotides involved in the RNA-protein interaction. The separate labeling of C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR transcripts with the four possible nucleotides [32P]U/C/A or [32P]GTP is an approach to get detailed information concerning which nucleotides are preferentially represented in the binding site. Such labeling experiments revealed that both hnRNP-A2 as well as hnRNP-B1 only interacted with uracil in the recognition element (Fig. 4B). There was no label transfer from C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR to hnRNP-A2/B1 proteins when the other possible nucleotides were used for the labeling reaction. From the UTR-dependent reporter gene assays, however, it was evident that only the 3′-terminal half of the 3′-UTR is responsible for mRNA stabilization. UV cross-linking competition assays in which non-labeled in vitro transcripts representing the first 500 nt of 3′-UTR (3′-A) or terminal 522 nt (3′-B) were added in an excess when compared with the radioactive labeled 3′-UTR showed that hnRNP-A2/B1 significantly interacted only with the 3′-terminal part of the 3′-UTR (Fig. 4C). Although both 3′-UTR parts contain several U(3–7) elements (see Fig. 7A, sequence), only the 3′-B part contains a U-rich element, which consists of a continuous stretch of 16 uridines (U(16) element). As shown by UTR-dependent reporter gene assays, the deletion of the 3′-UTR-located U(16) element significantly suppressed the posttranscriptional influence in response to the diminishment of Fe2+ ions by 2,2-dipyridyl (Fig. 6). These data confirm that the increased binding amount of hnRNP-A2/B1 to the 3′-UTR-located U(16) element is of crucial importance in the adaptation of C-P4H-α (I) gene expression under hypometabolic conditions, caused by the lack of Fe2+ ions.Furthermore, the influence of the trans-factors hnRNP-A2/B1 by interaction with the C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR U(16) cis-element on gene expression was demonstrated by UTR-dependent reporter gene assays. As shown in Fig. 7B, overexpression of hnRNP-A2/B1 lead to a significant increase in C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR-dependent luciferase activity. This influence was abolished by the deletion of the U(16) element. In contrast, another known RNA-binding protein, hnRNP-E1, did not alter C-P4H-α (I) 3′-UTR-mediated reporter gene activity, neither if the U(16) element was present nor if it was deleted.To test the hypothesis whether hnRNP-A2/B1 is also important as a regulatory factor under other physiological or pathophysiological conditions, we performed an hnRNP-A2/B1 mRNA/C-P4H-α (I) mRNA correlation study based on microarray"

A., and Serhan, C. N. (1997) Nature 389, 985–990). Here, we have identified and characterized a phosphatase that converts PSDP to PSMP. Unlike the related polyisoprenyl phosphate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), PSDP was not a substrate for type 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases. PSDP phosphatase activity was identified in activated human neutrophil (PMN) extracts and partially purified in the presence of Nonidet P-40 with gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. Peptide sequencing of a candidate phosphatase was consistent with phosphatidic acid phosphatase domain containing 2 (PPAPDC2), an uncharacterized protein that contains a lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase consensus motif. Recombinant PPAPDC2 displayed diphosphate phosphatase activity with a substrate preference for PSDP > FDP > phosphatidic acid. PPAPDC2 activity was independent of Mg2+ and optimal at pH 7.0 to 8.0. Incubation of [14C]FDP with recombinant human squalene synthase led to [14C]PSDP and [14C]squalene formation, and in the presence of PPAPDC2, [14C]PSMP was generated from [14C]PSDP. PPAPDC2 mRNA was detected in human PMN, and is widely expressed in human tissues. Together, these findings indicate that PPAPDC2 in human PMN is the first lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase identified for PSDP. Regulation of this activity of the enzyme may have important roles for PMN activation in innate immunity.

Nature. 2002; 420: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). In response to inflammatory stimuli, PMN target reactive oxygen species and granule enzymes to phagolysosomes for microbial killing or digestion of foreign materials (2Weissmann G. Smolen J.E. Korchak H.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Anomalous release of these potentially toxic agents often occurs, amplifying inflammation and leading to tissue injury, events that are implicated in a wide range of human diseases (3Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3865) Google Scholar). To prevent an overexuberant inflammatory response and limit damage to the host, PMN programs are tightly regulated with select bioactive lipids serving as endogenous anti-inflammatory signals (4Serhan C.N. Levy B.D. The Neutrophil.in: Cassatella M.A. 83. Karger, Basel2003: 115-145Google Scholar). It is now well appreciated that several enzymes of lipid metabolism also serve as signaling modules with their products acting as bioeffectors (5Futerman A.H. Hannun Y.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 6Newman J.W. Morisseau C. Harris T.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1558-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Polyisoprenyl phosphates, specifically the mevalonate-derived product presqualene diphosphate (PSDP), carry biological activity as an intracellular down-regulatory signal in human PMNs (7Levy B.D. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. Nature. 1997; 389: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PSDP directly inhibits phospholipase D (PLD) and leukocyte superoxide anion generation in vitro and in vivo (8Levy B.D. Fokin V.V. Clark J.M. Wakelam M.J. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Levy B.D. Hickey L. Morris A.J. Larvie M. Keledjian R. Petasis N.A. Bannenberg G. Serhan C.N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome were identified as a systemic inflammatory illness stemming from partial deletion of mevalonate kinase and subsequently decreased isoprenoid production (10Drenth J.P. van der Meer J.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1748-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 11Takada K. Aksentijevich I. Mahadevan V. Dean J.A. Kelley R.I. Kastner D.L. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Together, these observations indicate that in addition to their roles as structural elements in cholesterol biosynthesis, mevalonate-derived products can also display properties of lipid mediators in inflammation. Cell activation by receptor-mediated agonists leads to rapid and transient polyisoprenyl phosphate remodeling (7Levy B.D. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. Nature. 1997; 389: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Levy B.D. Fokin V.V. Clark J.M. Wakelam M.J. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PSDP is present in freshly isolated human PMN. When cells are activated, PSDP shifts from perinuclear to granule and microsomal subcellular domains, and within seconds is converted to its monophosphate form, presqualene monophosphate (PSMP) (7Levy B.D. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. Nature. 1997; 389: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Levy B.D. Serhan C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As an inhibitor of PLD and reactive oxygen species generation, PSMP is over 100-fold less potent than PSDP (8Levy B.D. Fokin V.V. Clark J.M. Wakelam M.J. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the presence of a regulated diphosphate phosphatase. Here, we report the identification of the first PSDP phosphatase in human PMN and characterize its biochemical properties. Materials—Phosphatidic acid (PA, C10:0) and diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP, C18:1) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and FDP from Sigma. Leukotriene B4 was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Plasmids encoding the LPPRP2 gene were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). Recombinant human phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase 2a (PAP2a), PAP2b, and PAP2c were generated as described in Ref. 13Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22059-22067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar. [14C]FDP (55 mCi/mmol, 50 μCi/ml) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). PSDP was isolated from healthy human PMNs as described (7Levy B.D. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. Nature. 1997; 389: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purification of PSDP Phosphatase Activity from PMN—Human PMN were isolated from whole blood as described (7Levy B.D. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. Nature. 1997; 389: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suspended (107 PMN/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1.6 mm CaCl2, warmed (5 min, 37 °C), and then activated with leukotriene B4 (100 nm, 60 s, 37 °C). Cells were suspended in iced 0.1 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.25 mm sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication (three 10-s pulses) with a Fisher model 100 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific) at full power. Unbroken cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Cellular materials in the supernatants were subjected to gel filtration with Sephacryl S200-HR (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The column (C10/40 (Amersham Biosciences), internal diameter 10 mm, length 40 cm) was eluted with 150 ml of Buffer A at 0.6 ml/min, and 3-ml fractions were collected. Materials eluting from the column were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm and screened for the ability to release phosphate from FDP. Eluted fractions containing phosphatase activity were combined. Enzymatically active materials in these fractions were concentrated by spin filtration with a 10-kDa limiting membrane (Centriplus YM-10, Amicon Bioseparations, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and applied to DEAE-Sepharose (DFF100, Sigma) for anion-exchange chromatography. The column (MT20 (Bio-Rad), internal diameter 15 mm, length 11.3 cm) was eluted at 1.0 ml/min for 10 ml with Buffer A and then an additional 40 ml with a linear KCl gradient (0–1.0 M) was constructed in Buffer A, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Eluents were screened for polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity. Fractions with PSDP phosphatase activity were combined, concentrated, and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE with 12% polyacrylamide. The gel was stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad), and protein in the expected Mr range was excised. After proteolytic digestion, sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility by microcapillary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ quadrapole ion trap mass spectrometer. Assay for Phosphatase Activity—Phosphatase activity was determined by phosphate release using malachite green reagent (Biomol Green kit, Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). Each reaction was performed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm EDTA (100 μl total volume). Materials were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Each reaction was stopped with 200 μl of malachite green reagent and incubated an additional 20 min (room temperature). Absorbance at 630 nm was measured with a 96-well microplate reader (μQuant, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, YT). Phosphatase Activity with Type 2 Lipid Phosphate Phosphatases—Sf21 cells were infected with baculovirus vectors containing recombinant PAP2a, PAP2b, and PAP2c at a viral multiplicity of 10 and harvested after 48 h as described in Ref. 13Roberts R.

Cells were suspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 80 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA and lysed by sonication (three 10-s pulses) with a Fisher model 100 Sonic Dismembrator at full power. Unbroken cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C). Membrane protein was then sedimented (10,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C) and the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at a concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml for analysis of enzyme activity. For phosphatase activity, PSDP, PA (C10:0), FDP, or DGPP (C18:1) (10 μm) were incubated with rhPAP2a, -2b, or -2c (5 μg). RT-PCR Analysis of Human PAP2a and Related Genes—Total RNA was extracted from PMN isolated from three healthy volunteers and HEK 293 cells. One nanogram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche), and PCR was performed with specific primers as follows: hPAP2A,5′-GCCCACATAAATGGATACGG-3′ and 5′-TCAACTGCAGCGATGGTTAC-3′; hPPAPDC2, 5′-AGACCAAAGACCACCAAACG-3′ and 5′-CCTACTTATCGCAGCCGTTC-3′; LPPRP1, 5′-AGATTCACAGGGGTGTTTGC-3′ and 5′-AGGCGGAGTAAATGCTCAGA-3′; LPPRP2, 5′-GAGTGCCTCCTGCTCTTGTC-3′ and 5′-AAGGAGTAGACCCCCAGGAA-3′; AK027568.1, 5′-CCTCCTGGACTACCTCACCA-3′ and 5′-GAGGTAGCCGATGACAAAGC-3′; β-ACTIN, 5′-GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG-3′ and 5′-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3′. GenBank™ accession numbers for lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 1 (LPPRP1), lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 2 (LPPRP2), PPAPDC2, unnamed protein product (AK027568.1), PAP2A and dolichyl pyrophosphate phosphatase 1 (DOLPP1) are AY304515.1, AY304516.1, BC038108, AK0 27568.1, AB000888, and BC033686.1, respectively. Expression of Recombinant PPAPDC2-His6 in Sf21 Cells—The human PPAPDC2 cDNA was generated by RT-PCR from human PMN, inserted into the EcoRI site of pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen, Palo Alto, CA) and verified by direct sequencing. A DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of the PPAPDC2 gene flanked by BamHI and XhoI was obtained by PCR (forward primer, 5′-AGTCCCGGATCCCGGAGGAGCATGGAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTCGAGTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGTCTAGATCGTTGACTCCACAGTAA-3′) with Pfu polymerase using a cDNA plasmid encoding PPAPDC2 as a template. To generate an additional His6 sequence at the carboxyl terminus of PPAPDC2, the reverse primer contained a 21-mer artificial sequence that codes His6 and a stop codon (indicated as underlined). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), ligated into the same restriction enzyme sites of pBacPAK9 baculovirus vector, and expressed in insect cells using the BacPAK® Baculovirus Expression System (Clontech, San Jose, CA). Sf21 cells were infected with a viral multiplicity of 5 and harvested after 72 h. Cells were suspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 80 mm KCl, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche), and lysed by sonication (three 10-s pulses). Unbroken cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Membrane protein was then sedimented (10,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C) and pellets were solubilized in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 80 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Partially purified enzyme was obtained through a Ni2+-charged column (Amersham Biosciences). For phosphatase activity, PSDP, PA (C10:0), FDP, or DGPP (C18:1) (10 μm) were incubated with rhPPAPDC2 (2 μg). Prior to select incubations, rhPPAPDC2 was boiled (20 min). Preparation of Recombinant Human Squalene Synthase—Human squalene synthase (SQS) cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR from human peripheral blood leukocytes using specific primers: 5′-ATAGAATTCATGGAGTTCGTGAAA-3′ and 5′-TATGTCGACTCAGTGTTCTCCAGT-3′ designed according to the GenBank accession number NM_004462. The truncated soluble form of human SQS was designed as described (14Thompson J.F. Danley D.E. Mazzalupo S. Milos P.M. Lira M.E. Harwood Jr., H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using primers: 5′-TAGAATTCATGGACCAGGACTCGC-3′ and 5′-TTCTCGAGATTCTGCGTCCGGATG-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pEt21a (Novagen, Nottingham, UK), and the insert was sequenced to verify the structure. Recombinant hSQS was isolated from 1 m isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced Escherichia coli (BL21 Star, Invitrogen) containing plasmid pEt21a-hSQS by freezing and thawing cell pellets in binding buffer (NaHPO4 20 mm (pH 7.8), NaCl 500 mm, imidazole 5 mm). After sonication and centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min), supernatants were loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Invitrogen). After equilibrating with wash buffer (20 mm NaHPO4, pH 6.0, 500 mm NaCl), His-tagged protein was eluted with stepwise increases in imidazole concentration (50, 200, 350, and 500 mm) in wash buffer. Recombinant hSQSts eluted at 350 mm imidazole was dialyzed overnight in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and stored in the presence of 50% glycerol at -80 °C. Squalene Synthesis Assay—Squalene synthase activity was determined in 100 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, [14C]FDP (0.25 μCi) in 23 μm FDP and 2 μg of rhSQS protein in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Some reactions were performed in the presence of 2 mm NADPH to promote PSDP conversion to squalene. For determination of polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity, PAP2a (5 μg) or PPAPDC2 (2 μg) were co-incubated with rhSQS (2 μg) in reaction buffer. Enzyme and substrate were incubated for up to 2 h at 37°C, after which the reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 1 m EDTA (pH 9.2) (15Gu P. Ishii Y. Spencer T.A. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12515-12525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture (10 μl) was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Silica Gel TLC plates (Fisher) were developed with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v). The radioactivity of each spot was visualized and quantified with a Bio-imaging analyzer (model 425E; Amersham Biosciences, with ImageQuant software version 3.2). After imaging, densitometry was performed using Scion Image software. RNA Dot Blot Hybridization of PPAPDC2 RNA—Hybridization of a 600-bp fragment encoding the open reading frame of PPAPDC2 to a human RNA multiple tissue expression array (MTE array, Clontech) was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used to generate the human PPAPDC2 probe were 5′-CCCTTATGAAGCTGCTGGAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GGCTGCTGGTTTAGGTTGAC-3′ (reverse primer). The identity of the probe was confirmed by direct sequencing. Statistical Analysis—Data were provided as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons of results were conducted by two-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Scheffe's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Activated PMNs display polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity by converting PSDP to PSMP (Fig. 1A), so freshly isolated human PMNs were exposed to leukotriene B4 (100 nm, 60s, 37 °C), lysed by sonication, and nuclei and remaining intact cells were pelleted. Supernatants were applied to Sephacryl S200-HR for gel filtration and 3-ml eluents were collected and assayed for polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity using FDP (see “Experimental Procedures”). We chose to screen the column fractions with FDP, because it is closely related to the structure of PSDP and quantities of PSDP were more limited. FDP phosphatase activity eluted with proteins of an estimated molecular mass of ∼35 kDa. To further purify the PMN proteins with PSDP phosphatase activity, we next pooled the catalytically active column fractions after gel filtration, concentrated the fractions by spin filtration with a 10-kDa limiting membrane, and then applied the materials to DEAE-Sepharose for anion-exchange chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). The column eluents were again screened for polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity with FDP and a broad peak of activity was identified over 5 separate 1-ml column fractions (Fig. 1B). For each fraction, we next compared FDP to PSDP phosphatase activity and determined that fractions from the leading edge (fractions 27 and 28) had significantly greater phosphatase activity for FDP than PSDP when assayed in parallel (Fig. 1C). In sharp contrast, fractions 31 and 32 from the trailing edge of the peak displayed a preference for PSDP as a substrate. The materials in fractions 27 and 28 and fractions 31 and 32 were combined, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and Coomassie Blue staining revealed a prominent band of protein at ∼35 kDa (Fig. 1D). Type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP2) isoenzymes are ∼35 kDa, involved in lipid signaling, and can dephosphorylate FDP (16Faulkner A. Chen X. Rush J. Horazdovsky B. Waechter C.J. Carman G.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14831-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether isoforms of PAP2 also displayed PSDP phosphatase activity, we first expressed human PAP2a and incubated recombinant protein (30 min, 37 °C) with PSDP, PA (C10:0), FDP, and DGPP (C18:1)(10 μm). We confirmed the ability of PAP2a to dephosphorylate a broad range of substrates, including PA, FDP, and DGPP (1.91 ± 0.45, 2.72 ± 0.7, and 3.17 ± 0.11 nmol/min/mg, respectively, Fig. 1E). In sharp contrast, phosphate release from PSDP was significantly less efficient (0.20 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg, p < 0.01). In separate experiments, rhPAP2b and rhPAP2c were also expressed and similar to PAP2a, these isoforms did not have significant phosphatase activity for PSDP (data not shown). These results indicated that PSDP, unlike shorter isoprenoid diphosphates, was not a substrate for type 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases. To identify the candidate PSDP phosphatase, enzymatically active materials for PSDP were extracted from the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1D). After proteolytic digestion, peptide sequencing uncovered a partial amino acid sequence, AGPSQSXXXXXXEXXR, that was found in phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 2 (PPAPDC2) (GenBank accession number BC038108), an uncharacterized but closely related protein to PAP2A (Fig. 2A). PPAPDC2 encodes a protein of 295 amino acids with an anticipated molecular mass of 31.5 kDa. The PPAPDC2 sequence displayed an overall 17% identity and 18% similarity to human PAP2A (Fig. 2A). Of note, PPAPDC2 had substantially greater homology with PAP2A in three conserved domains (C1, C2, and C3) that comprise a putative lipid phosphate phosphatase sequence motif, K(X)6RP-(X12–54)-PSGH-(X31–54)-SR(X)5H(X)3D (Fig. 2, A and B). This motif is shared among several yeast and mammalian lipid phosphate phosphatases (17Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Kyte-Doolittle analysis of the overall hydropathy profile of the protein predicted a structure for PPAPDC2 similar to PAP2a with six membrane-spanning domains in the encoded protein (data not shown). Because these structural features suggested that PPAPDC2 had the ability to serve as a new member of this class of enzymes, we next determined its relationship by evolutionary hierarchy to PAP2a and other proteins with elements of the conserved PAP2 phosphatase motif (Fig. 2C). The resulting phylogenetic tree suggested that PPAPDC2, like Dolpp1 (19Rush J.S. Cho S.K. Jiang S. Hofmann S.L. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45226-45234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), would have enzymatic properties distinct from PAP2 isoforms. Investigation of cellular extracts from human PMN and HEK 293 cells indicated that these diverse cell types both carried PSDP phosphatase activity, so we next determined which of the lipid phosphate phosphatases in Fig. 2C were expressed in both cell types. In addition to PAP2A, mRNA for only PPAPDC2 and LPPRP2 was detectable by RT-PCR in both cell types (Fig. 2D). Together, these findings indicated that PPAPDC2 was a candidate PSDP phosphatase. To investigate whether PPAPDC2 or LPPRP2 had PSDP phosphohydrolase activity, Sf21 cells were transfected with baculovirus vectors for expression of recombinant protein. In membrane fractions with rhPPAPDC2, a band with an apparent molecular mass of 31.5 kDa was specifically detected, and the enzyme was partially purified (>90%) with a Ni2+-charged column (Fig. 3A). Recombinant LPPRP2 was similarly expressed and purified (data not shown). PSDP phosphatase activity for PPAPDC2 was dependent on substrate concentration (Fig. 3B). No PSDP phosphatase activity was present with rhLPPRP2 (data not shown). PPAPDC2 demonstrated a marked substrate preference for PSDP over PA (C10:0) (Fig. 3, B and C). In these reactions, PPAPDC2 exhibited ∼5-fold more phosphate release from PSDP than equimolar amounts (10 μm) of the other substrates tested with a rank order of PSDP > FDP > PA > DGPP (Fig. 3C). This structure-activity relationship for PPAPDC2 is in sharp contrast to that observed with rhPAP2a (Fig. 1E). We next examined the effect of pH, divalent cations, and detergent on PPAPDC2 phosphatase activity. The impact of pH on PSDP phosphatase activity was determined at equimolar concentrations of PSDP (10 μm) (Fig. 4A). PPAPDC2 exhibited a pH optimum between 7.0 and 8.0, so activity was routinely measured at pH 7.4. We also determined the impact of divalent cations on PPAPDC2 activity. PSDP phosphatase activity was independent of Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ concentrations between 1 and 10 mm (data not shown). When PSDP phosphatase activity was determined with PPAPDC2 in the presence of 0.1–1% Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles, the activity was maximal at 0.1% Triton X-100 (data not shown). Experiments using other detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and β-octyl glucoside, at concentrations of 0.1–1% were also performed, but none proved superior to 0.1% Triton X-100. Squalene synthase catalyzes the head-to-head condensation of two molecules of FDP to generate PSDP as a biosynthetic intermediate in the two-step conversion of FDP to squalene (20Rilling H.C. Poulter C.D. Epstein W.W. Larsen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 1783-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether PPAPDC2 converted PSDP to PSMP and/or its primary alcohol, presqualene alcohol, we utilized [14C]PSDP that was generated in vitro by rhSQS and tracked the metabolic fate of FDP and PSDP by phosphorimaging after thin layer chromatography. Incubation of [14C]FDP with rhSQS (2 μg) and NADPH (2 mm) led to [14C]PSDP and [14C]squalene biosynthesis. In the presence of rhPPAPDC2 (2 μg), [14C]PSDP was converted to both [14C]PSMP (3.1 nmol of PSMP/min/mg) and [14C]squalene (Fig. 4, B and 4C) with 15.4 ± 1.2% conversion of PSDP to PSMP and 46.9 ± 5.1% of PSDP conversion to squalene (n = 4, Fig. 4B). No presqualene alcohol was detected up to 120 min. The time-dependent conversion of PSDP to PSMP gave a two-parameter hyperbolic relationship (y = (1.5(x))/(116.8 + x), r2 = 0.998, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4C). In addition, PPAPDC2 also catalyzed FDP dephosphorylation to FMP (10.1 ± 1.9%, n = 4, Fig. 4B), but displayed a significantly increased preference for PSDP as a substrate (p < 0.05, n = 4). No farnesol was detected. Together, these in vitro results indicated that rhPPAPDC2 was a polyisoprenyl phosphate diphosphate phosphatase and that, in vitro, PSDP generated by rhSQS was also available, despite its intimate relationship with this enzyme, for interactions with other proteins and conversion to products (i.e. PSMP) other than squalene. To determine the impact of PPAPDC2 and PAP2a on polyisoprenyl phosphate remodeling, co-incubations of the enzymes were performed with rhSQS in the presence of [14C]FDP. Recombinant hSQS generated PSDP (Fig. 5A, lane 2), but required NADPH for conversion to squalene with ∼5 and 2% conversion of FDP to PSDP and squalene, respectively, after 120 min (37 °C) (Fig. 5A, lane 3). In these incubations, rhSQS converted ∼40% of PSDP to squalene. PSMP formation was dependent on the presence of rhPPAPDC2 and independent of NADPH (lanes 4 and 5). When both rhSQS and PPAPDC2 were present (lane 5), PSDP formation increased (9.8 to 17.7% conversion from FDP). Of note, the rate of squalene generation from PSDP (38.5%) was without significant change from incubations with rhSQS alone (36.9%) (lane 3). Neither boiled rhPPAPDC2 (lane 6) nor intact rhPAP2a (lane 7) converted PSDP to PSMP. Co-incubation of rhPAP2a and rhSQS markedly enhanced formation of FMP from FDP (24.6%) and in addition, rhPAP2a dephosphorylated FMP to generate farnesol (lanes 7 and 8). Because the amounts of FDP present in these incubations exceeded the rate-limiting concentrations for both rhSQS and rhPAP2a, their co-incubation did not significantly affect the rates of PSDP or squalene synthesis (lane 7). Although PSDP was generated by rhSQS, no PSMP was detected in the presence of PAP2a. In the absence of rhSQS, PAP2a converted FDP to FMP (18.3%) and farnesol (5.0%) without formation of PSDP, PSMP, or squalene (lane 8). Together, these findings confirmed that PPAPDC2 was a polyisoprenyl phosphate diphosphate phosphatase (Fig. 5B), and that PAP2a did not utilize PSDP as a substrate. In addition, PAP2a also differs in its biochemical properties from PPAPDC2 in its ability to dephosphorylate both polyisoprenyl diphosphates and monophosphates. To determine the pattern of expression for PPAPDC2 mRNA, we performed RNA blot hybridization with a human tissue RNA expression array. In addition to human PMN and HEK 293 cells, PPAPDC2 was also expressed in most organs, in particular gastrointestinal organs, spleen, placenta, k"

Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) regulate the dephosphorylation of lipid phosphates, thus modulating their signals and producing new bioactive compounds both at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments. Knock-down of endogenous LPP2 in fibroblasts delayed cyclin A accumulation and entry into S-phase of the cell cycle. Conversely, overexpression of LPP2, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, caused premature S-phase entry, accompanied by premature cyclin A accumulation. At high passage, many LPP2 overexpressing cells arrested in G2/M and the rate of proliferation declined severely. This was accompanied by changes in proteins and lipids characteristic of senescence. Additionally, arrested LPP2 cells contained decreased lysophosphatidate concentrations and increased ceramide. These effects of LPP2 activity were not reproduced by overexpression or knock-down of LPP1 or LPP3.

The lipid phosphates, lysophosphatidate (LPA) 4The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; C1P, ceramide 1-phosphate; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LPP, lipid phosphate phosphatase (also known as phosphatidate phosphohydrolase-2); MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PA, phosphatidic acid; RT, reverse transcription; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are present in biological fluids and activate cells through families of four G-protein-coupled receptors for LPA and five receptors for S1P (1Radeff-Huang J. Seasholtz T.M. Matteo R.J. Brown J. Heller J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These receptors are coupled through Gαi that decreases cAMP concentrations; G12/13 that stimulates phospholipase D and Rho leading to stress fiber formation; and Gq that activates phospholipase C, Ca2+ transients, and protein kinase C isoforms (1Radeff-Huang J. Seasholtz T.M. Matteo R.J. Brown J. Heller J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). LPA and S1P receptors also transactivate epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (2Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Intracellular lipid phosphates also act as signaling molecules. For example, PA stimulates NADPH oxidase, protein kinase C-ζ, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, phospholipase C-γ, and sphingosine kinase-1, increases Ras-GTP and inhibits protein phosphatase-1 (4Jones J.A.

Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) and PA stimulates stress fiber formation (8Ha K.S. Exton J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The relative concentrations of LPA and PA in biological membranes control their curvature and vesicle budding (9Huijbregts R.P. Topalof L. Bankaitis V.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). C1P is the sphingolipid analogue of PA and is thought to be involved in synaptic vesicle movement and transport (10Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is formed during neutrophil phagocytosis and it is involved in liposome fusion (11Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33203-33209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). C1P binds to and activates cytosolic phospholipase A2, thereby increasing arachidonate and prostaglandin E2 production (12Pettus B.J. Bielawsa A. Subramanian P. Wijesinghe D.S. Maceyka M. Leslie C.C.

C1P also blocks activation of apoptosis in macrophages by inhibiting acidic sphingomyelinase activity (13Gomez-Munoz A. Kong J.Y. Salh B. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 99-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Intracellular LPA can signal through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ receptor (14McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St. Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38875-38883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Intracellular S1P stimulates ERK giving a mitogenic or anti-apoptotic response, it mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ and increases actin stress fiber formation (16Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Stunff H.L. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 882-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) are a family of enzymes that de-phosphorylate S1P, LPA, PA, and C1P, thus modulating their signaling (4Jones J.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15530-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such actions may also generate new signals through the dephosphorylated products sphingosine, diacylglycerol, and ceramide. There are three major isoforms of LPP, each containing six transmembrane spanning domains, an N-glycosylation site, which is not required for activity, and three conserved domains constituting a phosphatase active site (5Brindley D.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When the LPPs are expressed in the plasma membrane, the active site faces the extracellular matrix, thereby allowing LPPs to dephosphorylate external lipid phosphates. This orientation confers the potential to regulate the concentrations of extracellular LPA and S1P and possibly attenuate signaling through their respective receptors (18Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Zhang Q.X.

Additionally, the extracellular activity of the LPPs promotes the uptake of dephosphorylated products of lipid phosphates, which has been shown to regulate cell movement and survival (21Roberts R.Z. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Renault A.D. Sigal J.Y. Morris A.J. Lehmann R. Science. 2004; 305: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The LPPs are also expressed in intracellular membranes, and they can modify intracellular PA and DAG levels and perturb signaling downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors, including thrombin receptors (6Long J.S.

Pyne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Animal models have demonstrated that LPPs play important roles in regulating development, cell migration, tumor progression, and blood vessel formation (5Brindley D.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 900-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Renault A.D. Sigal J.Y. Morris A.J. Lehmann R. Science. 2004; 305: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although each LPP isoform can have a distinct physiological impact, the specific target lipids and functions of the different isoforms are not well defined. LPP2 has a much more restricted distribution in organs than LPP1 and LPP3. LPP2 is therefore likely to have an isoform-specific biological function in tissues in which it is highly expressed compared with the other isoforms, such as in colon, pancreas, and ovary (24Sigal Y.J. McDermott M.I. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present work arose from our observations that overexpressing LPP2 in fibroblasts produced a very different phenotype of cell proliferation compared with the overexpression of LPP1 or LPP3. Increasing LPP2 activity in rat2 fibroblasts caused a premature entry into S-phase associated with premature cyclin A expression. Conversely, knocking down endogenous LPP2 expression delayed S-phase entry associated with delayed cyclin A expression. The effects of LPP2 required its catalytic activity, and were not mimicked by increasing or decreasing LPP1 or LPP3 activity. Fibroblasts that stably overexpressed LPP2, but not LPP1 or LPP3, eventually arrested in G2/M after 20 passages and exhibited changes in the concentration of proteins and lipids that are characteristic of senescence. This work describes a novel, isoform-specific function of LPP2 that regulates cell cycle progression. Cloning and Expression of LPPs—Rat2 cells and Bosc 31 packaging cells were described previously (18Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). cDNA for human LPP2, a gift from Dr. A. Morris (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), or cDNA for rat LPP3 or mouse LPP1, were subcloned into the pBabePuro (pBP) expression vector. PCR was used to add a GFP tag to the C terminus of LPP2 and to create an R214K mutation. The pBP constructs were transiently transfected into retroviral Bosc 31 packaging cells and virion-containing media were used to infect rat2 fibroblasts. Mixed populations of transduced cells were selected by puromycin resistance (18Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged human LPP2 and myc-tagged mouse LPP1 driven by a cyto-megalovirus promoter were transferred into an adenovirus-packing cell line using the AdEasy® vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant plasmids were linearized and propagated in HEK 293 cells, and high-titer purified preparations (1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml) were generated by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core. For adenoviral transfections, multiplicity of infection 12 plaque-forming units/cell for myc-LPP1 or multiplicity of infection 100 plaque-forming units/cell for LPP2-GFP were added to cells in antibiotic-free media for 24 h. Cell Culture—Rat2 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Medicorp Inc., Montreal, PQ, Canada) and an antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (penicillin/streptomycin/amphoterecin B) (Invitrogen) at 5% CO2, 95% humidity, and 37 °C. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated on coverslips coated with fibronectin (Sigma). Cells were fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized, blocked in 4% nonfat milk and 0.6% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (25Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 12: 3601-3617Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted with Prolong® antifade mounting media (Invitrogen). Fluorescence was viewed on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope using a pinhole of 1 Airy unit and co-localization was determined using LSM5 Software (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Goat polyclonal anti-GFP from Dr. L. Berthiaume (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada) was diluted to 1:200. Mouse anti-early endosome antigen-1 from BD Biosciences (E41120) was diluted 1:200. Rabbit anti-caveolin-1 from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA) (06-591) was diluted 1:100. Secondary chicken anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor®594 (A-21442), chicken anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (A-21201), and chicken anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488(A-21467) from Invitrogen were diluted 1:500. siRNA Transfection—Double-stranded SMARTpool® siRNAs targeting rat LPP1, rat LPP2, rat LPP3, cyclophilin B, and non-targeting controls were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was used at 0.625 μg/ml according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final concentration of siRNAs was 200 nm. Controls for the knock-downs were performed with cyclophilin B, non-targeting control siRNAs, and lipofectamine alone. It was determined experimentally that maximum knock-down was achieved at and remained constant between 40 and 72 h post-transfection. The transfection efficiency for the introduction of siRNA was about 90%, as evaluated by the number of fluorescent cells transfected with siGLO, divided by the number of nuclei stained with Hoescht 33258 or phase-contrast microscopy (results not shown). For cell cycle analysis, transfection was performed in antibiotic-free media containing serum, and media were changed 6 h after transfection. After a further 18 h of transfection, cells were treated with serum-free media for 20 h before the re-addition of serum to promote cell cycle progression. Lysates were collected for real time RT-PCR at 12 h after the addition of serum in each experiment to determine the extent of knock-down achieved at approximately the point of S-phase entry. Real-time RT-PCR—RNA was collected using the RNAaqueous kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's directions. Contaminating DNA was removed using the DNA-free kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA was quantitated spectro-photometrically at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript II (Invitrogen), random primers (Invitrogen), and RNAout (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Negative controls lacking RNA or RT were performed with each reverse transcription reaction. PCR was performed on an Icycler (Bio-Rad). Each reaction contained 0.2 μm each primer, ∼100 ng of cDNA from the reverse transcription reaction, and SYBR Green® PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Standard curves were generated for each primer pair and the slope and efficiency calculated from the curves were used to determine target RNA levels relative to the housekeeping gene cyclophilin A. Melting curves were performed with each analysis to determine product specificity, and amplified products were run out in 2% agarose to confirm the presence of a single band. An annealing temperature of 57 °C was used for all primer pairs. Primers for PCR were as follows: LPP2 forward, TGGCCAAGTACATGATTGG and reverse, AGCAGCCGTGCCCACTTCC; LPP1 forward, GGTCAAAAATCAACTGCAG and reverse, TGGCTTGAAGATAAAGTGC; LPP3 forward, CCCGGCGCTCAACAACAACC and reverse, TCTCGATGATGAGGAAGGG; and mouse cyclophilin A forward, CACCGTGTTCTTCGACATCAC and reverse, CCAGTGCTCAGAGCTCGAAAG. Primers for the LPPs were designed to recognize human, mouse, and rat sequences. Measurement of Lipid Phosphatase Activity—Lysates were collected in 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Samples were assayed for protein with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad), and for the formation of diacylglycerol from 3H-labeled PA (17Stunff H.L. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 882-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For measurements of ecto-activity, medium containing 10 μm [32P]LPA or 5 μm [32P]S1P was added for 30 min. Media were collected and 32Pi was extracted (17Stunff H.L. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 882-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Analyses of Proliferation and Apoptosis—Cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/dish and grown for 8 days, with fresh media added each day. Under these conditions, cells proliferated exponentially for 2-3 days before encountering contact inhibition, irrespective of passage number. Cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline, trypsinized, resuspended in growth media, and counted on a hemocytometer. Parallel determinations of protein and DNA content were performed in some cases using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Bio-Rad) and Hoechst staining in a 96-well plate (26Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Bioch. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar), respectively. For measurement of apoptosis, cells were fixed with buffered 4% formaldehyde and stained with 500 ng/ml Hoechst 33258. Apoptotic cells were quantitated by counting condensed and/or fragmented nuclei versus evenly stained nuclei (27Song M.-S. Posse de Chaves E.I. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 1130-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were synchronized by starvation in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 0.6% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and released after 24 h by adding Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS. Cells synchronized by trypsinization exhibited the same phenotype (results not shown). Nocodazole and double thymidine block techniques were not used because of their inability to produce adequate cell cycle arrest or re-entry in the rat2 cell line. We used flow cytometry to measure the cell cycle distribution of control and LPP2 overexpressing cells during serum starvation to ensure that the cells were arrested in G1 to a similar extent. Control and LPP2 overexpressing cells had ∼70% of cells in G1-phase, 20% in S-phase, and 10% in G2/M-phase prior to starvation. After 9 h of starvation, both control and LPP2 overexpressing cells contained 85% of cells in G1-phase, 5% in S-phase, and 10% in G2/M-phase. After 24 h of starvation both cell lines had 94% of cells in G1-phase, 2% of cells in S-phase, and 4% of cells in G2/M-phase. The cell cycle distribution was maintained for an additional 24 h of starvation in both control and LPP2 overexpressing cells. Additionally, Western blots demonstrated equivalent levels of all cyclins in control and LPP2 overexpressing cells after 24 h of starvation. At specific times after serum stimulation, cells were harvested and suspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in Vindelov's reagent (0.01 m Tris base, 10 mm NaCl, 700 units of RNase I, 7.5 × 10-5 m propidium iodide (Sigma), 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cellquest software. A minimum of 20,000 cells were gated based on forward scatter versus side scatter and area versus width to exclude doublets, polyploids, and cell fragments. Modfit Lt. Software (Verity Software House, Inc.) was used to quantitate G1, S, and G2/M peaks. For determination of apoptosis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol for 18 h and stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide. The subdiploid peak was quantitated using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting—Identical amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in Odyssey® blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and incubated in primary antibodies and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were scanned on the Odyssey® Imager (Li-Cor) at 700 nm for anti-mouse and 800 nm for anti-rabbit IgG and quantitated using Odyssey® software. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were: sc-751, anti-cyclin A, 1:200; sc-181, anti-cyclin D2, 1:200; sc-528, anti-p27, 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-cdc2 (Tyr15), 1:1000; 9284S anti-phospho-p53 (Ser15), 1:1000 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, 9111S); and anti-cyclin D1, 1:200 (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-137). Mouse monoclonal antibodies were: sc-6283 anti-cyclin D3, 1:200; sc-6246 anti-p21, 1:500; and sc-245 anti-cyclin B1, 1:200 (Santa Cruz). Anti-LPP2 antibodies were from a gift from Dr. S. Pyne (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland, UK), and purchased from Exalpha Biologicals, Inc. (Watertown, MA). Rabbit anti-mLPP1 antibody was produced as described previously (18Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were: Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG, A-21057 (Invitrogen), 1:10,000; and IRDye 800 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Philadelphia, PA), 1:10,000. Immunoprecipitation and Cyclin-dependent Kinase-1 (CDK1) Kinase Assay—Lysates from cells overexpressing GFP alone or LPP2-GFP were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP (Santa Cruz, B-2) at 1:100 for anti-LPP2 or anti-LPP1 Western blots or with anti-CDK1 (Cell Signaling), at 1:200 for CDK1 kinase measurements. Prior to kinase assay, beads were washed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) and then in kinase buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). Precipitates were incubated in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of histone H1, 50 pmol of ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding gel loading buffer and products were separated on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated substrate was visualized on a phosphorimager and the bands were cut and quantitated in a scintillation counter. Lipid Determinations—The LPA assay was performed as described previously (29Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mass spectrometric analysis, methanol extracts were combined with internal standards of 0.5 nmol of each of C12-sphingomyelin, C12-ceramide, C12-galactosylceramide, C12-lactosylceramide, C20-sphingosine, C20-sphinganine, C17-sphingosine 1-phosphate, and C17-sphinganine 1-phosphate. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (30Sullards M.C. Merrill A.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 67: PL1Google Scholar). To quantitate phosphatidic acid, lipids were extracted using an acidified Bligh and Dyer method and analyzed after loading in the middle of Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates (31Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plates were developed twice in chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (65:35:7.5), cut 1 cm above the PA band, turned upside down, and developed in the reverse direction with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:acetone:water (50:10:10:20:5). PA was visualized with 0.03% Coomassie R-250 in 20% methanol with 100 mm NaCl, or 0.05% primulin in 80% acetone and quantitated by scanning on a Odyssey® imager, or a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad) at 525 nm. Diacylglycerol was measured using a DAG kinase assay (31Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Results for all lipid analyses were expressed relative to total lipid phosphate (31Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For determination of nuclear DAG, nuclei were purified by centrifugation through a 16% sucrose cushion. Nuclei were washed twice with buffer containing 10% sucrose and lipids were extracted as above. The presence of intact nuclei was confirmed by Hoechst staining using a fluorescence microscope. Characterization of Fibroblasts with Modified Expression of the LPPs—To study the isoform-specific effects of the LPPs, techniques for decreasing and increasing the relative expression of the three isoforms were developed. Knock-down experiments were performed by transfecting cells with siRNAs for each of the rat LPP isoforms. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that rat2 fibroblasts treated with siRNAs for LPP1, LPP2, and LPP3 showed about a 60% decrease in mRNA for the targeted LPP (Fig. 1, A and B). Transfection with control siRNAs did not decrease the expression of any LPP isoforms, and the knock-down of each of the three LPPs did not significantly alter the expression of mRNA for the other isoforms (Fig. 1, A and B). To overexpress the LPPs, rat2 fibroblasts were transduced with hLPP2, hLPP2-GFP, mutant LPP2(R214K)-GFP, mLPP1, mLPP1-GFP, rLPP3-GFP, or myc-rLPP3 and stable cell populations were selected with puromycin without clonal selection. Cells transduced with LPP2, LPP2-GFP, and R214K-GFP showed 32-, 42-, and 28-fold increases in mRNA for LPP2, respectively, compared with the endogenous expression levels in cells transduced with empty vector (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of LPP1 and LPP3 resulted in 16- and 78-fold increases in mRNA levels, respectively (Fig. 1D). The overexpression of each of the three LPP isoforms did not alter the expression of mRNA for the other isoforms (Fig. 1, C and D). When RT-PCR reactions were performed using the same reagents and RNA concentrations, the three isoforms had primer efficiencies of 1.88, 1.62, and 1.64, and required 22, 26, and 22 cycles to reach the threshold for LPP1, LPP2, and LPP3, respectively. The higher number of threshold cycles required for LPP2 indicated that LPP2 is likely to be the least abundant isoform in rat2 fibroblasts. LPP2 protein levels could not be determined because of technical difficulties encountered in resolving the protein on SDS-PAGE. Various techniques, which allowed the resolution of LPP1-GFP and LPP3-GFP with anti-GFP, including the addition of urea, increased detergent concentrations, N-ethylmaleimide addition, and lack of boiling, all failed to resolve LPP2-GFP and untagged LPP2 using two different anti-LPP2 antibodies (23Alderton F.

Immunoprecipitation of LPP2-GFP with anti-GFP antibody demonstrated that recombinant LPP2 activity was recovered (Fig. 2A), and there was no soluble GFP detected on Western blots (results not shown). This indicated that the LPP2-GFP fusion protein was overexpressed and remained intact. The immunoprecipitate from cells stably overexpressing LPP2-GFP did not co-immunoprecipitate LPP1, even when cells were transfected with adenovirus expressing myc-tagged mLPP1 to maximize any possible LPP1-LPP2 interaction (Fig. 2B). This demonstrated that the activity in the immunoprecipitate was caused by the activity of recombinant LPP2-GFP protein, not associated LPP1. When this immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting, there was a diffuse"
https://openalex.org/W2048587732,"The signature of calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) is a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (CaMLD) with four consensus calcium-binding sites. A junction domain (JD) joins the kinase with CaMLD and interacts with them through its autoinhibitory and CaMLD binding subdomains, respectively. We noted several CDPKs additionally have a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence as a subdomain in their JD, and this feature is obligatorily coupled with the absence of consensus calcium-binding sites in their respective CaMLDs. These predicted features are substantiated by undertaking investigations on a CDPK (gi:67479988) isolated from cultured groundnut (Arachis hypogea) cells. This kinase can bind 3.1 mol of Ca2+ under saturating conditions with a considerably high Kd of 392 μm as compared with its canonical counterparts. CD spectroscopic analysis, however, indicates the intramolecular structural changes accompanied with calcium binding to be similar to canonical CDPKs. Attesting to the presence of NLS in the JD, the endogenous kinase is localized in the nucleus of osmotically stressed Arachis cells, and in vitro binding assays indicate the NLS in the JD to interact with nuclear transport factors of the importin family. Homology modeling also indicates the feasibility of interaction of importins with the NLS present in the JD of such CDPKs in their activated form.

Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The core structure of CDPKs has an N-terminal catalytic domain, a C-terminal calmodulin-like regulatory domain (CaMLD), and a junction domain sandwiched between these two domains. As the catalytic domain of CDPKs is most closely related to calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK), CDPKs are believed to have arisen from a fusion event between a CaMK and a calmodulin (CaM) gene (1Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller E.G. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 4Zhang X.S. Choi J.H. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In consistency, the mechanism of activation of CDPKs is largely similar to CaMKs (5Harper J.F. Huang J.F. Lloyd S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7267-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Harmon A.C. Yoo B.C. McCaffery C.

Christodoulou J. Huang J.F. Chazin W.J. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In CaMKs, the autoinhibitory and calmodulin binding domain is located immediately C-terminal to the kinase domain, and the autoinhibition is released in the presence of calcium and exogenous CaM (10Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In CDPKs, the junction domain following the kinase domain is shown to contain subdomains possessing autoinhibitory and CaMLD binding properties. The autoinhibition is relieved by a calcium-dependent intramolecular interaction between the CaMLD and its target in the junction domain (7Huang J.F. Teyton L. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13222-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The distinguishing feature in the intramolecular activation of CDPKs is the covalent linkage of the CaMLD with its target in the same polypeptide. This linkage has been nicknamed as “tether” region and has been shown to provide a “structural constraint” that is essential for complete activation of a CDPK (9Vitart V. Christodoulou J. Huang J.F. Chazin W.J. Harper J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Any insertion in the tether results in almost complete disruption in calcium-dependent activation of a CDPK. Thus, in addition to interaction of the CaMLD with its target in the junction domain, intramolecular activation of CDPKs involves a conformational change of the holoenzyme mediated through the tether. Genomic sequencing as well as several extensively expressed sequence tag projects indicate the presence of multigene families of CDPKs in various plants (2Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 11Asano T. Tanaka N. Yang G. Hayashi N. Komatsu S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). They are demonstrated to be involved in regulating ion transport and/or gene expression linked with various cellular processes like cytoskeleton dynamics, stress response, growth and development, and metabolism (3Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Such response specificity of individual CDPKs is believed to be generated by their varying subcellular compartmentalizations, varying calcium and lipid sensitivities, and differences in substrate recognition (2Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The multiple subcellular locations of CDPKs include the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, endosperm storage vesicles, cytoskeletal system, mitochondria, nucleus, and peroxisomes (12Dammann C.

Here we report the domain analysis of a group of CDPKs, which apart from having the signature features of these kinases also have a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (18Dingwall C. Laskey R.A.

Interestingly, sequence analysis of all CDPKs in the data base reveals that the presence of NLS in their junction domains is obligatorily coupled with the presence of nonconsensus calcium binding EF hand loops (22Kawasaki H.

We substantiate these predictions with biophysical and biochemical experiments undertaken with an Arachis CDPK that possess these features. In the light of the known mechanism of regulation of CDPKs (5Harper J.F. Huang J.F. Lloyd S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7267-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Harmon A.C. Yoo B.C.

For auxin treatment, the stressed Arachis cells were treated for 1 h with 13.5 μmol liter-1 of 1-naphthalene acetic acid. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Arachis CDPK and Other Recombinant Polypeptides—Total RNA was isolated from osmotically stressed Arachis cells using RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA was isolated from this total RNA preparation using the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). The isolated mRNA was subjected to RT reaction using cDNA synthesis module (Amersham Biosciences) with random hexanucleotide and anchored dT25 primers. The cDNA for a Arachis CDPK was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-GCTCTAGAGG(T/A/G)(C/A)G(A/T/G/C)GG(T/A/G)-GA(A/G)TTC/TGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTATCATCGCCACAAATTC-3′ that corresponded to the sense sequence of domain I of the catalytic domain and antisense sequence of the fourth calcium-binding site of the CaMLD, respectively. The amplified 1.3-kb fragment was cloned in the TOPO TA vector from Invitrogen. The sequence named AhCPK2 was submitted to GenBank™ (gi:67479988). For expression of Arachis CDPK with a N-terminal His6 tag, it was PCR-amplified using 5′-GGGGTACCTATATCCTTGATAGAGAACTTGGGCGGGGGGAGTTCGGG-3′ as forward and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCTCCAATCTGTTCCTGTCTTCATCATCGCCACAAATTCTTC-3′ as reverse primers, respectively, and subcloned into the KpnI-HindIII sites in Qiagen expression vector pQE30. For expressing the JD-CaMLD polypeptide with an N-terminal His6 tag, a BamHI-HindIII fragment encompassing Ile-252 to Met-431 from AhCPK2 was subcloned in Qiagen expression vector pQE32. For expressing the CaMLD polypeptide (Ala-289 to Met-431) with a His6 tag, cloning was done in two steps. First, the CaMLD domain of AhCPK2 was PCR-amplified using 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTGATTTCTTGTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTATCATCGCCACAAATTC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and subcloned into the XbaI-HindIII sites of pUC19. The BamHI-HindIII fragment from the pUC19 backbone was then cloned into the Qiagen expression vector pQE30. Mutations were introduced in the JD-CaMLD polypeptide by PCR using 5′-CGGGATCCCAAATGCTAGGAGTGGCTCCAAATATTCCTCTTGGGGATGCTGTTCTATCAAGACTTAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTATCATCGCCACAAATTC-3′ as the forward and the reverse primers, respectively. The amplified fragment was cloned into the BamHI-HindIII sites in Qiagen expression vector pQE30 for expressing the JD-CaMLDmut. Nucleotide sequence and in-frame ligation was checked for all the clones by DNA sequencing. The recombinant polypeptides were expressed in Escherichia coli M15 by growing in the presence of 1 mm IPTG for 5 h at 37°C, and the proteins were purified under nondenaturing conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C by the procedures recommended by the manufacturers. The final preparation of the polypeptides were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored in aliquots in -80 °C. The purified recombinant proteins were analyzed for purity and integrity by SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1998; 273: 24083-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli BL21 in the presence of 0.5 mm IPTG for 4-6 h at 20 °C, and the proteins were purified at 4 °C using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). 2 mm dithiothreitol was included in all the solutions throughout the purification procedures. The final preparation of the polypeptides were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored in aliquots in -80 °C. Bioinformatics—Sequences of Arabidopsis CDPK family members were retrieved from the PlantsP Data Base (plantsp.sdsc.edu). CDPK sequences containing NLS in their junction domain coupled with noncanonical EF hands in their calmodulin-like domains were identified by manually analyzing all entries in the GenBank™ (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) or SwissProt database by using PROSITE (34Hulo N. Sigrist C.J.A. Le Saux V. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Bordoli L. Gattiker A. De Castro E. Bucher P. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D134-D137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned with ClustalW (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Binding to Proteins—The calcium binding property was measured by equilibrium dialysis as described previously (36Potter J.D. Strang-Brown P. Walker P.L. Iida S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For ensuring a calcium-free condition, all buffers and protein solutions were passed through a Chelex 100 column (Bio-Rad). The plasticwares were soaked in 2.5 mm EDTA overnight, and dialysis bags were heated at 80 °C in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaHCO3 for 1 h, and both were rinsed with calciumfree water. 40 μl (10 μm) of the purified polypeptide was dialyzed for 24 h at 25 °C against 400 μl of a solution of 25 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.0, containing 150 mm KCl and 45Ca2+ (0.25 μCi/ml) in presence of indicated concentrations of CaCl2. After dialysis, 20 μl of the protein solution and the external solution were collected from each of the dialysis set ups. The collected solutions were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane (13 mm in diameter), and radioactivity associated was measured. The moles of bound calcium/mol of protein and the concentration of unbound calcium were evaluated from the known concentration of the protein and the initial calcium concentration. The calcium binding data were processed according to the Hill model (37Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 38Cornish-Bowden A. Koshland D.E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 95: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) using Kyplot. The Hill model provides information regarding the degree of cooperativity (Hill constant, A3), the maximum number of calcium-binding sites (A1), and apparent dissociation constant (A2) according to Equation 1, y=A11+A2xA3(Eq. 1) where y and x denote the average number of moles of calcium bound/mol of protein and the free calcium concentration, respectively. Circular Dichroism—Experiments were performed on Jasco-720 spectropolarimeters. A bandwidth of 1 nm and a scan step size of 0.25 nm were employed with a 0.1-cm path length. Spectra were recorded at 298 K with 5 μm of the indicated polypeptides in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 1 mm calcium or 5 mm EGTA. Five scans were averaged for each sample, and the spectrum for the buffer was subtracted as a blank. Cell Fractionation—Membrane fractions were isolated and purified from both normal and stressed Arachis cells with or without auxin treatment as described previously (28Nag R. Maity M.K. Seal A. Hazra A. DasGupta M. Plant Cell Tissue Org. Cult. 2005; 10.1007/s11240-005-6902-zGoogle Scholar) and according to the procedures described in Refs. 12Dammann C. Ichida A. Hong B. Romanowsky S.M.

In brief, cells were harvested, rinsed with distilled water, ground in a mortar cooled with liquid nitrogen, and extracted with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 300 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg ml-1 leupeptin, and 10 μgml-1 aprotinin). To remove cell debris, the slurry (1 ml of buffer per g wet tissue) was first passed through cheesecloth and then centrifuged for 15 min at 2,000 × g (twice). The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The microsomal membrane pellet obtained at this step was resuspended in resuspension buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm and PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μgml-1 10 μgml-1 leupeptin aprotinin)). Membrane and soluble protein fractions were stored at -80 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared from normal and stressed Arachis cells as described in detail previously (29Nag R. Maity M.K. DasGupta M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 59: 819-836Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The final nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 m m MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μgml-1 leupeptin, 10 μgml-1 aprotinin, 10% Triton X-100 and stored at -80 °C in small aliquots. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Immunological Techniques—Antibodies against JD-CaMLD polypeptide of AhCPK2 was raised in rabbits. The affinity-purified His6-tagged JD-CaMLD polypeptide was subjected to SDS-PAGE. After mild staining of the gel, the appropriate band was excised, crushed, and used for immunization according to standard protocols (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-138Google Scholar). Western blotting with anti-AhCPK2 and anti-ABI3 (29Nag R. Maity M.K. DasGupta M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 59: 819-836Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was done at 1:1000 dilutions using a kit from Roche Applied Science. Western blotting with anti-His and anti-tubulin was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST Pull-down Assay—Interactions of the JD-CaMLD, CaMLD, and JD-CaMLDmut polypeptides with the importins were investigated by this assay following the binding conditions described previously (33Jiang C. Imamoto N. Matsuki R. Yoneda Y. Yamamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24083-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, 300 pmol of polypeptides were incubated in a total reaction volume of 150 μl in the presence of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 250 mm sucrose with the indicated concentrations of calcium and EGTA. Binding was done for 4 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added, gently mixed for 1 h, and then washed three times (15 min each) with 1× Tris-buffered saline containing the indicated concentrations of calcium or EGTA. The reaction mixture was analyzed in 12% SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and Western-blotted with anti-His or anti-AhCPK2 antibody. Homology Modeling—The model of Arachis CDPK, AhCPK2, was developed in two steps using the comparative modeling module of MODELLER (42Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A. Fiser A. Sánchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). The necessary sequence alignments were done using ClustalW (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). In the first step the model for JD bound to the calcium-bound CaMLD was modeled. The templates used were the files with codes 1CDM (43Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) and 1CKK (44Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) having calmodulin in complexation with target peptides in antiparallel and parallel orientations, respectively, from the Protein Data Bank (45Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar). The peptide templates in 1CDM and 1CKK were used to build the JD. Although the templates used were biomolecular calmodulin-peptide complexes, the target molecule had JD covalently linked to CaMLD. Because of this constraint, the model built using 1CDM showed the presence of knots (the JD peptide traversing through CaMLD). Consequently, the antiparallel mode of peptide binding was ruled out. The model obtained from 1CKK (with the parallel mode of binding) also had a knot with the peptide going through the linker connecting the N- and C-terminal domains of CaMLD (Fig. 8A). This could easily be rectified manually. In the second step, the active kinase was built using the sequence of death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) in the Protein Data Bank file 1JKT (46Tereshko V. Teplova M. Brunzelle J. Watterson D.M. Egli M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and this domain, along with the JD-CaMLD model, was used to build the complete structure of CDPK. The importin-CDPK complex was built by the protein docking method, GRAMM (47Vakser I.A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), using the structure of importin obtained from importin-NLS peptide complex, Protein Data Bank file 1PJN (48Fontes M.R.M. The T. Jans D. Brinkworth R.I. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27981-27987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The interface area between CaMLD and JD was calculated following Ref. 49Chakrabarti P. Janin J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, and the molecular diagrams were generated using MOLMOL (50Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar). Domain Analysis of an A. hypogea CDPK and Its Homologs; Nuclear Localization Sequence in the JD Is Coupled with Nonconsensus EF Hand Loops in the CaMLD—We developed a 1.3-kb partial cDNA clone (gi: 67479988) of an Arachis CDPK (designated AhCPK2) by amplification of RNA prepared from Arachis cells that were subjected to osmotic stress (27Seal A.

Cult. 2005; 10.1007/s11240-005-6902-zGoogle Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence contains a kinase catalytic domain with subdomains I to XI of Ser/Thr kinases, a junction domain, and a CaMLD with four calcium-binding motifs characteristic of the CDPK family (Fig. 1). Alignment and phylogenetic analysis using the entire length of the deduced AhCPK2 protein sequence showed that it belongs to the branch III cluster of plant and algal CDPKs (3Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). It showed the highest homology with AtCPK13, an Arabidopsis CDPK (gi:28059078) with 86% identity and 94% similarity, and OsCDPK, a rice CDPK (gi:34907990) with 83% identity and 92% similarity. The alignment of AhCPK2 with AtCPK13 and the OsCDPK is shown in Fig. 1. AhCPK2 also shares 71% identity and 83% similarity with a stress-induced CDPK (AtCPK10) from Arabidopsis (51Urao T. Katagiri T.

The arsRDABC operon of the clinically isolated Escherichia coli plasmid R773 encodes the ArsAB ATPase, a metalloid pump that confers resistance by actively extruding As(III) or Sb(III) from cells (1Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The 63-kDa ArsA is a metalloid-stimulated ATPase that comprises the catalytic subunit of the pump (2Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ArsA has two homologous halves, A1 and A2, connected by a short linker. Each half has a consensus nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). 2The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; MBD, metalloid-binding domain; STD, signal transduction domain; Ap, ampicillin; Tc, tetracycline; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. In the presence or absence of the pump substrate, Sb(III) or As(III), both NBD1 and NBD2 hydrolyze ATP, with steady state hydrolysis dominated by the activity of NBD1 (4Jiang Y. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Rosen B.P. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The two NBDs are located at the interface between A1 and A2, in close proximity to each other (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Over 20 Å distant from the NBDs is a metalloid-binding domain (MBD), where three Sb(III) or As(III) are bound at the A1-A2 interface (Fig. 1). One Sb(III) is connected to Cys-113 from A1 and Cys-422 from A2 (Site 1), a second to Cys-172 from A1 and His-453 from A2 (Site 2), and the third to His-148 from A1 and Ser-420 from A2 (Site 3). Thus, the three metalloid atoms act as molecular glue to bring the A1 and A2 halves of ArsA together, an event that is linked to activation of ATP hydrolysis. ArsA has two signature sequences that serve as signal transduction domains (STDs), D142TAPTGH148TIRLL in A1 (STD1) and D447TAPTGH453TLLLL in A2 (STD2), which corresponds to the Switch II region of many other nucleotide-binding proteins and have been proposed to be involved in transmission of the energy of ATP hydrolysis to metalloid transport (6Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Asp-142 and Asp-447 are Mg2+ ligands in NBD1 and NBD2, respectively, and His-148 and His-453 are Sb(III) ligands in the MBD (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Biometals. 2000; 13: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The relation between binding of trivalent metalloid to ArsA and its transport through the ArsAB pump is not clear. Is the metalloid bound at the MBD a transport substrate or is it an allosteric activator of the pump? A C113A/C422A mutation introduced into ArsA was found to eliminate high affinity metalloid binding to ArsA. The C113A/C422A ArsA had basal ATPase activity similar to that of the wild type but lacked metalloid-stimulated activity. However, cells expressing the mutant ArsAC113A/C422AB pump were able to extrude metalloid with higher efficiency than ArsB alone, exhibiting intermediate resistance between cells with wild type ArsAB and cells with only ArsB. These results indicate that the basal activity of the ArsAB pump is sufficient for ATP-driven efflux of metalloid and that the MBD is an allosteric site, with metalloid binding increasing pump activity. Finally, cells with wild type ArsAB were more successful than cells with the mutant ArsAC113A/C422AB in growth in mixed cultures. We propose that in the low concentrations of metalloid ubiquitously present in the environment, the allosteric site evolved to increase the fitness of the organism for growth. Media and Growth Conditions—The E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with either ampicillin (Ap) (125 μg/ml) or tetracycline (Tc) (12.5 μg/ml), as required. For arsenite resistance assays, overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh LB medium containing the indicated concentrations of sodium arsenite. After 6 h of growth at 37 °C, the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. Growth in mixed cultures was performed as follows. Cells of E. coli strain AW3110 bearing either pAlter1-ArsAB (Apr/Tcs) or pAlter1-ArsAC113A/C422AB (Apr/Tcr) were grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C. The cultures were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, diluted 1:1000 in fresh LB medium containing 125 μg/ml ampicillin and 4 μm sodium arsenite, and grown at 37 °C overnight. Each morning for 6 days the cultures were diluted 1:1000 into the same medium and grown overnight. Viable counts following serial dilutions were determined on LB plates containing 125 μg/ml ampicillin to obtain a total cell count or 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline to determine the fraction of cells bearing only pAlter1-ArsAC113A/C422AB.TABLE 1Strains and PlasmidsStrain/plasmidGenotype/descriptionRef.E. coli strainsES1301 mutSlacZ53 mutS201::Tn5 thyA36 rha-5 metB1 deoC IN(rrnD-rrnE)PromegaJM109recA1 supE44 endA1 hsdR17 gyrA96 relA1 thi Δ(lac-proAB) F' [traD36 proA+B+ laclq lacZΔM15]8Sambrook J.

The mutagenic oligonucleotides used and the respective changes (underlined) were as follows: T461W, 5′-GGTGGTACGCGCCCCAAGCATCCAGCAGC-3′; C113A, 5′-CGCAATCTCTGTTGTGGCTGCACCTGACAGTTG-3′; C422A, 5′-AGCAATTTCCTCAGTGGCAGGTGAGCGTAAGTC-3′. Purification of ArsA—Cells of strain JM109 bearing the indicated plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to mid-exponential phase, at which point 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce arsA expression. The cells were grown for another 2.5 h, and then harvested by centrifugation. Soluble ArsA was purified as described (6Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using an NADH-coupled assay (10Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 11Kuroda M. Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with 5 mm ATP and 2.5 mm MgCl2, unless otherwise noted. The concentration of purified ArsA was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay with a 340 PC microplate reader (Molecular Devices), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurement of Metalloid Binding—The buffer used for purification of ArsA was exchanged with a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), using a Bio-Gel P-6 Micro Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad). Purified protein was incubated at 4 °C with nucleotides, MgCl2, and the indicated concentrations of potassium antimonyl tartrate. After 1 h, each sample was passed through a Bio-Gel P-6 column pre-exchanged with the Buffer A. Portions (25 μl) were diluted with 2% HNO3, and the quantity of metalloid measured by inductively coupled mass spectrometry with a PerkinElmer ELAN 9000. Arsenic and antimony standard solutions in the range of 0.5–10 ppb in 2% HNO3 were obtained from Ultra Scientific, Inc. (North Kingstown, RI). Limited Trypsin Digestion—Limited trypsin digestion was performed at room temperature in Buffer A containing 0.25 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml ArsA at an ArsA to trypsin ratio of 500:1 (w/w) (12Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArsA was incubated with 5 mm ATP and/or 0.5 mm Sb(III), as indicated. Digestion was initiated by addition of N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma). Proteolysis was terminated at the indicated times by addition of a 5-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed on an Aminco Bowman-2 luminescence spectrometer with a built-in magnetic stirrer at room temperature. The bandwidths for emission and excitation monochromators were 4 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and an emission wavelength of 334 nm for T461W, 337 nm for W159, and 331 nm for M446W ArsA (6Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 8: 23815-23820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of Buffer A alone was subtracted from each spectrum. The concentration of ArsA was 1.25 μm, unless otherwise noted. Nucleotides, MgCl2, and potassium antimonyl tartrate were added as indicated. Transport Assays—Transport of arsenite by the ArsAB pump was assayed as decreased accumulation in cells (14Rosen B.P. Borbolla M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells bearing plasmids were grown to A600 nm of 1 at 37 °C with aeration in LB medium. The cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in a buffer consisting of 75 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 (Buffer B) and suspended at a density of 1010 cells/ml. To initiate the assay, 10 μm sodium arsenite, final concentration, was added in 1 ml of cells. Portions (0. 1 ml) were withdrawn at the indicated times, filtered through 0.45-μm pore diameter nitrocellulose filters (Whatman), and washed with 15 ml of the Buffer B, all at room temperature. The filters were dried and digested with 0.3 ml of 70% HNO3 (EM Science) at 70 °C for 20 min, allowed to cool to room temperature, and diluted with 7 ml of high pressure liquid chromatography grade water (Sigma) to produce a final concentration of HNO3 of ∼2.6%. Arsenic was quantified by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Binding of Sb(III) to ArsA—The 2.3-Å structure of the ArsA ATPase revealed a novel and complex MBD containing three atoms of Sb (5Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Each Sb atom is bound three-coordinately with two protein ligands and one unidentified non-protein ligand. One Sb was bound to A1 residue Cys-113 and A2 residue Cys-422. Because this binding site, which we term Site 1, includes two thiol ligands, it is expected to be a tight binding site. A second Sb was bound to A1 residue His-148 and A2 residue Ser-420. This site, termed Site 3, uses an imidazole nitrogen and serine hydroxyl as ligands. Because Sb(III) is a relatively soft metal, it would be expected to bind to this site with low affinity. The third Sb was bound to A1 residue Cys-172 and A2 residue His-453. With only a single thiol, this site, termed Site 2, would be expected to be a metalloid binding site with intermediate affinity between the other two sites. High affinity binding of Sb(III) to purified ArsA was measured by rapid gel filtration. Binding of As(III) could not be measured using this assay because of low affinity for this metalloid (cf. Fig. 3B). In the absence of nucleotide, only 0.1 mol of Sb(III) was bound per mol of ArsA (Fig. 2A). The same amount of Sb(III) binding was observed with bovine serum albumin, a protein of similar size to ArsA, indicating nonspecific interaction. Binding increased with addition of MgATP, MgADP, or MgATPγS, with binding of 1 mol of Sb(III) per mol of ArsA with the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide (Fig. 2A). Reciprocally, binding of nucleotide is also enhanced by metalloid binding (4Jiang Y. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Rosen B.P. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, it should be pointed out that the concentrations of ADP and ATP in the cytosol of E. coli are sufficient to saturate ArsA at all times, so in vivo binding of metalloid would be independent of nucleotide.FIGURE 2Stoichiometry of Sb(III) binding to ArsA. A, effect of nucleotides on the binding of Sb(III) to ArsA. 10 μm ArsA was incubated with 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 m m nucleotide, and 100 μm antimonite. ATP, ATPγS, ADP, no nucleotide, and 10 μm bovine serum albumin (BSA) incubated with 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm antimonite are indicated under the bars. The error bars represent the standard deviations (n = 4). B, antimonite binding to wild type (WT) and C113A/C422A ArsA. ArsA (10 μm) was incubated with 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATPγS, and increasing amounts of potassium antimonial tartrate. The lines represent best fit of the data using SigmaPlot 9.0 from five experiments for wild type ArsA and two experiments for the C113A/C422A ArsA. C, kinetic analysis of Sb(III) binding to either the wild type or C113A/C422A ArsA. Data were analyzed with the Scatchard equation: B = n-Kd·B/F, where B represents the concentration of Sb(III) bound to ArsA, and F represents the concentration of free Sb(III). Kd and n are the dissociation constant and the maximum number of Sb(III) bound per ArsA molecule, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding to purified ArsA was measured as a function of Sb(III) concentration. In the absence of Mg2+-nucleotide, only background binding was observed. In the presence of saturating MgATPγS, metalloid binding was saturable (Fig. 2B), with a stoichiometry of one Sb(III) per ArsA and an apparent Kd of ∼10–5 m (Fig. 2C). In the presence of ATPγS but in the absence of Mg2+, wild type ArsA still bound Sb(III) in a 1:1 ratio, but the apparent affinity was reduced by an order of magnitude (data not shown). In contrast, the C113A/C422A derivative bound only background levels of Sb(III) (Fig. 2, B and C), demonstrating that loss of Site 1 eliminates high affinity metalloid binding. C113A/C422A ArsA Lacks Metalloid-stimulated ATPase Activity—The ability of Sb(III) to activate ArsA was examined in wild type and C113A/C422A ArsA (Fig. 3). The wild type enzyme exhibited a basal ATPase activity of ∼100 nmol mg–1 min–1. Both metalloids stimulated ATP hydrolysis but to different extents. Sb(III)-stimulated ATPase activity 8-fold (Fig. 3A), with half-maximal stimulation at 8 μm, a value similar to the Kd for binding of Sb(III) (Fig. 2C). As(III) stimulated activity 3-fold (Fig. 3B), with half-maximal stimulation at 340 μm. C113A/C422A ArsA had basal activity similar to that of the wild type but lacked metalloid-stimulated activity. These results show a clear relationship between binding of metalloid to the high affinity binding Site 1 and metalloid stimulation of catalytic activity. Effect of Elimination of MBD Site 1 on Metalloid-associated Conformational Changes in ArsA—Loss of metalloid stimulation of the catalytic activity implies loss of conformational coupling between the MBD and NBDs. Because these are separated by at least 20 Å, interaction between these two sites requires substantial conformational changes. Limited trypsin digestion has been used as a sensitive tool to assess these ligand-induced changes under noncatalytic conditions (12Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of ligands, wild type ArsA was rapidly cleaved by trypsin to one or more polypeptides of 30 kDa (Fig. 4A). Addition of Sb(III) had little effect (Fig. 4A), which reflects the fact that high affinity Sb(III) binding occurs only in the presence of nucleotide (cf. Fig. 2). In the presence of ATP, the initial cleavage by trypsin produced a 50-kDa species with subsequent cleavage to smaller polypeptides (Fig. 4B). The rate of cleavage was decreased synergistically when both ATP and Sb(III) were present together (Fig. 4B), showing that the enzyme adopts a trypsin-resistant conformation when both the MBD and NBD are filled. The pattern of trypsin sensitivity in C113A/C422A ArsA was similar in the absence of Sb(III) (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that the overall structure of the mutant protein is not grossly different from wild type. Importantly, there was one major difference: addition of Sb(III) had no effect on the mutant protein in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4D). Thus, the lack of MBD Site 1 does not affect nucleotide-dependent conformational changes but does eliminate the metalloid-dependent effect. Effect of Elimination of MBD Site 1 on NBD1—The fluorescence of several single tryptophan-containing ArsA derivatives has been shown to report conformational changes associated with ligand binding, with basal ATP hydrolysis, and with metalloid-stimulated ATPase activity (6Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 8: 23815-23820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Trp-159, which is located near the C-terminal end of STD1, reports slow conformational changes during basal hydrolysis and rapid conformational changes during metalloid-activated ATP hydrolysis (6Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This fluorescence enhancement reports predominantly NBD1 activity in both the basal and activated states because NBD1 hydrolyzes ATP considerably faster than NBD2 under both sets of conditions (4Jiang Y. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Rosen B.P. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rate of fluorescence enhancement in the unactivated state is equivalent to the steady-state rate of basal hydrolysis (16Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The effect of ligands on the intrinsic fluorescence of W159 ArsA was compared with a W159 derivative of C113A/C422A ArsA (Fig. 5). Both proteins exhibited slow enhancement of fluorescence in the presence of MgATP but not MgADP. Addition of Sb(III), which produces activated ATP hydrolysis, elicited a large and rapid quenching of fluorescence in the W159 enzyme (Fig. 5A) that was absent in the MBD Site 1 mutant (Fig. 5B). This is consistent with occupancy of MBD Site 1 by metalloid being required for activation of NBD1. When the rate of fluorescence enhancement was measured as a function of ATP concentration in W159 (Fig. 6A) or W159/C113A/C422A (Fig. 6B) ArsAs, no significant differences were observed. If Sb(III) is added to W159 ArsA prior to MgATP, no enhancement of intrinsic fluorescence is observed (17Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of Sb(III) to W159/C113A/C422A ArsA prior to MgATP did not prevent the nucleotide-dependent enhancement of fluorescence (Fig. 6C). The Site 1 mutant and its parent had similar affinity for ATP during basal hydrolysis, but Sb(III) did not increase the affinity of the mutant (Fig. 6D). Thus, MBD Site 1 appears to be required for activation of ATP hydrolysis but not for basal hydrolysis by NBD1.FIGURE 6Effect of nucleotides on the intrinsic fluorescence of W159 ArsA proteins.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of MBD Site 1 on NBD2—Another single tryptophan derivative, M446W, has been useful for reporting events associated during nucleotide binding (9Zhou T. Shen J. Liu Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 8: 23815-23820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of Trp-446, which is located between NBD2 and the first residue of the A2 STD (Fig. 1), has been shown to respond to binding of either MgATP or MgADP in the absence of metalloid with an enhancement of fluorescence. In the presence of metalloid there is rapid quenching of fluorescence with MgADP as the dinucleotide product fills NBD2. There is slower quenching with MgATP that reflects slow hydrolysis of the trinucleotide by NBD2, with concomitant filling of the binding site with the dinucleotide product. The rate of this quenching is much slower than the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis by ArsA, which is controlled by NBD1. Thus, the enhancement of Trp-446 fluorescence under unactivated conditions most likely reports nucleotide binding, and the slow rate of Trp-446 fluorescence quenching is constrained by the slow rate of hydrolysis in NBD2. The fluorescent properties of the M446W enzyme that were otherwise wild type and the C113A/C422A derivative were compared (Fig. 7). In the absence of metalloid, either MgATP or MgADP produced an enhancement of Trp-446 fluorescence with M446W ArsA (Fig. 7A). Subsequent addition of Sb(III) produced rapid quenching with MgADP and slow quenching with MgATP. The M446W/C113A/C422A ArsA exhibited a similar enhancement of fluorescence with either MgADP or MgATP (Fig. 7B), indicating that NBD2 binds nucleotide in the absence of MBD Site 1. In contrast, the mutant enzyme was unresponsive to the subsequent addition of Sb(III), consistent with a requirement for binding of Sb(III) to Site 1 to activate hydrolysis in NBD2.

https://openalex.org/W1966381773,"Mechanisms regulating cell behavior and extracellular matrix composition in response to mechanical stimuli remain unresolved. Our previous studies have established that the MEK-ERK cascade plays a specific role in the mechano-dependent joint formation process by promoting the assembly of pericellular matrices reliant upon hyaluronan (HA) for their integrity. Here we demonstrate: (i) novel cross-talk between p38 MAPK and MEK-ERK signaling pathways that is specific for mechanical stimuli and (ii) a role for p38 MAPK in facilitating HA production by cells derived from the articular surface of embryonic chick tibiotarsal joints. We find that p38 MAPK blockade restricts pericellular assembly of HA-rich matrices and reduces basal as well as mechanical strain-induced release of HA. p38 MAPK blockers potentiated early strain-induced increases but restricted sustained increases in MEK/ERK phosphorylation at later times; c-Fos hyperphosphorylation at threonine 325 was found to parallel this p38 MAPK-mediated modulation of ERK activation. In contrast, p38 MAPK inhibitors had no detectable effect on the ERK activation induced by fibroblast growth factor 2 or pervanadate, a phosphatase inhibitor, and MEK inhibitors did not influence p38 MAPK phosphorylation, confirming both the specificity and unidirectionality of p38 MAPK-ERK cross-talk. Immunochemical and immunoblotting studies revealed constitutive p38 MAPK activation in cells at, or derived from, developing articular joint surfaces. Unlike the MEK-ERK pathway, however, p38 MAPK was not further stimulated by mechanical stimulation in vitro. Thus, p38 MAPK specifically facilitates ERK activation and downstream signaling in response to mechanical stimuli. These results suggest that constitutively active p38 MAPK serves an essential, permissive role in mechanically induced changes in ERK activation and in the accumulation of HA-rich extracellular matrices that serve a key role in joint development."
https://openalex.org/W2083037380,"We previously reported (Sarfare, S., Ahmad, S. T., Joyce, M. V., Boggess, B., and O'Tousa, J. E. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 11895–11901) that the Drosophila ninaG gene encodes an oxidoreductase involved in the biosynthesis of the (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal serving as chromophore for Rh1 rhodopsin and that ninaG mutant flies expressing Rh4 as the major opsin accumulate large amounts of a different retinoid. Here, we show that this unknown retinoid is 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinol. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array UV-visible absorbance detector and mass spectrometer revealed a major product eluting at a retention time, tr, of 3.5 min with a λmax of ∼324 nm and with a base peak in the mass spectrum at m/z 285. These observations are identical with those of the 3-hydroxyretinol standard. The base peak in the electrospray ionization mass spectrum arises from the loss of a water molecule from the protonated molecule at m/z 303 because of fragmentation in the ion source. These results suggest that 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinol is an intermediate required for chromophore biogenesis in Drosophila. We further show that ninaG mutants fed on retinal as the sole source of vitamin A are able to synthesize 3-hydroxyretinoids. Thus, the NinaG oxidoreductase is not responsible for the initial hydroxylation of the retinal ring but rather acts in a subsequent step in chromophore production. These data are used to review chromophore biosynthesis and propose that NinaG acts in the conversion of (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol to the 3S enantiomer. We previously reported (Sarfare, S., Ahmad, S. T., Joyce, M. V., Boggess, B., and O'Tousa, J. E. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 11895–11901) that the Drosophila ninaG gene encodes an oxidoreductase involved in the biosynthesis of the (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal serving as chromophore for Rh1 rhodopsin and that ninaG mutant flies expressing Rh4 as the major opsin accumulate large amounts of a different retinoid.

These data are used to review chromophore biosynthesis and propose that NinaG acts in the conversion of (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol to the 3S enantiomer. Photoisomerization of a retinoid chromophore covalently linked to the apoprotein opsin underlies the light-sensing ability of rhodopsins. Animals lack the ability to synthesize retinoids de novo and, therefore, derive retinoids from carotenoids present in the diet. In insects, three kinds of vitamin A derivatives, retinal, (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal, and (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal, function as chromophores (1Seki T. Vogt T.F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119: 53-64Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Dipteran suborder Cyclorrapha that includes Drosophila is the only suborder described so far that utilizes (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal as the Rh1 rhodopsin chromophore (2Seki T. Isono K. Ito M. Katsuta Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The use of (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal occurs in visual pigments exhibiting both UV and visible light sensitivity. This led to the suggestion that UV light sensitivity is because of the unique ability of (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal to accept energy transferred from a UV-sensitizing pigment (1Seki T. Vogt T.F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119: 53-64Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar).

Leung H.T. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Low Rh1 rhodopsin in ninaG mutants is not due to defects in Rh1 opsin transcription, but rather, the ability to synthesize the Rh1 chromophore is defective. However, the ninaG defect does not affect the expression of minor opsins Rh4 and Rh6 (4Sarfare S. Ahmad S.T. Joyce M.V. Boggess B. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Rh4 and Rh6 are expressed in the R7 and R8 photoreceptors, respectively (5Feiler R. Bjornson R.

Related family members catalyze redox reactions on a broad spectrum of small organic substrates. ninaG mutants have defects in the biogenesis of (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal and abnormally accumulate large amounts of an unknown retinoid (4Sarfare S.

In this report, we identify this previously unknown retinoid as 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinol and further characterize other aspects of the retinoid metabolism in the ninaG mutant. These results allow us to propose a model for biosynthesis of the (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal chromophore and to suggest that the NinaG oxidoreductase acts in a late step in this process, likely the conversion of (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol to (3S)-3-hydroxyretinol. Drosophila Strains and Media—The strains pRh1:Rh4; ninaGP330 and pRh1:Rh4; ninaEI17 are used to allow expression of Rh4 as the major visual pigment in both ninaG and ninaG+ flies (4Sarfare S.

In the first strain, Rh1 expression is suppressed by the presence of the ninaG mutation. In the second (ninaG+) strain, Rh1 expression is eliminated by ninaEI17, a mutation in the Rh1 coding gene. Unless stated otherwise, flies were reared on a 12-h light/12-h dark light cycle at room temperature on standard cornmeal molasses (referred to as vitamin A+) medium. The vitamin A-free medium was prepared as described previously (7Nichols R. Pak W.L. Drosoph. Inf. Serv. 1985; 61: 195Google Scholar). Flies were reared on vitamin A-free medium for one generation before retinal supplementation. Retinal supplementation was carried out by applying 100 μl of 2 mm solution of all-trans-retinal (Sigma) in ethanol onto the surface of a bottle containing 35 ml of vitamin A-free medium. Adult flies were reared on the supplemented food for 3 days prior to the retinoid extraction procedures. Protein Blot Analysis—Rh4 levels were detected using anti-Rh4 antibodies (gift from Armin Huber) as described previously (8Hsu C.D. Adams S.M. O'Tousa J.E. Vision Res. 2002; 42: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). HPLC-UV-visible-MS Reagents and Analysis—All-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol were purchased from Sigma, and all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals. Photoisomerization of all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal to 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal was carried out by exposing a 2 mm solution in ethanol to room light (750 lux) for 12–16 h at room temperature (24 °C). Chemical reduction of 3-hydroxyretinal to 3-hydroxyretinol was performed by adding 1 μg of anhydrous sodium borohydride to either 50 μl of a 2 mm solution of 3-hydroxyretinal in ethanol or a fly retinoid extract in 90:10 acetonitrile: water (v/v). These reactions were incubated at room temperature until effervescence had completely subsided. Retinoid extraction and HPLC-UV-visible-MS analysis was carried out as previously described (4Sarfare S. Ahmad S.T. Joyce M.V. Boggess B. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For analysis of dark-reared flies, all protocols were carried out under dim red light. Rh4 Maturation Requires Chromophore in ninaG Mutant Flies—The NinaG oxidoreductase is involved in the synthesis of the (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal chromophore required for the expression of Rh1 rhodopsin, but not for the expression of Rh4, a minor opsin expressed in a subset of R7 cells (4Sarfare S. Ahmad S.T. Joyce M.V. Boggess B. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the Rh4 opsin must either accommodate an alternative chromophore or not require chromophore binding for maturation. To determine whether a chromophore precursor is required for Rh4 maturation, we assayed Rh4 opsin levels in pRh1: Rh4; ninaEI17 flies reared on vitamin A-free medium. These flies carried the pRh1:Rh4 transgene (5Feiler R. Bjornson R. Kirschfeld K. Mismer D. Rubin G.M. Smith D.P. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3862-3868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allowing expression of Rh4 as major opsin in the R1–6 photoreceptor cells. The ninaEI17 mutant background eliminates expression of the Rh1 opsin in the same cells. Fig. 1 shows that, although high levels of Rh4 opsin are found in flies reared on vitamin A+ medium, Rh4 is absent in the flies reared on the vitamin A-free medium. These results demonstrate that Rh4 is dependent on the presence of a chromophore for high levels of expression and must accommodate a chromophore in the ninaG mutant that cannot be utilized by Rh1. For this reason, we sought to determine the composition of the retinoids found in ninaG flies expressing high levels of Rh4 (pRh1:Rh4; ninaG). 3-Hydroxyretinol Accumulates in ninaG Mutant Flies—In agreement with previous HPLC studies on the ninaG mutant (4Sarfare S. Ahmad S.T. Joyce M.V. Boggess B. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), Fig. 2A shows that pRh1:Rh4; ninaG flies (solid trace) accumulate a major retinoid component eluting at 3.5 min when compared with pRh1:Rh4; ninaEI17 flies (outlined trace). Other prominent chromatographic peaks eluted at 3.8 and 4.1 min in both sets of flies. To identify these components, we compared retention times, UV-visible absorbance spectra, and mass spectra of known retinoid standards to the corresponding data from these suspected retinoids. The results obtained from retinoid standards are summarized in Table 1. HPLC-UV-visible-MS analysis of all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal standard yielded a major chromatographic peak with tr = 3.8 min (Fig. 2D, solid trace), λmax of ∼374 nm (Fig. 2E), and a base peak in the ESI mass spectrum at m/z 301 (data not shown), which corresponds to an ion representing the protonated intact molecule.TABLE 1Retention times (tr), λmax, and observed ESI-MS base peak m/z values for the retinoid standards obtained by HLPC-UV-visible-MSRetinoidtrλmaxObserved ESI-MS base peakminnmm/zRetinal13.2∼37428511-cis-3-Hydroxyretinal4.1∼374301All-trans-3-hydroxyretinal3.8∼374301Retinol11.4∼32426911-cis-3-Hydroxyretinol3.5∼324285All-trans-3-hydroxyretinol3.2∼324285 Open table in a new tab Light treatment is known to cause photoisomerization of all-trans-retinal to cis isomers (9Cia D. Bonhomme B. Azim M. Wada A. Doly M. Azais-Braesco W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 864: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Noll G.N. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 721: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Photoisomerization of all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal followed by HPLC-UV-visible-MS analysis (Fig. 2D, outlined trace) revealed an increase in the relative abundance of the component with tr = 4.1 min, which also had a λmax of ∼374 nm (Fig. 2F) and a base peak in the ESI mass spectrum at m/z 301 (data not shown). This component was also detected as a major peak in wild type flies known to contain 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal as the major retinoid, and as a minor peak in the all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal standard. These observations support the assignment of the component eluting at 3.8 min, as alltrans-3-hydroxyretinal and the component eluting at 4.1 min contains its geometric isomer 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal. Likely the 4.1 min peak obtained from the photoisomerized all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal contains other cis isomers, but other isomers are not a major component of biological samples (1Seki T. Vogt T.F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119: 53-64Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Seki T. Isono K. Ozaki K. Tsukahara Y. Shibata-Katsuta Y. Ito M. Irie T. Katagiri M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HPLC-UV-visible-MS results for the chromatographic peak with tr = 3.5 min revealed a λmax of ∼324 nm (Fig. 2B) compared with the λmax of ∼374 nm for the 3-hydroxyretinal isomers (Fig. 2, C, pRh1:Rh4; ninaG extract; E, all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal standard; F, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal standard) and a base peak in the ESI mass spectrum at m/z 285 (Fig. 3A). It has been previously reported that the λmax of retinoids with a terminal alcohol is ∼324 nm, whereas the λmax of retinoids with a terminal aldehyde is ∼374 nm (12Gundersen T.E. Blomhoff R. J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 935: 13-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Indeed, this is consistent with our observations of λmax of ∼324 nm for a retinol standard and for λmax of ∼374 nm for both 3-hydroxyretinal isomers and all-trans-retinal (3-hydroxyretinal isomers shown in Fig. 2, E and F and data not shown for all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol). Furthermore, it was observed that under identical reversed phase HPLC conditions, the retinol form of a retinoid had a shorter retention time than the corresponding retinal, as expected due to polarity differences, for example, in our HPLC experiments, tr = 11.4 min for all-trans-retinol and tr = 13.2 min for all-trans-retinal (data not shown). Thus, the component with λmax of ∼324 nm and tr = 3.5 min, which elutes prior to tr = 3.8 min of alltrans-3-hydroxyretinal, could be 3-hydroxyretinol. However, the ESI mass spectrum showed a base peak of m/z 285 with only a low relative abundance (<10%) peak observed at the expected protonated molecule at m/z 303 (Fig. 3A). The observed base peak corresponds to the loss of water from the protonated molecule. Water loss during LC/MS of retinol has been reported previously (13Van Breemen R.B. Huang C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also observed that the retinol standard generated a base peak at m/z 269, which corresponds to a loss of water from the expected protonated molecule at m/z 287 (Fig. 3B). To determine conclusively whether the unknown retinoid found at high levels in Rh4; ninaG is 3-hydroxyretinol, a 3-hydroxyretinol standard was synthesized by chemically reducing 3-hydroxyretinal with sodium borohydride (2Seki T. Isono K. Ito M. Katsuta Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HPLC-UV-visible-MS experiments performed on the 3-hydroxyretinol products revealed a major component eluting at 3.2 min and a minor component eluting at 3.5 min (Fig. 2G). Both components have a λmax of ∼324 nm (Fig. 2, H and I) and produce an ESI mass spectrum with a base peak at m/z 285 and a low (<10%) relative abundance peak at m/z 303 (Fig. 3C). Given that the starting material was predominately all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal having a small amount of 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal, the reduced product was expected to consist mostly of all-trans-3-hydroxyretinol with a small amount of 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinol. Therefore, the agreement between the HPLC-UV-visible-MS results from the 3-hydroxyretinol standard and those from the retinoid extracts of the pRh1:Rh4; ninaG flies show that 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinol is the product accumulating in these flies. ninaG Flies Synthesize Hydroxyretinoids—The presence of large amounts of 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinol in ninaG mutants suggested that the NinaG oxidoreductase does not act in the hydroxylation of the retinoid ring. However, given the possibility that these hydroxyretinoids can be generated directly from centric cleavage of xanthophylls obtained from the diet, we sought evidence of conversion of retinoids to hydroxylated retinoids in the ninaG mutant. For this reason, we analyzed the retinoid extracts from pRh1:Rh4; ninaG flies reared with all-trans-retinal as the sole source of vitamin A. The flies were reared under dark condition to minimize isomerization of all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal. Fig. 4A shows that these flies produce both all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal, eluting at 3.8 min with λmax ∼374 (Fig. 4B), and all-trans-3-hydroxyretinol, eluting at 3.2 min with λmax ∼324 (Fig. 4C). Thus, the ninaG flies are capable of hydroxylation of the retinoid ring and excludes the possibility that the NinaG oxidoreductase is required for this reaction. We have compared the results of HPLC-UV-visible-MS experiments of retinoid extracts and retinoid standards to identify 3-hydroxyretinol as the retinoid accumulating in Rh4; ninaG flies. These results establish that the major retinoid found in the ninaG retina is not an aldehyde and therefore cannot form the Schiff-base linkage needed to serve as the chromophore for Rh4 or other visual pigments. For this reason, it is likely that 3-hydroxyretinol is an intermediate compound accumulating as a result of the defect in the (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal synthesis pathway caused by the ninaG mutation. Vertebrates are known to use a retinol species as an intermediate in the retinoid biogenesis. In the vertebrate visual system, the all-trans-retinal arising from the photobleaching of rhodopsin must first be converted to all-trans-retinol before 11-cis-retinal is regenerated (14Bernstein P.S. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6473-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Palczewski K. Saari J.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We propose the pathway outlined in Fig. 5 to account for the current information regarding (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal biosynthesis in Drosophila. Xanthophylls, such as lutein and zeaxanthin that are hydroxylated at the C-3 position of the retinoid ring and β-carotene, are the major dietary source of chromophore precursors (11Seki T. Isono K. Ozaki K. Tsukahara Y. Shibata-Katsuta Y. Ito M. Irie T. Katagiri M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Stark W.S. Schilly D. Christianson J.S. Bone R.A. Landrum J.T. J. Comp. Physiol. 1990; 166: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All naturally occurring xanthophylls are in the 3R, 3′R configuration thereby ruling out the possibility of obtaining retinoid species in 3S configuration by direct cleavage of such xanthophylls by an oxygenase. Further, the ninaB-encoded oxygenase only catalyzes cleavage of β-carotene and not these xanthophylls (17von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The NinaB enzyme is essential for the formation of the chromophore from both xanthophylls and β-carotene. These considerations suggest that xanthophylls are first converted to β-carotene before being acted on by the NinaB oxygenase. The production of retinal by the NinaB oxygenase occurs outside the retina (18Gu G. Yang J. Mitchell K.A. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18608-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is not known whether retinal itself is transported to the retina or is converted to retinol before transport. Both possibilities are shown in Fig. 5. These retinoids appear to be processed in retinal pigment cells because PINTA, a retinoid-binding protein essential for chromophore production, acts in these cells (19Wang T. Montell C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5187-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays show that PINTA is capable of interacting with both retinol and retinal, with a stronger binding affinity for the retinol. The hydroxylation of retinal to form 3-hydroxyretinal has been studied by Seki et al. (11Seki T. Isono K. Ozaki K. Tsukahara Y. Shibata-Katsuta Y. Ito M. Irie T. Katagiri M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These studies implicated a role of a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase in the hydroxylation of the retinal ring. Notably, this reaction exclusively produced the 3R enantiomer, as shown in Fig. 5. A second important observation made by Seki et al. (11Seki T. Isono K. Ozaki K. Tsukahara Y. Shibata-Katsuta Y. Ito M. Irie T. Katagiri M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was that the hydroxylation reaction produced a retinoid with λmax ∼330, thereby suggesting the formation of (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol. It is not clear whether (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol is formed directly by the P-450 monooxygenase or is the product of a subsequent reaction involving a retinal dehydrogenase. There are three short chain dehydrogenases with enriched transcripts within retinal tissues with the potential to catalyze this type of reaction (20Xu H. Lee S.J. Suzuki E. Dugan K.D. Stoddard A. Li H.S. Chodosh L.A. Montell C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Most insect visual pigments use the (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal enantiomer as the visual pigment chromophore. Only members of the higher Diptera, the Cyclorrapha, have been shown so far to synthesize and use the (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal enantiomer as chromophore (1Seki T. Vogt T.F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 119: 53-64Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that 3-hydroxyretinoids are formed in the ninaG mutant and infer that these are exclusively the 3R enantiomer because they are not capable of serving as a chromophore for Rh1 rhodopsin. These results allow us to assign a role for the NinaG oxidoreductase in the biochemical pathway responsible for conversion of 3R enantiomer to the 3S enantiomer. The 3R isomer is used by Rh4 rhodopsin, at least in the ninaG mutant. It is not known whether Rh4 and other minor Drosophila visual pigments use the 3R enantiomer in wild type (ninaG+) flies. Given the proposal that ninaG mutant is defective in the production of (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal from the 3R enantiomer, the NinaG oxidoreductase could be responsible for two different reactions. First, NinaG could act in the conversion of the (3R)-3-hydroxyretinoid (alcohol or aldehyde form) to the corresponding (3S)-3-hydroxyretinoid. Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase, a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase, is responsible for the oxidization of a hydroxyl group on a six-member carbon ring of cholesterol and the subsequent rearrangement of a double bond within the cholesterol rings (21Yamashita M. Toyama M. Ono H. Fujii I. Hirayama N. Murooka Y. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The second possibility is that the NinaG enzyme acts in the oxidation of (3S)-3-hydroxyretinol to (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal. This assumes that only the alcohol form, (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol, is converted to (3S)-3-hydroxyretinol by an uncharacterized enzyme. Then NinaG would be responsible for the subsequent step, that is, the oxidation of (3S)-3-hydroxyretinol to (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal. However, short chain dehydrogenases typically catalyze retinol-retinal interconversions, and therefore the involvement of NinaG in this reaction seems unlikely. The model presented in Fig. 5 also explains the production of some 3-hydroxyretinal, postulated to be exclusively the 3R isomer, in ninaG flies. This isomer cannot be used by Rh1 rhodopsin; hence the low Rh1 content is observed in ninaG mutants. On the other hand, Rh4 and another visual pigment, Rh6, are produced in the ninaG mutant because they are able to use the 3R isomer. We have proposed here that the accumulation of 3-hydroxyretinol in ninaG mutant flies is not because it serves as an alternative chromophore, but rather because it is an intermediate in the chromophore biosynthetic pathway or a byproduct of the NinaG defect. An additional observation is that 3-hydroxyretinol is present in greater amounts in ninaG mutants than in wild type. We propose that the accumulation of 3-hydroxyretinol occurs because it is a precursor in chromophore biosynthesis. The model for chromophore biogenesis in Fig. 5 shows NinaG acting in the conversion of (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol to (3S)-3-hydroxyretinol. Likely this reaction requires an oxidized intermediate of the carbon ring that is then reduced to generate (3S)-3-hydroxyretinoid. NinaG, a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase, would act in one or both of these reactions. Therefore ninaG mutants lacking this enzyme accumulate (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol. An alternative possibility is that (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal is the retinoid converted to the 3S isomer, and in the absence of this reaction a side reaction converts (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal to (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol and results in the accumulation of (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol. A higher level of 3-hydroxyretinol was observed in ninaG flies expressing Rh4 than in ninaG flies expressing Rh1 or no visual pigment (4Sarfare S. Ahmad S.T. Joyce M.V. Boggess B. O'Tousa J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reason for this is not known. One possibility is that photoreceptor cells maintain membrane structures in greater quantity when visual pigments are synthesized and transported to the rhabdomeric membranes, and thereby perhaps greater capacity for biogenesis or storage of this retinoid precursor (22Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Kumar J.P. Ready D.F. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 4359-4370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of the ninaG oxidoreductase has provided a useful probe into the biosynthesis of visual pigment chromophores. The Drosophila visual system offers much promise for further insights, including the investigation of the role of (3R)- and (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal enantiomers as chromophores in the function of specific visual pigments.

Malaria is one of the world's most important infectious diseases in terms of both mortality and morbidity. The consensus is that 0.5 billion clinical attacks take place every year, including 2-3 million severe attacks (1Greenwood B.M. Bojang K. Whitty C.J. Targett G.A.

It is assumed that the disease claims more than 1 million lives annually and that most of these deaths occur in African children, but the true number might be much higher. Chloroquine, which used to be the first line treatment for malaria, now fails everywhere. Emerging resistance to drugs introduced to replace chloroquine, such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, reinforces the need for new, selective, and affordable drugs against the parasite (1Greenwood B.M.

Of the four causative agents of malaria, i.e. Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae, P. falciparum is the most dangerous. The recent completion of the genome sequencing of P. falciparum allowed the identification of highly promising pathways in the parasite (4Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W.

FAS-II is found in bacteria and plants and is structurally very different from the FAS-I system found in most eukaryotes. In FAS-I, the biosynthetic enzymes are integrated into a large multifunctional single polypeptide (7Smith S.

Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Among the inhibitors described to act against various targets in FAS-I and FAS-II, thiolactomycin and cerulenin are known to inhibit the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases FabB and FabF of bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and plants (e.g. Pisum sativum and Allium porrum) (12Jones A.L.

In the type II FAS of plants and bacteria, three β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases with different substrate specificities have emerged as important regulators of the initiation and elongation steps in the pathway. The initiation enzyme β-ketoacyl synthase III (FabH) only catalyzes the elongation of malonyl-ACP by an acetyl-CoA primer, whereas the elongation enzymes β-ketoacyl synthase I and II (FabB and FabF) use acyl-ACPs for elongation of malonyl-ACP (18Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Sequencing of the full genome of P. falciparum revealed that the parasite possesses only one isoform of the elongating condensing enzyme, PfFabBF. As PfFabBF is unique, its activity cannot be replaced by another β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, which makes it a very promising target. To date there are no data available concerning substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of PfFabBF. To this end, we present the cloning, expression, and purification of this enzyme. A recombinant expression and purification system was established, allowing the production of significant amounts of active enzyme that are suitable for the characterization using natural acyl-PfACP substrates as well as the corresponding acyl-CoA analogs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Instrumentation—All cloning steps were performed in E. coli Nova Blue cells (Stratagene). Expression was conducted in E. coli BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene). Sources of supplies are as follows: pET vectors from Novagen; Pfu Turbo polymerase from Stratagene; T4 DNA ligase and restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs; plasmid extraction kits from Sigma; NADPH from Roche Diagnostics; Terrific broth (TB) medium from Difco; cerulenin and acyl-CoAs from Sigma; nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose from Qiagen; HiTrap, HisTrap, PD10 and Superdex 75/200 gel filtration columns from Amersham Biosciences. An Aekta FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) was used for protein purification. Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out on a Cary 50 concentration Varian Spectrophotometer using an ultra-micro cell from Hellma (type 105.202-QS). All other supplies were reagent grade or better.Multiple Sequence Alignment—Sequences of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases of various organisms were aligned using the ClustalW alignment program (22Thompson J.D. Desmond G. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55217) Google Scholar). The sequences were obtained from the SwissProt data base and included E. coli FabB (SwissProt primary accession number P14926) and FabF (P39435), Arabidopsis thaliana FabB (P52410) and FabF (Q9C9P4), and P. falciparum FabBF (Q6LF11).Cloning of the P. falciparum PfFabBF Expression Plasmids—A two-step megaprimer PCR method (23Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Application. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar, 24Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) was used to create a pffabBF clone that carried a 171-bp truncation at the N terminus. In the first step, two overlapping fragments of the pffabBF gene were PCR-amplified from P. falciparum 3D7 gDNA (MRA-386, MR4; ATCC, Manassas VA). The first fragment was amplified using the forward primer 5′-ACTTCTAGAGTGGTGTGCACAG and the reverse primer 5′-CCTGAACCTTCTCCCATAACGAAACCACACG. The second fragment was generated using the following primer pair: 5′-GAAGTGGTTTCGTTATGGGAGAAGGTTCAGG and 5′-TCACTTTACAATTTTTTTGAAAAGTAATG. In a second step, the above mentioned fragments were combined to give the final insert using forward primer 5′-TGGTTCCATGGCTTCTAGAGTGGTGTGCACAGGTGTAGGGGTA and reverse primer 5′-CCGAATTCTCACTTTACAATTTTTTTGAAAAGTAATGCTGTGTTATGGCCTCC who carried NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). The PCR program for both reactions consisted of an initial 2-min denaturation step (94 °C), followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 90 s, and 60 °C for 60 s, followed by a final elongation step at 60 °C for 5 min. The amplified gene was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into pET30b vector using T4 DNA ligase.An 18-bp-long stretch of DNA, coding for six additional amino acids (i.e. KNLCET) of the original pffabBF N terminus, was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using as template the plasmid described above. The following primers were used: 5′-GGTACCGACGACGACGACAAGCATATGAAAAATCTTTGTGAAACTTCTAGAGTGGTGTGCACAGGTGTAGGGGT and 5′-ACCCCTACACCTGTGCACACCACTCTAGAAGTTTCACAAAGATTTTTCATATGCTTGTCGTCGTCGTCGGTACC. The amplification was carried out with Pfu Turbo polymerase. The PCR program consisted of a 2-min initial denaturation step at 94 °C, followed by 18 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, 48 °C for 60 s, 52 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 14 min, and a final polishing step at 68 °C for 7 min. The original plasmid was digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 90 min. The remaining mutated plasmid was purified by ethanol precipitation and used to transform CaCl2 competent Nova Blue E. coli cells. Positive mutants were identified by sequencing.This elongated construct was named pET30b-PfFabBF and was used for all further subcloning steps. pET30b-PfFabBF was digested with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into an equally digested pET42b vector. The resulting pET42b-PfFabBF was then digested with SpeI and EcoRI and ligated into pET43.1b to give pET43.1b-PfFabBF (Fig. 1). All positive clones were identified by PCR screening, restriction digestion, and automated sequencing to verify authenticity.Expression and Purification of PfFabBF—The final pET43.1b-PfFabBF clone was designed to express PfFabBF as NusA fusion protein with an expected molecular mass of 107 kDa, covering amino acids 52-474 of the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase part. The expression plasmid was introduced into BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL expression cells. The cells were used to inoculate 500 ml of TB medium supplemented with 1 mm betaine, 660 mm sorbitol, ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The temperature was then lowered to 25 °C, and protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 7 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing DNase, and disrupted by passing them twice through a French press. The extract was clarified, and the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml HisTrap chelating column. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of lysis buffer and eluted by means of a 50-ml linear imidazole gradient using buffer A (20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) and buffer B (20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Fractions containing PfFabBF were pooled, concentrated (Centriprep, 30-kDa cut-off), diluted to a final NaCl concentration of 50 mm, and loaded on a 5-ml HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP column. The protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient using buffer C (20 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5) and buffer D (20 mm NaH2PO4,1 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5). The fractions containing the fusion protein were again pooled, concentrated, and either applied on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with buffer E (20 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) or desalted by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 4, 30-kDa cut-off), depending on the required degree of purity. Total protein concentration was determined by a dye-binding assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar). The purified protein was stored at +4 °C.Cloning and Expression of P. falciparum ACP—Acyl-PfACPs are the natural substrates of PfFabBF and are thus needed for its characterization. PfACP has been cloned and expressed in a similar way as described earlier (26Prigge S.T. He X. Gerena L. Waters N.C. Reynolds K.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Waters N.C. Kopydlowski K.M. Guszczynski T. Wei L. Sellers P. Ferlan J.T. Lee P.J. Li Z. Woodard C.L. Shallom S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 123: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pfacp gene sequence N-terminally truncated by 180 bp was PCR-amplified from a P. falciparum strain 3D7 gametocyte stage cDNA pSPORT plasmid library (kindly provided by Dr. T. Templeton, Weill Medical College of Cornell University) and ligated into the pET28b expression vector. Correct clones were identified and verified by restriction digestion, PCR, and automated sequencing with T7 forward and reverse primers. The resulting clone was designed to express PfACP without the putative N-terminal signal and translocation sequence, i.e. amino acids 1-60. PfACP, consisting of residues 61-137, was expressed for 8 h at 37 °C in TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) using BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL expression cells. After isolation on a HisTrap chelating column and subsequent imidazole gradient elution, the N-terminal His tag was removed by thrombin digestion. The protein was concentrated, diluted in buffer A (20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5) to a final NaCl concentration of 50 mm, and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q-Sepharose XL column in order to separate the apo-form of the protein from the holo-form. Apo-PfACP and holo-PfACP were separated by applying a linear NaCl gradient (120 ml) using buffer A and buffer B (20 mm BisTris, 1 m NaCl, pH 6.5). Fractions containing apo-PfACP were pooled and reapplied to the column. Three runs were necessary to complete the separation. The purity of apo-PfACP was verified by conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis (CS-PAGE) (28Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pure fractions were concentrated (Centriprep, 3-kDa cut-off) and stored at -20 °C.Cloning and Expression of E. coli ACPS—In order to produce the acyl-PfACPs enzymatically, EcACPS has been cloned and expressed essentially as described earlier (30Chopra S. Singh S.K. Sati S.P. Ranganathan A. Sharma A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, the complete acpS coding sequence was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA and ligated into the pET30b expression vector. Correct clones were identified and verified by restriction digestion, PCR, and automated sequencing with T7 forward and reverse primers. The resulting plasmid was introduced into BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL expression cells, and the protein was expressed for 8 h at 37 °C in TB medium supplemented with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). After isolation on a HisTrap chelating column and subsequent imidazole gradient elution, EcACPS was desalted by applying the concentrated fractions to a PD10 column. The protein was eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm DTT.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of PfFabG—Activity assays of PfFabBF were performed by coupling the synthase activity of PfFabBF to the reductase activity of PfFabG. A pffabG sequence N-terminally truncated by 162 bp was PCR-amplified from a P. falciparum (strain 3D7) gametocyte cDNA pSPORT plasmid library and after restriction digestion was ligated into the pET30b expression vector. Correct clones were identified and verified by restriction digestion, PCR, and automated sequencing with T7 forward and reverse primers. The resulting clone was designed to express the enzyme without the putative N-terminal signal and translocation sequence, i.e. amino acids 1-54. PfFabG, consisting of residues 55-304, was expressed for 6 h at 37°C using BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL cells. Purification of the protein was performed as described for PfFabI (31Perozzo R. Kuo M. Sidhu A.B.S. Valiyaveettil J.T. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Fidock D.A. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13106-13114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), except that a linear imidazole gradient was applied.Preparation of Acylated PfACP Substrates—C4:0 to C16:0 acyl-PfACPs were generated using EcACPS. A typical reaction (1 ml) contained 100 μm of the corresponding acyl-CoA, 250 μg of EcACPS, 1 mg of apo-PfACP, 25 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. For higher amounts of substrates, the protocol was scaled up accordingly. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. EcACPS was eliminated from the mixture by binding it to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Afterward the acyl-PfACPs were concentrated and desalted by means of a PD10 column equilibrated with 20 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The purity of acyl-PfACPs was confirmed by CS-PAGE (28Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—A continuous assay format was used to monitor the PfFabBF activity by coupling the condensing activity of PfFabBF to PfFabG. FabG reduces β-ketoacyl-ACPs to the corresponding β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs by simultaneous oxidation of its cofactor NADPH to NADP+, allowing the reaction course to be monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Control experiments, such as performing the reaction either without substrates or without enzyme, were carried out to rule out unspecific oxidase activity.Specific activity measurements of the acyl-PfACPs were performed at 37 °C and contained 30 μm malonyl-PfACP, 30 μm acyl-PfACP (1 mm for the acyl-CoA series), and 5 μg of PfFabG in assay buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 80 μm NADPH, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was started with the addition of 3 μg of PfFabBF. The course of the reaction was monitored for 1 min, and the rates of product formation were expressed as pmol/min. The substrate specificity of PfFabBF was additionally checked by CS-PAGE in order to exclude the possibility of PfFabG being the limiting factor.Kinetic measurements were performed with C4:0- to C14:0-PfACPs under Michaelis-Menten conditions at 37 °C using various concentrations of acyl-PfACP (25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 800 μm), malonyl-PfACP at saturating conditions (400 μm), and 5 μg of PfFabG in assay buffer (final volume 100 μl). The kinetic parameters of malonyl-PfACP were determined using 500 μm C4:0-PfACP and various concentrations of malonyl-PfACP (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μm). The reaction was started with the addition of 3 μg of PfFabBF. Control experiments (e.g. linearity of the rate of product formation at different PfFabBF concentrations) were performed to show that PfFabG is not the rate-limiting step in the reaction.Cerulenin Inhibition Assay—Time dependence of cerulenin (CER) inhibition was analyzed by adding 3 μg of PfFabBF that had been preincubated with 100 μm CER for 0, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 120 s to the assay buffer containing 30 μm malonyl-PfACP, 30 μm hexanoyl-PfACP, and 5 μg of PfFabG (total volume 100 μl). The IC50 value was determined using various concentrations of CER (0, 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm) in the reaction mixture described above. The reaction was started without preincubation by the addition of 3 μg of enzyme. The irreversibility of CER inhibition was confirmed by adding inhibited enzyme to the reaction mixture described above, thereby diluting the CER concentration 20-fold. All measurements were performed at 37 °C.Thiolactomycin Inhibition Assay—The IC50 value was determined as described for CER, except that the following thiolactomycin (TLM) concentrations were used: 0, 1, 10, 50, and 100 μm. The type of inhibition was determined with respect to malonyl-PfACP and C6:0-PfACP in consideration of the Michaelis-Menten steady state condition. To investigate the inhibition mechanism of TLM with respect to malonyl-PfACP, 250 μm C6:0-PfACP, various concentrations of malonyl-PfACP (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm), and 1 μg of PfFabG were added to the assay buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 3 μg of PfFabBF. The type of inhibition with respect to acyl-PfACP was determined as described for malonyl-PfACP, except that the C6:0-PfACP concentration was varied (50, 100, 200, 400, and 500 μm), and the malonyl-PfACP concentration was kept constant at 400 μm.RESULTSThe fatty acid biosynthesis of P. falciparum received considerable attention with the recent discovery of this pathway in the parasite. In the meantime several key enzymes involved have been characterized with respect to their biochemical behavior as well as to their three-dimensional structure, and first inhibitors have been found or designed. However, the enzymatic characteristics of the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I/II homolog of the P. falciparum pathway have not been reported yet in the literature. The Plasmodium Genome Data base (32Kissinger J.C. Brunk B.P. Crabtree J. Fraunholz M.J. Gajria B. Milgram A.J. Pearson D.S. Schug J. Bahl A. Diskin S.J. Ginsburg H. Grant G.R. Gupta D. Labo P. Li L.

Nature. 2002; 419: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) proposed the open reading frame PFF1275c to be the mentioned β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (PfFabBF). To confirm this hypothesis, we cloned the cDNA corresponding to PFF1275c and characterized its gene product PfFabBF.Multiple Sequence Alignment—The open reading frame encodes a protein of 474 amino acids with an expected molecular mass of 52.6 kDa. PfFabBF has a long N-terminal extension that is characteristic of bipartite N-terminal presequences found in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma parasite proteins targeted to the apicoplast (5Waller R.F.

The size of the adjacent apicoplast translocation signal cannot be predicted and remains to be determined experimentally. A multiple sequence alignment of PfFabBF with FabB and FabF of E. coli and A. thaliana is shown in Fig. 2. When compared with PfFabBF (residues 56-474), the parasite enzyme shares 31 and 38% identity with FabB (residues 1-406) and FabF (residues 1-412) of E. coli and 38 and 37% identity with FabB (residues 59-473) and FabF (residues 128-541) of A. thaliana.

MD-2 is a 20-25-kDa extracellular glycoprotein that binds to Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR4) and LPS and is a critical part of the LPS receptor. Here we have shown that the level of MD-2 expression regulates TLR4 activation by LPS. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have found that glycosylation has no effect on MD-2 function as a membrane receptor for LPS. We used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify regions of human MD-2 that are important for TLR4 and LPS binding. We found that mutation in the N-terminal 46 amino acids of MD-2 did not substantially diminish LPS activation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells co-transfected with TLR4 and mutant MD-2. The residues 46-50 were important for LPS activation but not LPS binding. The residues 79-83, 121-124, and 125-129 are identified as important in LPS activation but not surface expression of membrane MD-2. The function of soluble MD-2 is somewhat more sensitive to mutation than membrane MD-2. Our results suggest that the 46-50 and 127-131 regions of soluble MD-2 bind to TLR4. The region 79-120 is not involved in LPS binding but affects monomerization of soluble MD-2 as well as TLR4 binding. We define the LPS binding region of monomeric soluble MD-2 as a cluster of basic residues 125-131. Studies on both membrane and soluble MD-2 suggest that domains of MD-2 for TLR4 and LPS binding are separate as well as overlapping. By mapping these regions on a three-dimensional model, we show the likely binding regions of MD-2 to TLR4 and LPS.

A key component of the mammalian innate immune system is a family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LBP, LPS-binding protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: FACS, fluorescence-activating cell sorter; HA, hemagglutinin; IL, interleukin; MCN, mean channel number; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LBP, LPS-binding protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: FACS, fluorescence-activating cell sorter; HA, hemagglutinin; IL, interleukin; MCN, mean channel number; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of Gram-negative bacteria, activates a variety of cells to produce inflammatory cytokines that can lead to septic shock in humans. The innate immune mechanism that recognizes LPS involves a transfer of LPS to a pattern recognition molecule CD14 (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar) by lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) (4Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CD14 has no transmembrane domain and is not capable of signaling. TLR4 is a type 1 transmembrane protein that has extracellular leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular signaling domain that is responsible for LPS signaling (5Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). A cascade of events leading to maximal cellular activation is likely to involve transferring of LPS by LBP to CD14 and then to TLR4·MD-2. Although CD14 and LBP enhance cellular activation, activation of TLR4 by LPS absolutely requires MD-2 (8Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).MD-2 can be found on the cell surface in association with TLR4 or as a secreted protein. It shares a sequence homology to MD-1, a protein that binds to another TLR family member, RP105 (9Miyake K. Shimazu R. Kondo J. Niki T. Akashi S. Ogata H. Yamashita Y. Miura Y. Kimoto M. J.

Interaction of the cell surface TLR4·MD-2 complex with LPS induces clustering of TLR4 and may be the mechanism that triggers cellular activation (13Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T.

Whereas soluble MD-2 is essential for LPS-induced activation of cells expressing only TLR4, high levels of soluble MD-2 can inhibit cellular responses (11Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

In this study, we have investigated the structure/function relationships of membrane and soluble MD-2 by alanine-scanning mutagenesis.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Salmonella minnesota Re 595 LPS (Re LPS) was prepared as previously described (26Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble CD14 with C-terminal His tags were prepared as described previously (27Viriyakosol S. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol.

Control mouse IgG1 and rabbit IgG were obtained from Caltag. All protein biotinylations were done using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC biotinylation kit (Pierce). All reagents were tested for LPS contamination with Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (BioWhittaker). All reagents had <0.02 pg of endotoxin/μg of protein. When necessary, LPS was removed from the reagents using END-X (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc.). Mutagenesis of MD-2—The human MD-2 gene with the gp64 signal peptide sequence as described in Ref. 11Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol.

The MD-2 amino acids were changed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutant MD-2 constructs were transfected into a CHO cell line stably transfected with TLR4 containing an N-terminal HA tag and a CD25 reporter plasmid as described previously (11Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected cell lines were generated by selection with Zeocin followed by immunomagnetic sorting using anti-His tag mAb (Qiagen).Cell Culture and Transfection—Cell lines were maintained in the laboratory as previously described (26Viriyakosol S.

EL1, a CHO cell line stably transfected with inducible membrane CD25 under the transcriptional control of a human E-selectin promoter containing NFκB binding sites, was a gift from Dr. D. Golenbock (28Delude R.L. Yoshimura A. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using an EndoFree kit (Qiagen). Stably transfected cell lines were generated using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells expressing TLR proteins were sorted by immunomagnetic beads (Dynal) using anti-HA mAb (Roche Diagnostics). The stably transfected lines were generated by selection with G418 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were assayed for surface expression of the HA-epitope by FACS analysis using anti-HA mAb followed by a F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse Ig fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag).Analysis of NFκB Activity by Flow Cytometry—CHO cells carrying NFκB reporter plasmids to express surface CD25 were plated in a 24-well plate 1 day prior to activation. The cells were stimulated overnight, harvested, and stained with phycoerythrin-CD25 mAb (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by FACS as previously described (11Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L.

Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MD-1 genes (Invivogen) were subcloned into pBlueBac4.5/V5-His (Invitrogen) or pBac11 (Novagen) and recombinant virus generated by the manufacturers' protocols. Recombinant virus stock was verified to contain the correct mutation by sequencing PCR-amplified inserts. Expressed protein in the insect cell supernatant was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described previously (11Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of all proteins was determined by Coomassie Blue staining of protein electrophoresed on a Nu-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). The protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce), ELISA using biotinylated anti-His tag, and Western blotting of the protein with anti-His tag. The control His tag protein was produced using control recombinant virus supplied by Novagen.LPS Binding Assays—The assay for MD-2 binding using immobilized LPS was done in a similar manner to the method described previously (11Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Activation of U373 Cells—The cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and activated with various reagents in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts and glutamine supplemented with 10 mg/ml human serum albumin. The supernatant was harvested after 16 h of activation and assayed for IL-6 by ELISA as described previously (11Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of Soluble MD-2 Binding to TLR4—TLR4-transfected CHO cells with or without the CD25 reporter gene were incubated with various amounts of soluble MD-2 in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 15 min or 16 h at 20 °C. After washing off the excess protein with medium, the cells were stained with mAb anti-His (Qiagen) to detect MD-2 or anti-HA to detect TLR4, followed by rabbit anti-mouse-Ig-fluorescein isothiocyanate and analyzed by FACS. To quantitate the amount of MD-2 and TLR4 on the cell surface, the mean channel number (MCN) of fluorescence intensity was compared with the standard curve of Simply Cellular Microbeads (Bangs Laboratories) stained with the corresponding antibodies.Antibody Sandwich ELISA for the Detection of Soluble MD-2—A 96-well microtiter plate (Immulon, Dynex) was coated with 1 μg/ml of three different monoclonal antibodies against soluble MD-2 developed in our laboratory and diluted in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.01% Tween (PBST) and blocked with 1% casein in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The culture supernatant was added to each well and the plate incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed four times in PBST, and 2.5 μg/ml biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-soluble MD-2 was added to each well. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed five times, and 80 ng/ml Streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was added for 45 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed five times, and the substrate (1% tetramethylbenzidine) was added. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.2 m H2SO4 to each well, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The concentration of soluble MD-2 in the culture supernates was derived from a standard curve using purified wild-type-soluble MD-2 expressed by baculovirus.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—CHO cells stably transfected with TLR4 were incubated with 1 μg of soluble MD-2 for 15 min at 25 °C. The cells were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum and lysed in 50 mm Hepes, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and HALT proteinase inhibitor mixture (Pierce). The cell lysate was incubated with anti-HA-agarose (Profound HA, Pierce) overnight at 4 °C and the precipitated protein eluted according to the manufacturer's protocol. The eluted protein was electrophoresed on a reduced 4-12% Nu-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The soluble MD-2 and TLR4 were detected using the biotinylated anti-His or anti-HA antibody, respectively. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) were used to detect the bound antibodies.RESULTSMD-2 Influences LPS Activation—To investigate the role of MD-2 LPS receptor function, we varied the amount of soluble MD-2 and examined the response of TLR4-transfected EL1 cells (a CHO cell line stably transfected with a NFκB/CD25 reporter plasmid) (28Delude R.L. Yoshimura A. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar) to LPS. The amount of soluble MD-2 that bound to TLR4-transfected cells well as the TLR4 expression level were assayed by FACS analysis using antibody to His and HA tags, respectively. The cells were also activated with 100 ng/ml of LPS, and NFκB activation was assayed by FACS analysis of surface CD25 expression. These data plotted versus the concentration of soluble MD-2 are shown in Fig. 1. As the soluble MD-2 concentration increased, more MD-2 could be detected on the cell surface, whereas the TLR4 receptor number remained constant. At a concentration of 0.5 nm soluble MD-2, the calculated ratio of surface MD-2 per TLR4 was 0.5, yet a small amount of LPS-induced NFκB activation occurred. The level of activation increased with more MD-2 on the cell surface and reached a maximum when the calculated ratio of MD-2 per TLR4 was ∼5. This suggests that optimal receptor function requires multiple molecules of MD-2 bound to each TLR4.N-linked Glycosylation of Membrane MD-2 Has Little Effect on Cellular Activation—There have been several reports in the literature that the glycosylation state of MD-2 was important for receptor function (23da Silva Correia J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Ohnishi T. Muroi M. Tanamoto K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we mutated the two N-glycosylation sites by replacing them with glutamines. The mutated MD-2 gene pcDNA/V5His was transfected into the TLR4/CHO reporter cell line, NQ) expressed unglycosylated MD-2 protein, as shown by Western blotting of the cellular extract with antibody to His tag (Fig. 2A). The TLR4·MD-2 NQ expressed the MD-2 protein as a value 17 Kd protein, whereas the wild type expressed glycoforms of ∼20-27 Kd. Because the level of MD-2 expression on the cell surface influences LPS activation, it was important that we compare the function of this mutant to the wild type expressed at a similar level. To achieve equal expression of mutant and WT MD-2, we sorted the TLR4·MD-2 NQ cell line several times using immunomagnetic beads to select cells expressing high levels of MD-2 NQ. Fig. 2B shows FACS analysis of the surface expression of TLR4 and MD-2 on the TLR4·MD-2 NQ and WT cell lines. The TLR4·MD-2 NQ and WT cell lines were activated with LPS, and NFκB activation was assayed by CD25 surface expression. Fig. 3A shows that 100 ng/ml LPS activated the non-glycosylated mutant cells to express surface CD25 at the same level as the WT cells. We compared the level of CD25 expression after both cell lines were activated with concentrations of LPS stimulation from 1 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml and found similar levels of LPS activation, as shown in Fig. 3B. These data show that glycosylation is not important for the LPS receptor function of membrane MD-2.FIGURE 2Expression of the unglycosylated mutant of MD-2. A, CHO (EL1) cells were stably transfected with TLR4 (lane 1), TLR4 and MD-2 wild type (TLR4·MD-2 WT) (lane 2), and TLR4 and MD-2 unglycosylated mutant (TLR4·MD-2 NQ) (lane 3). The cells were lysed and cell extracts immunoprecipitated with mAb against MD-2, 5H10 (developed in our laboratory). Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted and probed with anti-His tag antibody. B, surface expression of TLR4 and MD-2 on the cell lines was analyzed by FACS using anti-HA tag and anti-His tag staining for TLR4 and MD-2, respectively.

Data are presented as means ± S.D. of triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Critical Regions of Human Membrane MD-2 for TLR4 Binding and Cellular Activation by LPS—We analyzed regions of functional importance of human MD-2 by site-directed mutagenesis. The protein sequence of human MD-2 was analyzed for Kyte-Dolittle hydrophilicity with McVector Software. Mutagenesis was designed by replacing blocks of 4-5 amino acids with alanine, as shown in Fig. 4. The expression constructs with C-terminal His tags were stably transfected into TLR4/EL1 cells. We analyzed cell surface TLR4 and MD-2 by FACS using anti-HA and anti-His tags, respectively. TLR4 surface expression levels were relatively constant (data not shown), whereas MD-2 levels varied widely. (Fig. 5). Alanine replacement mutagenesis in the N-terminal 46 amino acids of MD-2 produced mutants that expressed as well or better than the wild type. Mutation in the rest of the molecule yielded protein that was expressed poorly on the cell surface, except for three regions: amino acids 79-83, 106-110, and 121-129. This suggests that most of the MD-2 sequence after amino acid 61 is important for cell surface expression. Fig. 5, left column, shows that all mutants were synthesized and secreted as soluble protein into the medium. The levels of secreted MD-2 varied among the mutants and were not correlated with the cell surface expression levels. These data rule out the possibility that MD-2 was not found on the cell surface, because the engineered mutants were not synthesized.FIGURE 4Alanine replacement mutagenesis of human MD-2. The amino acid sequence of the predicted mature MD-2 protein, starting at amino acid 17, is shown in gray. The 7 cysteine residues are shown in black. The two N-glycosylation sites are underlined. A set of 4-5 alanines replaces the wild-type residues in the positions as shown. The blocks of alanine shown in underlined letters replace the hydrophilic regions of MD2, whereas the ones shown in italics replace the hydrophobic regions. The alanines in lowercase letters replace the regions in between.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Analysis of membrane MD-2 mutants. Mutant MD-2 in pcDNA V5-His were created by alanine replacement mutagenesis at the amino acid numbers and sequences, as indicated, and transfected into TLR4/EL1 cells. Cell lines expressing maximal amounts of membrane MD-2 expression were selected by immunomagnetic bead sorting with anti-His antibody. Expression of MD-2 on the cell surface was analyzed by FACS using anti-His. MCN of fluorescent intensity of the staining was expressed as fold difference compared with the TLR4·MD-2 wild type. Stably transfected EL1 cells with TLR4 and MD-2 mutants were activated with 100 ng/ml LPS, and NFκB activation was assayed by FACS analysis of surface CD25 staining. MCN of LPS-induced CD25 expression was normalized against IL-1β-induced CD25 expression. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. from at least three experiments.

Each mutant was assayed in triplicate at least twice. Fig. 5 shows the LPS activation levels of different mutants as compared with the surface expression level. All mutants in the N-terminal 61 amino acids, which expressed on the cell surface, were responsive to LPS. Among this group, mutant 19-23 is more responsive to LPS than one would predict from the surface expression level. Mutants in the region 42-61 were expressed at a higher level than WT but responded to LPS less than half as well as WT. The three mutants at the C-terminal region (amino acids 79-83, 121-125, and 125-129) were expressed well but were not responsive to LPS. Mutants in the regions 66-79, 87-102, 116-122, and 127-150 were not expressed well on the cell surface.Conformation of Soluble MD-2 Mutants—Selected MD-2 mutants with different levels of expression on the cell surface, mutants that expressed well but were poorly activated by LPS, as well as the unglycosylated mutant were chosen for expression as soluble protein. The mutant genes were subcloned into baculoviral plasmids and soluble proteins expressed in insect cells. All recombinant viruses used were purified and DNA sequenced to confirm the correct mutation. The protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The purified protein was analyzed on non-reducing PAGE. Fig. 6 shows isoforms of different soluble MD-2 mutants on non-reduced PAGE. Soluble mutants 38-42, 46-50, and 125-129 are most similar to the WT MD-2 in the amount of monomer. These mutants also expressed well on the cell surface. Mutants 75-79, 79-83, 106-110, and 116-120 did not express well on the cell surface. The soluble forms of these mutants contained very little monomer. These data suggest that monomer formation may correlate positively with membrane MD-2 expression.FIGURE 6Effect of alanine substitution and N-glycosylation mutation on soluble MD-2 oligomerization.

https://openalex.org/W2163542694,"Vitamin E was discovered for its implication in reproductive biology, and its transport in mammalian plasma and brain was shown to be governed by plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). We show that PLTP deficiency is associated with hypofertility of mouse males but not mouse females, and it accounts for a significant decrease in total number of pups produced over a 2-month breeding period of PLTP knocked out mice (-32%, P<0.03). PLTP is highly expressed in epididymis of mouse males, and alpha-tocopherol, the main vitamin E isomer in vivo, was significantly less abundant in cauda and caput epididymis of PLTP-deficient mice as compared with wild-type counterparts (caput: -26%, P<0.05; cauda: -21%, P<0.05). Mature spermatozoa from PLTP-deficient epididymis were shown to retain an abnormal alpha-tocopherol content. PLTP deficiency tended to reduce sperm motility as shown by a 24% reduction in spermatozoa with progressive motility (P<0.02), with no change in other sperm parameters as compared with wild-type males. Finally, in vitro fertilization rates of wild-type oocytes with spermatozoa from PLTP-deficient males were markedly reduced as compared with those measured with spermatozoa from wild-type males (-60%, P<0.05).

Non-phosphorylated recombinant FIX has been reported to rapidly disappear from plasma, indicating that phosphorylation of FIX plays an important role in the physiological activity of this coagulation factor. In this study, we characterized the human FIX activation peptide (AP) using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes phosphorylated Ser-158 in the AP region. Murine monoclonal antibody B1 against human FIX recognized FIX with an apparent <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> value of 5 nm in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.58 mm). B1 bound to the isolated AP of FIX and retained the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of binding to the isolated AP. The deglycosylation of AP did not affect the binding of B1 to AP, while B1 failed to bind to recombinant AP expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed that the <i>m/z</i> of plasma-derived deglycosylated AP is 82.54 Da greater than that of recombinant AP. The binding ability of B1 to AP was lost by the dephosphorylation of plasma-derived AP. B1 bound to synthetic peptide AP-(5-19), including phosphoserine-13, but not to the non-phosphorylated AP-(5-19) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These data provide direct evidence that Ser-13 of the plasma-derived FIX AP region (Ser-158 of FIX) is phosphorylated and that B1 recognizes the epitope, which includes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound phosphoserine-158. B1 should be useful in the quality control of biologically active recombinant FIX containing phosphoserine-158."

Identification of compounds that can modulate the activities of Bcl-2 family proteins will facilitate development of drugs for treatment of apoptosis-related human diseases. We used an in vitro selection method named systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to isolate RNA aptamers that bind the Caenorhabditis elegans Bcl-2 homolog CED-9 with high affinity and specificity and tested whether these aptamers modulate programmed cell death in C. elegans. Five CED-9 aptamers were isolated and classified into three groups based on their predicted secondary structures. Biochemical analyses indicated that two of these aptamers, R9-2 and R9-7, and EGL-1, an endogenous CED-9-binding proapoptotic protein, bound to distinct regions of CED-9. However, these two aptamers shared overlapping CED-9 binding sites with CED-4, another CED-9-binding proapoptotic factor. Importantly ectopic expression of these two aptamers in touch receptor neurons induced efficient killing of these neurons largely in a CED-3 caspase-dependent manner. These findings suggest that RNA aptamers can be used to modulate programmed cell death in vivo and can potentially be used to develop drugs to treat human diseases caused by abnormal apoptosis.

Apoptosis is an essential cellular process that is critical for tissue homeostasis and animal development in metazoans. Abnormal inactivation of apoptosis can result in uncontrolled cell growth, leading to development of cancer and autoimmune disorders. By contrast, inappropriate activation of apoptosis can cause too much cell death, leading to neurodegenerative diseases and immunodeficiency (1Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6170) Google Scholar). Development of effective therapeutic methods that can correct or reverse inappropriate apoptosis is thus a critical issue in clinical medicine.Apoptosis is controlled and executed by an evolutionarily conserved cell death pathway (3Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 4Horvitz H.R. Biosci. Rep. 2003; 23: 239-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the center of this pathway is a family of conserved cell death regulators first defined by the human proto-oncogene bcl-2, which promotes cell survival and was identified by virtue of its overexpression in a number of B-cell lymphomas (5Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 6Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M.

Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4775) Google Scholar). Subsequently a family of Bcl-2-related proteins, characterized by the presence of at least one of four conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) 3The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PLM, posterior lateral microtubule. 3The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PLM, posterior lateral microtubule. domains, has been discovered and found in organisms as distantly related as Caenorhabditis elegans and humans (8Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4775) Google Scholar). Members of this family can be either antiapoptotic or proapoptotic and can form heterodimers with selected family members to affect apoptosis. The mechanisms by which Bcl-2 family proteins regulate cell death appear to be quite complicated but likely involve modulation of the mitochondrial permeability and the release of crucial apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G, which promote activation of caspases, the cell death executors, and other cell death events such as chromosome fragmentation (8Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4775) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition to B-cell lymphomas, Bcl-2 family members are overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers, contributing to malignant growth of tumors as well as tumor resistance to chemotherapies (10Shangary S. Johnson D.E. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1470-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus Bcl-2 family proteins are ideal targets for pharmaceutical intervention in the treatment of cancer and other human diseases.Genetic studies in C. elegans have identified a central cell killing pathway involving four genes (egl-1, ced-9, ced-4, and ced-3) that act in a negative regulatory cascade to control activation of programmed cell death (4Horvitz H.R. Biosci. Rep. 2003; 23: 239-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that EGL-1, a BH3-only proapoptotic protein, induces cell death by binding to and inhibiting the activity of CED-9, a cell death inhibitor and a homologue of human Bcl-2, leading to the disassociation of CED-4 from the CED-4/CED-9 complex tethered on the surface of mitochondria (4Horvitz H.R. Biosci. Rep. 2003; 23: 239-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CED-4, a homologue of the human apoptotic protease activating factor 1, then directly facilitates the activation of the CED-3 caspase and apoptosis (4Horvitz H.R. Biosci. Rep. 2003; 23: 239-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yan N. Gu L. Kokel D. Chai J. Li W. Han A. Chen L. Xue D. Shi Y. Mol.

Nature. 2005; 437: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As in humans, misregulation of apoptosis in C. elegans can have detrimental outcomes. For example, loss-of-function mutations in the ced-9 gene cause embryonic lethality as a result of too much cell death (13Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 14Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Importantly key components of this cell death pathway are highly conserved from nematodes to humans (4Horvitz H.R. Biosci. Rep. 2003; 23: 239-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that studies of apoptosis in C. elegans will be highly relevant to studies of apoptosis in humans.Small RNA molecules play critical roles in regulating many important cellular events such as ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, gene silencing (RNA interference), and protein translation (microRNA) (15Finnegan E.J. Matzke M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4689-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and can potentially be used as therapeutic agents. In the early nineties, an in vitro selection method named systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) was developed to isolate small RNA molecules (aptamers) that have high binding affinity and specificity to important biomolecules such as proteins and RNAs (16Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7821) Google Scholar, 17Nimjee S.M. Rusconi C.P. Sullenger B.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56: 555-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). By binding specifically to a region or a domain of their targets, aptamers can directly modulate the biological activities of their targets at the protein level. Most attractively, aptamers have been used successfully to treat human diseases caused by misexpression or altered activity or function of their target proteins. For example, aptamers with high affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor are being clinically used to treat blindness caused by macular dysfunction (18Group Eyetech Study Ophthalmology. 2003; 110: 979-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 19Group Eyetech Study Retina. 2002; 22: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Aptamers targeting blood coagulation factors VIIa and IXa are promising anticoagulants (20Rusconi C.P. Scardino E. Layzer J. Pitoc G.A. Ortel T.L. Monroe D. Sullenger B.A. Nature. 2002; 419: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 21Rusconi C.P. Roberts J.D. Pitoc G.A. Nimjee S.M. White R.R. Quick Jr., G. Scardino E. Fay W.P.

In addition, aptamers have also been developed to modulate the activities of other proteins critical for various biological processes, including transcription factors NF-κB (22Ghosh G. Huang D.B.

Thus SELEX could be an effective method to identify new small molecule regulators for Bcl-2 family proteins.In this study, we used SELEX to identify RNA aptamers for the C. elegans cell death inhibitor CED-9 and isolated five different CED-9 aptamers, which can be categorized into three different groups based on their predicted secondary structures. We found that two of these aptamers, R9-2 and R9-7, and EGL-1 bind to different regions of CED-9 but seem to have overlapping CED-9 binding sites with CED-4. Importantly overexpression of these two CED-9 aptamers induced ectopic cell killing in C. elegans touch receptor neurons, and this ectopic killing was suppressed by a strong loss-of-function mutation in the ced-3 gene. Therefore, these aptamers may antagonize the prosurvival activity of CED-9 and kill cells through the normal programmed cell death pathway. Our results suggest that RNA aptamers for key cell death regulators can yield, or serve as leads to generate, potent compounds to modulate apoptosis in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant Proteins—CED-9(1–251)-His6, which contains all four Bcl-2 homology motifs (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) and binds EGL-1 and CED-4 as well as the full-length CED-9 protein (12Yan N.

After purification (Fig. 1A), the recombinant proteins were dialyzed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Recombinant GST-EGL-1, GST-CED-9 (wild type and mutants), and CED-4 were purified as described previously (11Yan N. Gu L. Kokel D. Chai J. Li W. Han A. Chen L. Xue D. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 999-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).SELEX—The RNA library for the first round of SELEX was generated from a DNA template containing 49 randomized nucleotides flanked by fixed linker regions and a T7 promoter for in vitro transcription (Table 1). RNA was transcribed overnight and purified using 10% denatured polyacrylamide gels. For the first six rounds of selection, a filter binding assay was used. Briefly RNA was preincubated with a nitrocellulose filter (HAWP, 0.45 μm, Millipore) for 1 h at room temperature to reduce nonspecific binding of RNA molecules. Then the counterselected RNA was incubated with CED-9(1–251)-His6 at 30 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The reaction mixture was subsequently filtered gently through the nitrocellulose membrane with a filtration apparatus, and the membrane was washed four times with 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 20% glycerol). The membrane containing the protein-RNA complex was incubated with proteinase K at 55 °C for 20 min in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 12.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS followed by phenol:chloroform extraction and precipitation with cold ethanol. The amounts of protein and RNA used for binding were gradually decreased with the increasing rounds of selection. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used for the last three rounds of SELEX. Approximately 300 cpm 32P-labeled RNA was incubated with different amounts of CED-9(1–251)-His6 in a reaction mixture of 20 μl for 30 min at 30 °C in the same protein-RNA binding buffer as above and separated with 7.5% native polyacrylamide gels. The shifted protein-RNA complex was cut off the gel, and the RNA was recovered as described above. For both selection assays, the selected RNA was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 1 h according to the instructions from the provider (Fisher BioReagents). The cDNA was further amplified by PCR using the primers corresponding to the fixed regions at both ends, and the amplified DNA was subjected to the next round of in vitro transcription and selection. The RNA selected after round 8 and round 9 was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and ligated into the C. elegans expression vector pPD52.102 via its NheI and EcoRV sites. After transformation of the ligation products into DH5α cells, PCR was performed on the resulting colonies to amplify the inserts, which were digested with the 4-base cutter enzyme AciI for fingerprinting on 4% agarose gel. The binding of individual aptamers to CED-9 was further confirmed by gel shift assays, and aptamers with high binding affinity to CED-9 were sequenced. The secondary structures of these aptamers were predicted with the program Mfold (33Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10084) Google Scholar).TABLE 1CED-9 aptamers selected from the RNA libraryCloneAptamer sequenceaThe aptamer sequences shown are cDNA sequences corresponding to the 49-nucleotide variable region of the RNA aptamers, which were selected from a random RNA library.

Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—CED-9(1–251)-His6 or GST-CED-9 protein was incubated with 32P-labeled aptamers (∼150 cpm) in a 20-μl reaction mixture in the binding buffer (as described above) supplemented with 2 μg of yeast tRNA as a nonspecific binding competitor. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was separated on a 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. For the competition binding assay, the indicated amounts of unlabeled aptamer were added to a reaction mixture with a fixed concentration (0.5 μm) of CED-9(1–251)-His6. Both 32P-labeled and unlabeled (cold) aptamers were denatured at 85 °C for 5 min and cooled on ice for 5 min before being added to the reactions.Overexpression of Aptamers in C. elegans—The cDNAs encoding the aptamers with high binding affinity to CED-9 were inserted into the C. elegans expression vector pPD52.102 via its NheI and EcoRV sites that directs the expression of the aptamers in six touch receptor neurons under the control of the promoter of the mec-7 gene. The aptamer expression vectors were linearized with EcoRV and injected into wild-type animals with the co-injection marker pRF4, which causes the Roller phenotype. Two to three independent transgenic lines were scored for cell killing caused by the overexpression of each aptamer.RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of CED-9 Aptamers—To identify RNA aptamers for CED-9, SELEX was carried out using a protocol described by Chen et al. (26Chen C.H. Chernis G.A. Hoang V.Q. Landgraf R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly an RNA library was generated in vitro using an oligonucleotide library that contains a central region of 49 randomized nucleotides flanked at both ends by constant sequences and a bacterial T7 promoter for in vitro transcription (Table 1). For the first round of SELEX ∼1015 unique sequences were represented. Each round of SELEX consisted of the following steps. Radioactive labeled RNAs were incubated with purified recombinant CED-9 before the reaction mixtures were applied to a protein binding assay such as the EMSA or the filter binding assay. CED-9/RNA complexes that were isolated from the EMSA or retained by the filter (“Materials and Methods”) were recovered and reverse transcribed to cDNAs, which were then PCR-amplified to generate a new oligonucleotide library enriched in DNAs encoding RNAs with higher binding affinity for CED-9. After nine rounds of SELEX, we obtained a pool of RNA molecules that bound CED-9 with high affinity (see below).To determine the sequences of isolated CED-9 aptamers, we cloned the corresponding cDNA molecules of aptamers obtained from the last two rounds of SELEX into a vector. We then checked these cloned cDNA molecules with restriction enzyme fingerprinting to determine the relative abundance of closely related aptamers in these pools (“Materials and Methods”). To do this, the RNA coding regions of 30 cDNA clones from each round of SELEX were PCR-amplified and digested with a frequent 4-base cutter, AciI. Clones with the same restriction digestion pattern were assumed to have identical or very close DNA sequences. Using this analysis, we identified seven different RNA species among the 30 cDNA clones selected from the ninth round RNA pool. From the last two rounds of SELEX, we identified a total of 12 different aptamers that bind CED-9. We further tested their binding affinities for CED-9 using EMSAs and chose the aptamers that bound CED-9 with the highest affinity for further analysis. Five aptamers obtained from these secondary selections are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1.Among the five aptamers, R8-20 was isolated from the round 8 SELEX, and the other four were isolated from round 9. Based on restriction enzyme fingerprinting analysis, these aptamers are likely the most abundant RNAs in the last two rounds of SELEX. Therefore further rounds of selection would not likely yield significantly different pools of aptamers. Two of the five aptamers, R8-20 and R9-7, differ by only 3 nucleotides (Table 1). Because these two aptamers were isolated from consecutive rounds of selection, our SELEX method appears to be able to enrich for specific binders of CED-9 as shown by increased frequency of their isolations (3 of 30 for R8-20 and 9 of 30 for R9-7, respectively; Table 1). EMSAs indicated that all these aptamers bound CED-9 very well (Fig. 1B). Interestingly R9-2 had slightly higher CED-9 binding affinity than the other aptamers, although the frequency of R9-2 isolation was not as high as those of other aptamers (Fig. 1B and Table 1). It is likely that R9-2 will be enriched with more rounds of selection.To further characterize these CED-9 aptamers, we used the Mfold program to predict secondary structures of these aptamers. Based on the predictions, these five aptamers can be categorized into three groups. Group A includes R8-20, R9-7, and R9-4, which have very similar trifoliolate stem-loop structures. Group B has R9-2 and Group C includes R9-8, both of which contain rodlike stem-loop structures (Fig. 1C). The different predicted secondary structures of these aptamers suggest that they may have different CED-9 binding properties. Again the similarity of secondary structures within each aptamer group indicates that our SELEX enriched specific aptamers for CED-9. In the studies described below, we chose R9-7 from group A that is relatively more abundant and R9-2 from group B that has very good binding affinity to CED-9 for more detailed analyses.R9-2 and R9-7 Aptamers Bind to Overlapping Sites on CED-9—We first determined the binding affinity of R9-2 or R9-7 to CED-9 using competition-based EMSA. In these assays, 32P-labeled aptamer/CED-9 complexes were incubated with increasing amounts of unlabeled aptamer, and the amounts of labeled aptamer that remained in aptamer/CED-9 complexes were monitored. The disassociation constant (Kd) of CED-9/R9-2 complexes measured using this assay was ∼4 nm, whereas the Kd for R9-7/CED-9 complexes was ∼16 nm (data not shown). Based on the Mfold predictions, R9-2 and R9-7 have different secondary structures and may bind to different surface regions of CED-9. We therefore tested whether these two aptamers bind to the same surface regions of CED-9 by performing a modified competition EMSA in which unlabeled R9-7 was incubated with 32P-labeled R9-2/CED-9 complexes or vice versa. As shown in Fig. 2A, R9-7 could compete with R9-2 for binding to CED-9, although at least 4-fold excess of cold R9-7 was required for this competition. Similarly R9-2 could efficiently compete away the binding between R9-7 and CED-9, but much less cold R9-2 was needed for the competition (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that R9-2 and R9-7 may contact CED-9 at overlapping sites. However, it is also possible that the binding of one aptamer to another CED-9/aptamer complex could induce a conformational change in CED-9 that causes dissociation of the other aptamer. In such a scenario, the two aptamers could bind to different regions of CED-9 but still effectively compete with each other for CED-9 binding. To test this possibility, we performed limited proteolytic digestion of CED-9 or CED-9/aptamer complex with trypsin and monitored the digestion patterns using gel electrophoresis. The CED-9 trypsin digestion patterns were essentially the same with or without aptamers (data not shown), suggesting that no obvious CED-9 conformational change was induced by the binding of the aptamers. In contrast, binding of EGL-1 to CED-9 induces conformational changes of CED-9 (11Yan N. Gu L. Kokel D. Chai J. Li W. Han A. Chen L. Xue D. Shi Y. Mol.

Taken together, these observations suggest that these two aptamers bind to the same or overlapping regions on CED-9 despite having different predicted secondary structures.FIGURE 2Aptamers R9-2 and R9-7 compete with each other for binding to CED-9. A, approximately 8 nm 32P-labeled R9-2 was incubated with CED-9(1–250)-His6 (500 nm) in the presence of increasing concentrations (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 nm) of unlabeled R9-7 at 30 °C for 30 min and separated with a 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel.

It has been suggested that CED-9 inhibits cell death by binding to and tethering the proapoptotic protein CED-4 onto the surface of mitochondria (34Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M.

In cells that are doomed to die, the cell death initiator EGL-1 is transcriptionally up-regulated and then binds to CED-9, resulting in the release of CED-4 from the CED-9/CED-4 complex, which then promotes the activation of the CED-3 caspase (11Yan N.

To evaluate the potential effects of CED-9 aptamers on cell death, we tested whether CED-9 aptamers interfere with the interactions of CED-9 with EGL-1 and CED-4. Using EMSA, we found that EGL-1 could form a ternary complex with CED-9/R9-2 or CED-9/R9-7 as indicated by the supershifted CED-9/aptamer complexes following addition of EGL-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Because EGL-1 alone did not interact with either of these aptamers, these results suggest that EGL-1 and R9-2 (or R9-7) likely bind to different regions of CED-9. In contrast, recombinant CED-4 failed to supershift the CED-9/aptamer complexes (Fig. 3C), suggesting that CED-4 probably could not form higher order complexes with CED-9 and its aptamers.FIGURE 3EGL-1 but not CED-4 forms a ternary complex with CED-9 and its aptamers.
