We show that a clinical stage multivalent SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain nanoparticle (RBD-NP) vaccine protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge after a single immunization, indicating a potential dose-sparing strategy. We benchmarked serum neutralizing activity elicited by RBD-NPs in non-human primates against a lead prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (HexaPro) using a panel of circulating mutants. Polyclonal antibodies elicited by both vaccines are similarly resilient to many RBD residue substitutions tested, although mutations at and surrounding position 484 have negative consequences for neutralization. Mosaic and cocktail nanoparticle immunogens displaying multiple sarbecovirus RBDs elicit broad neutralizing activity in mice and protect mice against SARS-CoV challenge even in the absence of SARS-CoV RBD in the vaccine. This study provides proof of principle that multivalent sarbecovirus RBD-NPs induce heterotypic protection and motivates advancing such broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines to the clinic."

This study aimed to investigate the association between stress and turnover intention among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia and whether social support could affect this association. In this cross-sectional study, healthcare workers in primary healthcare centers in Saudi Arabia responded to an online questionnaire assessing their sociodemographic and occupational history, stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), social support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and turnover intention within the next few months. Path analysis was conducted to assess the mediating effect of social support on the association between stress and turnover intention. A total of 1101 healthcare workers (242 physicians, 340 nurses, 310 paramedics, and 209 administrative workers) participated in this study. The path between stress and support had a significant standardized regression weight (-.34, p < .05). The path between support and turnover had a significant standardized regression weight (.08, p < .05). The standardized total effect of stress on turnover without the impact of support was significant (-.39, p < .05). The direct effect of stress on turnover with the presence of support was significant (-.36, p < .05). The indirect effect of stress on turnover with the presence of support was significant (-.03, p < .05). Thus, there is evidence to show that support mediates the relationship between stress and support. Stress is associated with turnover intention among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. Social support had a mitigating effect on the relationship between stress and turnover intention."

To obtain a functional model of the human intestinal epithelium for studying toxin-induced disease mechanisms, differentiated enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells were co-cultured with goblet cell-like HT29-MTX cells. These co-cultures formed a functional epithelial barrier, as characterized by a high electrical resistance and the presence of physiological intestinal properties such as glucose transport and chloride secretion which could be demonstrated electrophysiologically and by measuring protein expression. When the tissues were exposed to cholera toxin or heat-labile enterotoxin in the Ussing chamber, cholera toxin incubation resulted in an increase in short-circuit currents, indicating an increase in apical chloride secretion. This is in line with typical cholera toxin-induced secretory diarrhea in humans, while heat-labile enterotoxin only showed an increase in short-circuit-current in Caco-2 cells. This study characterizes for the first time the simultaneous measurement of physiological properties on a functional and structural level combined with the epithelial responses to bacterial toxins. In conclusion, using this model, physiological responses of the intestine to bacterial toxins can be investigated and characterized. Therefore, this model can serve as an alternative to the use of laboratory animals for characterizing pathophysiological mechanisms of enterotoxins at the intestinal level."
https://openalex.org/W3201681642,"Fibrates and omega-3 polyunsaturated acids are used for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia but have not demonstrated consistent effects on cardiovascular (CV) risk. In this study, we investigate how these two pharmacological agents influence plasma levels of bioactive lipid mediators, aiming to explore their efficacy beyond that of lipid-lowering agents. Plasma from overweight patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hypertriglyceridemia, participating in a randomized placebo-controlled study investigating the effects of 12 weeks treatment with fenofibrate or omega-3 free carboxylic acids (OM-3CA) (200 mg or 4 g per day, respectively), were analyzed for eicosanoids and related PUFA species, N-acylethanolamines (NAE) and ceramides. OM-3CA reduced plasma concentrations of proinflammatory PGE2 , as well as PGE1 , PGD1 and thromboxane B2 but increased prostacyclin, and eicosapentaenoic acid- and docosahexaenoic acid-derived lipids of lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) (e.g., 17-HDHA, 18-HEPE, 19,20-DiHDPA). Fenofibrate reduced plasma concentrations of vasoactive CYP-derived eicosanoids (DHETs). Although OM-3CA increased plasma levels of the NAE docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine and docosapentaenoyl ethanolamine, and fenofibrate increased palmitoleoyl ethanolamine, the effect of both treatments may have been masked by the placebo (olive oil). Fenofibrate was more efficacious than OM-3CA in significantly reducing plasma ceramides, pro-inflammatory lipids associated with CV disease risk. Neither treatment affected putative lipid species associated with NAFLD. Our results show that OM-3CA and fenofibrate differentially modulate the plasma mediator lipidome, with OM-3CA promoting the formation of lipid mediators with potential effects on chronic inflammation, while fenofibrate mainly reducing ceramides. These findings suggest that both treatments could ameliorate chronic inflammation with possible impact on disease outcomes, independent of triglyceride reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3202450591,"Self-aid and mutual assistance among victims are critical for resolving difficulties in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, but individual facilitative factors for such resolution processes are poorly understood. To identify such individual factors in the background (i.e., disaster damage and demographic) and personality domains considering different types of difficulty and resolution, we analyzed survey data collected in the 3-year aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. We first identified major types of difficulty using a cluster analysis of 18 difficulty domains and then explored individual factors that facilitated six types of resolution (self-help, request for help, help from family, help from an acquaintance, help through cooperation, and public assistance) of these difficulty types. We identified general life difficulties and medico-psychological difficulties as two broad types of difficulty; disaster damage contributed to both types, while some personality factors (e.g., neuroticism) exacerbated the latter. Disaster damage hampered self-resolution and forced a reliance on resolution through cooperation or public assistance. On the other hand, some demographic factors, such as being young and living in a three-generation household, facilitated resolution thorough the family. Several personality factors facilitated different types of resolution, primarily of general life difficulties; the problem-solving factor facilitated self-resolution, altruism, or stubbornness resolutions through requests, leadership resolution through acquaintance, and emotion-regulation resolution through public assistance. Our findings are the first to demonstrate the involvement of different individual, particularly personality, factors in survival in the complex social dynamics of this disaster stage. They may contribute to disaster risk mitigation, allowing sophisticated risk evaluation and community resilience building."
https://openalex.org/W3201707625,"The study determined the frequency of dry eye, its clinical subtypes and risk factors among pregnant women. This study was a hospital-based cross-sectional study of pregnant women visiting the antenatal clinic of the University of Cape Coast hospital. Clinical dry eye tests were performed along with the administration of a symptom questionnaire. Frequencies, chi-square analysis and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the frequency of dry eye disease, its clinical subtypes and associated factors. The prevalence of dry eye disease among the cohort of pregnant women was 82/201 (40.8% 95% confidence interval 34.3%-47.3%). Among the 82 pregnant women with dry eye disease, the frequencies of the clinical subtypes of dry eye were: evaporative dry eye [15/82(18.3%; 95% CI, 12.2%-25.2%)], aqueous deficient dry eye [10/82(12.2.%; 95% CI, 7.3%-18.3)], mixed dry eye [6/82(7.3%; 95% CI, 3.7%-11.0%)], and unclassified dry eye [51/82(62.2%; 95% CI, 52.4%-72.0%)]. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors were not significantly associated with dry eye: age, BMI, lipid profile, prolactin level, testosterone level, ocular protection index and blink rate. Only gestational age was significantly associated with dry eye disease in pregnancy. In conclusion, the current study showed that dry eye disease occurs frequently in pregnant women ranging from the first to the third trimester and it is associated with increasing gestational age. The evaporative dry eye was more common compared to the aqueous deficient dry eye, but most dry eye could not be classified."
https://openalex.org/W3204099474,"International collaborations have become the standard model for global health research and often include researchers and institutions from high income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While such collaborations are important for generating new knowledge that will help address global health inequities, there is evidence to suggest that current forms of collaboration may reproduce unequal power relations. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study with scientists, researchers and those involved in research management, working in international health collaborations. Interviews were conducted between October 2019 and March 2020. We conducted 13 interviews with 15 participants. From our findings, we derive three major themes. First, our results reflect characteristics of equitable, collaborative research relationships. Here we find both relational features, specifically trust and belonging, and structural features, including clear contractual agreements, capacity building, inclusive divisions of labour, and the involvement of local communities. Second, we discuss obstacles to develop equitable collaborations. These include exclusionary labour practices, donor-driven research agendas, overall research culture, lack of accountability and finally, the inadequate financing of indirect costs for LMIC institutions. Third, we discuss the responsibilities for promoting science equity of funders, LMIC researchers, LMIC institutions, and LMIC governments. While other empirical studies have suggested similar features of equity, our findings extend these features to include local communities as collaborators in research projects and not only as beneficiaries. We also suggest the importance of funders paying for indirect costs, without which the capacity of LMIC institutions will continually erode. And finally, our study shows the responsibilities of LMIC actors in developing equitable collaborations, which have largely been absent from the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3202664002,"As the largest carbon dioxide emitter, China is working towards the direction of a green economy. As an irreplaceable part of establishing a green economy, the low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy is implemented in many large cities in China, and the scope of implementation will be further expanded. However, to date, there has been an absence of empirical studies basing on prefecture-level cities about the evaluation of China’s LCCP policy. Evaluating and optimizing the LCCP policy is constructive to achieve the goal of China’s green economic transition. In this paper, we evaluated the effect of the LCCP policy on China’s low-carbon economic transition by using the difference-in-difference (DID) approach which can effectively alleviate endogenous problems and better evaluate this effect and the panel data of 210 prefecture-level cities in China from 2008 to 2016. The empirical analysis revealed that the LCCP policy inhibited China’s low-carbon economic transition in general. Specifically, the policy worked well in the eastern region but failed in the central region and western region by studying the regional heterogeneity and influence mechanism. The reason is that the LCCP policy can stimulate low-carbon innovation with the help of innovation offset effects in the eastern region, but it failed to do so in the central region and western region. In addition, this paper analyzed the performance of three types of policy tools adopted by local governments to implement the policy, we found that market-economic tools are valuable to improving the low-carbon economic transition in pilot areas, but command-mandatory tools and voluntary tools have failed to achieve the expected objectives. The research results of this article can provide policy recommendations for optimizing the low-carbon policy and provide a reference for countries that are determined to develop a green economy."
https://openalex.org/W3204573125,"Population risks for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia (NH) vary. Knowledge of local risks permits interventions that may reduce the proportion becoming severe. Between January 2015 and May 2016, in a resource-limited setting on the Thailand-Myanmar border, neonates from 28 weeks’ gestation were enrolled into a prospective birth cohort. Each neonate had total serum bilirubin measurements: scheduled (24, 48, 72 and 144 hours of life) and clinically indicated; and weekly follow up until 1 month of age. Risk factors for developing NH were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard mixed model. Of 1710 neonates, 22% (376) developed NH (83% preterm, 19% term). All neonates born &lt;35 weeks, four in five born 35–37 weeks, and three in twenty born ≥38 weeks had NH, giving an overall incidence of 249 per 1000 livebirths [95%CI 225, 403]. Mortality from acute bilirubin encephalopathy was 10% (2/20) amongst the 5.3% (20/376) who reached the severe NH threshold. One-quarter (26.3%) of NH occurred within 24 hours. NH onset varied with gestational age: at a median [IQR] 24 hours [24, 30] for neonates born 37 weeks or prematurely vs 59 hours [48, 84] for neonates born ≥38 weeks. Risk factors for NH in the first week of life independent of gestational age were: neonatal G6PD deficiency, birth bruising, Sgaw Karen ethnicity, primigravidae, pre-eclampsia, and prolonged rupture of membranes. The genetic impact of G6PD deficiency on NH was partially interpreted by using the florescent spot test and further genotyping work is in progress. The risk of NH in Sgaw Karen refugees may be overlooked internationally as they are most likely regarded as Burmese in countries of resettlement. Given high levels of pathological jaundice in the first 24 hours and overall high NH burden, guidelines changes were implemented including preventive PT for all neonates &lt;35 weeks and for those 35–37 weeks with risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3204811761,"Bacterial lipases play important roles during infection. The Staphylococcus aureus genome contains several genes that encode well-characterized lipases and several genes predicted to encode lipases or esterases for which the function has not yet been established. In this study, we sought to define the function of an uncharacterized S . aureus protein, and we propose the annotation S . aureus lipase 3 (SAL3) (SAUSA300_0641). We confirmed that SAL3 is a lipase and that it is surface associated and secreted through an unknown mechanism. We determined that SAL3 specifically hydrolyzes short chain (4-carbon and fewer) fatty acids and specifically binds negatively charged lipids including phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, and phosphatidylglycerol, which is the most abundant lipid in the staphylococcal cell membrane. Mutating the catalytic triad S 66 -A, D 167 -A, S 168 -A, and H 301 -A in the recombinant protein abolished lipase activity without altering binding to host lipid substrates. Taken together we report the discovery of a novel lipase from S . aureus specific to short chain fatty acids with yet to be determined roles in host pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3204556193,"Background In the United States, medical devices are regulated and subject to review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be marketed. Low-to-medium risk novel medical devices can be reviewed under the De Novo umbrella before they can proceed to market, and this process can be fairly cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. An alternate faster and less-expensive pathway to going to market is the 510(k) pathway. In this approach, if the device can be shown to be substantially equivalent in safety and effectiveness to a pre-existing FDA-approved marketed device (or “predicates”), it can be cleared to market. Due to the possibility of daisy-chaining predicate devices, it can very quickly be difficult to unravel the logic and justification of how a particular medical device’s equivalence was established. From patients’ perspective, this minimizes transparency in the process. From a vendor perspective, it can be difficult to determine the right predicate that applies to their device. Methods We map the connectivity of various predicates in the medical device field by applying text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques on data publicly made available by the FDA 78000 device summaries were scraped from the US FDA 510(k) database, and a total of 2,721 devices cleared by the 510(k) regulatory pathway in 2020 were used as a specific case study to map the genealogy of medical devices cleared by the FDA. Cosine similarity was used to gauge the degree of substantial equivalence between two medical devices by evaluating their device descriptions and indications for use. Recalls and complaints for predicate devices were extracted from the FDA’s Total Product Life Cycle database using html scraping and web page optical character recognition to determine the similarity between class 1 recalled devices (the most severe form of device recall) and other substantially equivalent devices. A specific product code was used to illustrate the mapping of the genealogy from a De Novo device. Results and discussion The ancestral tree for the medical devices cleared in 2020 is vast and sparse, with a large number of devices having only 1–2 predicates. Evaluation of substantial equivalence data from 2003–2020 shows that the standard for substantial equivalence has not changed significantly. Studying the recalls and complaints, shows that the insulin infusion pump had the highest number of complaints, yet none of the recalled devices bore significant degree of text similarity to currently marketed devices. The mapping from the De Novo device case study was used to develop an ancestry map from the recalled predicate (recalled due to design flaws) to current substantially equivalent products in the market. Conclusions Besides enabling a better understanding of the risks and benefits of the 510(k) process, mapping of connectivity of various predicates could help increase consumer confidence in the medical devices that are currently in the marketplace."
https://openalex.org/W3201832082,"Autoimmunity contributes to the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis (VMC), which is characterized by the production of anti-heart autoantibodies (AHA) from lymphoid follicles. Recently, the formation of ectopic lymphoid follicles (ELFs) was reported in heart grafts. However, the existence and role of ELFs in myocardial tissues of VMC remain unclear. This study aimed to explore whether and how cardiac ELFs with germinal centers (GCs) could be generated during the development of VMC. We identified the existence of ELFs and explored the underlying mechanism. In a BALB/c mouse model of VMC, the dynamic myocardial infiltrations of lymphocytic aggregates and expressions of associated lymphorganogenic factors were investigated, accompanied by the detection of the production and location of myocardial AHA. The data indicated ELFs formation in myocardial tissues of VMC, and the number of ELFs was in accordance with the severity of VMC. Moreover, the functional ELFs with GCs were capable of facilitating the production of local AHA. Blocking IL-17 or podoplanin (PDPN) could inhibit cardiac ELFs generation, perhaps due to the negative regulation of PDPN neutralization in Th17 cell proliferation and differentiation. The presence of cardiac ELFs and AHA might offer new opportunities for stratification and early identification of VMC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3202122246,"Proper protection of vascular access after haemodialysis is one of the key measures for the prevention of catheter-related infections. Various substances with bactericidal and anticoagulant properties are used to fill catheters, but due to the unsatisfactory clinical effects and occurrence of adverse reactions, the search for new substances is still ongoing. In the present paper, we compared the in vitro antimicrobial activity of solutions used for tunnelled catheter locking (taurolidine, trisodium citrate) and solutions of substances that could potentially be used for this purpose (sodium bicarbonate, polyhexanide-betaine). The studies have been conducted on bacteria that most commonly cause catheter-related infections. The values of both minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum biofilm eradication concentration of the substances were determined. The ability of the tested substances to eradicate biofilm from the dialysis catheter surface was also evaluated. The results showed that polyhexanide-betaine inhibited the growth of all microbes comparably to taurolidine, even after ≥ 32-fold dilution. The activity of trisodium citrate and sodium bicarbonate was significantly lower. Polyhexanide exhibited the highest activity in the eradication of bacterial biofilm on polystyrene plates. The biofilm formed on a polyurethane dialysis catheter was resistant to complete eradication by the test substances. Polyhexanide-betaine and taurolidine showed the highest activity. Inhibition of bacterial growth regardless of species was observed not only at the highest concentration of these compounds but also after dilution 32–128x (taurolidine) and 32–1024x (polyhexanide-betaine). Therefore, it can be assumed that taurolidine application as a locking solution prevents catheter colonization and systemic infection development. Taurolidine displays high antimicrobial efficacy against Gram-positive cocci as well as Gram-negative bacilli. On the contrary, the lowest antibacterial effect displayed product contained sodium bicarbonate. The inhibitions of bacterial growth were not satisfactory to consider it as a substance for colonization prevention. Polyhexanidine-betaine possessed potent inhibitory and biofilm eradication properties comparing to all tested products. PHMB is applied as a wound irrigation solution worldwide. However, based on our results, we assume that the PHMB is a promising substance for catheter locking solutions thanks to its safety and high antimicrobial properties."
https://openalex.org/W3203565397,"The ectodysplasin receptor (EDAR) is a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF) superfamily member. A substitution in an exon of EDAR at position 370 (EDARV370A) creates a gain of function mutant present at high frequencies in Asian and Indigenous American populations but absent in others. Its frequency is intermediate in populations of Mexican ancestry. EDAR regulates the development of ectodermal tissues, including mammary ducts. Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are prevalent in people with Indigenous and Latino ancestry. Latino patients also have altered prevalence and presentation of breast cancer. It is unknown whether EDARV370A might connect these phenomena. The goals of this study were to determine 1) whether EDARV370A is associated with metabolic phenotypes and 2) if there is altered breast anatomy in women carrying EDARV370A. Participants were from two Latino cohorts, the Arizona Insulin Resistance (AIR) registry and Sangre por Salud (SPS) biobank. The frequency of EDARV370A was 47% in the Latino cohorts. In the AIR registry, carriers of EDARV370A (GG homozygous) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher plasma triglycerides, VLDL, ALT, 2-hour post-challenge glucose, and a higher prevalence of prediabetes/diabetes. In a subset of the AIR registry, serum levels of ectodysplasin A2 (EDA-A2) also were associated with HbA1c and prediabetes (p < 0.05). For the SPS biobank, participants that were carriers of EDARV370A had lower breast density and higher HbA1c (both p < 0.05). The significant associations with measures of glycemia remained when the cohorts were combined. We conclude that EDARV370A is associated with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome and breast density in Latinos."
https://openalex.org/W3176004165,"Bigheaded Carp have spread throughout the Mississippi River basin since the 1970s. Little has stopped the spread as carp have the ability to pass through locks and dams, and they are currently approaching the Great Lakes. However, the location of the leading edge in the Illinois River has stalled for over a decade, even though there is no barrier preventing further advancement towards the Great Lakes. Defining why carp are not moving towards the Great Lakes is important for predicting why they might advance in the future. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic contaminants in the Illinois River may be playing a role in preventing further upstream movement of Bigheaded Carp. Ninety three livers were collected from carp at several locations between May and October of 2018. Liver samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a targeted metabolite profiling approach. Livers from carp at the leading edge had differences in energy use and metabolism, and suppression of protective mechanisms relative to downstream fish; differences were consistent across time. This body of work provides evidence that water quality is linked to carp movement in the Illinois River. As water quality in this region continues to improve, consideration of this impact on carp spread is essential to protect the Great Lakes."

In this first single-cell RNA-seq study of tetramer-sorted T cells from untreated celiac disease patients blood, we found that gluten-specific T cells showed distinct transcriptomic profiles consistent with activated effector memory T cells that shared features with Th1 and follicular helper T cells. Compared to non-specific cells, gluten-specific T cells showed differential expression of several genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling, translational processes, apoptosis, fatty acid transport, and redox potentials. Many of the gluten-specific T cells studied shared T-cell receptor with each other, indicating that circulating gluten-specific T cells belong to a limited number of clones. Moreover, the transcriptional profiles of cells that shared the same clonal origin were transcriptionally more similar compared with between clonally unrelated gluten-specific cells."
https://openalex.org/W3202213814,"The objective of this study was to examine the link between systemic and general psychosocial stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a group of U.S. Latinos as a function of acculturation and education within the blended guiding conceptual framework of the biopsychosocial model of the stress process plus the reserve capacity model. We analyzed data from self-identifying Mexican-origin adults ( n = 396, 56.9% female, M age = 58.2 years, 55.5% &lt; 12 years of education, 79% U.S.-born) from the Texas City Stress and Health Study. We used established measures of perceived stress (general stress), neighborhood stress and discrimination (systemic stress) to capture psychosocial stress, our primary predictor. We used the atherosclerotic CVD calculator to assess 10-year CVD risk, our primary outcome. This calculator uses demographics, cholesterol, blood pressure, and history of hypertension, smoking, and diabetes to compute CVD risk in the next 10 years. We also created an acculturation index using English-language use, childhood interaction, and preservation of cultural values. Participants reported years of education. Contrary to expectations, findings showed that higher levels of all three forms of psychosocial stress, perceived stress, neighborhood stress, and perceived discrimination, predicted lower 10-year CVD risk. Acculturation and education did not moderate the effects of psychosocial stress on 10-year CVD risk. Contextualized within the biopsychosocial and reserve capacity framework, we interpret our findings such that participants who accurately reported their stressors may have turned to their social networks to handle the stress, thereby reducing their risk for CVD. We highlight the importance of examining strengths within the sociocultural environment when considering cardiovascular inequities among Latinos."
https://openalex.org/W3203552384,"Background Enterobacter species are an important cause of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (BSI) in children. Up to 19% of adult patients with Enterobacter BSI have recurrence of infection resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) while on therapy with a 3GC. Data are lacking regarding the incidence of and risk factors for recurrence of infection in children with Enterobacter BSI. Methods We conducted a retrospective case-control study of patients aged ≤21 years old admitted to Texas Children’s Hospital from January 2012 through December 2018 with Enterobacter BSI. The primary outcome was microbiologic failure from 72 hours to 30 days after the initial BSI (cases). The secondary outcome was isolation of a 3GC non-susceptible Enterobacter sp . from a patient with an initial 3GC-susceptible isolate. Results Twelve patients (6.7%) had microbiologic failure compared to 167 controls without microbiologic failure. Of the 138 patients (77.1%) with an Enterobacter sp . isolate that was initially susceptible to 3GCs, 3 (2.2%) developed a subsequent infection with a non-susceptible isolate. Predictors of microbiologic failure were having an alternative primary site of infection besides bacteremia without a focus or an urinary tract infection (OR, 9.64; 95% CI, 1.77–52.31; P &lt; 0.01) and inadequate source control (OR, 22.16; 95% CI, 5.26–93.36; P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Source of infection and adequacy of source control are important considerations in preventing microbiologic failure. In-vitro susceptibilities can be used to select an antibiotic regimen for the treatment of Enterobacte r BSI in children."
https://openalex.org/W3203640428,"Although wildfires are an important ecological process in forested regions worldwide, they can cause significant economic damage and frequently create widespread health impacts. We propose a network optimization approach to plan wildfire fuel treatments that minimize the risk of fire spread in forested landscapes under an upper bound for total treated area. We used simulation modeling to estimate the probability of fire spread between pairs of forest sites and formulated a modified Critical Node Detection (CND) model that uses these estimated probabilities to find a pattern of fuel reduction treatments that minimizes the likely spread of fires across a landscape. We also present a problem formulation that includes control of the size and spatial contiguity of fuel treatments. We demonstrate the approach with a case study in Kootenay National Park, British Columbia, Canada, where we investigated prescribed burn options for reducing the risk of wildfire spread in the park area. Our results provide new insights into cost-effective planning to mitigate wildfire risk in forest landscapes. The approach should be applicable to other ecosystems with frequent wildfires."
https://openalex.org/W3203849430,"The firefly algorithm (FA) is proposed as a heuristic algorithm, inspired by natural phenomena. The FA has attracted a lot of attention due to its effectiveness in dealing with various global optimization problems. However, it could easily fall into a local optimal value or suffer from low accuracy when solving high-dimensional optimization problems. To improve the performance of the FA, this paper adds the self-adaptive logarithmic inertia weight to the updating formula of the FA, and proposes the introduction of a minimum attractiveness of a firefly, which greatly improves the convergence speed and balances the global exploration and local exploitation capabilities of FA. Additionally, a step-size decreasing factor is introduced to dynamically adjust the random step-size term. When the dimension of a search is high, the random step-size becomes very small. This strategy enables the FA to explore solution more accurately. This improved FA (LWFA) was evaluated with ten benchmark test functions under different dimensions (D = 10, 30, and 100) and with standard IEEE CEC 2010 benchmark functions. Simulation results show that the performance of improved FA is superior comparing to the standard FA and other algorithms, i.e., particle swarm optimization, the cuckoo search algorithm, the flower pollination algorithm, the sine cosine algorithm, and other modified FA. The LWFA also has high performance and optimal efficiency for a number of optimization problems."
https://openalex.org/W3120056911,"Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is a classic form of allergen-specific immunotherapy that is used to treat birch pollen induced allergic asthma. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of SCIT, we aimed to profile lung samples to explore changes in the differential proteome before and after SCIT in mice with allergic asthma. Fresh lungs were collected from three groups of female BALB/c mice: 1) control mice, 2) birch pollen-induced allergic mice, and 3) birch pollen-induced allergic mice with SCIT. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze the lung proteome in the mice. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and Gene Ontology (GO) classification analysis were applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and crucial pathways. The screened DEPs were validated by immunohistochemistry analysis. A total of 317 proteins were upregulated and 184 proteins were downregulated in the asthma group compared to those of the control group. In contrast, 639 DEPs (163 upregulated and 456 downregulated proteins) were identified after SCIT in comparison with those of the asthma group. Among the 639 DEPs, 277 proteins returned to similar levels as those of the relative non-asthma condition. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the 277 proteins played a significant role in the leukocyte extravasation signaling pathway. The leukocyte extravasation signaling pathway and related DEPs were of crucial importance in birch pollen SCIT."

Thirty-six of these participants received 50 Gy of conventional irradiation in 25 fractions over 5 weeks to the whole breast with a sequential boost to the tumor bed with 10–16 Gy in 5–8 fractions (Conv-SEQ). The other 37 participants received a hypofractionated dose of 43.2 Gy in 16 fractions with an additional daily concomitant boost (CB) of 0.6 Gy over 3 weeks (Hypo-CB). Results At a median follow-up time of 123 months, ipsilateral local recurrence (ILR) was found in 3 participants, 1 of whom was in the hypofractionated group. All 3 ILR were true local recurrence (TR). There were no significant differences in the 10-year disease free survival (DFS) and 10-year overall survival rates (OS) between the conventional and hypofractionated groups (93.9% vs . 94.4%, p = 0.96 and 91.9% vs . 91.6%, p = 0.792, respectively). Conclusion This study showed that the effectiveness, DFS and OS were comparable between hypofractionated whole breast irradiation with a CB and the conventional irradiation with a sequential boost."
https://openalex.org/W3201856632,"Objectives The aims of this study were to compare the initial implant stability obtained using four different osteotomy techniques in low-density synthetic bone, to evaluate the instrument design in comparison to the implant design, and to determinate a possible correlation between the insertion torque and initial stability quotient (ISQ). Materials and methods Four groups were identified in accordance with the osteotomy technique used (n = 10 implants per group): group G1, osteotomy using the recommended drilling sequence; group G2, osteotomy using an undersized compactor drill; group G3, osteotomy using an undersized drill; and group G4, osteotomy using universal osseodensification drills. Two polyurethane blocks were used: block 1, with a medullary portion of 10 pounds per cubic foot (PCF 10) and with a 1 mm cortical portion of PCF 40, and block 2, with a medullary of PCF 15 and with a 2 mm cortical portion of PCF 40. Tapered implants of 4 mm in diameter and 11 mm in length were used. The insertion torque (IT) and ISQ were measured. The dimensions of the final instrument used in each group and the dimensions of the implant were used to calculate the total area of each part, and these data were compared. Results Differences between the four groups were found for IT and ISQ values depending on the technique used for the osteotomy in the two synthetic bone models (p &lt; 0.0001). All groups showed lower values of initial stability in block 1 than in block 2. Conclusions Undersized osteotomies with instruments designed according to the implant body significantly increased the initial stability values compared to beds prepared with universal drills and using the drilling sequence standardized by the manufacturer."
https://openalex.org/W3202214968,"Serrasalmidae has high morphological and chromosomal diversity. Based on molecular hypotheses, the family is currently divided into two subfamilies, Colossomatinae and Serrasalminae, with Serrasalminae composed of two tribes: Myleini (comprising most of pacus species) and Serrasalmini (represented by Metynnis , Catoprion , and remaining piranha’s genera). This study aimed to analyze species of the tribes Myleini ( Myloplus asterias , M . lobatus , M . rubripinnis , M . schomburgki , and Tometes camunani ) and Serrasalmini ( Metynnis cuiaba , M . hypsauchen , and M . longipinnis ) using classical and molecular cytogenetic techniques in order to understand the chromosomal evolution of the family. The four species of the genus Myloplus and T . camunani presented 2n = 58 chromosomes, while the species of Metynnis presented 2n = 62 chromosomes. The distribution of heterochromatin occurred predominantly in pericentromeric regions in all species. Tometes camunani and Myloplus spp. presented only one site with 5S rDNA. Multiple markers of 18S rDNA were observed in T . camunani , M . asterias , M . lobatus , M . rubripinnis , and M . schomburgkii . For Metynnis , however, synteny of the 18S and 5S rDNA was observed in the three species, in addition to an additional 5S marker in M . longipinnis . These data, when superimposed on the phylogeny of the family, suggest a tendency to increase the diploid chromosome number from 54 to 62 chromosomes, which occurred in a nonlinear manner and is the result of several chromosomal rearrangements. In addition, the different karyotype formulas and locations of ribosomal sequences can be used as cytotaxonomic markers and assist in the identification of species."
https://openalex.org/W3203029536,"Background Characterization of populations at risk of acquiring HIV is required to inform the public health response to HIV. To identify potential changing needs in HIV prevention and care cascade, we aim to describe how the demographic profiles and exposure categories of newly diagnosed HIV positive individuals attending a large sexual health clinic in Montréal (Canada) evolved since the beginning of the antiretroviral therapy era in the mid-1990s. Methods Using diagnosis data from participants of the Clinique médicale l’Actuel cohort of HIV-positive patients, we examined the distribution of exposure categories (sexual orientation, sexual behaviours, injection drug use, being born in an HIV-endemic country) by gender and year of diagnosis. Time trends in mean age and in the proportion of patients with late (CD4 &lt;350 cells/μL) or advanced stage (CD4 &lt;200 cells/μL) of HIV infection at diagnosis were assessed through meta-regressions. Results A total of 2,612 patients diagnosed with HIV between January 1 st , 1995 and December 31 st , 2019 were included. Overall, mean age was 35 years (standard deviation: 10 years) and remained stable over time. The proportion of patients with advanced stage of HIV infection decreased from 16% in 1995 to 4% in 2019. Although men who have sex with men (MSM) consistently accounted for the highest proportion of new diagnoses (77%, 2,022/2,612 overall), their proportion decreased since 2013. There was also a concomitant decrease in the proportion of people who inject drugs, with none of the newly diagnosed participants reporting injection drug use since 2017, and an important increase in the proportion of patients born in an HIV-endemic country (24%, 7/29 in 2019), especially among women. Compared to patients from non-endemic countries, those from HIV-endemic countries were characterized by higher proportions of heterosexuals (88% vs 17%) and of women (52% vs 7%), and were twice likely to get diagnosed at an advanced stage of HIV infection (32% vs 15%). Conclusions In absolute numbers, MSM continue to account for the largest exposure category. However, patients from HIV-endemic countries, who tend to be diagnosed at later stages of HIV infection, constitute an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed individuals. These persons could face distinct barriers to rapid diagnosis. Tailoring HIV testing strategies and other prevention interventions to the specific unmet prevention needs of these individuals is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3203666924,"Successful implementation of medical technologies applied in life-threatening conditions, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) requires appropriate preparation and training of medical personnel. The pandemic has accelerated the creation of new ECMO centers and has highlighted continuous training in adapting to new pandemic standards. To reach high standards of patients' care, we created the first of its kind, National Education Centre for Artificial Life Support (NEC-ALS) in 40 million inhabitants' country in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The role of the Center is to test and promote the novel or commonly used procedures as well as to develop staff skills on management of patients needing ECMO.In 2020, nine approved and endorsed by ELSO courses of ""Artificial Life Support with ECMO"" were organized. Physicians participated in the three-day high-fidelity simulation-based training that was adapted to abide by the social distancing norms of the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge as well as crucial cognitive, behavioral and technical aspects (on a 5-point Likert scale) of management on ECMO were assessed before and after course completion. Moreover, the results of training in mechanical chest compression were also evaluated.There were 115 participants (60% men) predominantly in the age of 30-40 years. Majority of them (63%) were anesthesiologists or intensivists with more than 5-year clinical experience, but 54% had no previous ECMO experience. There was significant improvement after the course in all cognitive, behavioral, and technical self-assessments. Among aspects of management with ECMO that all increased significantly following the course, the most pronounced was related to the technical one (from approximately 1.0 to more 4.0 points). Knowledge scores significantly increased post-course from 11.4 ± SD to 13 ± SD (out of 15 points). The quality of manual chest compression relatively poor before course improved significantly after training.Our course confirmed that simulation as an educational approach is invaluable not only in training and testing of novel or commonly used procedures, skills upgrading, but also in practicing very rare cases. The implementation of the education program during COVID-19 pandemic may be helpful in founding specialized Advanced Life Support centers and teams including mobile ones. The dedicated R&D Innovation Ecosystem established in the ""ECMO for Greater Poland"" program, with developed National Education Center can play a crucial role in the knowledge and know-how transfer but future research is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3201719281,"Late Neolithic Vinča communities, spread over much of central and northern Balkans during the late sixth to mid-fifth millennium BC and characterised by unusually large and densely population centres, would have required highly organised food production systems. Zooarchaeological analysis indicates that domesticate livestock were herded, but little is known about the seasonal husbandry practices that helped ensure a steady supply of animal products to Vinča farming communities. Here, we present new stable carbon (δ 13 C) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotopic measurements of incremental bioapatite samples from the teeth of domesticated livestock and wild herbivore teeth from two late Neolithic Vinča culture sites: Vinča-Belo brdo and Stubline (Serbia). Our results show a low variation overall within sheep and goats in terms of pasture type that may have been composed of seasonal halophyte plant communities, which have higher δ 13 C values due to the saline rich growing environments. Cattle feeding strategies were more variable and provided with supplementary forage, such as cut branches or leafy hay, during winter. The sharp distinction in the management of cattle and sheep/goat may be associated with the development of herding strategies that sought to balance livestock feeding behaviours with available forage or, more provocatively, the emergence of household-based control over cattle–an animal that held a central economic and symbolic role in Vinča societies."
https://openalex.org/W3201926530,"Mathematics teachers must be able to engage in self-reflection and think constructively about their professional activities to instruct students effectively. This is also important for students' ability to solve problems in class, as well as the challenges facing them and their societies in the future. This study aimed to examine in-service math teachers' reflective thinking skills in the context of how they are applied to their understanding of their teaching practices. The sample included 322 mathematics teachers, who responded to a questionnaire designed to elucidate how they were thinking reflectively about their teaching practice. The findings revealed that the teachers' practices concerning all the themes of reflective thinking addressed by the questionnaire, especially their ability to self-assess, fluctuated around the intermediate, and advanced levels. The implications of our findings are discussed in terms of extensive and continuous professional development centered on supporting ongoing growth in the reflective thinking skills of in-service math teachers."
https://openalex.org/W3202128814,"Health information technology systems have the capacity to improve health outcomes for the patients thus ensuring quality and efficient services. Health information systems (HIS) are important tools in guidance towards patient safety and better outcomes. However, still, morbidity and mortality attributed to medical errors remain an important issue that needs to be addressed. The objective of the present study was to assess the health information system in terms of technological, environmental, organizational and human factors affecting the adoption as well as the perceptions of stakeholders along with barriers and constraints related to successful implementation. A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. Prospective data was collected from primary sources by self-administering the pre-validated questionnaires as well as by physical verification of the availability of equipment. After data collection, data was analyzed to assess the health information management systems. The results of the present study showed that the health information system in Pakistan is not up to the mark. The equipment was mostly unavailable at the primary healthcare facilities. The staff was also unsatisfied with the available services. Administrative, financial and human constraints were identified as the major barriers towards successful implementation and management of HIS. The present study concluded that the health information system of Pakistan needs to be revamped. Health information management system partially existed at district and sub-district offices, while was completely absent at tertiary, secondary and primary healthcare levels. The poor adoption of health information technology systems at healthcare facilities might largely be attributed to insufficient human resources with limited resources and budget allocation for health in Pakistan. Effective and timely strategies involving all important stakeholders and healthcare professionals must be designed and implemented at the National level to restructure an affordable, resilient and quality healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W3202219942,"Objective Obesity is a well-known risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), but there is little evidence on the effect of long-term trajectories of body mass index (BMI) over the life course. By using repeated assessments, the aim was to study the risk of CHD in adults during 38 years in different trajectories of BMI. Methods A sample of 2129 men and women, aged 20–59 years at baseline, took part in four repeated interviews between 1980 and 2005. Data on BMI, medical history, lifestyle and socioeconomy were collected. Based on the World Health Organization categories of BMI, life course trajectories of stable normal weight, stable overweight, stable obesity, increasing BMI and fluctuating BMI were created. The individuals were followed through national registers for first hospitalization of CHD (389 events) until the end of 2017, and Hazard Ratios (HRs) were calculated, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors and metabolic comorbidities. Results Stable normal weight in all assessments was the reference group. Those who had an increase in BMI from normal weight in the first assessment to overweight or obesity in later assessments had no increased risk of CHD, HR 1.04 (95% CI: 0.70–1.53). The HR for individuals with fluctuating BMI was 1.25 (0.97–1.61), for stable overweight 1.43 (1.03–1.98), for stable obesity 1.50 (0.92–2.55), and for stable overweight or obesity 1.45 (1.07–1.97), after full adjustments. Conclusion Having a stable overweight or obesity throughout adult life was associated with increased CHD risk but changing from normal weight at baseline to overweight or obesity was not associated with increased CHD risk. Prevention of obesity early in life may be particularly important to reduce CHD risk."
https://openalex.org/W3202489149,"Increasing evidence links prolonged freshwater exposure to adverse health conditions, immune deficiencies, and mortality in delphinids. Pensacola, Florida, experienced a record-breaking flood event in April 2014, after which, skin lesions evident of freshwater exposure were observed on common bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ). Here we assess the potential consequences of the flood on bottlenose dolphin health and mortality. Data from an ongoing study were used to evaluate the relationship between skin lesions (progression, prevalence, and extent) and the flood with respect to changing environmental conditions (salinity). Annual stranding records (2012–2016) from Alabama to the eastern Florida Panhandle were used as an indicator of dolphin health to test the hypothesis that the flood event resulted in increased annual mortality rates. Although salinities remained low for several months, results suggest that there was not the widespread skin lesion outbreak anticipated. Of the 333 unique individuals detected only 20% were seen with skin lesions. There was a significant increase in the proportion of dolphins seen post-flood with lesion extent above background levels (≥ 5%; p = 0.001), however, there were only 11 cases with lesion extent greater than 20%. Skin lesion prevalence increased overall following the flood ( p &lt; 0.001), but pairwise comparisons revealed a delayed response with significant increases not detected until the following fall ( p = 0.01), several months after salinities returned to expected levels. Regression modeling revealed no significant effects of year, region, or year x region on mortality rates, except in Alabama, where increased mortality rates were likely due to residual impacts from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. This study takes advantage of a natural experiment, highlighting how little is understood about the conditions in which prolonged freshwater exposure leads to negative impacts on dolphin health."
https://openalex.org/W3202649528,"Introduction Congestion in emergency departments [ED] is a significant challenge worldwide. Any delay in the timely and immediate medical care provided in the ED can affect patient morbidity and mortality. Our research analyzed the use of an innovative platform to improve patient navigation in the ED, as well as provide updated information about their care. Our hope is that this can improve ED efficiency and improve overall patient care. Objective The primary objective of our study was to determine whether the use of an automatic push notification system can shorten ‘length of stay’ (LOS) in the ED, improve patient flow, and decrease ED patient load. Methods This was a prospective cohort study utilizing data extrapolated from the electronic medical records of 2972 patients who visited the walk-in ED of a large-scale central hospital in Israel from January 17, 2021 to March 15, 2021. During this period, the automatic push text notification system was activated on a week-on week-off basis. We compared data from our experimental group with the control group. Results The results of this study indicate that the use of an automatic push notification system had a minimal impact on specific parameters of ED patient flow. Apart from a few significant reductions of specific timed-intervals during patients’ ED visit, the majority of results were not statistically significant. Conclusion This study concluded that the anticipated benefits of a push text notification system in the ED do not, at this stage, justify the system’s additional cost. We recommend a follow-up study to further investigate other possible benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3203555065,"In southern Ontario, Canada, the two-spotted spider mite ( Tetranychus urticae ) is an emerging pest of soybean ( Glycine max ) due to the increasing incidence of warmer, drier weather conditions. One key strategy to manage soybean pests is breeding resistant cultivars. Resistance to pathogens and herbivores in soybean has been associated with isoflavonoid phytoalexins, a group of specialized metabolites commonly associated with root, leaf and seed tissues. A survey of 18 Ontario soybean cultivars for spider mite resistance included evaluations of antibiosis and tolerance in relation to isoflavonoid and other metabolites detected in the leaves. Ten-day and 4-week trials beginning with early growth stage plants were used to compare survival, growth, fecundity as well as damage to leaves. Two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) counts were correlated with HPLC measurements of isoflavonoid concentration in the leaves and global metabolite profiling by high resolution LC-MS to identify other metabolites unique to the most resistant (R) and susceptible (S) cultivars. Within 10 days, no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) in resistance to TSSM was determined between cultivars, but after 4 weeks, one cultivar, OAC Avatar, was revealed to have the lowest number of adult TSSMs and their eggs. Other cultivars showing partial resistance included OAC Wallace and OAC Lakeview, while Pagoda was the most tolerant to TSSM feeding. A low, positive correlation between isoflavonoid concentrations and TSSM counts and feeding damage indicated these compounds alone do not explain the range of resistance or tolerance observed. In contrast, other metabolite features were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) in R versus S cultivars. In the presence of TSSM, the R cultivars had significantly greater (P&lt;0.05) concentrations of the free amino acids Trp, Val, Thr, Glu, Asp and His relative to S cultivars. Furthermore, the R cultivar metabolites detected are viable targets for more in-depth analysis of their potential roles in TSSM defense."
https://openalex.org/W3203879031,"Objective Patients who undergo Fontan surgery for complex cardiac anomalies are prone to developing liver and gastrointestinal complications. In particular, gastroesophageal varices (GEVs) can occur, but their prevalence is unknown. We aimed to elucidate the occurrence of GEVs and the predicting parameters of GEVs in these patients. Materials and methods Twenty-seven patients (median age, 14.8 years; median time since surgery, 12.9 years) who had undergone the Fontan surgery and were examined by abdominal dynamic computed tomography (CT) for the routine follow-up were included in the study. Radiological findings including GEVs and extraintestinal complications were retrospectively evaluated by experienced radiologists in a blinded manner. Relationships between blood-biochemical and demographic parameters and the presence of GEVs were statistically analyzed. Results Dynamic CT revealed gastric varices (n = 3, 11.1%), esophageal varices (n = 1, 3.7%), and gastrorenal shunts (n = 5, 18.5%). All patients with gastric varices had gastrorenal shunts. All gastric varices were endoscopically confirmed as being isolated and enlarged, with indications for preventive interventional therapy. A platelet count lower than 119 × 10 9 /L was identified as a predictor of GEV (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.946; sensitivity, 100%; and specificity, 87%). Conclusions GEVs are important complications that should not be ignored in patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure. Platelet counts lower than 119 × 10 9 /L may help to prompt patient screening by using abdominal dynamic CT to identify GEVs and their draining collateral veins in these patients."

Knowledge of HPV genotype profiles is important for patients care and HPV vaccination implementation. The objective of this study was to describe HPV genotype distribution and risk factors in a population-based cohort of women in Martinique. In this study, 1312 women were included and underwent cervical cancer screening with successful sample collection between 2009 and 2014. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were recorded. Cytological examination of cervical vaginal smear was performed and classified(Bethesda). Detection of HPV DNA was performed with the PapilloCheck © Kit from Greiner Bio-one. Genotypes were analyzed for18 high-risk HPV (hrHPV) and 6low-risk HPV(lrHPV) types. A total of 1075 women were included with a mean age of 49.1±10.5 years. HPV prevalence was 27.6% (297/1075) with 19.4% (209/1075) women with only hrHPV, 5.3% (57/1075) with only lrHPV. Multiple infections (hrHPV/lrHPV) were detected in 31/240 cases of hrHPV (12.9%). A total of 353 hrHPV genotypes were analyzed; the most common HPV types were HPV51 (11.0%), HPV68 (10.8%), HPV53 (9.1%) and HPV 52 (7.1%). HPV16 and HPV18 represented respectively 4.8% and 4.0% of hrHPV genotypes. Abnormal cytology was observed in 34 cases (3.2%), with 14 ASCUS (1.3%), 10 LSIL (0.9%), 5 HSIL (0.5%), 3 ASC-H (0.3%) and 2 AGC (0.2%). Fifteen (44.1%) were hrHPV and 4 (14.7%) lrHPV; 7 cases of hrPHV were in the age-group 25–34 years. Among 1041cases of normal cytology, 225 had positive hrHPV detection (21.6%). This is the first population-based study of HPV profiles in our country, and we found a high prevalence of hrHPV. The most common genotypes were HPV51, 68, 53. These results could serve for cancer vaccination strategies and HPV surveillance in Martinique."

Objective Parents’ perceptions of being parented in the past and their current parenting as well as adolescents’ perceptions of current parenting were explored applying a multi-method approach. Methods Following written informed consent, a total of 24 interviews with 10 families (dyads of 14 parents and ten adolescents) from Udupi taluk in southern India was conducted. In the first stage, in-depth interviews were conducted with parent participants (Generation 1 (G1)) and in the second stage, adolescents (Generation 2 (G2)) participated in the photovoice component. Multiple forms of data including photographs, journals and interviews facilitated using the SHOWeD model were collected and were analysed thematically using ATLAS.ti(v.8). Results Subtle changes in reinforcing culture-specific gender norms between generations were elicited. Differences in communication, granting autonomy to female adolescents, and in disciplining methods between G1 and G2 were observed. Warm parenting was transmitted between generations while harsh parenting in G1 in the presence of external social support was discarded in favor of warm parenting in G2. Conclusion We provide evidence for perceptions of parenting and adolescent behaviors across two generations. Transmission of warm parenting and interruption in the cycle of harsh parenting in the presence of external social support were significant findings. Related theoretical and methodological applications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3204406295,"Drug use disorder (DUD) is a serious health condition that imposes a heavy burden on the persons who have a drug addiction experience and their families, especially in countries, such as Myanmar, where few formal support mechanisms are in place and repressive drug laws exacerbate the situation. Yet, in Myanmar, little is known about how informal caregivers are affected. This qualitative study aims at exploring the socioeconomic and psychological burden that informal caregivers in Myanmar encounter, coping strategies they employ, as well as barriers to coping they face. Thirty primary informal caregivers were chosen purposively from a mental health hospital in Yangon for in-depth interviews. The recorded interviews were transcribed and the data were analysed using framework analysis. The results revealed that financial constraint, income loss, social limitation and negative impact on family cohesion are important dimensions of socioeconomic burden, whereas sadness, anger, helplessness, worry, fear and guilt are the main psychological distress factors encountered by caregivers of persons with DUD. Key coping strategies employed by caregivers include religious coping, financial coping, acceptance and planning. Moreover, perceived stigma towards persons with DUD and their caregivers was very high and caregivers received hardly any social support, inter alia because of the country’s drug law which reinforces stigma and discrimination. Neither the government nor any other organization in Myanmar provided financial support to the caregivers. The results of this study showed that caring for persons with DUD has devastating effects on caregivers and their families. While the 2018 National Drug Control Policy can potentially help alleviate the burden on substance users and their families, further amendments of the existing drug law are urgently needed. Moreover, strengthening prevention and harm reduction approaches, improving treatment and rehabilitation services, as well as stigma-reducing educational campaigns should be considered a priority."
https://openalex.org/W3202051532,"Background Patient-centred care (PCC) has been suggested to provide benefits such as improved patient-healthcare provider communication and better disease self-management to patients. The practice of PCC should involve all healthcare professionals, including pharmacists who are well-positioned in providing pharmaceutical care to patients. However, a better understanding of the factors that can affect the practice of PCC in pharmacists’ consultations is needed. Objective To explore the perceptions of Malaysian hospital pharmacists and patients on the barriers and facilitators of a PCC approach in pharmacist consultations. Design This study employed a qualitative, explorative semi-structured interview design. Setting and participants Interviews were conducted with 17 patients and 18 pharmacists from three tertiary hospitals in Malaysia. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Emerging themes were developed through a constant comparative approach and thematic analysis. Results Three themes were identified in this study: (i) patient-related factors (knowledge, role expectations, and sociocultural characteristics), (ii) pharmacist-related factors (personalities and communication), and (iii) healthcare institutional and system-related factors (resources, continuity of care, and interprofessional collaboration). Pharmacists and patients mentioned that factors such as patients’ knowledge and attitudes and pharmacists’ personality traits and communication styles can affect patients’ engagement in the consultation. Long waiting time and insufficient manpower were perceived as barriers to the practice of PCC. Continuity of care and interprofessional collaboration were viewed as crucial in providing supportive and tailored care to patients. Conclusion The study findings outlined the potential factors of PCC that may influence its implementation in pharmacist consultations. Strategic approaches can be undertaken by policymakers, healthcare institutions, and pharmacists themselves to address the identified barriers to more fully support the implementation of PCC in the pharmacy setting."
https://openalex.org/W3202988255,"Speech production gives rise to distinct auditory and somatosensory feedback signals which are dynamically integrated to enable online monitoring and error correction, though it remains unclear how the sensorimotor system supports the integration of these multimodal signals. Capitalizing on the parity of sensorimotor processes supporting perception and production, the current study employed the McGurk paradigm to induce multimodal sensory congruence/incongruence. EEG data from a cohort of 39 typical speakers were decomposed with independent component analysis to identify bilateral mu rhythms; indices of sensorimotor activity. Subsequent time-frequency analyses revealed bilateral patterns of event related desynchronization (ERD) across alpha and beta frequency ranges over the time course of perceptual events. Right mu activity was characterized by reduced ERD during all cases of audiovisual incongruence, while left mu activity was attenuated and protracted in McGurk trials eliciting sensory fusion. Results were interpreted to suggest distinct hemispheric contributions, with right hemisphere mu activity supporting a coarse incongruence detection process and left hemisphere mu activity reflecting a more granular level of analysis including phonological identification and incongruence resolution. Findings are also considered in regard to incongruence detection and resolution processes during production."
https://openalex.org/W3203065044,"The uptake of the immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) in many countries with an opportunistic colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme remains suboptimal. This study aimed to determine the rate, associated factors and reasons of refusal to perform the iFOBT test offered under an opportunistic CRC screening programme in semi-urban communities. This cross-sectional study was conducted among the average-risk individuals living in semi-urban areas, who sought care from public primary care centres across Kedah state, Malaysia. The information regarding the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of individuals who were offered the iFOBT between January and April 2019, along with their willingness to perform the test, was gathered. The factors associated with the refusal were further explored using the logistic regression analysis. The individuals offered the iFOBT (n = 920) were mainly female (52.4%) and had a mean age of 58.7±10.6 years. The refusal rate of the iFOBT was 32.2%. Patients who did not have hypertension (adjusted OR: 3.33; 95% CI: 2.44, 4.54), did not have CRC symptoms (adjusted OR: 3.15; 95% CI:1.26, 7.89), had the test offered by either medical assistants (adjusted OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.71, 3.49) or nurses (adjusted OR: 2.41; 95% CI 1.65, 3.51), did not have diabetes (adjusted OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.42, 2.77),and were not active smokers (adjusted OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.47), were more likely to refuse the iFOBT. The common reasons of refusing the test included “feeling not ready for the test” (21.6%) and “feeling healthy” (14.9%). The iFOBT was refused by one-third of the average-risk individuals from semi-urban communities. The associated factors and reasons of refusal found in this study could guide policymakers in developing targeted interventions to boost the uptake of CRC screening in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W3203496744,"A politics of resentment has shaped a low-dialogue political environment in the United States, feeding into populism, and characterized by perceived distributive injustice, detachment between politicians and “the people”, and political polarization. In this political environment, independent of editorial lines, news can spread based on populist content features and drive the political divide even further. However, we still do not understand well, how the forces of political disconnect as well as potentially unifying elements such as political knowledge and the willingness to connect with the other (political) side predict audience interest in populist news featuring people-centrism , anti-elitism , restoring popular sovereignty , and the exclusion of others . To better understand what drives (dis-)interest in populist news features, we combined self-report data from a non-student US sample ( N = 440) on political attitudes with unobtrusively measured data on their selective exposure to populist news. We analyzed the data using zero-inflated negative binomial regression models, in which we simultaneously modeled selective exposure to and avoidance of populist news. The findings indicate that especially the will to connect with others explained exposure to news about anti-elitism , especially among Democrats, while Republicans’ news avoidance seems to be specifically geared toward people-centrism . Populist communication features promoting “us” vs. “them” dichotomies seem to not automatically resonate with the views of resentful voters and their motivated reasoning."
https://openalex.org/W3204436953,"Introduction In 2009 and 2010, Athens, Greece experienced a hepatitis C virus (HCV) and a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) outbreak among People Who Inject Drugs (PWID), respectively. The HCV outbreak was not detected, while that of HIV was identified in 2011. The integrated HIV-interventions, launched in early 2012, managed to reduce directly the HIV incidence and indirectly the HCV incidence. This study aims to assess what would have been the course of the HIV outbreak and its associated economic consequences if the 2009 HCV outbreak had been detected and integrated interventions had been initiated 1- or 2-years earlier. Methods The model was calibrated to reproduce the observed HIV epidemiological and clinical parameters among PWID of Athens, Greece. We examined the effect of the 1- or 2-years earlier detection scenarios, the 1-year later detection, the non-detection scenario, and compared them to the status quo scenario. Results Cumulative HIV cases, under the status-quo scenario during 2009‐2019, were 1360 (90% Credible intervals: 290, 2470). If the HCV outbreak had been detected 1- or 2- years earlier, with immediate initiation of integrated interventions, 740 and 1110 HIV cases could be averted by 2019, respectively. Regarding the costs, if there was an efficient notification system to detect the HCV outbreak 1 or 2 years earlier, 35.2–53.2 million euros could be saved compared to the status quo by 2019. Conclusions If the HCV outbreak had been detected and promptly addressed, the HIV outbreak would have been prevented and 35.2–53.2 million euros could have been saved."
https://openalex.org/W3204724553,"This study aimed to assess the numbers of juvenile European hedgehogs admitted to rescue centers in the Czech Republic from the viewpoint of their weight on admission, the reason for their admission, and the success rate of their release back into the wild. The results of our study show varying levels of success in the rearing of hedgehogs admitted at different ages (weights) and a varying period required for their rehabilitation. The greatest chance of release was seen in hedgehogs with a weight on the admission of 500–599 g (64.22% released) and 400–499 g (63.31% released). In contrast, the smallest number of young hedgehogs successfully rehabilitated and released was seen in hoglets weighing 200–299 g (35.24% released) on admission, which corresponds to the weight of hedgehogs at the time of weaning. Time spent at a rescue center may pose an undesirable threat to the lives of animals in some categories. Hedgehogs weighing up to 99 g on admission spent the longest period time at rescue centers (a median of 48 days), while hedgehogs weighing 500–599 g on admission spent the shortest time (a median of 7 days). The majority of hedgehogs in the lowest weight categories were admitted due to their inability to survive on their own. A large percentage of hedgehogs of greater weight, in contrast, were juvenile hedgehogs brought to rescue centers needlessly. The percentage of released animals did not exceed 65%, however, even for entirely independent categories of older juveniles. From this perspective, the fact that hedgehogs are often brought to rescue centers in the belief that they are not self-sufficient young, though they are actually juvenile or even adult individuals that do not require human care, can be considered a significant finding."
https://openalex.org/W3204866112,"In March 2020, an influx of admissions in COVID-19 positive patients threatened to overwhelm healthcare facilities in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. Exacerbating this problem was an overall shortage of diagnostic testing capability at that time, resulting in a delay in time-to-result return. An improvement in diagnostic testing availability and timeliness was necessary to improve the allocation of resources and ultimate throughput of patients. The management of a COVID-19 positive patient or patient under investigation requires infection control measures that can quickly consume personal protective equipment (PPE) stores and personnel available to treat these patients. Critical shortages of both PPE and personnel also negatively impact care in patients admitted with non-COVID-19 illnesses.A multisectoral partnership of healthcare providers, facilities and academicians created a molecular diagnostic lab within an academic research facility dedicated to testing inpatients and healthcare personnel for SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of the laboratory was to provide a temporary solution to the East Baton Rouge Parish healthcare community until individual facilities were self-sustaining in testing capabilities. We describe the partnership and the impacts of this endeavor by developing a model derived from a combination of data sources, including electronic health records, hospital operations, and state and local resources.Our model demonstrates two important principles: the impact of reduced turnaround times (TAT) on potential differences in inpatient population numbers for COVID-19 and savings in PPE attributed to the more rapid TAT."
https://openalex.org/W3202507236,"In addition to the classical voltage-dependent behavior mediated by the voltage-sensing-domains (VSD) of ion channels, a growing number of voltage-dependent gating behaviors are being described in channels that lack canonical VSDs. A common thread in their mechanism of action is the contribution of the permeating ion to this voltage sensing process. The polymodal K2P K + channel, TREK2 responds to membrane voltage through a gating process mediated by the interaction of K + with its selectivity filter. Recently, we found that this action can be modulated by small molecule agonists (e.g. BL1249) which appear to have an electrostatic influence on K + binding within the inner cavity and produce an increase in the single-channel conductance of TREK-2 channels. Here, we directly probed this K + -dependent gating process by recording both macroscopic and single-channel currents of TREK-2 in the presence of high concentrations of internal K + . Surprisingly we found TREK-2 is inhibited by high internal K + concentrations and that this is mediated by the concomitant increase in ionic-strength. However, we were still able to determine that the increase in single channel conductance in the presence of BL1249 was blunted in high ionic-strength, whilst its activatory effect (on channel open probability) persisted. These effects are consistent with an electrostatic mechanism of action of negatively charged activators such as BL1249 on permeation, but also suggest that their influence on channel gating is complex."

Studies examining the size and distribution of slow conduction regions in the context of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may help to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients with AF. In this work, we studied the differences of size and number in slow conduction areas between control and persistent AF goats and the influence of propagation direction on the development of these pathological conduction areas. Epicardial atrial electrical activations from the left atrial roof were optically mapped with physiological pacing cycle lengths and for the shortest captured cycle lengths. The recordings were converted to local activation times and conduction velocity measures. Regions with slow conduction velocity (less than [Formula: see text]) were identified. The size of the connected regions and the number of non-connected regions were counted for propagation from different orthogonal directions. We found that regions of slow conduction significantly increases in our 15 persistent AF goat recordings in response to premature stimulation (24.4±4.3% increase to 36.6±4.4%, p < 0.001). This increase is driven by an increase of size from (3.70±0.89[mm2] to 6.36±0.91[mm2], p = 0.014) for already existing regions and not by generation of new slow conduction regions (11.6±1.8 vs. 13±1.9, p = 0.242). In 12 control goat recordings, no increase from baseline pacing to premature pacing was found. Similarly, size of the slow conduction areas and the count did not change significantly in control animals."
https://openalex.org/W3203829295,"Background In New York City (NYC), pneumonia is a leading cause of death and most pneumonia deaths occur in hospitals. Whether the pneumonia death rate in NYC reflects reporting artifact or is associated with factors during pneumonia-associated hospitalization (PAH) is unknown. We aimed to identify hospital-level factors associated with higher than expected in-hospital pneumonia death rates among adults in NYC. Methods Data from January 1, 2010–December 31, 2014 were obtained from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the American Hospital Association Database. In-hospital pneumonia standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated for each hospital as observed PAH death rate divided by expected PAH death rate. To determine hospital-level factors associated with higher in-hospital pneumonia SMR, we fit a hospital-level multivariable negative binomial regression model. Results Of 148,172 PAH among adult NYC residents in 39 hospitals during 2010–2014, 20,820 (14.06%) resulted in in-hospital death. In-hospital pneumonia SMRs varied across NYC hospitals (0.77–1.23) after controlling for patient-level factors. An increase in average daily occupancy and membership in the Council of Teaching Hospitals were associated with increased in-hospital pneumonia SMR. Conclusions Differences in in-hospital pneumonia SMRs between hospitals might reflect differences in disease severity, quality of care, or coding practices. More research is needed to understand the association between average daily occupancy and in-hospital pneumonia SMR. Additional pneumonia-specific training at teaching hospitals can be considered to address higher in-hospital pneumonia SMR in teaching hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3204253451,"Copy number variation is an important source of genetic variation, yet data are often lacking due to technical limitations for detection given the current genome assemblies. Our goal is to demonstrate the extent to which an array-based platform (aCGH) can identify genomic loci that are collapsed in genome assemblies that were built with short-read technology. Taking advantage of two cichlid species for which genome assemblies based on Illumina and PacBio are available, we show that inter-species aCGH log 2 hybridization ratios correlate more strongly with inferred copy number differences based on PacBio-built genome assemblies than based on Illumina-built genome assemblies. With regard to inter-species copy number differences of specific genes identified by each platform, the set identified by aCGH intersects to a greater extent with the set identified by PacBio than with the set identified by Illumina. Gene function, according to Gene Ontology analysis, did not substantially differ among platforms, and platforms converged on functions associated with adaptive phenotypes. The results of the current study further demonstrate that aCGH is an effective platform for identifying copy number variable sequences, particularly those collapsed in short read genome assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W3204439441,"Background Heat shock proteins can protect against stress-associated cellular challenges, but they can also protect some tumors from human immune system monitoring. Heat shock protein 105 (HSP105/110) is a high molecular weight protein whose expression has been reported in many cancers, but few studies on its role in cutaneous malignant melanoma have been published. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between HSP105 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of CMM. Methods This retrospective study included 91 patients with CMM. The clinicopathological characteristics of CMM patients, including age, lesion duration, location, pathological classification, Clark’s level, Breslow thickness, metastasis and recurrence, were collected. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis for HSP105 were performed. Pigmented nevi (n = 20) served as a control. The staining intensity and percentage of stained cells were expressed as a histochemical score (HSCORE). Results HSP105 was overexpressed in melanoma compared with nevi. Differences in the HSCORE between nevi (HSCORE = 1.05(0.15,1.50)) and CMM (HSCORE = 2.68(1.80,3.60)) were remarkable (P&lt;0.001). Exposed site lesions, recurrent and metastatic lesions, nodular melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma were closely associated with higher HSP105 expression (P = 0.011, P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in Clark’s level, Breslow thickness, or lesion duration (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion HSP105 is overexpressed in CMM. Higher HSP105 expression in lesions is associated with different clinicopathological variables. HSP105 may be a potential target for the diagnosis, treatment and prognostic prediction of CMM."
https://openalex.org/W3204465709,"Exporting is a central growth strategy for most firms and managers with international experience are instrumental for export decisions. We suggest that such managers can be hired from Multinational Corporations (MNCs). We integrate theory from strategic human capital research into models explaining export decisions. We theorize that hiring managers from MNCs increases the odds of domestic firms to start exporting and this effect depends on the similarities between hiring firms and MNCs. We hypothesize that young firms will benefit comparatively less from hiring MNC managers. In contrast, firms with internationally diverse workforces and with high degrees of hierarchical specialization will benefit the most from hiring MNC managers. We test and support these hypotheses for 474,926 domestic firms in Sweden, which we observe between 2007 and 2015."
