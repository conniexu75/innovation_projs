https://openalex.org/W2793184643,"Although risk perception is a key concept in many health behavior theories, little research has explicitly tested when risk perception predicts motivation to take protective action against a health threat (protection motivation). The present study tackled this question by (a) adopting a multidimensional model of risk perception that comprises deliberative, affective, and experiential components (the TRIRISK model), and (b) taking a person-by-situation approach. We leveraged a highly intensive within-subjects paradigm to test features of the health threat (i.e., perceived severity) and individual differences (e.g., emotion reappraisal) as moderators of the relationship between the three types of risk perception and protection motivation in a within-subjects design. Multi-level modeling of 2968 observations (32 health threats across 94 participants) showed interactions among the TRIRISK components and moderation both by person-level and situational factors. For instance, affective risk perception better predicted protection motivation when deliberative risk perception was high, when the threat was less severe, and among participants who engage less in emotional reappraisal. These findings support the TRIRISK model and offer new insights into when risk perceptions predict protection motivation."
https://openalex.org/W2793873467,"Remote magnetic manipulation is a powerful technique for controlling devices inside the human body. It enables actuation and locomotion of tethered and untethered objects without the need for a local power supply. In clinical applications, it is used for active steering of catheters in medical interventions such as cardiac ablation for arrhythmia treatment and for steering of camera pills in the gastro-intestinal tract for diagnostic video acquisition. For these applications, specialized clinical-scale field applicators have been developed, which are rather limited in terms of field strength and flexibility of field application. For a general-purpose field applicator, flexible field generation is required at high field strengths as well as high field gradients to enable the generation of both torques and forces on magnetic devices. To date, this requirement has only been met by small-scale experimental systems. We have built a highly versatile clinical-scale field applicator that enables the generation of strong magnetic fields as well as strong field gradients over a large workspace. We demonstrate the capabilities of this coil-based system by remote steering of magnetic drills through gel and tissue samples with high torques on well-defined curved trajectories. We also give initial proof that, when equipped with high frequency transmit-receive coils, the machine is capable of real-time magnetic particle imaging while retaining a clinical-scale bore size. Our findings open the door for image-guided radiation-free remote magnetic control of devices at the clinical scale, which may be useful in minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic medical interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2790679767,"Plasticized poly (lactic acid) (PPLA) was prepared by melt blending poly (lactic acid) (PLA) with 10 wt% of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), with varied molecular weights range from 400 to 4000. The structure, thermal property, morphology, and surface free energy of the PPLA were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angles (CA). The resulting PPLA results indicated that the introduction of PEG to the blend systems resulted in a ductile fracture, a decrease in the melt temperature (Tm) and glass transfer temperature (Tg), and an increase in the degree of crystallization (χc), which indicated an improved flexibility. In addition, the polarity of the PPLA increased and the surface free energy decreased. The resulting PPLA was subsequently used as matrix to blend with wood flour to prepare composites. The mechanical strength, melting behavior, thermal stability, and microscopy of the PPLA/wood flour composites were also evaluated. These results illustrated that the plasticized PPLA matrix was beneficial to the interfacial compatibility between the polar filler and the substrate."

Methods Direct and indirect costs were estimated by conducting comprehensive interviews on the use of resources in a sample of 156 patients with dementia treated at an outpatient memory clinic of a tertiary hospital. A regression model was used to determine the main determinants of costs associated with dementia. Results Global costs of dementia were US$1,012.35; US$1,683.18 and US$1,372.30 per patient/month for mild, moderate and severe stages, respectively. Indirect costs ranged from US$536.62 to US$545.17 according to severity. Dementia costs were influenced by medication, FAST score, and educational level of caregiver. Discussion The study represents an original contribution toward establishing direct and indirect costs of dementia in Brazil. Results indicate significant economic impacts, including projection of annual costs of US$16,548.24 per patient."
https://openalex.org/W2793476283,"Lipid peroxidation can be described as a process under which free radicals attack carbon double bonds of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Whereas the end products of this process are reactive aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA). Lipid peroxidation leads to adverse changes in the nutritional value of milk; therefore, higher degree of antioxidant protection (DAP) ensures higher stability of dairy products by effecting their high antioxidative potential. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the relationship between the DAP and the level of MDA in high-performance Polish Holstein-Friesian cows in peak of lactation. Sixty-three Polish Holstein-Friesian cows were selected to the experiment according to: parity (all in the 2nd lactation), phase of lactation (peak of lactation), cytological quality of milk (somatic cell count < 150 thousand/ml) and without diagnosed metabolic diseases. The data obtained were analyzed statistically by two–way ANOVA, and Tukey’s post-hoc test. After analysis of performance the cows were divided into 3 groups (twenty one cows in each group) based on milk yield and MDA concentration. The study revealed a significant effect of the lactation performance of cows on MDA levels in milk (P ≤ 0.01). The highest concentration of MDA (61.137 nM/mL) was shown in milk of cows yielding between 50.00 and 55.80 kg/day. The highest concentration of fat was found in milk in which the MDA level ranged from 48 to 86 nM/mL. Whereas, the inverse relationship was demonstrated in case of protein concentration. The highest level of protein was found in cows with MDA levels in the range of 18–28 nM/mL (P ≤ 0.01). The lowest MDA level (in the range of 18–28 nM/mL) was associated with the highest concentration of vitamin E, β-carotene, total antioxidant status (TAS) and DAP, measured in both milk and plasma. The obtained results show that lipid peroxidation leads to adverse changes in the nutritional value of milk; the highest DAP (7.89 x 10−3) was found in the cows with the lowest MDA concentration in milk."
https://openalex.org/W2792684900,"Ginkgo leaves are raw materials for flavonoid extraction. Thus, the timing of their harvest is important to optimize the extraction efficiency, which benefits the pharmaceutical industry. In this research, we compared the transcriptomes of Ginkgo leaves harvested at midday and midnight. The differentially expressed genes with the highest probabilities in each step of flavonoid biosynthesis were down-regulated at midnight. Furthermore, real-time PCR corroborated the transcriptome results, indicating the decrease in flavonoid biosynthesis at midnight. The flavonoid profiles of Ginkgo leaves harvested at midday and midnight were compared, and the total flavonoid content decreased at midnight. A detailed analysis of individual flavonoids showed that most of their contents were decreased by various degrees. Our results indicated that circadian rhythms affected the flavonoid contents in Ginkgo leaves, which provides valuable information for optimizing their harvesting times to benefit the pharmaceutical industry."
https://openalex.org/W2789644226,"In low and middle income countries (LMICs), where the burden of neonatal sepsis is the highest, the spread of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) in the community, potentially contributing to the neonatal mortality, is a public health concern. Data regarding the acquisition of ESBL-PE during the neonatal period are scarce. The routes of transmission are not well defined and particularly the possible key role played by pregnant women. This study aimed to understand the neonatal acquisition of ESBL-PE in the community in Madagascar. The study was conducted in urban and semi-rural areas. Newborns were included at birth and followed-up during their first month of life. Maternal stool samples at delivery and six stool samples in each infant were collected to screen for ESBL-PE. A Cox proportional hazards model was performed to identify factors associated with the first ESBL-PE acquisition. The incidence rate of ESBL-PE acquisition was 10.4 cases/1000 newborn-days [95% CI: 8.0-13.4 cases per 1000 newborn-days]. Of the 83 ESBL-PE isolates identified, Escherichia coli was the most frequent species (n = 28, 34.1%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20, 24.4%). Cox multivariate analysis showed that independent risk factors for ESBL-PE acquisition were low birth weight (adjusted Hazard-ratio (aHR) = 2.7, 95% CI [1.2; 5.9]), cesarean-section, (aHR = 3.4, 95% CI [1.7; 7.1]) and maternal use of antibiotics at delivery (aHR = 2.2, 95% CI [1.1; 4.5]). Our results confirm that mothers play a significant role in the neonatal acquisition of ESBL-PE. In LMICs, public health interventions during pregnancy should be reinforced to avoid unnecessary caesarean section, unnecessary antibiotic use at delivery and low birth weight newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2792567209,"There is a high quest for novel therapeutic strategies to enhance recovery after stroke. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) has been described as neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory molecule. Moreover, miR-124 is a well described enhancer of adult neurogenesis that could offer potentially beneficial effects. Herein, we used miR-124-loaded nanoparticles (miR-124 NPs) to evaluate their therapeutic potential in an in vitro and in vivo model of stroke. For that, neuroprotective and neurogenic responses were assessed in an in vitro model of stroke. Here, we found that miR-124 NPs decreased cell death and improved neuronal differentiation of subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cell cultures after oxygen and glucose deprivation. In contrast, intravenous injection of miR-124 NPs immediately after permanent focal ischemia induced by photothrombosis (PT) did not provide a better neurological outcome. In addition, treatment did not affect the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)- and doublecortin/BrdU- positive cells in the SVZ at the study endpoint of 14 days after PT. Likewise, the ischemic insult did not affect the numbers of neuronal progenitors in the SVZ. However, in PT mice miR-124 NPs were able to specifically augment interleukin-6 levels at day 2 post-stroke. Furthermore, we also showed that NPs reached the brain parenchyma and were internalized by brain resident cells. Although, promising in vitro data could not be verified in vivo as miR-124 NPs treatment did not improve functional outcome nor presented beneficial actions on neurogenesis or post-stroke inflammation, we showed that our NP formulation can be a safe alternative for drug delivery into the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2789233926,"Background Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) which is prevalent in South China, and its association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases has not been studied in the mainland of China. The EBV serological tests have been performed on patients with various diseases or manifestations for years at our institution and their values need to be evaluated. Methods For routine medical purposes, anti-EB viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies, anti-EBV diffuse early antigen (EA-D) IgA antibodies, and anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1(EBNA-1) IgG antibodies were tested with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in patients visiting Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2013 and 2017. The test results were analyzed in this retrospective study. Results There were a total of 11122 serum samples available to be tested in the study. As indicators of past EBV infection, the prevalence of VCA-IgG/EBNA1-IgG were 66.6%/58.5%, 84.3%/78.8%, 92.9%/87.0% and 98.5%/95.4% in patients aged under 5 years, 6–10 years, 11–20 years and 21–30 years old, respectively, and these values maintained at this highest rate as age increased further. The prevalence of VCA-IgM, as a parameter of acute EBV infection, was 14.6%, 10.2%, 10.4%, 6.3% and 3.1% in patients aged under 5 years, 6–10 years,11–20 years, 21–30 years, 31–40 years old, respectively, and decreased to 2%~3% in older patients. Patients with elevated serum liver enzymes were more likely to have a higher prevalence of EA/D IgA antibody (P < 0.01) and young patients (≤30 years) with lymphadenopathy were more likely to have higher prevalence of VCA-IgM antibody (P < 0.01). The prevalence of VCA-IgA and EAD-IgA were 87.0% and 59.2% in NPC patients, respectively, and both were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that in non-NPC patients. The prevalence of VCA-IgA was 45.4% and 25.6% in SLE patients and patients with other autoimmune diseases, respectively, which were significantly (P < 0.001) and mildly (P = 0.039) higher than their controls. In pediatric SLE patients between 6 and10 years old, the prevalence of VCA-IgG, VCA-IgA and EBNA1-IgG was 100%, 59.5% and 100%, respectively, all being significantly higher than the age (6-10y) related controls (P< 0.01). In the 705 cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens, VCA-IgG, VCA-IgM, VCA-IgA and EAD-IgA were found to be positive in 12.1%, 0.15%, 0.25% and 0.25%, respectively. There were 157 paired specimens (CSF and serum were collected simultaneously) and VCA-IgG was identified as positive in 12.7% of the CSF and 100% of the serum specimens. Conclusions Around 98% of Chinese patients were infected with EBV before 30 years of age and the highest rate of acute EBV infection were observed in patients under 5 years old. EBV infection was found to be associated with elevated serum liver enzymes, NPC and SLE. Acute anti-EBV antibody was valued for young patients with lymphadenopathy but limited value for CNS neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2791085417,"Absorption of ammonia from the gastrointestinal tract results in problems that range from hepatic encephalopathy in humans to poor nitrogen efficiency of cattle with consequences for the global climate. Previous studies on epithelia and cells from the native ruminal epithelium suggest functional involvement of the bovine homologue of TRPV3 (bTRPV3) in ruminal NH4+ transport. Since the conductance of TRP channels to NH4+ has never been studied, bTRPV3 was overexpressed in HEK-293 cells and investigated using the patch-clamp technique and intracellular calcium imaging. Control cells contained the empty construct. Divalent cations blocked the conductance for monovalent cations in both cell types, with effects higher in cells expressing bTRPV3. In bTRPV3 cells, but not in controls, menthol, thymol, carvacrol, or 2-APB stimulated whole cell currents mediated by Na+, Cs+, NH4+, and K+, with a rise in intracellular Ca2+ observed in response to menthol. While only 25% of control patches showed single-channel events (with a conductance of 40.8 ± 11.9 pS for NH4+ and 25.0 ± 5.8 pS for Na+), 90% of bTRPV3 patches showed much larger conductances of 127.8 ± 4.2 pS for Na+, 240.1 ± 3.6 pS for NH4+, 34.0 ± 1.7 pS for Ca2+, and ~ 36 pS for NMDG+. Open probability, but not conductance, rose with time after patch excision. In conjunction with previous research, we suggest that bTRPV3 channels may play a role in the transport of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and NH4+ across the rumen with possible repercussions for understanding the function of TRPV3 in other epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2789483389,"This study aimed to analyze the bile acid patterns in commercially available oxgall powders used for evaluation of the bile tolerance ability of probiotic bacteria. Qxgall powders purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Oxoid and BD Difco were dissolved in distilled water, and analyzed. Conjugated bile acids were profiled by ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), free bile acids were detected as their p-bromophenacyl ester derivatives using reversed-phase HPLC after extraction with acetic ether, and total bile acids were analyzed by enzymatic-colorimetric assay. The results showed that 9 individual bile acids (i.e., taurocholic acid, glycocholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid) were present in each of the oxgall powders tested. The content of total bile acid among the three oxgall powders was similar; however, the relative contents of the individual bile acids among these oxgall powders were significantly different (P < 0.001). The oxgall powder from Sigma-Aldrich was closer to human bile in the ratios of glycine-conjugated bile acids to taurine-conjugated bile acids, dihydroxy bile acids to trihydroxy bile acids, and free bile acids to conjugated bile acids than the other powders were. It was concluded that the oxgall powder from Sigma-Aldrich should be used instead of those from Oxoid and BD Difco to evaluate the bile tolerance ability of probiotic bacteria as human bile model."
https://openalex.org/W2792965149,"Background Polyamines have various biological functions including marked effects on the structure and function of genomic DNA molecules. Changes in the higher-order structure of DNA caused by polyamines are expected to be closely related to genetic activity. To clarify this issue, we examined the relationship between gene expression and the higher-order structure of DNA under different polyamine concentrations. Principal findings We studied the effects of polyamines, spermidine SPD(3+) and spermine SP(4+), on gene expression by a luciferase assay. The results showed that gene expression is increased by ca. 5-fold by the addition of SPD(3+) at 0.3 mM, whereas it is completely inhibited above 2 mM. Similarly, with SP(4+), gene expression is maximized at 0.08 mM and completely inhibited above 0.6 mM. We also performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations on DNA under different polyamine concentrations. AFM revealed that a flower-like conformation is generated at polyamine concentrations associated with maximum expression as measured by the luciferase assay. On the other hand, DNA molecules exhibit a folded compact conformation at polyamine concentrations associated with the complete inhibition of expression. Based on these results, we discuss the plausible mechanism of the opposite effect, i.e., enhancement and inhibition, of polyamines on gene expression. Conclusion and significance It was found that polyamines exert opposite effect, enhancement and inhibition, on gene expression depending on their concentrations. Such an opposite effect is argued in relation to the conformational change of DNA: enhancement is due to the parallel ordering of DNA segments that is accompanied by a decrease in the negative charge of double-stranded DNA, and inhibition is caused by the compaction of DNA into a tightly packed state with almost perfect charge-neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W2793051675,"Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) has been associated with microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities including areas that have been implicated in the control of the lower urinary tract. As such, this descriptive case series has aimed to investigate whether CZS is linked with neurogenic bladder. Identifying such an association is paramount in the effort to recognize CZS complications that have putative treatment options that could mitigate the impact of CZS in infected children.Following IRB approval, urological assessment was performed in all patients referred to our clinic between June 2016 and May 2017 who presented with confirmed CZS-associated microcephaly. The research protocol consisted of obtaining clinical history, laboratory tests, lower and upper urinary tract ultrasounds, as well as a diagnostic urodynamic evaluation. ZIKA virus infection was previously confirmed by maternal history and positive PCR in babies and mothers. Microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities were established based on neurological assessment and associated imaging of the central nervous system (CT head and/or Brain MRI).Twenty-two consecutive CZS patients were tested and confirmed to have neurogenic bladder. Of the 22 patients assessed, 21 presented with an overactive bladder combined with reduced bladder capacity and elevated detrusor filling pressures. Clinically significant increases in postvoid residual (PVR) were confirmed in 40% of cases while a urinary tract infection (UTI) was identified in 23% of cases.Neurogenic bladder, a known treatable health condition, was confirmed in 100% of patients tested in this study, most presenting with high-risk urodynamic patterns known to lead to renal damage when left untreated. Follow up studies are necessary to provide further insight onto long-term disease progression and to investigate the response to standard therapies for neurogenic bladder. Nonetheless, we emphasize the importance of proactive management of neurogenic bladder and prompt referral so as to help mitigate CZS disease burden for patients and their families."
https://openalex.org/W2792056774,"Global changes, such as increased temperatures and elevated CO2, are driving shifts in plant species distribution and dominance, like woody plant encroachment into grasslands. Local factors within these ecotones can influence the rate of regime shifts. Woody encroachment is occurring worldwide, though there has been limited research within coastal systems, where mangrove (woody shrub/tree) stands are expanding into salt marsh areas. Because coastal systems are exposed to various degrees of nutrient input, we investigated how nutrient enrichment may locally impact mangrove stand expansion and salt marsh displacement over time. We fertilized naturally co-occurring Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) stands in Port Aransas, TX, an area experiencing mangrove encroachment within the Northern Gulf of Mexico mangrove-marsh ecotone. After four growing seasons (2010-2013) of continuous fertilization, Avicennia was more positively influenced by nutrient enrichment than Spartina. Most notably, fertilized plots had a higher density of taller (> 0.5 m) mangroves and mangrove maximum height was 46% taller than in control plots. Fertilization may promote an increase in mangrove stand expansion within the mangrove-marsh ecotone by shifting Avicennia height distribution. Avicennia individuals, which reach certain species-specific height thresholds, have reduced negative neighbor effects and have higher resilience to freezing temperatures, which may increase mangrove competitive advantage over marsh grass. Therefore, we propose that nutrient enrichment, which augments mangrove height, could act locally as a positive feedback to mangrove encroachment, by reducing mangrove growth suppression factors, thereby accelerating the rates of increased mangrove coverage and subsequent marsh displacement. Areas within the mangrove-marsh ecotone with high anthropogenic nutrient input may be at increased risk of a regime shift from grass to woody dominated ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2792693620,"This study aims to contribute to the understanding of the impact of Didymosphenia geminata massive growths upon river ecosystem communities’ composition and functioning. This is the first study to jointly consider the taxonomic composition and functional structure of diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages in order to determine changes in community structure, and the food web alterations associated with this invasive alga. This study was carried out in the Lumbreras River (Ebro Basin, La Rioja, Northern Spain), which has been affected by a considerable massive growth of D. geminata since 2011. The study shows a profound alteration in both the river community composition and in the food web structure at the sites affected by the massive growth, which is primarily due to the alteration of the environmental conditions, thus demonstrating that D. geminata has an important role as an ecosystem engineer in the river. Thick filamentous mats impede the movement of large invertebrates—especially those that move and feed up on it—and favor small, opportunistic, herbivorous organisms, mainly chironomids, that are capable of moving between filaments and are aided by the absence of large trophic competitors and predators -prey release effect-. Only small predators, such as hydra, are capable of surviving in the new environment, as they are favored by the increase in chironomids, a source of food, and by the reduction in both their own predators and other midge predators -mesopredator release-. This change in the top-down control affects the diatom community, since chironomids may feed on large diatoms, increasing the proportion of small diatoms in the substrate. The survival of small and fast-growing pioneer diatoms is also favored by the mesh of filaments, which offers them a new habitat for colonization. Simultaneously, D. geminata causes a significant reduction in the number of diatoms with similar ecological requirements (those attached to the substrate). Overall, D. geminata creates a community dominated by small organisms that is clearly different from the existing communities in the same stream where there is an absence of massive growths."
https://openalex.org/W2951362833,"Currently, a challenge in electrical stimulation of the retina with a visual prosthesis (bionic eye) is to excite only the cells lying directly under the electrode in the ganglion cell layer, while avoiding excitation of axon bundles that pass over the surface of the retina in the nerve fiber layer. Stimulation of overlying axons results in irregular visual percepts, limiting perceptual efficacy. This research explores how differences in fiber orientation between the nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer leads to differences in the electrical activation of the axon initial segment and axons of passage. Approach. Axons of passage of retinal ganglion cells in the nerve fiber layer are characterized by a narrow distribution of fiber orientations, causing highly anisotropic spread of applied current. In contrast, proximal axons in the ganglion cell layer have a wider distribution of orientations. A four-layer computational model of epiretinal extracellular stimulation that captures the effect of neurite orientation in anisotropic tissue has been developed using a volume conductor model known as the cellular composite model. Simulations are conducted to investigate the interaction of neural tissue orientation, stimulating electrode configuration, and stimulation pulse duration and amplitude. Main results. Our model shows that simultaneous stimulation with multiple electrodes aligned with the nerve fiber layer can be used to achieve selective activation of axon initial segments rather than passing fibers. This result can be achieved while reducing required stimulus charge density and with only modest increases in the spread of activation in the ganglion cell layer, and is shown to extend to the general case of arbitrary electrode array positioning and arbitrary target volume. Significance. These results elucidate a strategy for more targeted stimulation of retinal ganglion cells with experimentally-relevant multi-electrode geometries and achievable stimulation requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2790259558,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an age-associated disease characterized by chronic inflammation, vascular cell apoptosis and metalloproteinase-mediated extracellular matrix degradation. Despite considerable progress in identifying targets involved in these processes, therapeutic approaches aiming to reduce aneurysm growth and rupture are still scarce. Indoleamine 2-3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme involved in the conversion of tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (Kyn) pathway. In this study, we investigated the role of IDO in two different models of AAA in mice.Mice with deficiencies in both low density receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) and IDO (Ldlr-/-Ido1-/-) were generated by cross-breeding Ido1-/- mice with Ldlr-/-mice. To induce aneurysm, these mice were infused with angiotensin II (Ang II) (1000 ng/min/kg) and fed with high fat diet (HFD) during 28 days. AAAs were present in almost all Ldlr-/- infused with AngII, but only in 50% of Ldlr-/-Ido1-/- mice. Immunohistochemistry at an early time point (day 7) revealed no changes in macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration within the vessel wall, but showed reduced apoptosis, as assessed by TUNEL assay, and increased α-actin staining within the media of Ldlr-/-Ido1-/- mice, suggesting enhanced survival of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the absence of IDO. In another model of elastase-induced AAA in C57Bl/6 mice, IDO deficiency had no effect on aneurysm formation.Our study showed that the knockout of IDO prevented VSMC apoptosis in AngII -treated Ldlr-/- mice fed with HFD, suggesting a detrimental role of IDO in AAA formation and thus would be an important target for the treatment of aneurysm."
https://openalex.org/W2793352746,"To identify systemic risk factors for sickle cell maculopathy, and to analyze the microstructure of the macula of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients by using automated segmentation of individual retinal layers.Thirty consecutive patients with SCD and 30 matched controls underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and automated thickness measurement for each retinal layer; thicknesses for SCD patients were then compared to normal controls. Demographic data, systemic data, and lab results were collected for each SCD patient; multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential risk factors for sickle cell maculopathy.Ongoing chelation treatment (p = 0.0187) was the most predictive factor for the presence of sickle cell maculopathy; the odds were 94.2% lower when chelation was present. HbF level tended to influence sickle cell maculopathy (p = 0.0775); the odds decreased by 12.9% when HbF increased by 1%. Sickle cell maculopathy was detected in 43% of SCD patients as patchy areas of retinal thinning on SD-OCT thickness map, mostly located temporally to the macula, especially in eyes with more advanced forms of sickle cell retinopathy (p = 0.003). In comparison to controls, SCD patients had a subtle thinning of the overall macula and temporal retina compared to controls (most p<0.0001), involving inner and outer retinal layers. Thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium was also detected in SCD eyes (p<0.0001).Chronic chelation therapy and, potentially, high levels of HbF are possible protective factors for the presence of sickle cell maculopathy, especially for patients with more advanced forms of sickle cell retinopathy. A subtle thinning of the overall macula occurs in SCD patients and involves multiple retinal layers, suggesting that ischemic vasculopathy may happen in both superficial and deep capillary plexi. Thinning of the outer retinal layers suggests that an ischemic insult of the choriocapillaris may also occur in SCD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2790357063,"Objective The specific objectives of this study were to examine variation in the care of self-harm patients in hospital settings and to identify the factors that predict recommended next care following self-harm. Methods Data on consecutive presentations to Irish emergency departments (EDs) involving self-harm from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland from 2004 to 2012 were utilised. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between patients’ clinical and demographic characteristics, and recommended next care received. Results Across the study period a total 101,904 self-harm presentations were made to hospital EDs, involving 63,457 individuals. Over the course of the study there was a declining number of presentations resulting in patient admission following attendance with self-harm. Recommended next care varied according to hospital location, with general admission rates ranging from 11% to 61% across administrative health regions. Multinomial logistic regression identified that the factor which most strongly affected next care was the presenting hospital. Being male, older age, method, repeat self-harm, time of attendance and residence of the patient were all identified as influencing care received. Psychiatric admission was most common when highly lethal methods of self-harm were used (OR = 4.00, 95% CI, 3.63–4.41). A relatively large proportion of patients left the ED without being seen (15%) and the risk of doing so was highest for self-harm repeaters (1.64, 1.55–1.74 for those with 5+ presentations). Conclusions The extensive hospital variation in recommended next care indicates that management of self-harm patients may be determined more by where they present than by the needs of the patient. The study outcomes underline the need to standardise the clinical management of self-harm patients in general hospital settings."
https://openalex.org/W2790820523,"Chromosomal instability and associated chromosomal aberrations are hallmarks of cancer and play a critical role in disease progression and development of resistance to drugs. Single-cell genome analysis has gained interest in latest years as a source of biomarkers for targeted-therapy selection and drug resistance, and several methods have been developed to amplify the genomic DNA and to produce libraries suitable for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). However, most protocols require several enzymatic and cleanup steps, thus increasing the complexity and length of protocols, while robustness and speed are key factors for clinical applications. To tackle this issue, we developed a single-tube, single-step, streamlined protocol, exploiting ligation mediated PCR (LM-PCR) Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) method, for low-pass genome sequencing with the Ion Torrent™ platform and copy number alterations (CNAs) calling from single cells. The method was evaluated on single cells isolated from 6 aberrant cell lines of the NCI-H series. In addition, to demonstrate the feasibility of the workflow on clinical samples, we analyzed single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and white blood cells (WBCs) isolated from the blood of patients affected by prostate cancer or lung adenocarcinoma. The results obtained show that the developed workflow generates data accurately representing whole genome absolute copy number profiles of single cell and allows alterations calling at resolutions down to 100 Kbp with as few as 200,000 reads. The presented data demonstrate the feasibility of the Ampli1™ WGA-based low-pass workflow for detection of CNAs in single tumor cells which would be of particular interest for genome-driven targeted therapy selection and for monitoring of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2789681386,"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) technology is widely used for the diagnosis of pancreatic masses. However, in some cases, inadequate tissue volume or difficulty of morphological diagnosis are constraining factors for adequate cytopathological evaluation. K-ras mutation is the most frequently acquired genetic abnormality, occurring in approximately 90% of all patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In the present study, the clinical utility of residual liquid-based cytology (LBC) specimens obtained using EUS-FNA for K-ras mutation analysis was evaluated.In this study, 81 patients with pancreatic lesions were examined. The cell block (CB) specimens separated from EUS-FNA samples were morphologically evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Final diagnoses were confirmed by CB specimens, surgical resection specimens, diagnostic imaging, and clinical follow-up. Genomic DNA of residual LBC specimens stored at 4°C for several months were extracted and assessed for K-ras mutations using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based preferential homoduplex formation assay.K-ras mutation analysis using residual LBC samples was successful in all cases. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CB examination alone were 77.4%, 100%, and 81.3%, respectively, and those of the combination of CB examination and K-ras mutation analysis were 90.3%, 92.3%, and 90.7%, respectively. Furthermore, K-ras mutations were detected in 8 (57.1%) of 14 PDAC samples for which the CB results were inconclusive.These findings suggest that K-ras mutation analysis using residual LBC specimens improves the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA."
https://openalex.org/W2793502619,"Motor skill acquisition inherently depends on the way one practices the motor task. The amount of motor task variability during practice has been shown to foster transfer of the learned skill to other similar motor tasks. In addition, variability in a learning schedule, in which a task and its variations are interweaved during practice, has been shown to help the transfer of learning in motor skill acquisition. However, there is little evidence on how motor task variations and variability schedules during practice act on the acquisition of complex motor skills such as music performance, in which a performer learns both the right movements (motor skill) and the right time to perform them (timing skill). This study investigated the impact of rate (tempo) variability and the schedule of tempo change during practice on timing and motor skill acquisition. Complete novices, with no musical training, practiced a simple musical sequence on a piano keyboard at different rates. Each novice was assigned to one of four learning conditions designed to manipulate the amount of tempo variability across trials (large or small tempo set) and the schedule of tempo change (randomized or non-randomized order) during practice. At test, the novices performed the same musical sequence at a familiar tempo and at novel tempi (testing tempo transfer), as well as two novel (but related) sequences at a familiar tempo (testing spatial transfer). We found that practice conditions had little effect on learning and transfer performance of timing skill. Interestingly, practice conditions influenced motor skill learning (reduction of movement variability): lower temporal variability during practice facilitated transfer to new tempi and new sequences; non-randomized learning schedule improved transfer to new tempi and new sequences. Tempo (rate) and the sequence difficulty (spatial manipulation) affected performance variability in both timing and movement. These findings suggest that there is a dissociable effect of practice variability on learning complex skills that involve both motor and timing constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2790679736,"Enzyme hydrolysates (trypsin, papain, pepsin, α-chymotrypsin, and pepsin-pancreatin) of Tinospora cordifolia stem proteins were analyzed for antioxidant efficacy by measuring (1) 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•) radical scavenging activity, (2) 2,20-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS+) radical scavenging capacity, and (3) Fe2+ chelation. Trypsin hydrolysate showed the strongest DPPH• scavenging, while α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate exhibited the highest ABTS+ scavenging and Fe2+ chelation. Undigested protein strongly inhibited the gastrointestinal enzymes, trypsin (50% inhibition at enzyme/substrate ratio = 1:6.9) and α-chymotrypsin (50% inhibition at enzyme/substrate ratio = 1:1.82), indicating the prolonged antioxidant effect after ingestion. Furthermore, gel filtration purified peptide fractions of papain hydrolysates exhibited a significantly higher ABTS+ and superoxide radical scavenging as compared to non-purified digests. Active fraction 9 showing the highest radical scavenging ability was further purified and confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS followed by MS/MS with probable dominant peptide sequences identified are VLYSTPVKMWEPGR, VITVVATAGSETMR, and HIGININSR. The obtained results revealed that free radical scavenging capacity of papain hydrolysates might be related to its consistently low molecular weight hydrophobic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2793930796,"In declining birches (Betula sp.) from different European stands affected by the ""birch leaf-roll disease"" (BLRD) a novel virus is identified by means of RNA-Seq virome analysis. The virus represents a new member in the genus Badnavirus, family Caulimoviridae, tentatively named Birch leaf roll-associated virus (BLRaV) and it is the first badnavirus found to infect birch. Complete genome sequences (7,862-7,864 nucleotides) of three viral isolates of Finnish and German origin have been determined. The virus sequences show a typical badnavirus organization with three major open reading frames (ORFs) and a fourth potential ORF overlapping with the end of ORF3. ORFs 1-2-3 show low level of amino acid identity to the corresponding proteins encoded by other badnaviruses, reaching a maximum of 44% identity (ORF3). Grapevine vein-clearing virus appears as the closest badnavirus when considering the polymerase region. So far, we can exclude evidence for presence of endogenous BLRaV elements in the birch genome, while evidence for the episomal activity of BLRaV is provided. The viral population holds significant haplotype diversity, while co-infection by different BLRaV variants are observed in single hosts. BLRaV presence is associated with the BLRD in both silver (B. pendula) and downy birch (B. pubescens). These results challenge the earlier hypothesis of a causal role of Cherry leaf roll virus in BLRD. Further work is now needed to finally prove that BLRaV is the causal agent for the BLRD."
https://openalex.org/W2794140789,"The impact of the microbiota on our health is rapidly gaining interest. While several bacteria have been associated with disease, and others being indicated as having a probiotic effect, the individual biomolecules behind these alterations are often not known. A major problem in the study of these factors in vivo is their low abundance in complex environments. We recently identified the first secreted bacterial antioxidant protein, RoxP, from the skin commensal Propionibacterium acnes, suggesting its relevance for maintaining the redox homeostasis on the skin. In order to study the effect, and prevalence, of RoxP in vivo, a capacitive biosensor with a recognition surface based on molecular imprinting was used to detect RoxP on skin in vivo. In vitro analyses demonstrated the ability to detect and quantify RoxP in a concentration range of 1 x 10-13 M to 1 x 10-8 M from human skin swabs; with a limit of detection of 2.5 x 10-19 M in buffer systems. Further, the biosensor was highly selective, not responding to any other secreted protein from P. acnes. Thus, it was possible to demonstrate the presence, and quantity, of RoxP on human skin. Therefore, the developed biosensor is a very promising tool for the detection of RoxP from clinical samples, offering a rapid, cost-effective and sensitive means of detecting low-abundant bacterial proteins in vivo in complex milieus."
https://openalex.org/W2792188382,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, strain CV777, was initially characterized in 1978 as the causative agent of a disease first identified in the UK in 1971. This coronavirus has been widely distributed among laboratories and has been passaged both within pigs and in cell culture. To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome (ca. 28kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different full genome sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession number AF353511) but they are >99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest proportion of variability including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more dramatically affected in three different variants of this virus through either loss of the initiation codon or gain of a premature termination codon. The genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5´-terminal sequence. This rearrangement was validated through the analysis of sub-genomic mRNAs from infected cells. It is clearly important to know the features of the specific sample of CV777 being used for experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W2789957887,"Here we examine a conceptualization of immigrant assimilation that is based on the more general notion that distributional differences erode across generations. We explore this idea by reinvestigating the efficiency-equality trade-off hypothesis, which posits that stratified education systems educate students more efficiently at the cost of increasing inequality in overall levels of competence. In the context of ethnic inequality in math achievement, this study explores the extent to which an education system’s characteristics are associated with ethnic inequality in terms of both the group means and group variances in achievement. Based on data from the 2012 PISA and mixed-effect location scale models, our analyses revealed two effects: on average, minority students had lower math scores than majority students, and minority students’ scores were more concentrated at the lower end of the distribution. However, the ethnic inequality in the distribution of scores declined across generations. We did not find compelling evidence that stratified education systems increase mean differences in competency between minority and majority students. However, our analyses revealed that in countries with early educational tracking, minority students’ math scores tended to cluster at the lower end of the distribution, regardless of compositional and school differences between majority and minority students."

The aim of this study is to elucidate the putative association between CRS and stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) using large population-based national health insurance data.Using the national cohort study from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, CRS patients (n = 22,959) and control participants (n = 91,836) were selected and matched at a rate of 1:4 (age, sex, income, region, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia). A Cox-proportional hazard model was used to analyze the hazard ratio (HR) of CRS for hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. We divided the participants according to age and gender for the subgroup analysis.The HR for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke was significantly increased in the CRS patients compared to that in the controls (adjusted HR = 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.10-2.80 for hemorrhagic stroke; adjusted HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.61-1.92 for ischemic stroke) after adjusting for age, sex, income, region of residence, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, migraine, chronic kidney disease, depression, sleep disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. In the subgroup analysis, the HR of hemorrhagic stroke was significantly increased in the CRS group regardless of age and gender. The HR of ischemic stroke was also significantly increased in all subgroups of the CRS group.CRS consistently increased the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke regardless of age and gender."
https://openalex.org/W2790750748,"Pathological cardiac hypertrophy leads to derangements in lipid metabolism that may contribute to the development of cardiac dysfunction. Since previous studies, using high saturated fat diets, have yielded inconclusive results, we investigated whether provision of a high-unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) diet was sufficient to restore impaired lipid metabolism and normalize diastolic dysfunction in the pathologically hypertrophied heart. Male, Wistar rats were subjected to supra-valvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) or sham surgery. After 6 weeks, diastolic dysfunction and pathological hypertrophy was confirmed and both sham and SVAS rats were treated with either normolipidic or HUFA diet. At 18 weeks post-surgery, the HUFA diet failed to normalize decreased E/A ratios or attenuate measures of cardiac hypertrophy in SVAS animals. Enzymatic activity assays and gene expression analysis showed that both normolipidic and HUFA-fed hypertrophied hearts had similar increases in glycolytic enzyme activity and down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation genes. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed depletion of unsaturated fatty acids, primarily linoleate and oleate, within the endogenous lipid pools of normolipidic SVAS hearts. The HUFA diet did not restore linoleate or oleate in the cardiac lipid pools, but did maintain body weight and adipose mass in SVAS animals. Overall, these results suggest that, in addition to decreased fatty acid oxidation, aberrant unsaturated fatty acid metabolism may be a maladaptive signature of the pathologically hypertrophied heart. The HUFA diet is insufficient to reverse metabolic remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, or pathologically hypertrophy, possibly do to preferentially partitioning of unsaturated fatty acids to adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2793201967,"The contribution of specific HLA Class II alleles in type 1 diabetes is determined by polymorphic amino acid epitopes that direct antigen binding therefore, along with conventional allele frequency analysis, epitope analysis can provide important insights into disease susceptibility. We analyzed the highly heterogeneous Cypriot population for the HLA class II loci of T1DM patients and controls and we report for the first time their allele frequencies. Within our patient cohort we identified a subgroup that did not carry the DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 and DRB1*04:xx-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02 risk haplotypes but a novel recombinant one, DRB1*04:XX-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*02:01 designated DR4-DQ2.3. Through epitope analysis we identified established susceptibility (DQB1 A57, DRB1 H13) and resistance (DQB1 D57) residues as well as other novel susceptibility residues DRB1 Q70, DQB1 L26 and resistance residues DRB1 D70, R70 and DQB1 Y47. Prevalence of susceptibility epitopes was higher in patients and was not exclusively a result of linkage disequilibrium. Residues DRB1 Q70, DQB1 L26 and A57 and a 10 amino acid epitope of DQA1 were the most significant in discriminating risk alleles. An extended haplotype containing these epitopes was carried by 92% of our patient cohort. Sharing of susceptibility epitopes could also explain the absence of risk haplotypes in patients. Finally, many significantly associated epitopes were non-pocket residues suggesting that critical immune functions may exist spanning further from the binding pockets."
https://openalex.org/W2793962914,"A survey of 67 experienced orthopedic surgeons indicated that precise portal placement was the most important skill in arthroscopic surgery. However, none of the currently available virtual reality simulators include simulation / training in portal placement, including haptic feedback of the necessary puncture force. This study aimed to: (1) measure the in vivo force and stiffness during a portal placement procedure in an actual operating room and (2) implement active haptic simulation of a portal placement procedure using the measured in vivo data. We measured the force required for port placement and the stiffness of the joint capsule during portal placement procedures performed by an experienced arthroscopic surgeon. Based on the acquired mechanical property values, we developed a cable-driven active haptic simulator designed to train the portal placement skill and evaluated the validity of the simulated haptics. Ten patients diagnosed with rotator cuff tears were enrolled in this experiment. The maximum peak force and joint capsule stiffness during posterior portal placement procedures were 66.46 (±10.76N) and 2560.82(±252.92) N/m, respectively. We then designed an active haptic simulator using the acquired data. Our cable-driven mechanism structure had a friction force of 3.763 ± 0.341 N, less than 6% of the mean puncture force. Simulator performance was evaluated by comparing the target stiffness and force with the stiffness and force reproduced by the device. R-squared values were 0.998 for puncture force replication and 0.902 for stiffness replication, indicating that the in vivo data can be used to implement a realistic haptic simulator."

In sugarcane, UDP-glucose is a branch-point in the carbon channelling into other carbohydrates, such as sucrose and cellulose, which are the major factors for sugarcane productivity. In most plants, UGPase has been described to be enzymatically active in the monomeric form, while in human and yeast, homo-octamers represent the active form of the protein. Here, we present the crystal structure of UGPase from sugarcane (ScUGPase-1) at resolution of 2.0 Å. The crystals of ScUGPase-1 reveal the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit and the multi-angle light scattering analysis shows that ScUGPase-1 forms a mixture of species ranging from monomers to larger oligomers in solution, suggesting similarities with the orthologs from yeast and human."
https://openalex.org/W2791823317,"To advance the study of variables associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with special consideration for the degree of disease activity, age and gender.The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and the presence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques along with clinical and biochemical characteristics were determined in 214 RA patients.Adjusted analysis reveals that men had a 0.059 mm significantly increased cIMT compared with women (p = 0.001; R2 = 3.8%) and that age was associated with cIMT (β = 0.0048 mm; p = 0.0001; R2 = 16%). Interestingly, we observed a significant interaction between gender and age. Thus, the effect of age on cIMT was significantly increased (12%) in men compared with women (p-value for interaction term = 0.041). Moreover, adjusted multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that disease activity score (DAS28) was significantly associated with cIMT in women (β = 0.021; p = 0.018: R2 = 0.03) but not men. In particular, women with high disease activity had a 0.079 mm increased cIMT compared with women in remission (p = 0.026). In addition, men in remission had a 0.134 mm increased cIMT compared with women in remission (p = 0.003; R2 = 8.7%). Active patients did not exhibit differences in cIMT values. Furthermore, 43% of patients presented carotid plaques. The variables independently associated with carotid plaques were age, smoking, health assessment questionnaire, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and rheumatoid factor (p<0.0001; R2 = 46%).In our cohort of patients with RA, DAS28 and age are differentially associated with cIMT in men and women. Our findings could explain the contradictory results that have previously been published in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2792966840,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer the possibility of cell replacement therapies using patient-matched cells to treat otherwise intractable diseases and debilitations. To successfully realize this potential, several factors must be optimized including i) selection of the appropriate cell type and numbers to transplant, ii) determination of the means of transplantation and the location into which the transplanted cells should be delivered, and iii) demonstration of the safety and efficacy of the cell replacement protocol to mitigate each targeted disease state. A majority of diseases or debilitations likely to be targeted by cell-based therapeutic approaches represent complex conditions or physiologies manifest predominantly in primates including humans. Nonhuman primates afford the most clinically relevant model system for biomedical studies and testing of cell-based therapies. Baboons have 92% genomic similarity with humans overall and especially significant similarities in their immunogenetic system, rendering this species a particularly valuable model for testing procedures involving cell transplants into living individuals. To maximize the utility of the baboon model, standardized protocols must be developed for the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells from living adults and the long-term maintenance of these cells in culture. Here we tested four commercially available culture systems (ReproFF, mTeSR1, E8 and Pluristem) for competence to maintain baboon iPSCs in a pluripotent state over multiple passages, and to support the derivation of new lines of baboon iPSCs. Of these four media only Pluristem was able to maintain baboon pluripotency as assessed by morphological characteristics, immunocytochemistry and RT-qPCR. Pluristem also facilitated the derivation of new lines of iPSCs from adult baboon somatic cells, which had previously not been accomplished. We derived multiple iPS cell lines from adult baboon peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in Pluristem. These were validated by expression of the pluripotency markers OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, SSEA4 and TRA181, as well as the ability to differentiate into tissues from all three germ layers when injected into immunocompromised mice. These findings further advance the utility of the baboon as an ideal preclinical model system for optimizing iPS cell-based, patient-specific replacement therapies in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2794238023,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play critical functions in the initiation of immune responses. Understanding their role in reactive arthritis (ReA) will help delineate the pathogenesis of this arthropathy. In early studies, we detected IL-12/23p40 deregulation in Yersinia entercolitica (Ye)-induced ReA in TNFRp55-deficient (TNFRp55-/-) mice. In this study, we assessed the contribution of DCs in this overproduction. First, greater levels of IL-12/23p40, IFN-γand IL-17A were confirmed in supernatants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TNFRp55-/-splenocytes obtained on arthritis onset (day 14 after Ye infection). Later, DCs were identified as a precise source of IL-12/23p40 since increased frequency of splenic IL-12/23p40+DCs was detected in TNFRp55-/- mice. After robust in vivo amplification of DCs by injection of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-Ligand (Flt3L)-transfected BL16 melanoma, DCs were purified. These cells recapitulated the higher production of IL-12/23p40 under TNFRp55deficiency. In agreement with these results, TNFRp55-/- DCs promoted Th1 and Th17 programs by co-culture with WT CD4+lymphocytes. A mechanistic study demonstrated that JNK and p38 MAPK pathways are involved in IL-12/23p40 overproduction in purified TNFRp55-/- DCs as well as in the JAWS II cell line. This deregulation was once again attributed to TNFRp55 deficiency since CAY10500, a specific inhibitor of this pathway, compromised TNF-mediated IL-12/23p40 control in LPS-stimulated WT DCs. Simultaneously, this inhibition reduced IL-10 production, suggesting its role mediating IL-12/23p40 regulation by TNFRp55 pathway. These results provide experimental data on the existence of a TNFRp55-mediated anti-inflammatory circuit in DCs. Moreover, these cells may be considered as a novel target in the treatment of ReA."
https://openalex.org/W2790454107,"The strategies of crossing B. napus with parental species play important role in broadening and improving the genetic basis of B. napus by the introgression of genetic resources from parental species. With these strategies, it is easy to select new types of B. napus, but difficult to select new types of B. rapa or B. oleracea by self-pollination. This characteristic may be a consequence of high competition with B. napus gametes. To verify the role of gamete viability in producing new B. napus individuals, the meiotic chromosome behavior of the interspecific hybrid between B. napus (Zhongshuang 9) and B. oleracea (6m08) was studied, and microspore-derived (MD) individuals were analyzed. The highest fitness of the 9:19 (1.10%) pattern was observed with a 5.49-fold higher than theoretical expectation among the six chromosome segregation patterns in the hybrid. A total of 43 MD lines with more than 14 chromosomes were developed from the hybrid, and 8 (18.6%) of them were B. napus-like (n = 19) type gametes, having the potential to broaden the genetic basis of natural B. napus (GD = 0.43 ± 0.04). It is easy to produce B. napus-like gametes with 19 chromosomes, and these gametes showed high fitness and competition in the microspore-derived lines, suggesting it might be easy to select new types of B. napus from the interspecific hybrid between B. napus and B. oleracea."
https://openalex.org/W2794330365,"Clearing of dry forests globally creates edges between remnant forest and open anthropogenic habitats. We used flight intercept traps to evaluate how forest beetle communities are influenced by distance from such edges, together with vertical height, spatial location, and local vegetation structure, in an urbanising region (Brisbane, Australia). Species composition (but not total abundance or richness) differed greatly between ground and canopy. Species composition also varied strongly among sites at both ground and canopy levels, but almost all other significant effects occurred only at ground level, where: species richness declined from edge to interior; composition differed between positions near edges (<10 m) and interiors (> 50 m); high local canopy cover was associated with greater total abundance and richness and differing composition; and greater distances to the city centre were associated with increased total abundances and altered composition. Analyses of individual indicator species associated with this variation enabled further biological interpretations. A global literature synthesis showed that most spatially well-replicated studies of edge effects on ground-level beetles within forest fragments have likewise found that positions within tens of metres from edges with open anthropogenic habitats had increased species richness and different compositions from forest interior sites, with fewer effects on abundance. Accordingly, negative edge effects will not prevent relatively small compact fragments (if >10–20 ha) from supporting forest-like beetle communities, although indirect consequences of habitat degradation remain a threat. Retention of multiple spatially scattered forest areas will also be important in conserving forest-dependent beetles, given high levels of between-site diversity."

The average inventory in the river mouth (10 km2) was 131 kBq⋅m-2 and 0.73 kBq⋅m-2 in the central bay (330 km2) as the decay corrected value on March 16, 2011. Most of the radiocesium that flowed into Tokyo Bay originated in the northeastern section of the Tokyo metropolitan area, where the highest precipitation zone of 137Cs in soil was almost the same level as that in Fukushima City, then flowed into and was deposited in the Old-Edogawa River estuary, deep in Tokyo Bay. The highest precipitation of radiocesium measured in the high contaminated zone was 460 kBq⋅m-2. The inventory in sediment off the estuary of Old-Edogawa was 20.1 kBq⋅m-2 in August 2011 immediately after the accident, but it increased to 104 kBq⋅m-2 in July 2016. However, the radiocesium diffused minimally in sediments in the central area of Tokyo Bay in the five years following the FDNPP accident. The flux of radiocesium off the estuary decreased slightly immediately after the accident and conformed almost exactly to the values predicted based on its radioactive decay. Contrarily, the inventory of radiocesium in the sediment has increased. It was estimated that of the 8.33 TBq precipitated from the atmosphere in the catchment regions of the rivers Edogawa and Old-Edogawa, 1.31 TBq migrated through rivers and was deposited in the sediments of the Old-Edogawa estuary by July 2016. Currently, 0.25 TBq⋅yr-1 of radiocesium continues to flow into the deep parts of Tokyo Bay."

Whereas several studies have evaluated the toxicity of mosquito control products on honey bees, most have been laboratory based and have focused solely on acute mortality as a measure of impact. The goal of this study was to determine effects of routine applications of truck-based ultra-low volume (ULV) mosquito adulticides (i.e., Scourge, Duet, and Deltagard) on honey bees in a suburban setting. The mosquito adulticides used in this study were pyrethroids with active ingredients resmethrin (Scourge), prallethrin and sumithrin (Duet), and deltamethrin (Deltagard), in which resmethrin, prallethrin, and sumithrin were synergized with piperonyl butoxide. We measured and compared mortality and detoxification enzyme activities (esterase and glutathione S-transferase) from sentinel beehives within and outside of mosquito control areas. Concurrently, colony health (i.e., number of adult bees, brood quantity and brood quality) was compared throughout the study period. No significant differences were observed in honey bee mortality, colony health or detoxification enzyme activities between treated (five sprayed areas each received one to three insecticide treatment) and control sites (four unsprayed areas that did not receive insecticide treatment) over the seven week study period. However, our laboratory study showed that exposure to resmethrin, the active ingredient in Scourge, caused significant inhibition of esterase activity compared with the control group. Our findings suggest that proper application of truck based insecticides for mosquito control results in little or no exposure and therefore minimal effects on domestic honey bees."

Given the substantial clinical and economic burden of these events in advanced BCa, we conducted the present study to understand the prevalence and identify the risk factors associated with these events among elderly women presenting with de novo metastatic BCa.Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare data, we identified women with incident metastatic BCa diagnosed during 2005-2009. Associations between patient demographics and select clinically relevant factors, and SCRT were examined using the Cox proportional hazards model, accounting for death as a competing risk.Of 3,731 Medicare beneficiaries with incident metastatic BCa, 1,808 (48.5%) experienced at least one SCRT event during a median follow-up of 13.2 months; a majority (69%) experienced a subsequent SCRT event. The proportions of women who had RAD, PF, BS, and SCC were: 32%, 28%, 8%, and 4%. Older women (80+ years), or those with more comorbid conditions (CCI≥2) had a statistically significant lower risk of SCRT (HR 0.78 [CI: 0.67-0.92, p<0.01]; HR 0.77 [CI: 0.67-0.89, p<0.01], respectively), primarily due to lower frequency of radiotherapy (p<0.01). Compared to Caucasians, African Americans had lower risk of SCRT (HR 0.70 [CI: 0.60-0.82, p<0.01]), as well as all SCRT subtypes defining this group except for SCC, which was the same for both race groups.This study highlights that certain patient characteristics and clinical factors are associated with the risk of spinal cord compression or pathologic fractures, or need for bone surgery or radiation among women with metastatic BCa. In future studies, it will also be important to consider the clinical and economic burden based on these components of skeletal complications and radiation therapy use in order to guide and improve the management of women with advanced BCa."
https://openalex.org/W2793906604,"Aortic smooth muscle contains limiting amounts of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) for myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation and contraction that predisposes to thoracic aortic disease in humans containing heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in MYLK. We tested the hypothesis that thoracic aortic smooth muscle contraction may also be susceptible to variations in the smooth muscle-specific isoform of the motor protein myosin where inactivation of one Myh11 allele or the presence of one Myh11 missense variant associated with an increased risk of human aortic disease may result in a reduced force development response. Additionally, other kinds of smooth muscles may be less sensitive to the effects of mutations in one smooth muscle myosin allele, similar to results obtained with Mylk. Force development responses were reduced in aortic tissue from a conditional knockout of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain in adult mice (Myh11+/- or Myh11-/-) with a greater reduction with homozygous vs heterozygous tissues. Similar reductions in force responses were obtained with tissues containing either a heterozygous or homozygous knockin mutation in smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (Myh11+/R247C or Myh11R247C/R247C mutations that cause human aortic disease) with no significant changes in RLC phosphorylation. Agonist-dependent force responses were not reduced significantly in urinary bladder, ileal, or tracheal tissues from Myh11+/- mice while only ileal tissue showed a reduced force response in Myh11R247C/R247C mice. Thus, heterozygous mutations in Myh11 associated with reduced myosin function result in compromised contractile function primarily in aortic smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2791146741,"In their foundational work on the social construction of gender, Kessler and McKenna (1978) investigated the relationship between gender attribution and genital attribution. We used digital reproductions of the original stimuli to replicate their findings in the current social context. To further investigate the underlying decision processes we applied eye tracking. The stimuli shown varied in the composition of gender cues: from those more commonly associated with maleness to associated with femaleness. Applying the ethnomethodological approach originally used, participants were asked to decide for each stimulus whether they saw a man or a woman and to indicate subjective confidence with the decision. In line with the original results we found that the genital attribution contributed immensely to the gender attribution. Also, male gender was ascribed more often when the penis was present than was female gender when the vulva was shown. Eye tracking revealed that overall most dwell time as a proxy for important information was dedicated to the head, chest and genital areas of all the stimuli. Total dwell time depended on whether the gender attribution was made in line with the depicted genital, if the genital was a penis. Attributing female gender when a penis was present was associated with longer total dwell time, unlike attributing male gender with a vulva shown. This is indicative of higher cognitive effort and more difficulty ignoring the penis as opposed to the vulva. We interpret this finding in context of the persistent male dominance as well as to the socio-cultural understanding of the vulva as a concealed and therefore seemingly absent organ. In summary, we were able to show that the gender attribution is still closely linked to genital attribution when having a binary forced choice task and that the penis is a special cue in this attribution process."
https://openalex.org/W2792990553,"Since the late 1990s, high mortality and declining populations have been reported among sea birds including Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) from the Baltic Sea area in Northern Europe. Repeated BoNT type C/D botulism outbreaks have occurred, but it remains unclear whether this is the sole and primary cause of mortality. Thiamine deficiency has also been suggested as a causal or contributing factor. With this study, we aimed to investigate gross and microscopic pathology in Herring gulls from affected breeding sites in Sweden in search of contributing diseases. Herring gulls from Iceland served as controls. Necropsies and histopathology were performed on 75 birds, of which 12 showed signs of disease at the time of necropsy. Parasites of various classes and tissues were commonly observed independent of host age, e.g. oesophageal capillariosis and nematode infection in the proventriculus and gizzard with severe inflammation, air sac larid pentastomes and bursal trematodiasis in pre-fledglings. Gross and microscopic findings are described. Notably, amyloidosis was diagnosed in 93 and 33% of the adult birds from Sweden and Iceland, respectively (p<0.001), with more pronounced deposits in Swedish birds (p<0.001). Gastrointestinal deposits were observed in the walls of arteries or arterioles, and occasionally in villi near the mucosal surface. Amyloid was identified within the intestinal lumen in one severely affected gull suggesting the possibility of oral seeding and the existence of a primed state as previously described in some mammals and chickens. This could speculatively explain the high occurrence and previously reported rapid onset of amyloidosis upon inflammation or captivity in Herring gulls. Amyloid-induced malabsorbtion is also a possibility. The Herring gull SAA/AA protein sequence was shown to be highly conserved but differed at the N-terminus from other avian species."
https://openalex.org/W2790828261,"Different oculomotor abnormalities have been reported to occur in premanifest Huntington's disease. The aim of this study is to investigate which oculomotor items of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) are affected in premanifest individuals compared to healthy controls, and if CAG repeat length and age are correlated with oculomotor abnormalities in premanifest Huntington's disease gene carriers.We compared baseline data of 70 premanifest individuals and 27 controls who participated in the Enroll-HD study at the Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands. Premanifest gene carriers were divided in individuals near to disease onset and individuals far from disease onset.Using a logistic regression model, only horizontal ocular pursuit of the six oculomotor items of the UHDRS was significantly more frequently affected in premanifest individuals close to disease onset compared to controls (p = 0.044, OR 13.100). Age was significantly higher in premanifest individuals with affected horizontal ocular pursuit (p = 0.016, OR 1.115) and with affected vertical ocular pursuit (p = 0.030, OR 1.065) compared to premanifest individuals without ocular pursuit deficits.Our results suggest that horizontal ocular pursuit is the only affected oculomotor item of the UHDRS in premanifest individuals and could be used to assess early clinical signs of Huntington's disease. Saccade initiation and saccade velocity do not seem useful for detecting differences between premanifest individuals and controls."
https://openalex.org/W2793682210,"In this study, we report the establishment and characterization of a new epithelial cell line, goose embryonated epithelial cell line (GEE), derived from embryonic goose tissue. The purified GEE cell line can efficiently grow over 65 passages in the M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Immunofluorescence assay was used to identify purified GEE cells as epithelial cell line by detecting expression of the Keratin-18 and -19. Further characterizations demonstrated that the GEE cell line can be continuously subcultured with (i) a high capacity to replicate for over 65 passages, (ii) a spontaneous epithelial-like morphology, (iii) constant chromosomal features and (iv) without an evidence of converting to tumorigenic cells either in vitro or in vivo study. Moreover, the GEE cell line can be effectively transfected with plasmids expressing reporter genes of different avian viruses, such as VP3, VP1 and F of goose parvo virus (GPV), duck hepatitis virus (DHV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respectively. Finally, the established GEE cell line was evaluated for avian viruses infection susceptibility. Our results showed that the tested GPV, DHAV and NDV were capable to replicate in the new cell line with titers a comparatively higher to the ones detected in the traditional culture system. Accordingly, our established GEE cell line is apparently a suitable in vitro model for transgenic, and infection manipulation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2790831356,"The aim of the present study was to observe whether performing a low intensity endurance exercise following an overnight fasted (FAST) or fed (FED) condition promotes different cardiorespiratory, enzymatic and hormonal responses. Nine male physical active subjects, (age 21.89 ± 2.52 years old, height 175.89 ± 5.16 cm, weight 72.10 ± 4.31 kg, estimated body fat 7.25 ± 2.11%), randomly performed two sessions of 45 minutes' low intensity exercise (individual ventilator threshold) interspersed by seven days, differentiated only in whether they were provided with a standardized meal or not. The oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously at the 30-min rest, the 45-min during and the 30-min post-exercise. The testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) hormones were measured at rest, immediately post-exercise and 15-min post-exercise. The Glucose (GLU), Free fatty acids (FFA) and enzyme lipase activity (ELP) were measured at rest, 15-min and 30-min exercise, immediately, 15-min and 30-min post-exercise. Significantly lower values were observed in FED compared to FAST with: C (nmol/L) from pre (428.87 ± 120.41; 454.62 ± 148.33, respectively) to immediately post-exercise (285.10 ± 85.86; 465.66 ± 137.70, respectively) and 15-min post-exercise (248.00 ± 87.88; 454.31 ± 112.72, respectively) (p<0.05); and GLU at all times, with an exception at 15-min post-exercise. The testosterone/cortisol ratio (T/C) was significantly higher in the FED compared with FAST from pre (0.05 ± 0.02, 0.05 ± 0.01, respectively) to 15-min post-exercise (0.08 ± 0.03, 0.05 ± 0.02, respectively). No other significant differences were observed between conditions. We conclude that fasting prior to low intensity endurance exercise does not seem be advantageous, when it comes to fat loss, compared with the same exercise performed after a meal."
https://openalex.org/W2793768948,"The Sch9 kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the major TOR pathway effectors and regulates diverse processes in the cell. Sch9 belongs to the AGC kinase family. In human, amplification of AGC kinase genes is connected with cancer. However, not much is known about the effects of Sch9 overproduction in yeast cells. To fill this gap, we developed a model system to monitor subcellular location and aggregation state of overproduced Sch9 or its regions fused to a fluorescent protein. With this system, we showed that Sch9-YFP forms detergent-resistant aggregates, and multiple protein regions are responsible for this. This finding corroborated the fact that Sch9-YFP is visualized as various fluorescent foci. In addition, we found that Sch9 overproduction caused cell elongation, and this effect was determined by its C-terminal region containing kinase domains. The constructs we present can be exploited to create superior yeast-based model systems to study processes behind kinase overproduction in cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2791389117,"Background Young women frequently drink alcohol in groups and binge drinking within these natural drinking groups is common. This study describes the design of a theoretically and empirically based group intervention to reduce binge drinking among young women. It also evaluates their engagement with the intervention and the acceptability of the study methods. Methods Friendship groups of women aged 18–35 years, who had two or more episodes of binge drinking (>6 UK units on one occasion; 48g of alcohol) in the previous 30 days, were recruited from the community. A face-to-face group intervention, based on the Health Action Process Approach, was delivered over three sessions. Components of the intervention were woven around fun activities, such as making alcohol free cocktails. Women were followed up four months after the intervention was delivered. Results The target of 24 groups (comprising 97 women) was recruited. The common pattern of drinking was infrequent, heavy drinking (mean consumption on the heaviest drinking day was UK 18.1 units). Process evaluation revealed that the intervention was delivered with high fidelity and acceptability of the study methods was high. The women engaged positively with intervention components and made group decisions about cutting down. Twenty two groups set goals to reduce their drinking, and these were translated into action plans. Retention of individuals at follow up was 87%. Conclusions This study successfully recruited groups of young women whose patterns of drinking place them at high risk of acute harm. This novel approach to delivering an alcohol intervention has potential to reduce binge drinking among young women. The high levels of engagement with key steps in the behavior change process suggests that the group intervention should be tested in a full randomised controlled trial."
