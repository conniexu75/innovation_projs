https://openalex.org/W1994897102,"In 1978, three carbonized grains of barley and a carbonized grain of einkorn wheat were found in a buried hearth at a Late Paleolithic site at Wadi Kubbaniya in Egypt. In 1981, two large clusters of barley seeds, which were identified as six-row barley and thus domestic, were found at a nearby site of comparable age. Numerous grinding stones, presumed to have been used for processing the cereals, were found in these and other sites, often deeply buried, and 30 radiocarbon dates placed the occupations between 18,500 and 17,000 radiocarbon years ago. These finds led us to suggest an early origin of food production, with implications for the initial development of complex societies. Several barley seeds were analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy to determine the maximal temperature to which they had been subjected before burial. Six barley seeds and three small pieces of wood charcoal were dated directly by using a tandem accelerator mass spectrometer."

Under a system in which only grass was fed, livestock would be restricted to beef, milk, and lamb production. The amount of grain fed to U.S. livestock is about 135 million tons (metric) or about ten times the amount consumed by the U.S. population."

The upshot is that about a dozen parallel machines are now under development for AI alone. As might be expected, the approaches are diverse yet there are a number of fundamental issues in common: granularity, topology, control, and algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W1973907082,"The astronomical theory of climatic change provides an alternative to the traditional chronology for Holocene climatic change, which calls for one thermal maximum about 6000 years ago. The theory predicts a series of maxima during the Holocene, one for each season. Because the relation of the perihelion to the spring equinox changes with a 22,000-year period, late summer insolation would have been greatest 5000 years ago, whereas early summer insolation would have been greatest 13,000 years ago. Climatic reconstructions based on the response of ecosystems to late summer climate indicate a later Holocene thermal maximum than paleoclimatic data sensitive to early summer climate. In southern Idaho, three different vegetation types indicate thermal maxima at different times during the Holocene, depending on the climatic variable controlling each type."

Electronics and microprocessors, new engine transmission concepts, composite and ceramic materials, and computer-aided design and manufacture will combine to make possible the creation of advanced automobiles offering outstanding quality, fuel economy, and performance. A projected ""average"" vehicle of the 1990's is described to illustrate the application of these new concepts."

https://openalex.org/W2075689810,The appearance of regional city-states in pre-Hispanic Central Mexico corresponds with the disruption of socioeconomic relationships throughout Teotihuac√°n's political domain after 650 A.D. Surface reconnaissance and mapping at Xochicalco provided information on the growth and organization of one of these urban centers. The data indicate that Xochicalco was a well-planned urban center and capital of a regional city-state that extended its domain throughout western Morelos by military conquest.

https://openalex.org/W2036687091,The cell walls of sieve elements in the primary phloem of the Carboniferous fern Tubicaulis contain structural features that morphologically resemble cellulose microfibrils in extant plants. This may be the oldest example of distinct fibrillar structures in the fossil record. The possible identity and significance of these features are discussed and their structure is compared with that of cell walls in other fossil and extant plants.
