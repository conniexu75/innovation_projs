https://openalex.org/W2088046534,"Sleep is characterized by a structured combination of neuronal oscillations. In the hippocampus, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is marked by high-frequency network oscillations (approximately 200 Hz ""ripples""), whereas neocortical SWS activity is organized into low-frequency delta (1-4 Hz) and spindle (7-14 Hz) oscillations. While these types of hippocampal and cortical oscillations have been studied extensively in isolation, the relationships between them remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate the existence of temporal correlations between hippocampal ripples and cortical spindles that are also reflected in the correlated activity of single neurons within these brain structures. Spindle-ripple episodes may thus constitute an important mechanism of cortico-hippocampal communication during sleep. This coactivation of hippocampal and neocortical pathways may be important for the process of memory consolidation, during which memories are gradually translated from short-term hippocampal to longer-term neocortical stores."
https://openalex.org/W2066781880,"Both theoretical and experimental work have suggested that central neurons compensate for changes in excitatory synaptic input in order to maintain a relatively constant output. We report here that inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission in cultured spinal neurons leads to an increase in mEPSC amplitudes, accompanied by an equivalent increase in the accumulation of AMPA receptors at synapses. Conversely, increasing excitatory synaptic activity leads to a decrease in synaptic AMPA receptors and a decline in mEPSC amplitude. The time course of this synaptic remodeling is slow, similar to the metabolic half-life of neuronal AMPA receptors. Moreover, inhibiting excitatory synaptic transmission significantly prolongs the half-life of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, suggesting that synaptic activity modulates the size of the mEPSC by regulating the turnover of postsynaptic AMPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2005891911,"Radial glia cells perform a dual function in the developing nervous system as precursor cells and guides for migrating neurons. We show here that during forebrain neurogenesis, the transcription factor Pax6 is specifically localized in radial glia cells of the cortex but not of the basal telencephalon. In Pax6-deficient mice, cortical radial glia cells were altered in their morphology, number, tenascin-C (TN-C) expression, and cell cycle. We show that some of these alterations are cell-autonomous, whereas others were rescued by coculturing with wild-type cortical cells. Our results suggest that Pax6 plays an essential role in the differentiation of cortical radial glia. Thus, despite their widespread distribution, radial glia cells are regionally specified in the developing CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2044273755,"Long-term changes in synaptic efficacy may require the regulated translation of dendritic mRNAs. While the basis of such regulation is unknown, it seemed possible that some features of translational control in development could be recapitulated in neurons. Polyadenylation-induced translation of oocyte mRNAs requires the cis-acting CPE sequence and the CPE-binding protein CPEB. CPEB is also present in the dendritic layers of the hippocampus, at synapses in cultured neurons, and in postsynaptic densities of adult brain. α-CaMKII mRNA, which is localized in dendrites and is necessary for synaptic plasticity and LTP, contains two CPEs. These CPEs are bound by CPEB and mediate polyadenylation-induced translation in injected Xenopus oocytes. In the intact brain, visual experience induces α-CaMKII mRNA polyadenylation and translation, suggesting that this process likely occurs at synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2012585750,"Neuropilins bind secreted members of the semaphorin family of proteins. Neuropilin-1 is a receptor for Sema III. Here, we show that neuropilin-2 is a receptor for the secreted semaphorin Sema IV and acts selectively to mediate repulsive guidance events in discrete populations of neurons. neuropilin-2 and semaIV are expressed in strikingly complementary patterns during neurodevelopment. The extracellular complement-binding (CUB) and coagulation factor domains of neuropilin-2 confer specificity to the Sema IV repulsive response, and these domains of neuropilin-1 are necessary and sufficient for binding of the Sema III semaphorin (sema) domain. The coagulation factor domains alone are necessary and sufficient for binding of the Sema III immunoglobulin- (Ig-) basic domain and the unrelated ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Lastly, neuropilin-1 can homomultimerize and form heteromultimers with neuropilin-2. These results provide insight into how interactions between neuropilins and secreted semaphorins function to coordinate repulsive axon guidance during neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2006907150,"We report the cloning and mapping of mouse (mTim) and human (hTIM) orthologs of the Drosophila timeless (dtim) gene. The mammalian Tim genes are widely expressed in a variety of tissues; however, unlike Drosophila, mTim mRNA levels do not oscillate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) or retina. Importantly, hTIM interacts with the Drosophila PERIOD (dPER) protein as well as the mouse PER1 and PER2 proteins in vitro. In Drosophila (S2) cells, hTIM and dPER interact and translocate into the nucleus. Finally, hTIM and mPER1 specifically inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1-induced transactivation of the mPer1 promoter. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mTim and hTIM are mammalian orthologs of timeless and provide a framework for a basic circadian autoregulatory loop in mammals."

The predicted amino acid sequence of this novel mitochondrial carrier indicates a level of identity of 39, 31, or 30%, toward the mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier, phosphate carrier, or adenine nucleotide translocator, respectively, and a level of identity of 34, 38, or 39% with the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP1, UCP2, or UCP3, respectively. Northern analysis of mouse, rat, or human tissues demonstrated that mRNA of this novel gene is mainly expressed in brain, although it is 10–30-fold less expressed in other tissues.In situ hybridization analysis of brain showed it is particularly abundant in cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Chromosomal mapping indicates that BMCP1 is located on chromosome X of mice and at Xq24 in man. Expression of the protein in yeast strongly impaired growth rate.

These novel UCPs may explain proton leaks measured in mitochondria from most tissues and contribute to the partial coupling of respiration to ADP phosphorylation that exists in mitochondria from most tissues (9Rolfe D.F.S. Brown G.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 731-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Previous Northern analysis of rodent brain RNA using UCP1 cDNA or UCP2 cDNA suggested the existence of another mRNA related to the family of uncoupling proteins. 2D. Sanchis, C. Fleury, F. Bouillaud, and D. Ricquier, unpublished data. 2D. Sanchis, C. Fleury, F. Bouillaud, and D. Ricquier, unpublished data. Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of BMCP1, a novel member of the mitochondrial carrier family that appears to be expressed in brain and, to a lesser extent, in other tissues. Although the predicted sequence of this protein is less homologous to UCP1, UCP2, or UCP3, the functional analysis of the protein when expressed in yeast indicated its potential uncoupling activity and suggested that it could be a fourth member of the UCP family. Enzymes were purchased from Appligene (Illkirsch, France) and New England Biolabs (Ozyme, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). [α-32P]dATP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Les Ulis, France) and from NEN Life Science Products. Purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). For the cloning of mouse BMCP1, a mouse brain cDNA library (catalog number ML5004t,CLONTECH) was screened with 32P-labeled UCP1 and UCP2 cDNAs using standardized procedures. The selection of clones was confirmed using 32P-labeled insert from IMAGE clone 381344 obtained from the IMAGE Consortium and originating from human retina (GenBankTM accession number AA057007). A search in Unigene 3The World Wide Web address ishttp://www.ncbi. for uncoupling protein produced a set of expressed sequence tags that were annotated as similar to uncoupling proteins. Contig construction with the aid of further sequencing provided the information for primer design and cloning of human BMCP1. The IMAGE clone 381344 was the seed for creating a contig. A 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends on human brain using the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH) and primers: sense 5′-TGTCACCCATCAGTATCCATC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGTGGGGTGGTTCAAAG-3′ produced clones containing most of the human BMCP1 coding sequence. The PCR conditions used were: 94 °C 1 min and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min. After characterization and complete sequencing of rapid amplification of cDNA ends products, the full-length cDNA was generated using the Advantage high fidelity PCR kit, the human brain Marathon-Ready cDNA library (both fromCLONTECH), and the following PCR primer pair: sense 5′-TGGTCTCTCTCTCCCCTCAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CCACCCCACTGTTCTTCC-3′. The PCR conditions used were: 94 °C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 3 min. Mouse (4-month-old B6D2 fed female) and rat (8-week-old lean Zucker fed male) multiple tissue blots were made from RNA prepared in the laboratory from different tissues using the guanidium thiocyanate procedure (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar). A membrane containing 2 μg of mRNA from human tissues was purchased fromCLONTECH. Hybridization and washing procedures were conducted as described previously (3Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwitt R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Gen. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Three mice were intracardially perfused with paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and cut using a sliding microtome. 25-μm-thick sections were collected and mounted onto poly-l-lysine coated slides. The brain sections were then hybridized as described previously (11Richard D. Rivest R. Huang Q. Bouillaud F. Sanchis D. Champigny O. Ricquier D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with mouse BMCP1 sense and antisense cRNA probes. These BMCP1 cRNA probes were generated from the 979-base pair EcoRI/SacI fragment of a mouse BMCP1 cDNA subcloned into a pSELECT vector (Promega, Inc. Lyon, France), which was linearized withBamHI and EcoRI for sense and antisense probes, respectively. Yeast transfections and functional analysis using flow cytometry were carried out as described previously (3Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwitt R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Gen. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 12Bouillaud F. Arechaga I. Petit P.X. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Casteilla L. Laurent M. Rial E. Ricquier D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, the diploid yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain W303 was used for expression of BMCP1 or oxoglutarate carrier in the yeast expression vector pYeDP. Transformants were selected for uracil auxotrophy. Yeast strains were plated on minimal medium with glucose, supplemented with adenin and tryptophan. Liquid cultures were grown in lactate minimum medium as described (13Arechaga I. Raimbault S. Prieto S. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Zaragoza P. Miroux B. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of mitochondrial carriers under the control of the gal-cyc promoter was induced by galactose in absence of glucose. Measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential of yeast was estimated by flow cytometry in the presence of the DiOC(6)3 fluorescent probe. The preparation and use of permeabilized yeast spheroplasts was made according to Averet et al. (14Averet N. Fitton V. Bunoust O. Rigoulet B. Guérin B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 184: 67-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of respiration (in the presence of 6 mm NADH) was made with an oxygen electrode; measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential was determined with a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) electrode as described elsewhere (15Beauseigneur F. Goubern M. Chapey M.-F. Gresti J. Vergely C. Tsoko M. Demarquoy J. Rochette L. Clouet P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) under conditions where the ΔpH component was low and did not vary. To compare different spheroplast preparation, the experiments were performed using the same amount of respiratory chains as determined by the maximal respiratory rate in presence of 1 μm FCCP uncoupler. The initial state 4 of respiration was obtained in presence of oligomycin at 10 μg/ml. Then respiratory chain was titrated by the addition of potassium cyanide (concentrations ranging from 7 to 400 μm). Under these conditions, the uptake of TPP+ is proportional to the membrane potential, and independent preparations of spheroplasts or mitochondria can be accurately compared. A mouse brain cDNA library was screened using mouse UCP1 and mouse UCP2 cDNA as probes. A number of candidates clones were further screened using the human expressed sequence tag IMAGE clone 381344 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This expressed sequence tag was similar but not identical to hUCP1, hUCP2, or hUCP3. The screening led to the cloning of a mouse cDNA referred to here as BMCP1 (brain mitochondrialcarrier protein-1). The full-length cDNA of human BMCP1 was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The predicted amino acid sequence of mouse and human BMCP1 is given in Fig. 1. Mouse and human BMCP1 are highly similar and share a level of identity of 97%. The predicted sequence of the mouse protein is 322 amino acids (calculated molecular mass, 36,019 daltons), and the predicted sequence for the human protein is 325 residues. The BMCP1 sequence shows the three motifs characteristic for the triplicate mitochondrial carriers (boxed in Fig. 1) and also predicts the existence of six transmembrane domains (not shown). Differences between the human and mouse sequences at amino acids 23–25 (VSG) are probably due to sequence polymorphisms, because we also identified human BMCP1 cDNA, which lacks the corresponding 9-base pair VSG motif. The levels of identity between BMCP1 and UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 are 34, 38, and 39%, respectively. Therefore, the predicted BMCP1 sequence is less homologous to the other animal UCPs, which share 60–70% identity. BMCP1 sequence is 38% identical to the plant Solanum tuberosum UCP sequence (16Laloi M. Klein M. Riesmeier J.W. Muller-Rober B. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Nature. 1997; 389: 135-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A difference between BMCP1 predicted sequence and the other UCPs is in the 20 N-terminal amino acid residues in BMCP1 that are absent in UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3. This N-terminal sequence is significantly distant from known motifs implicated in the targeting of mitochondrial precursors to mitochondria. Whether this N-terminal part of BMCP1 is involved in targeting of BMCP1 into mitochondria is under investigation; preliminary data indicate that in vitro translated BMCP1 is incorporated in isolated mitochondria. 4D. Sanchis and K. Prip-Buus, unpublished data. In other respects, BMCP1 is as homologous to the mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier as it is to the other UCPs (39% identity, alignment not shown) and shares 30% identity with the adenine nucleotide translocator 1. Northern blot analysis of BMCP1 mRNA expression in mouse, rat, or human tissues revealed that BMCP1 is highly expressed in brain as a 1.8-kilobase mRNA (Fig. 2). In addition to the primary expression in brain, BMCP1 mRNA was also detected to a lesser in heart, skeletal muscle, gut, lung, kidney, uterus, testis, and adipose tissues of mice, whereas no expression was measured in liver of mice. However, relative to the brain, the levels of expression of BMCP1 mRNA in other tissues of mice (quantitated using a PhosphorImager) were 13-fold less in heart, 28-fold less in muscle, 9-fold less in gut, 7.5-fold-less in lung, 31-fold less in spleen, 7-fold less in kidney, 10-fold less in uterus, 7-fold less in testis, 9-fold less in peri-ovarian fat, and 30-fold less in brown adipose tissue. A weak expression of BMCP1 mRNA was observed in lung, adrenals, gonadal fat, ovary, heart, and kidney of rats. In human tissues, a clear signal was obtained in brain using Northern analysis. Some expression was also noticed in human testis and pituitary using a dot blot containing RNA from 50 different human tissues and purchased from CLONTECH (data not shown). Fig. 3 demonstrates the distribution of BMCP1 mRNA at the level of the tuberal region of the mouse hypothalamus. The expression was particularly abundant in the cortex, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus. This distribution substantially differs from that of UCP2 mRNA (11Richard D. Rivest R. Huang Q. Bouillaud F. Sanchis D. Champigny O. Ricquier D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in that it is more ubiquitous. The exact location of cells expressing BMCP1 mRNA remains to be delineated. To examine the activity of BMCP1 in mitochondria and test for possible functional uncoupling activity, BMCP1 protein was expressed in yeast as previously reported for UCP1 (12Bouillaud F. Arechaga I. Petit P.X. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Casteilla L. Laurent M. Rial E. Ricquier D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Arechaga I. Raimbault S. Prieto S. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Zaragoza P. Miroux B. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or UCP2 (3Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwitt R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Gen. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Upon induction of BMCP1 expression, the growth rate of yeast was significantly reduced relative to the vector control, whereas induction of expression of the mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier had no effect (Fig.4). BMCP1 expression increased the instantaneous generation time measured in liquid culture (241 ± 3 min, n = 5) when compared with yeast expressing no recombinant protein (185 ± 2 min, n = 5,p < 0.001, Student's t test). A similar inhibition of growth was observed in yeast overexpressing UCP1 or UCP2 (3Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwitt R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Gen. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 12Bouillaud F. Arechaga I. Petit P.X. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Casteilla L. Laurent M. Rial E. Ricquier D.

J. 1993; 296: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of BMCP1 on the mitochondrial membrane potential, we used flow cytometry analysis of intact yeast labeled with the fluorescent dye DiOC(6)3 (Fig. 5) and also analyzed permeabilized yeast spheroplasts (Fig.6). Induction of expression of BMCP1 for 5 h lead to a marked decrease of the staining with the mitochondrial pontential-sensitive probe of whole yeast analyzed by flow cytometry as previously observed with UCP1 (12Bouillaud F. Arechaga I. Petit P.X. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Casteilla L. Laurent M. Rial E. Ricquier D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting an uncoupling activity of respiration. In contrast, expression of the oxoglutarate carrier in yeast did not alter staining of the mitochondria. However, a decreased staining of mitochondria by the fluorescent probe does not necessarily reflect a decreased coupling of respiration because a reduction of the number of mitochondria or an increase of some other protonmotive force consumers would have provoked a similar effect. In fact, full demonstration of uncoupling activity of a mitochondrial protein requires additional analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics. The method allowing analysis of an imperfect coupling was first reported by Nicholls (17Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and modified by Brand et al. (18Brand M.D. Chien L.-F. Ainscow E.K. Rolfe D.F.S. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We have investigated the bioenergetics parameters concerning uncoupling effect of BMCP1 according to this method. For this purpose, nystatin permeabilized yeast spheroplasts are an accurate material easier to prepare than mitochondria (14Averet N. Fitton V. Bunoust O. Rigoulet B. Guérin B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 184: 67-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6Functional activity of mouse BMCP1 expressed in yeasts: analysis of respiratory rate and mitochondrial membrane potential using yeast spheroplasts. A, simultaneous recording of mitochondrial membrane potential (biphasic curves) and oxygen consumption (lines) of control (pYeDP plasmid) or BMCP1 yeast spheroplasts. Mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated from uptake of TPP+ (xaxis, TPP+ uptake is proportional to the mitochondrial membrane; see “Experimental Procedures”). Respiratory rate was measured using an oxygen electrode (the numbers along the respiratory traces correspond to nmol 02/min/mg protein).N, NADH (6 mm, respiratory substrate);A, ADP (2 mm); O, oligomycin (10 μg/ml)); F, FCCP (7 μm). The two traces on the right-hand side of the figure show the respiratory traces of control or BMCP1 spheroplasts used to perform the experiment shown in panel B; the exact values of respiratory control ratio corresponding to the curves shown are 3.1 and 1.78 for pYeDP and BMCP1 spheroplasts, respectively. B, relationship between respiratory rate (nmol 02/min/mg protein) of control (pYeDP, open circles) or BMCP1 (BMCP1, closed circles) yeast spheroplasts, and mitochondrial membrane potential (uptake of TPP+, x axis).

Addition of 6 mm NADH to permeabilized spheroplasts led to a true state 4 respiration (checked to be oligomycin-insensitive), which was enhanced in BMCP1 spheroplasts concomitantly with a lower membrane potential. Addition of 2 mm ADP promoting state 3 respiration decreased membrane potential to the same level and revealed a poor coupling of respiration of BMCP1 mitochondria compared with control mitochondria. The two traces on the right-hand side of Fig. 6 A show that addition of FCCP stimulated 3.1-fold the respiratory activity of control spheroplasts, whereas it stimulated only 1.8-fold the respiration of BMCP1 spheroplasts. This result was consistent with several experiments where we used different preparations of spheroplasts corresponding to independent cultures of yeasts, as well as independent transformations of yeast to rule out the eventuality of a bias due to the recipient cells. The respiratory control ratio values (defined as the ratio between respiratory rate in presence of FCCP, and respiratory rate in state 4 of respiration) of spheroplasts isolated from yeast overexpressing BMCP1 or not overexpressing BMCP1 were 2.02 ± 0.08 (n = 17) and 3.73 ± 0.22 (n = 26), respectively (mean ± S.E., p < 0.001, Student'st test). These data confirmed a lower coupling of respiration in yeast expressing BMCP1 compared with control yeast. Nicholls (17Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and Brand et al. (18Brand M.D. Chien L.-F. Ainscow E.K. Rolfe D.F.S. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) have shown that the measurement of the force/flux relationship between mitochondrial membrane potential and state 4 respiratory rate (in presence of oligomycin, i.e. in nonphosphorylating mitochondria) undoubtedly demonstrates and quantifies proton leaks through inner mitochondrial membrane. This method was applied to yeast spheroplasts. To obtain curves reported in Fig. 6 B, amounts of control and BMCP1 permeabilized spheroplasts were normalized to assume the same FCCP uncoupled maximal respiratory rate. Thus it is likely that the same quantity of mitochondria reflected by the same maximal activity of the respiratory chain was present. Data shown in Fig. 6 Bwere obtained in presence of oligomycin, and NADH oxidation was progressively slowed by potassium cyanide titration according to published protocols (Refs. 17Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar and 18Brand M.D. Chien L.-F. Ainscow E.K. Rolfe D.F.S. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar and see “Experimental Procedures”). As the rate of substrate oxidation decreases, the membrane potential (recorded with a TPP+ electrode in conditions where TPP+ uptake is proportional to membrane potential, the mean component of the protonmotive force) and the proton motive force decrease. The comparison of the force/flux curves of BMCP1 spheroplasts with control spheroplasts shows an enhanced respiratory rate regardless of the value of membrane potential. The decreased membrane potential associated with increased respiratory rate in BMCP1 spheroplasts suggested out the possibility that our observations might be due to an artifactual consequence of a lower mitochondrial content. According to Nicholls (17Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and Brand et al. (18Brand M.D. Chien L.-F. Ainscow E.K. Rolfe D.F.S. Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), these data demonstrate that BMCP1 expression induced an uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration in recombinant yeast and indicate that addition of BMCP1 to mitochondria increased a proton leak. On the basis of such data, it may be proposed that BMCP1 participates to the mitochondrial proton leak measured in brain mitochondria (19Rolfe F.S. Hulbert A.J. Brand M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1118: 405-416Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Whether BMCP1 modulates the efficiency of respiration in certain brain cells in vivo remains to be investigated. In preliminary experiments we tested the hypothesis of a regulation of BMCP1 activity in yeast by fatty acids or nucleotides that are known activators or inhibitors of UCP1 (1Nicholls D.G. Locke R. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) and observed no effect. The possible regulation of BMCP1 activity by particular ligands will be investigated. Actually, an uncoupling activity of a mitochondrial carrier moderately homologous to the UCPs is not entirely surprising because it was proposed that the adenine translocator of mitochondria, which shares 30% identity with UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, or BMCP1, can mediate the uncoupling effect of fatty acids (20Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Conversely, the data presented here do not rule out another activity of BMCP1. We determined the chromosomal location of BMCP1 in mice and humans. Both localizations are consistent with the presence of a single BMCP1 locus on the X chromosome. In humans a sequence tagged site (G23624) was derived from IMAGE clone 33681, GenBankTM accession number R44688, which is part of the human BMCP1 cluster. The transcript marker WI-13677 was mapped to human chromosome X between DXS1047 and DXS994, placing BMCP1 between 150 and 151 centimorgans on the human gene map (300.5 centiroentgens on the WI radiation hybrid map). The chromosomal location of mouse BMCP1 was determined in a well characterized C3H × Mus spretusbackcross panel, as described previously (3Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwitt R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Gen. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). A restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to map mBMCP1 to the X chromosome at 12.5 centimorgans, co-incident with Gria3. This location predicts that the human homologue would be on the X chromosome at Xq24, which is the same location identified by sequence tagged site mapping. The mouse BMCP1 locus is included in the confidence intervals for two mouse quantitative trait loci for body weight. These quantitative trait loci were named body weights 1 and 2. BMCP1 may be a positional candidate for these body weight quantitative trait loci, although they are very broad, including most of the X chromosome. Interestingly, the ADP/ATP translocator-2 (ANT2) gene, which is also part of the same mitochondrial carrier family as BMCP1, has been mapped to Xq24. This suggests the possibility that BMCP1 and ANT2 may be duplicated genes with divergent functions. In conclusion, we report here the cloning of cDNAs encoding a new mouse or human mitochondrial carrier protein that we propose to refer to as BMCP1. BMCP1 gene is located on chromosome X. On the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence, this new protein belongs to the family of mitochondrial carriers and is equally homologous to mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier and UCPs. However, when it is expressed in yeasts, the detailed analysis of the relationship between the respiratory rate and the mitochondrial membrane potential indicates that BMCP1 behaves as a potent uncoupler of respiration. The predominant expression of BMCP1 in brain raises the question as to the physiological significance and specific role for BMCP1 in neurons, for example the possibility to modulate ATP/ADP ratio or level of reactive oxygen species. We acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of M. F. Chapey and Dr. G. Durand for support during these studies."

Here, semD ligand binding studies of Npn-1 mutants demonstrate that the sema domain binds to the amino-terminal quarter, or complement-binding (CUB) domain, of Npn-1. By herpes simplex virus– (HSV-) mediated expression of Npn-1 mutants in chick retinal ganglion cells, we show that semD-induced growth cone collapse requires two segments of the ectodomain of Npn-1, the CUB domain and the juxtamembrane portion, or MAM (meprin, A5, μ) domain. In contrast, the transmembrane segment and cytoplasmic tail of Npn-1 are not required for biologic activity. These data imply that the CUB and MAM ectodomains of Npn-1 interact with another transmembrane growth cone protein that in turn transduces a semD signal into axon repulsion."

Distantly related taxa sometimes exhibit correlations between morphological differences and patterns of gene expression3,4,5,6,7,8, but such comparisons cannot establish how mechanisms evolve to generate diverse morphologies. Answers to these questions require resolution of the nature of developmental evolution within and between closely related species. Here I show how the detailed regulation of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax patterns trichomes on the posterior femur of the second leg in Drosophila melanogaster, and that evolution of Ultrabithorax has contributed to divergence of this feature among closely related species. The cis-regulatory regions of Ultrabithorax, and not the protein itself, appear to have evolved. This study provides experimental evidence that cis-regulatory evolution is one way in which conserved proteins have promoted morphological diversity1."

In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of two substrates of Trk kinases, rAPS and SH2-B, which are closely related Src homolog 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling molecules. rAPS and SH2-B are substrates of TrkB and TrkC in cortical neurons and SH2-B is a substrate of TrkA in sympathetic neurons. Moreover, rAPS and SH2-B bind to Grb2, and both are sufficient to mediate NGF induction of Ras, MAP kinase (MAPK), and morphological differentiation of PC12 cells. Lastly, antibody perturbation and transient transfection experiments indicate that SH2-B, or a closely related molecule, is necessary for NGF-dependent signaling in neonatal sympathetic neurons. Together, these observations indicate that rAPS and SH2-B mediate Trk signaling in developing neurons."

The mTim protein shows five homologous regions with Drosophila TIM. mTim is weakly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) but exhibits robust expression in the hypophyseal pars tuberalis (PT). mTim RNA levels do not oscillate in the SCN nor are they acutely altered by light exposure during subjective night. mTim RNA is expressed at low levels in several peripheral tissues, including eyes, and is heavily expressed in spleen and testis. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed an array of interactions between the various mPER proteins but no mPER-mTIM interactions.

We have produced a slice preparation of mouse barrel cortex that isolates Layer 4. We report that excitatory interaction between spiny stellate neurons is largely via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and that a given neuron contains more than one type of NMDAR, as distinguished by voltage dependence.

The wrapper gene encodes a novel member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Wrapper protein is expressed specifically on the surface of midline glia.

While there has been a great deal of research on bacterial polysialylation, eukaryotic, especially mammalian, protein polysialylation has been the focus of intense investigation in recent years. Although polysialic acid has been found throughout the taxonomic spectrum, only the oligosaccharides of a few mammalian proteins bear this modification. While polysialic acid has been found on the α-subunit of the rat brain voltage-sensitive sodium channel (6Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Catterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol.

Polysialylated NCAM has been observed in developing brain (9Finne J. Finne U. Deagostini-Bazin H. Gordis C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It is widely postulated that the polysialylation of NCAM oligosaccharides during the development of the nervous system and other organ systems in the embryo and neonate leads to a general decrease in cell adhesion (12Sadoul R.V.

Interestingly, recent in vitro studies on PST revealed that the PST enzyme is itself modified by polysialic acid and that this modification may be important for activity (28Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In light of the observation that PST is polysialylated in vitro, no published data to date have shown in vitropolysialylation of STX or in vivo polysialylation of either enzyme. Here we report the in vivo autopolysialylation of both PST and STX. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that both enzymes are associated with the cell and are found as high molecular mass, soluble forms in the extracellular space. Glycosidase digestion demonstrated that the high molecular mass forms of PST and STX are due to modification of the enzymes' complex,N-linked oligosaccharides. This modification was subsequently identified as α2,8-polysialic acid by its susceptibility to endo-N-acetylneuraminidase (Endo N) digestion (35Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R. Yu F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J.

Kitajima, unpublished results.. Last, indirect immunofluorescence localization of autopolysialylated PST and STX shows that both localize to the Golgi and the cell surface. Based on these data, we hypothesize that autopolysialylated PST and STX, found on the cell surface and in the extracellular space, may modulate the interactions of expressing cells.

Endo N was a gift from Dr. Frederic Troy II (Department of Biological Chemistry, University of California, Davis).35S-Express protein labeling mix and [α-35S]dATP for DNA sequencing were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma and Fisher. Full-length PST cDNA was obtained from Dr. Minoru Fukuda (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and full-length STX cDNA was obtained from Dr. John Lowe (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). The PST and STX cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Vent DNA polymerase and oligonucleotide primers specific for each cDNA (GATATCCAAGATGCGCTCCATTAGGAAG and TCTAGACCTTGCTTTACACACTTTCCTG for PST; GATATCATGCAGCTGCAGTTCCGGAG and TCTAGACCCGTGGCCCCATCGCACTG for STX). These primers specifically introduced an EcoRV restriction site at the 5′-end and an XbaI site at the 3′-end of each cDNA. Following restriction enzyme digestion, PST and STX cDNAs were ligated into previously digested pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector DNA to complete the construction of PST-V5 and STX-V5. Inserts were confirmed using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the T7 primer TAATACGACTCACTATAG (Genosys Biotechnologies, The Woodlands, TX). COS-1, CHO, and Lec2 CHO cells maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS (COS-1) or α-minimal essential medium, 10% FBS (CHO and Lec2 CHO) were plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates or 12-mm glass coverslips and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent. Lipofectin (COS-1) and LipofectAMINE Plus (CHO and Lec2 CHO) transfections were performed according to the protocols provided by Life Technologies, Inc. Thirty microliters of Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE Plus and 20 μg of PST-V5 or STX-V5 plasmid DNA in 3 ml of Opti-MEM I plus 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol were used for transfection of each 100-mm tissue culture plate. Two microliters of Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE Plus and 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA in 250 μl of Opti-MEM plus 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol were used for transfection of each coverslip. Following transfection of COS-1, CHO, or Lec2 CHO cells with V5 epitope-tagged PST or STX cDNA and expression of these enzymes in the cells for 18 h, 100-mm tissue culture dishes of transfected cells were incubated with cysteine/methionine-free DMEM for 1 h. After incubation, this medium was replaced with 3.5 ml of fresh cysteine/methionine-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml 35S-Express protein labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products). Cells were incubated with the radiolabel for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After labeling, medium was removed, cells were washed, and the labeled proteins were chased for various periods of time with DMEM, 10% FBS. Cell medium was collected, and cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer 2 (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). Both PST and STX enzymes were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and media at each time point using 2.5 μg of anti-V5 epitope tag antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (36Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, to avoid breakdown of the polysialic acid, the boiling step was omitted, and the immunoprecipitation beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and directly loaded into the gel wells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% separating, 3% stacking SDS-polyacrylamide gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using 10% 2,5-diphenyloxalzole in dimethyl sulfoxide (38Bonner W.M. Lasky R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar), and gels were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at −80 °C. COS-1 cells expressing either PST-V5 or STX-V5 were metabolically labeled for 1 h and chased for 6 h, and radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. Following the final wash, the immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose beads were treated with glycosidases for 18 h with shaking at 37 °C. For PNGase F, 1500 units of enzyme was added to 70 μl of distilled H2O and 30 μl of 1× reaction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) per manufacturer's instructions. PNGase F cleaves between the innermost N-acetylglucosamine and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides fromN-linked glycoproteins. For V. cholerae Nm digestions, 30 milliunits of enzyme was added to 70 μl of 1× reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 4 mm calcium chloride, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) per manufacturer's instructions. V. cholerae Nm hydrolyzes terminal N- or O-acylsialic acids that are linked via α2,3-, α2,6-, or α2,8-bonds. For Endo N digestions, a 1:10 dilution of enzyme in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to the immune complexes. Endo N cleaves α2,8-polysialic acid chains at random sites, requiring a minimum chain length of five sialic acid residues for activity (35Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R. Yu F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3553-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Endo H digestions, 10 milliunits of enzyme was added to 90 μl of 1× reaction buffer (0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 0.075% SDS, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) (39Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1987; 50: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Endo H cleaves only high mannose or hybrid N-linked oligosaccharide structures of glycoproteins. Digested samples were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel after the addition of 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and β-mercaptoethanol to 5% final concentration. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography, and gels were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at −80 °C. COS-1 cells were transfected with PST-V5 or STX-V5 cDNA, and unlabeled cell lysates and medium were collected after an overnight incubation. Lysates and medium were subjected to serial immunoprecipitation by rotation of samples for 1.5 h with 0.75 μg of V5 antibody and 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose in PBS. After this incubation, the immune complexes were centrifuged, and supernatants were removed to new tubes. An additional 0.75 μg of V5 antibody and 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose in PBS were added to the supernatants, and this mixture was rotated for an additional 1.5 h. This scheme was repeated a total of four times, with the final supernatant being retained. The immune complexes were electrophoresed on 7.5% separating, 3% stacking SDS-polyacrylaminde gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 500 mA. The membranes were processed for immunoblotting according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Anti-V5 epitope tag antibody (IgG) was diluted 1:5000, and anti-polysialic acid antibody, OL.28 (IgM), was diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer (5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20 for anti-V5 epitope tag antibody; 2% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, for OL.28 antibody). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-mouse IgM, were each diluted 1:8000 in blocking buffer (5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20). Immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at room temperature. Separately, aliquots (2.5% of total volume) of the final supernatants of cell lysates and medium from the serial immunoprecipitation were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and total protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoblots were cut into strips, and selected strips were treated overnight at 37 °C with a 1:10 dilution of Endo N. Immunoblotting with the anti-V5 epitope tag and anti-polysialic acid antibodies was performed as described above. COS-1 cells were plated on glass coverslips, transfected with PST-V5 or STX-V5, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (40Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with either −20 °C methanol to visualize internal staining or 3% paraformaldehyde to visualize cell surface staining. Anti-V5 epitope tag antibody was diluted 1:100, and the OL.28 anti-polysialic acid antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-mouse IgM, were diluted 1:200 in 5% normal goat serum/PBS blocking buffer prior to use. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using 20 μl of mounting medium (15% (w/v) Vinol 205 polyvinyl alcohol, 33% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% azide in PBS, pH 8.5). Cells were visualized and photographed using a Nikon Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination and a 60× oil immersion Plan Apochromat objective. In addition to their expected localization in the Golgi, many glycosyltransferases are found as soluble forms in the extracellular space and at low levels on the cell surface (41Jaskiewicz E. Zhu G.

Cell Res. 1995; 219: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether PST and STX are cleaved and secreted into the extracellular space, we performed pulse-chase immunoprecipitation analyses. PST and STX tagged with the V5 epitope at their carboxyl termini were transiently expressed in CHO cells. Cells were metabolically labeled with 35S-Express protein labeling mix for 1 h and chased with unlabeled medium for 0–12 h. V5 epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from both cell lysates and media with the anti-V5 epitope tag antibody, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. An approximately 57-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates of CHO cells expressing the PST-V5 enzyme (Fig.1 A). The size of this protein corresponds well with the expected molecular mass of the full-length epitope-tagged PST (PST-V5) modified by four N-linked oligosaccharides (28Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A smaller 52-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated from media and is likely to represent a cleaved and secreted form of the enzyme. More interestingly, we observed a heterogeneous, immunoreactive band extending from 105 to 190 kDa associated with the cell at early chase time points (1 and 3 h) and in the medium from 1 to 12 h of chase (Fig. 1 A). The polydisperse appearance of this high molecular mass immunoreactive band suggests that a large proportion of the PST-V5 is highly glycosylated and most likely polysialylated. Analysis of STX-V5 protein transiently expressed in CHO cells revealed a similar pattern of biosynthesis. A protein of 58 kDa molecular mass was observed associated with the cells, and a smaller, 53-kDa species appeared in the medium after 1 h of chase (Fig. 1 C). Again, the size of the 58-kDa protein corresponds well with the calculated molecular mass of the epitope-tagged STX (STX-V5) modified by four N-linked oligosaccharides, while the size of the 53-kDa protein suggests that it is a cleaved and secreted form of the full-length enzyme. Like PST-V5, we also observed a heterogeneous band extending from 70 to 131 kDa in the medium from 1 to 12 h of chase (Fig. 1 C). The polydisperse appearance of this band again suggests that the high molecular mass form of the STX-V5 is highly glycosylated and most likely polysialylated. These results demonstrate that both PST and STX are cleaved and secreted from cells as both highly modified and less modified forms. The polydisperse appearance of the highly modified forms of PST-V5 and STX-V5 suggest that both enzymes are extensively glycosylated and probably polysialylated. In order to determine what proportion of the molecular mass of PST-V5 and STX-V5 could be attributed to the addition of sialic acid, we expressed the PST-V5 and STX-V5 proteins in Lec2 CHO cells, metabolically labeled the cellular proteins, and immunoprecipitated the enzymes with the anti-V5 epitope tag antibody (Fig. 1, B andD). Lec2 CHO cells lack a functional CMP-NeuAc transporter and consequently show a very significant reduction in sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids compared with wild type CHO cells (47Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,48Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PST-V5 enzyme secreted from the Lec2 cells migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a molecular mass ranging from 55 to 82 kDa (Fig. 1 B). This is markedly smaller than the 105–190-kDa PST-V5 secreted from wild type CHO cells (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, the STX-V5 enzyme secreted from Lec2 cells migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a molecular mass of 56–80 kDa, and this too was significantly smaller than the 70–131-kDa STX-V5 protein secreted from wild type CHO cells (Fig. 1, compare C andD). These data indicate that the expression of the high molecular mass forms of PST-V5 and STX-V5 polysialyltransferases depend upon the cells' ability to sialylate glycoproteins. The previous results suggest that the bulk of these enzymes' molecular mass increase could be attributed to the addition of sialic acid residues to the oligosaccharide structures of PST-V5 and STX-V5. In light of Gerardy-Schahn and colleagues' (28Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) de"

The initial mechanism of SSAT superinduction is an increase in transcription in response to analogue exposure. This increased transcription appears to be modulated through the association between a nuclear protein factor and a cis-element described here as the polyamine-responsive element (PRE). The PRE was identified as a 9-base pair sequence, 5′-TATGACTAA-3′, in the context of a 31-base pair stretch from –1522 to –1492 base pairs with respect to the SSAT transcriptional start site. This element binds a nuclear factor from polyamine analogue-responsive cells, but not from polyamine analogue-insensitive cells. The labeled PRE was used to clone and identify the transcription factor, Nrf-2, that binds constitutively to the PRE sequence. Although the PRE sequence shares homology to the originally identified Nrf-2 recognition sequence, the two sequences are not identical. The Nrf-2 transcription factor appears only to be present in cell types that are capable of expressing high amounts of SSAT. The results of these studies suggest that Nrf-2, bound to the PRE, plays an important regulatory role of expression of the human SSAT gene.

The requirement for polyamines in growth and development is absolute in eukaryotic cells (1Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Although this requirement has been well established, some of the precise molecular functions of the polyamines have only recently been elucidated. Several newly synthesized polyamine analogues have been examined for their potential as antitumor agents (2Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Folsch U.R. Loser C. Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar, 3Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev.

These compounds have been designed to alter the regulation of polyamine metabolism and interfere with the normal functions of polyamines in tumor cells. Some of these compounds appear to act in an association with an ability to superinduce the expression of spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT),1 the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism (5Bergeron R.J.

The superinduction of SSAT has been associated with a phenotype-specific sensitivity to some of the antitumor polyamine analogues, and there are several reports demonstrating superinduction of SSAT and tumor cell toxicity (8Casero R.A.

Therefore, there is considerable interest in elucidating the mechanisms that differentiate sensitive tumors from analogue-insensitive tumors and normal tissue.Control of the analogue-mediated superinduction of SSAT is initiated at the level of transcription (14Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rucksdeschel J.C. Finkelstein D.M. Ettinger D.S. Leech R.H. Mason B.A. Joss R.A. Vogl S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1986; 4: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The -fold induction of SSAT transcription by analogue exposure is relatively small (2–7-fold) compared with the ultimate induction of enzyme activity; however, this increased transcription is necessary for the downstream events, which can result in >1000-fold increases in SSAT activity (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shappell N.W. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W.

Here we identify a cis-element in the 5′ regulatory region of the human SSAT and define it as a polyamine-responsive element (PRE). Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) results demonstrate that the PRE is bound by a cell type-specific DNA-binding protein that appears to exist only in cells that are capable of transcribing the SSAT gene (17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Xiao L. Casero R.A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 250Google Scholar). We used the labeled PRE in an expression library screening strategy to clone and identify the protein(s) responsible for the cell type-specific binding activity and subsequent transcriptional activation. The results of the experiments presented below suggest that the natural polyamines and some analogues can play a regulatory role in gene expression through modulation of the interaction between cis-elements and trans-acting factors.DISCUSSIONThe rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism, SSAT, was the first enzyme in the polyamine metabolic pathway demonstrated to be positively regulated by the natural polyamines and the antineoplastic polyamine analogues (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 10Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J.

The increase in expression is regulated at multiple steps, from modest, but necessary increases in transcription, to the stabilization of the active protein (10Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R.

Interact. 1992; 81: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the current work, a cis-element in the SSAT promoter has been identified, the PRE, which mediates the transcriptional induction of SSAT by the polyamine analogue, BENSpm. The increased transcription appears to be associated with a constitutively expressed nuclear protein, Nrf-2, which is expressed in the analogue-responsive cell types. The observed analogue-induced 2–3-fold increase in expression of the chimeric luciferase constructs are consistent with results of nuclear run-on experiments defining the transcriptional control of human SSAT (14Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results and the run-on experiments are in agreement with the hypothesis that once induced at the transcriptional level by the analogues, the majority of the observed increases in SSAT protein are a result of post-transcriptional mechanisms (33Parry L. Fouce R.B. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The initial transfection experiments using the SSAT promoter/luciferase chimeras yielded results with a relatively high background of luciferase expression. Although exposure to BENSpm consistently produced a significant induction of luciferase activity, the -fold increase was small. However, when cells were first depleted of their natural polyamines by pretreating with DFMO, the -fold induction increased. These results suggest that the normal concentration of intracellular polyamines is sufficient to drive transcription of the SSAT promoter when a large number of the promoter regions are available, as is the case after transfection. However, once the intracellular concentrations of polyamines have been depleted by DFMO treatment, this background transcription is reduced. Additionally, the chimeric constructs may be missing negative regulatory regions, which may be necessary to keep basal transcription low in cells with normal intracellular concentrations of polyamines, and the observed high background may be due to an efficient promoter region in the sequence examined.The effects of the polyamines and the analogues on SSAT expression is unique among the enzymes in the polyamine metabolic pathway (34Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The other rate-limiting steps in polyamine metabolism, specifically ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, are both negatively regulated by excess polyamines (35Porter C.W. Berger F.G. Pegg A.E. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,36Pegg A.E. Shantz L.M. Coleman C.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, this regulation appears to be limited to the post-transcriptional level (37White M.W. Degnin C. Hill J. Morris D.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Kameji T. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2427-2430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyamines have also been implicated in the regulation of expression of several other genes. The growth-related proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun have been demonstrated to be down-regulated at the transcriptional level by the depletion of the natural polyamines by DFMO treatment (39Celano P. Baylin S.B. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang J.Y. McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Wag H.L. Tzen C.Y. Scott R.E. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G331-G338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The current data are consistent with the hypothesis that Nrf-2 is the nuclear factor that binds to the human PRE in the EMSA studies. Although satisfactory antibodies are not currently available to perform supershift studies, the Southwestern analyses performed in the above studies provide solid supporting evidence that Nrf-2 is the trans-acting protein. Although unlikely, we cannot presently exclude the possibility that a protein other than Nrf-2 binds to both the PRE and Nrf-2 elements and has identical electrophoretic mobility.The current results are entirely consistent with past studies suggesting that H82 cells have low or no ability to express the SSAT gene (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 9Casero R.A. Mank A.R. Xiao L. Smith J. Bergeron R.J. Celano P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5359-5363PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of expression appears to result from the lack of measurable transcription of SSAT in H82, either basally or after analogue treatment (17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is possible that one of the reasons for this inability is the low expression of Nrf-2 in H82 cells demonstrated here. The potential lack of this DNA-binding protein is also consistent with the observation that the H82 cells lack a DNase hypersensitivity site observed in the H157 cells that maps precisely to the region where the PRE has been identified (17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the current study, DNase footprinting using H82 nuclear extracts indicates that H82 lacks the nuclear factor responsible for binding to the PRE. Moi et al. (25Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Google Scholar) demonstrated a widespread expression of Nrf-2 mRNA in multiple normal human tissues. Nrf-2 was found to be highly expressed in normal human lung. These results suggest that the H157 and A549 cells are more normal in their expression of Nrf-2 than H82, where Nrf-2 mRNA is nearly undetectable. Taken together, these data suggest that H82 and possibly other cell types may lack the necessary factors to express appreciable amounts of SSAT. Further, these data strongly support the importance of the PRE and Nrf-2 in playing a critical role in the polyamine analogue-induced expression of SSAT in sensitive cell types.It should be noted that the binding of Nrf-2 to the cognate PRE does not appear to be mediated by the presence of the analogues. However, the increased expression of SSAT is only observed in the presence of analogue or natural polyamines, suggesting that the activity of Nrf-2 is altered in the presence of the cation. Basu et al. (41Basu H.S. Schwietert H.C.A. Feuerstein B.G. Marton L.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,42Basu H.S. Sturkenboom C.J.M. Delcros J.-G. Csokan P.P. Szollosi J. Feuerstein B.G. Marton L.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have demonstrated profound changes in DNA conformation in the presence of the polyamine analogues. It has also been shown that DNA/protein interactions can be altered by the natural polyamines, as demonstrated by examining the effects of polyamines on restriction endonuclease activity (43Conrad M. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9707-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Pingoud A. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5697-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).These results suggest two possibilities for the involvement of Nrf-2 in SSAT expression. First, it is possible that Nrf-2 is modified in the presence of the polyamine analogue, thus activating transcription. Another possibility, potentially more likely, is that there is a partner protein that modulates the activity of Nrf-2 when cells are exposed to the analogue. Nrf-2 is known to have both an activation domain and a leucine zipper domain, which is typical among transcription factors that are modulated by protein/protein interactions (46Lamb P. McKnight S.L. Trends Biochem. 1991; 16: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). One family of proteins that has been demonstrated to associate with Nrf-2 and regulate its activity is the small Maf protein family (47Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 48Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 49Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Ito E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). NF-E2 is a globin-specific transcription factor that recognizes the same consensus sequence as Nrf-2, and appears to be tissue-specific in its expression in erthythroid differentiation (50Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Rommens J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). By contrast, Nrf-2 appears to be more ubiquitous in its expression, but in all instances known thus far, it is modulated in a tissue-specific manner by the small Maf proteins (47Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has not yet been determined if the Maf family members play a role in expression of SSAT.The mechanisms involved in SSAT expression will likely have significance beyond the regulation of the SSAT gene. Therefore, the polyamines may be expected to play a role in the regulation of other as of yet undefined genes. Since a number of polyamine analogues are under consideration for clinical trial, it is important to understand how such compounds might effect gene expression. If the action of the analogues is not limited solely to the regulation of the polyamine metabolic pathway, it will be important to understand how these compounds effect gene expression in order to avoid potential undesirable effects. Further, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of ODC is often associated with tumorigenesis and that polyamines are generally found in higher concentrations in tumor cells than in their normal counterparts (51Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 52Moshier T.A. Dosescu J. Skunea M. Luk G.D. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2618-2622PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the increased polyamine concentration associated with transformed cells may be necessary for the expression of genes required for the neoplastic phenotype (53Bryans M. Harley E. Gilmour S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), perhaps by activation of Nrf-2. The requirement for polyamines in growth and development is absolute in eukaryotic cells (1Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Although this requirement has been well established, some of the precise molecular functions of the polyamines have only recently been elucidated. Several newly synthesized polyamine analogues have been examined for their potential as antitumor agents (2Porter C.W. Regenass U. Bergeron R.J. Dowling R.H. Folsch U.R. Loser C. Polyamines in the Gastrointestinal Tract. Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 301-322Google Scholar, 3Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 4Woster P.M. Casero R.A. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit; Polyamines: Regulation and Molecular Interaction. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1996: 171-204Google Scholar). These compounds have been designed to alter the regulation of polyamine metabolism and interfere with the normal functions of polyamines in tumor cells. Some of these compounds appear to act in an association with an ability to superinduce the expression of spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase (SSAT),1 the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism (5Bergeron R.J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 36: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The superinduction of SSAT has been associated with a phenotype-specific sensitivity to some of the antitumor polyamine analogues, and there are several reports demonstrating superinduction of SSAT and tumor cell toxicity (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 9Casero R.A. Mank A.R. Xiao L. Smith J. Bergeron R.J. Celano P.

A. 1997; 94: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is considerable interest in elucidating the mechanisms that differentiate sensitive tumors from analogue-insensitive tumors and normal tissue. Control of the analogue-mediated superinduction of SSAT is initiated at the level of transcription (14Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rucksdeschel J.C. Finkelstein D.M. Ettinger D.S. Leech R.H. Mason B.A. Joss R.A. Vogl S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1986; 4: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The -fold induction of SSAT transcription by analogue exposure is relatively small (2–7-fold) compared with the ultimate induction of enzyme activity; however, this increased transcription is necessary for the downstream events, which can result in >1000-fold increases in SSAT activity (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shappell N.W. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1083-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we identify a cis-element in the 5′ regulatory region of the human SSAT and define it as a polyamine-responsive element (PRE). Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) results demonstrate that the PRE is bound by a cell type-specific DNA-binding protein that appears to exist only in cells that are capable of transcribing the SSAT gene (17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Xiao L. Casero R.A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 250Google Scholar). We used the labeled PRE in an expression library screening strategy to clone and identify the protein(s) responsible for the cell type-specific binding activity and subsequent transcriptional activation. The results of the experiments presented below suggest that the natural polyamines and some analogues can play a regulatory role in gene expression through modulation of the interaction between cis-elements and trans-acting factors. DISCUSSIONThe rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism, SSAT, was the first enzyme in the polyamine metabolic pathway demonstrated to be positively regulated by the natural polyamines and the antineoplastic polyamine analogues (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 10Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J.

The increase in expression is regulated at multiple steps, from modest, but necessary increases in transcription, to the stabilization of the active protein (10Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shappell N.W. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1083-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 17Xiao L.

Interact. 1992; 81: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the current work, a cis-element in the SSAT promoter has been identified, the PRE, which mediates the transcriptional induction of SSAT by the polyamine analogue, BENSpm. The increased transcription appears to be associated with a constitutively expressed nuclear protein, Nrf-2, which is expressed in the analogue-responsive cell types. The observed analogue-induced 2–3-fold increase in expression of the chimeric luciferase constructs are consistent with results of nuclear run-on experiments defining the transcriptional control of human SSAT (14Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

It has not yet been determined if the Maf family members play a role in expression of SSAT.The mechanisms involved in SSAT expression will likely have significance beyond the regulation of the SSAT gene. Therefore, the polyamines may be expected to play a role in the regulation of other as of yet undefined genes. Since a number of polyamine analogues are under consideration for clinical trial, it is important to understand how such compounds might effect gene expression. If the action of the analogues is not limited solely to the regulation of the polyamine metabolic pathway, it will be important to understand how these compounds effect gene expression in order to avoid potential undesirable effects. Further, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of ODC is often associated with tumorigenesis and that polyamines are generally found in higher concentrations in tumor cells than in their normal counterparts (51Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 52Moshier T.A. Dosescu J. Skunea M. Luk G.D. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2618-2622PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the increased polyamine concentration associated with transformed cells may be necessary for the expression of genes required for the neoplastic phenotype (53Bryans M. Harley E. Gilmour S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), perhaps by activation of Nrf-2. The rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism, SSAT, was the first enzyme in the polyamine metabolic pathway demonstrated to be positively regulated by the natural polyamines and the antineoplastic polyamine analogues (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 10Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J.

The increase in expression is regulated at multiple steps, from modest, but necessary increases in transcription, to the stabilization of the active protein (10Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shappell N.W. Miller J.T. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 1083-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 17Xiao L.

Interact. 1992; 81: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the current work, a cis-element in the SSAT promoter has been identified, the PRE, which mediates the transcriptional induction of SSAT by the polyamine analogue, BENSpm. The increased transcription appears to be associated with a constitutively expressed nuclear protein, Nrf-2, which is expressed in the analogue-responsive cell types. The observed analogue-induced 2–3-fold increase in expression of the chimeric luciferase constructs are consistent with results of nuclear run-on experiments defining the transcriptional control of human SSAT (14Fogel-Petrovic M. Shappell N.W. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19118-19125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results and the run-on experiments are in agreement with the hypothesis that once induced at the transcriptional level by the analogues, the majority of the observed increases in SSAT protein are a result of post-transcriptional mechanisms (33Parry L. Fouce R.B. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The initial transfection experiments using the SSAT promoter/luciferase chimeras yielded results with a relatively high background of luciferase expression. Although exposure to BENSpm consistently produced a significant induction of luciferase activity, the -fold increase was small. However, when cells were first depleted of their natural polyamines by pretreating with DFMO, the -fold induction increased. These results suggest that the normal concentration of intracellular polyamines is sufficient to drive transcription of the SSAT promoter when a large number of the promoter regions are available, as is the case after transfection. However, once the intracellular concentrations of polyamines have been depleted by DFMO treatment, this background transcription is reduced. Additionally, the chimeric constructs may be missing negative regulatory regions, which may be necessary to keep basal transcription low in cells with normal intracellular concentrations of polyamines, and the observed high background may be due to an efficient promoter region in the sequence examined. The effects of the polyamines and the analogues on SSAT expression is unique among the enzymes in the polyamine metabolic pathway (34Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The other rate-limiting steps in polyamine metabolism, specifically ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, are both negatively regulated by excess polyamines (35Porter C.W. Berger F.G. Pegg A.E. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,36Pegg A.E. Shantz L.M. Coleman C.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, this regulation appears to be limited to the post-transcriptional level (37White M.W. Degnin C. Hill J. Morris D.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Kameji T. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2427-2430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyamines have also been implicated in the regulation of expression of several other genes. The growth-related proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun have been demonstrated to be down-regulated at the transcriptional level by the depletion of the natural polyamines by DFMO treatment (39Celano P. Baylin S.B. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang J.Y. McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Wag H.L. Tzen C.Y. Scott R.E. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G331-G338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current data are consistent with the hypothesis that Nrf-2 is the nuclear factor that binds to the human PRE in the EMSA studies. Although satisfactory antibodies are not currently available to perform supershift studies, the Southwestern analyses performed in the above studies provide solid supporting evidence that Nrf-2 is the trans-acting protein. Although unlikely, we cannot presently exclude the possibility that a protein other than Nrf-2 binds to both the PRE and Nrf-2 elements and has identical electrophoretic mobility. The current results are entirely consistent with past studies suggesting that H82 cells have low or no ability to express the SSAT gene (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 9Casero R.A. Mank A.R. Xiao L. Smith J. Bergeron R.J. Celano P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5359-5363PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of expression appears to result from the lack of measurable transcription of SSAT in H82, either basally or after analogue treatment (17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is possible that one of the reasons for this inability is the low expression of Nrf-2 in H82 cells demonstrated here. The potential lack of this DNA-binding protein is also consistent with the observation that the H82 cells lack a DNase hypersensitivity site observed in the H157 cells that maps precisely to the region where the PRE has been identified (17Xiao L. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the current study, DNase footprinting using H82 nuclear extracts indicates that H82 lacks the nuclear factor responsible for binding to the PRE. Moi et al. (25Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Google Scholar) demonstrated a widespread expression of Nrf-2 mRNA in multiple normal human tissues. Nrf-2 was found to be highly expressed in normal human lung. These results suggest that the H157 and A549 cells are more normal in their expression of Nrf-2 than H82, where Nrf-2 mRNA is nearly undetectable. Taken together, these data suggest that H82 and possibly other cell types may lack the necessary factors to express appreciable amounts of SSAT. Further, these data strongly support the importance of the PRE and Nrf-2 in playing a critical role in the polyamine analogue-induced expression of SSAT in sensitive cell types. It should be noted that the binding of Nrf-2 to the cognate PRE does not appear to be mediated by the presence of the analogues. However, the increased expression of SSAT is only observed in the presence of analogue or natural polyamines, suggesting that the activity of Nrf-2 is altered in the presence of the cation. Basu et al. (41Basu H.S. Schwietert H.C.A. Feuerstein B.G. Marton L.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,42Basu H.S. Sturkenboom C.J.M. Delcros J.-G. Csokan P.P. Szollosi J. Feuerstein B.G. Marton L.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have demonstrated profound changes in DNA conformation in the presence of the polyamine analogues. It has also been shown that DNA/protein interactions can be altered by the natural polyamines, as demonstrated by examining the effects of polyamines on restriction endonuclease activity (43Conrad M. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9707-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Pingoud A. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5697-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results suggest two possibilities for the involvement of Nrf-2 in SSAT expression. First, it is possible that Nrf-2 is modified in the presence of the polyamine analogue, thus activating transcription. Another possibility, potentially more likely, is that there is a partner protein that modulates the activity of Nrf-2 when cells are exposed to the analogue. Nrf-2 is known to have both an activation domain and a leucine zipper domain, which is typical among transcription factors that are modulated by protein/protein interactions (46Lamb P. McKnight S.L. Trends Biochem. 1991; 16: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). One family of proteins that has been demonstrated to associate with Nrf-2 and regulate its activity is the small Maf protein family (47Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 48Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). NF-E2 is a globin-specific transcription factor that recognizes the same consensus sequence as Nrf-2, and appears to be tissue-specific in its expression in erthythroid differentiation (50Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Rommens J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). By contrast, Nrf-2 appears to be more ubiquitous in its expression, but in all instances known thus far, it is modulated in a tissue-specific manner by the small Maf proteins (47Marini M.G. Chan K.

https://openalex.org/W2083108636,"p190 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Rho family of GTPases. The GAP domain of p190 is at the C terminus of the protein. At its N terminus, p190 contains a GTP binding domain of unknown significance. We have introduced a mutation (Ser36 → Asn) into this domain of p190 that decreased its ability to bind guanine nucleotide when expressed as a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged protein in COS cells. In vitro,both the wild type and S36N mutant HA-p190 proteins showed similar GAP activities toward RhoA, but when expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts only wild type p190 appeared able to function as a RhoGAP. Wild type HA-p190 induced a phenotype of rounded cells with long, beaded extensions similar to that seen when Rho function is disrupted by ADP-ribosylation. HA-p190(S36N), although expressed at a similar level to the wild type protein, had no discernible effect on the cells. The beaded extension phenotype induced by wild type HA-p190 required GAP function. A GAP-defective mutant, p190(R1283A), had no effect on cell morphology. Moreover, the beaded extension phenotype could be suppressed by co-expression of a gain-of-function Rho mutant, RhoA(G14V), or Rac mutant, Rac1(G12V). Activation of the Jun kinase (JNK) via muscarinic receptors was inhibited by wild type HA-p190, but JNK activity was enhanced by the S36N mutant. Co-expression of HA-p190 with a fragment containing only the mutated GTP binding domain partially inhibited the beaded extension phenotype, suggesting that it may sequester a factor required for p190 function.

Within cells there are numerous proteins that bind to and hydrolyze GTP and that function as molecular switches. One class of GTPases, which has been called the Ras superfamily, can be subdivided into families according both to sequence similarity and function. The Rho family of GTPases which includes Rho, Rac, Cdc42, and TC10 is involved in various aspects of cytoskeletal organization (1Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rho GTPases can activate the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1 and can regulate the transcriptional activity of certain genes (2Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Actions of the Ras-like GTPases are tightly controlled and are dictated by the state of nucleotide binding, which alters the conformation of discrete “switch regions” in the proteins (3Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The change in conformation allows the GTPases to interact with their appropriate targets (4Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar). Regulation of the Ras-like GTPases is accomplished by GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors), which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on the GTPases, and GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins), the function of which is to catalyze the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP (5Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). GAPs have been identified that act specifically either on Ras or Rho GTPases. RasGAPs include p120 (6Trahey M. Wong G. Halenbeck R. Rubinfeld B. Martin G.A. Ladner M. Long C.M. Crosier W.J. Watt K. Koths K. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 242: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and neurofibromin (7Martin G.A. Viskochil D. Bollag G. McCabe P.C. Crosier W.J. Haubruck H. Conroy L. Clark R. O'Connell P. Cawthon R.M. Innis M.A. McCormick F. Cell. 1990; 63: 843-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), whereas p190, Bcr, and RhoGAP act on the Rho subfamily of GTPases (8Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Many of these GAPs possess, in addition to the sequences responsible for enhancing GTP hydrolysis, domains that are found in diverse signal transduction components. For example, the p190 RhoGAP contains a C-terminal catalytic domain and at its extreme N terminus a region with significant sequence similarity to the guanine nucleotide binding domain of the Ras superfamily of GTPases (9Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This region is most similar to the yeast Rab GTPase, Ypt1, but it contains unusual amino acid residue substitutions within key motifs. Through this N-terminal region, p190 has been shown to bind GTP, and mutations within the GTP binding domain of p190 exhibit altered nucleotide binding affinities (10Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the significance of this GTP binding domain is unknown. In addition to their ability to enhance hydrolysis of GTP, some GAPs may be downstream effectors of the GTPases with which they interact. The p120 RasGAP is believed to be involved in signal transduction events (11Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). It recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated p190 RhoGAP (12Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar,13Hu K.Q. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and in cells transformed by tyrosine kinases, most of the p120 RasGAP is found complexed to p190 (14Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The formation of a p120-p190 complex may provide a means for the Ras and Rho GTPase pathways to coordinate their signals. The p190 RhoGAP is predominantly cytoplasmic, although changes in localization have been reported to occur when cells are stimulated with certain growth factors. In murine fibroblasts that overexpress c-Src, for example, stimulation with epidermal growth factor induces a rapid and transient condensation of p190 RhoGAP and p120 RasGAP into arc-like structures radiating away from the nucleus (15Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cheng et al. (16Cheng J.C. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Bearer E.L. Kumar P.S. Kannan B. Santos-Moore A. Rifai A. Settleman J. Clark J.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 652: 139-148Google Scholar) have shown that in chronic myelogenous leukemic cells the association of p190 with p120 parallels an increase in actin polymerization and cell adhesion induced by phorbol esters. However, these treatments have not been shown directly to alter the GAP activity of p190. A new p190 RhoGAP isoform has been discovered, called p190-B. This protein is expressed in a number of cell types and is clustered at adherence sites where the cell membrane attaches to fibronectin (17Burbelo P.D. Miyamoto S. Utani A. Brill S. Yamada K.M. Hall A. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30919-30926Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This interaction could establish a transmembrane link between integrins and the Rho family of GTPases, but there is no evidence to date that integrins modulate p190 GAP activity. The existence of an unusual GTP binding domain (GBD) in p190 suggests the interesting possibility that it functions to control the RhoGAP domain. To investigate this hypothesis, we created a mutant p190 protein in which Ser36 was changed to Asn. This mutation is homologous to the Ras(S17N) mutation that generates a protein with decreased affinity for nucleotide binding (18Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By using this mutant protein we showed that binding of GTP is required for p190 RhoGAP function within the cell, even though in vitro RhoGAP activity is not affected. We speculate that regulatory factors tightly control the GTP/GDP ratio of p190 which in turn regulates its GAP activity and hence modulates the Rho GTPases. AHindIII-EcoRI fragment was isolated from p190 cDNA clone 391 (9Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) provided by R. Weinberg and J. Settleman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). This fragment, which lacks the 5′ 670 base pairs of the p190 open reading frame, was subcloned into pBS. The first 670-base pair fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to include a 5′ BamHI site. The PCR product was cut with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into the pBS-p190 plasmid. The reconstructed p190 open reading frame was excised from pBS using BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pKH3, which attaches, in frame, a triple HA1 tag to the N terminus (19Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To make GFP-p190, theBamHI-EcoRI p190 fragment was inserted into a vector (K7-GFP) that contains a BamHI-EcoRI cloning site in the same frame as pKH3, 3′ to the GFP open reading frame (20Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 133: 985-996Google Scholar). The mutation Ser17 → Asn in Ras creates a mutant GTPase that cannot stably bind guanine nucleotides. The equivalent residue in p190 is Ser36. We mutated this residue to Asn to produce p190(S36N) by overlap polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (21Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using pKH3-p190 as a template, a mismatched 5′ primer and a 3′ primer about 800 base pairs downstream. The PCR product, containing the mutation, was digested with BamHI and HindIII and then inserted in place of the wild type p190 fragment in pKH3. To create a GAP-defective p190, a point mutation was introduced so as to alter Arg1283 → Ala. This residue is highly conserved in GAP domains and is required for their catalytic activity (22Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An R1283K mutation in p190 was recently shown to destroy the p190 RhoGAP activity (23Li R. Zhang B.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To create p190(R1283A), a fragment of p190 extending from the XhoI site to the EcoRI site was subcloned into the pBluescript II KS phagemid (Stratagene) in which the KpnI site was previously destroyed. Using pKH3-p190 as a template, a mismatched 5′ primer containing the p190NsiI site at about position 3800 and sequence encoding for the Arg1283 to Ala mutation was used for amplification together with a 3′ primer about 200 base pairs downstream that contained a KpnI site. The PCR product was digested withKpnI and NsiI and then inserted in place of the wild type fragment in the Bluescript-p190(XhoI-EcoRI) construct. The p190 fragment containing R1283A was cut out of Bluescript from theXhoI to EcoRI site and inserted in place of the wild type p190 fragment in pKH3. The regions of p190 in which the mutations were introduced were sequenced to verify the mutations were present. The p190(1–266) and p190(1–266)S36N truncation mutants were created by PCR which added a stop codon and an EcoRI site after position 266 in the nucleotide sequence. These fragments were then inserted into pKH3. NIH 3T3 and COS cells were cultured and transfected by the CaPO4 method as described previously (19Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Amounts of plasmid transfected are described in the figure legends. For immunofluorescence, NIH 3T3 cells on Lab-Tek glass slides were transfected, allowed to grow 38–40 h, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with −20 °C methanol for 2 min and blocked in 2% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for at least 1 h. Cells were then incubated with either a 1:400 dilution of the anti-HA1 antibody 12CA5 or a 5 μg/ml concentration of anti-p190 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with TBS-T, detection of antibody was accomplished by incubating the cells with a 1:1000 dilution of secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse) in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBS-T for 1 h. Cells were washed with TBS-T and mounted with Vectashield (Vector). Fluorescence was detected using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with either an oil or water immersion 60× objective and recorded using a Photometrics 200 CCD camera. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. For detection of expressed GFP-fusion proteins, cells were fixed as above and directly mounted with Vectashield, prior to examination by epifluorescence microscopy. NIH 3T3 cells were grown on 35-mm plates and transfected with 5 μg of pRK7GFP-p190 plasmid. The GFP-p190 was imaged by fluorescence microscopy using a 20× objective lens. Time lapse began approximately 36 h post-transfection and continued over a period of 7 h at 37 °C. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu camera and processed using OpenLab and Adobe Photoshop software. Cells were lysed by adding a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and rocking on ice for 20 min. Cells were then scraped into centrifuge tubes and pulled through a 26-gauge needle 5 times. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g. Soluble lysates were incubated with 3 μl of 12CA5 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C at which time 30 μl (50/50 slurry) of protein A-Sepharose beads were added for an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The recovered antibody-antigen complex was washed 5 times in wash buffer (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.1), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and washed 2 times in wash buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 100 μm GTP, and 1 mmNaPO4). Detection of proteins was by immunoblotting as described previously (20Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 133: 985-996Google Scholar) with the following changes: blots were incubated with either a 1:6000 dilution of the 12CA5 antibody in TBS or a 1:500 dilution of the anti-p190 antibody. COS cells in 10-cm plates were incubated in 3 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/plate at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were then lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated as above with the following change: to the RIPA wash buffer was added 10 mm MgCl2 to keep the nucleotide bound to the immunoprecipitated proteins. Once the proteins were washed, bound nucleotides were eluted from the proteins by heating the recovered antibody-antigen complex to 68 °C in the following buffer: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm GTP, and 5 mm GDP. An aliquot of the eluted nucleotides was then spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate, resolved by TLC in 0.75m KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) (10Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and visualized by autoradiography. GTP/GDP ratio was calculated after background (empty vector) subtraction by assuming that all the phosphates were at equilibrium with the 32P label and using the formula %GTP = GTP/1.5(GDP) + GTP. GTP and GDP values were determined by PhosphorImager analysis. 5 μg of RhoA protein, which was produced inEscherichia coli as GST-RhoA and cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST, was loaded with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol); the labeled protein was then incubated with immunoprecipitated wild type or mutant p190 proteins for the specified time points. RhoGAP activity was detected as the loss of [γ-32P]GTP bound to RhoA. In control experiments (data not shown), RhoA loaded with [α-32P]GTP showed no significant reduction in 32P counts when in the presence of either wild type or mutant p190 proteins. The amount of 32P bound to protein was determined through a filter binding assay (24Wolfman A. Macara I.G. Science. 1990; 248: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells, which stably express the human m1 type (hm1) muscarinic receptor (19Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), were transfected with plasmids as indicated in Fig. 8. Transfected cells were stimulated with either 100 μl of distilled water (control) for 15 min, 100 μmcarbachol for 15 min, or 100 μg of anisomycin/10-cm plate of cells for 20 min. The cells were lysed in the following buffer: 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm okadaic acid. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g. Aliquots of detergent-soluble protein extract were removed from each sample tube and were fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted as above. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the remaining detergent-soluble extracts and washed 3 times in Buffer A (2 mm Na3VO4 and 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline), washed 1 time in Buffer B (100 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.5 m LiCl), and washed 1 time in Kinase Buffer (12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, plus 0.5 mm NaF and 0.5 mm Na3VO4). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 30 μl of Kinase Buffer, to each reaction tube was added 2 μg of purified GST-cJun-(1–79) and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min at which time the reactions were halted by the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunocomplex kinase reactions were fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed. Recombinant p190 protein expressed in SF9 insect cells is bound primarily to GTP (10Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of nucleotide binding to p190, it was necessary to create a mutation that eliminated binding of GTP. We therefore created a mutation within the p190 guanine nucleotide binding domain (GBD) that is homologous to the Ser17 → Asn mutation in Ras (Fig.1 A). This Ras mutant has a low affinity for both GTP and GDP and associates tightly with Ras-specific exchange factors. When expressed in cells, Ras(S17N) acts as a dominant-negative mutant that prevents the activation of endogenous Ras (25Quilliam L.A. Kato K. Rabun K.M. Hisaka M.M. Huff S.Y. Campbell-Burk S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We mutated the Ser36 of p190 to Asn to produce p190(S36N) (Fig. 1 A). Neither this mutant nor wild type p190 bound nucleotide when expressed in bacteria. Therefore, to establish whether p190(S36N) could stably bind GTP, COS cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant plasmids and were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The HA-tagged p190 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody (12CA5) directed against the HA epitope. Bound nucleotide was eluted from the immunoprecipitated proteins and detected by thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HA-p190 expressed in COS cells was specifically associated with both GDP and GTP. After correction for nonspecific binding, the fractional association with GTP of p190 appears to be about 12%. In accordance with prediction, the p190(S36N) mutant did not specifically bind any guanine nucleotide, although it was expressed at a level similar to that of the wild type protein. The p190 protein, when expressed in SF9 insect cells, can also bind GTP (10Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the remote possibility remained that the wild type p190 was associated through its C-terminal GAP domain with a GTPase that was complexed with 32P-labeled guanine nucleotides. To eliminate this possibility, we expressed the isolated, HA-tagged N-terminal GBDs (residues 1–266) of wild type and S36N p190 in COS cells. As can be seen from Fig. 1 B, the wild type GBD was bound to both GTP and GDP in a ratio similar to that of the full-length HA-p190. The isolated GBD containing the S36N mutation did not detectably bind nucleotide. These results strongly support the conclusion that, when expressed in mammalian cells, the N-terminal GBD of p190 binds to both GDP and GTP and that the S36N mutant, like the analogous S17N mutant of Ras, possesses a greatly reduced affinity for guanine nucleotides. To determine the effect of the S36N mutation on p190 function, both wild type and S36N p190 were expressed by transient transfection as HA-tagged proteins in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The cells were fixed and stained for HA. Overexpression of wild type HA-p190 produced a distinct phenotype in which the cells rounded up and extended very long, beaded, dendritic-like processes, as observed by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2). This phenotype is similar to that seen when either C3 botulinum toxin or RhoGDI is microinjected into Swiss 3T3 cells (26Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Miura Y. Kikuchi A. Musha T. Kuroda S. Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 510-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar phenotype was produced when HA-p190 was expressed in COS and BHK cells (data not shown). Fig. 2shows representative cells that had been transfected with p190, p190(S36N), or with a GAP-defective mutant, p190(R1283A) (23Li R. Zhang B.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and stained with an anti-HA antibody. Remarkably, only those cells transfected with wild type p190 exhibited the beaded extension phenotype. Cells transfected with either the S36N or R1283A mutant looked normal, even though expression levels of the mutants and wild type p190 were similar, as determined from the fluorescence intensities. To investigate how the p190 overexpression phenotype was produced, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with a vector that encodes a GFP-p190 fusion protein and monitored by time lapse imaging, beginning 36 h post-transfection. Fig.3 shows typical transfected cells undergoing retraction of the cell body accompanied by the extension of long, dendritic processes. Cells were monitored for 7 h during which time they continued to extend processes and move around the surface of the plate. These data indicate first that GFP-p190 induces the same phenotype as does the ectopic expression of HA-p190 and second that the phenotype is produced not simply by retraction but also by the active elongation of dendrite-like processes. To confirm that the lack of effect of p190(S36N) on cell morphology was not a result of expression differences, we transfected both COS and NIH 3T3 cells with a range of plasmid doses. In these experiments 5, 10, or 25 μg of pRK7, pKH3-p190, or pKH3-p190(S36N) were transiently transfected into cells along with a plasmid containing the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) that was used as a marker for transfected cells. Cells were allowed to grow for 2 days, at which time green fluorescent cells were counted and scored for morphology. A fraction of the cells was harvested for immunoblot detection of p190 proteins. Fig.4 shows a positive correlation between amount of p190 plasmid introduced into the cells, expression of p190, and incidence of the beaded extension phenotype. However, even when 5 times more p190(S36N) plasmid than p190 plasmid was transfected into the cells, there was no evidence of significant morphological changes induced by HA-p190(S36N). These results confirm that p190(S36N) is nonfunctional when expressed in either NIH 3T3 or COS cells. The similarity between the beaded extension phenotype induced by the overexpression of p190 in NIH 3T3 cells, and that induced by botulinum C3 toxin or RhoGDI (26Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Miura Y. Kikuchi A. Musha T. Kuroda S. Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 510-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), argues that this phenotype is a consequence of the p190 RhoGAP activity, which depletes the cell of Rho:GTP (and/or Rac:GTP). To test this hypothesis, we used three independent approaches. First, we ascertained that the GBD domain was not sufficient for induction of the beaded extension phenotype. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the isolated HA-tagged GBD domain, residues 1–266, of wild type p190. Transfected cells were fixed and stained for HA. Immunofluorescence showed that cells expressing HA-GBD appeared normal. Therefore, the GBD of p190 is not responsible for the induction of the beaded extension phenotype. In the second approach, we created a GAP-defective p190. The GAPs of many small GTPases contain a conserved Arg residue that is essential for catalyzing nucleotide hydrolysis (22Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This residue is located at position 1283 in p190 (Fig. 1 A). While our study was in progress, the mutation of Arg1283 to Lys in p190 was found to destroy its RhoGAP activity (23Li R. Zhang B.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We created in p190 a point mutation in this Arg residue, to produce HA-p190(R1283A). To test the GAP activity of the mutant, it was expressed in COS cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and incubated with recombinant RhoA complexed to [γ-32P]GTP. As shown in Fig. 5, Rho-directed GAP activity of p190 was easily detectable, but the R1283A mutant did not catalyze GTP hydrolysis on RhoA, even though it was present in the immunoprecipitates at much higher levels than the wild type and S36N mutant p190 proteins. The 1283 mutant was then transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, which were fixed and stained with anti-HA antibody. As can be seen from Fig. 2, although p190(R1283A) was expressed at a level comparable with that of wild type p190, it did not induce the formation of beaded extensions. This result supports the hypothesis that the GAP activity of p190 is required for the induction of morphological changes in NIH 3T3 cells. As a third, independent approach, we asked whether the co-expression of Rho or Rac could reverse the phenotype induced by p190. We reasoned that a gain-of-function Rho m"

In this study, the role of arrestin-3 in receptor internalization was investigated by constructing different arrestin-3 minigenes that could potentially act as dominant negative inhibitors of arrestin function. Expression of arrestin-3 proteins containing amino acids 1–320 or 201–409 resulted in the inhibition of β2-adrenergic receptor internalization in HEK-293 cells by approximately 40%. Both of these arrestins were diffusely localized within the cytoplasm of transfected cells, were unable to mediate redistribution of receptors to clathrin-coated pits, and did not localize to coated pits in either the presence or absence of receptor and agonist. Arrestin-3(1–320), but not arrestin-3(201–409), bound to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin with an affinity comparable with that of wild-type arrestin-3. In contrast, expression of arrestin-3 proteins composed of only the clathrin binding domain, arrestin-3(284–409), and arrestin-3(290–409) resulted in the constitutive localization of these arrestins to coated pits. Arrestin-3(284–409) and arrestin-3(290–409) acted as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type arrestin function, inhibiting receptor internalization by 70 and 30%, respectively. Carboxyl-terminal deletions of arrestin-3 retained the ability to promote internalization until residues amino-terminal to amino acid 350 were deleted, suggesting that residues in this region also compose part of the clathrin binding domain in addition to the major binding site between residues 371–379. These studies characterize at least two distinct mechanisms, competition for either receptor or clathrin binding, by which dominant negative arrestins inhibit receptor internalization and further define residues within arrestin-3 that constitute the clathrin binding domain.

Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 193-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Initial binding of arrestin-1 to phosphorylated metarhodopsin II occurs through the activation- and phosphorylation-recognition domains. These domains are located within the amino-terminal half of arrestins and include a conserved arginine residue (Arg-175 in arrestin-1) within the phosphorylation recognition domain (6Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This residue, upon interaction with receptor, is thought to act as a molecular switch that promotes a conformational change in arrestin. This conformational change is proposed to disrupt the intramolecular interaction of the basic amino terminus and acidic carboxyl terminus (20Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) has substantially confirmed the structural and functional organization of arrestin derived from biochemical and mutagenesis studies. In contrast to arrestin-1, the nonvisual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, contain a region within the carboxyl terminus that mediates binding to clathrin and subsequent internalization of receptors through the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway (14Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The ability to specifically interrupt arrestin-mediated internalization of GPCRs is a potentially powerful means by which to probe both receptor trafficking and the mechanism of action of arrestins. Dominant negative mutants of arrestin-2 have been described that appear to function by competing with endogenous arrestins for binding to clathrin. A Val-to-Asp mutation (V53D) in arrestin-2 has been shown to exhibit increased affinity for clathrin and decreased affinity for receptor (7Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E.I. Colapietro A-M. Barak L.S.

Also, overexpression of a peptide comprising the arrestin-2 clathrin binding domain has been shown to inhibit internalization of both β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) and lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptors in a dominant negative manner (24Krupnick J.G.

A dominant negative mutant of dynamin that lacks GTP binding (K44A) (26Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) has also proven useful in assessing the role of endocytosis in various receptor-mediated events but may not be specific for the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway (27Henley J.R. Krueger E.W.A. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further analyzed the role of arrestin-3 in receptor trafficking by designing a panel of arrestin-3 minigenes. We assessed the effect of these constructs on β2AR internalization in both COS-1 and HEK-293 cells. These studies resulted in the characterization of several novel dominant negative arrestin-3 proteins that inhibit arrestin function at either the level of receptor or clathrin. Moreover, we identify additional residues that comprise the clathrin binding domain. The availability of arrestin-3 mutants that can interfere with arrestin function at separate steps in the endocytic pathway should prove useful in elucidating the role of arrestins in the trafficking of GPCRs mediated by different endocytic pathways and their role in GPCR-mediated signaling. pcDNA3-Flag-β2AR, wild-type arrestin-3 and dynamin K44A plasmids were previously described (14Krupnick J.G.

A 5′ top-strand primer was designed to include a GC “clamp,” aHindIII site and a consensus Kozak sequence (CCATGG) followed by 4–5 codons encoding the amino terminus of arrestin-3. The 3′ bottom strand primer was composed of a GC clamp, an XbaI site and a stop codon (TGA) followed by the codons for the last 4–5 amino acids of the construct. These primers were used in a PCR reaction with wild-type pcDNA3-arrestin-3 as template using standard PCR conditions (94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C). The resulting fragments were digested with HindIII andXbaI and ligated to pcDNA3 cut with the same enzymes. For the carboxyl-terminal arrestin-3 constructs 201–409, 284–409, 290–409, 297–409, 309–409, and 320–409, the same design was used with the exception that the 5′ top-strand primer encoded glycine (GCA) after the initial methionine, and the 3′ bottom-strand primer contained either a BglII or BamHI site. The resulting PCR products were digested with HindIII and eitherBglII or BamHI and ligated into pcDNA3 cut with HindIII and BamHI. All constructs were sequenced by dideoxy dye termination. COS-1 and HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Before transfection, cells were grown to 70–90% confluency. Cells were transfected for 5–7 h in either 60- or 100-mm dishes (Falcon) and 10- or 30-μl Fugene-6 (Boehringer Mannheim), respectively, according to the manufacturers' protocol. For ligand binding assays to assess receptor internalization, cells were split 1:2 5 h after transfection and assayed at 24 h post-transfection. For internalization assays performed by ELISA, cells from one 60-mm dish were split into 6 wells of a 24-well plate that had been coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly(l-lysine) (Sigma) and assayed 24 h posttransfection. Internalization of β2AR was assessed by either ligand binding using [3H]CGP-12177 or by ELISA. Ligand binding was performed essentially as described (15Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), with the exception that cells were treated with isoproterenol while still adherent. Cells were then trypsinized in the presence of isoproterenol (for COS-1 cells) or dislodged (for HEK-293), washed twice with a total of 90 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and assayed in 0.25-ml reactions in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 nm[3H]CGP-12177 for 3 h at 14 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μm alprenolol. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/C membranes using a Brandel cell harvester. The ELISA assay was performed essentially as described by Daunt et al. (29Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were split into 24-well dishes as described above and were treated with 0.3 mmascorbate with or without 10 μm isoproterenol, then fixed for 5 min with 3.7% formaldehyde. The primary anti-Flag antibody M1 (Sigma) and the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad), were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Visualization of antibody binding was performed using an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Plates were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader driven by Microplate Manager software (Bio-Rad). To assess arrestin expression, cells were pelleted, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose. To detect amino-terminal arrestin constructs, blots were probed with F4C1 (1:1000 dilution), a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against a conserved epitope in the amino terminus of all arrestins, DGVVLVD (30Dua H.S. Lee R.H. Lolley R.N. Barrett J.A. Abrams M. Forrester J.V. Donoso L.A. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To detect expression of carboxyl-terminal constructs, blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing residues 350–409 of arrestin-3 (1:2000 dilution). Protein was visualized using the appropriate species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies raised in goat (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 followed by development by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Supersignal (Pierce)). COS-1 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected as described above with 3 μg Flag-β2AR and 1 μg of the indicated arrestin-3 construct or 1 μg of the indicated arrestin-3 construct alone. After transfection, cells were split and allowed to adhere on glass coverslips grown in 24-well dishes. To visualize cell surface receptors, cells were incubated with M1 antibody diluted 1:500 for 1 h at 4 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 10 min, washed, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and incubated with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution). To visualize arrestins, cells were fixed, permeabilized and processed as described above after agonist treatment. The primary antibodies used to detect arrestins were either F4C1 (1:500 dilution) or the arrestin-3-specific polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:200 dilution). Clathrin-coated vesicles were visualized using a mouse monoclonal antibody (AP-6) raised against the clathrin adaptor protein, AP-2 (American Type Culture Collection). Arrestin-3 proteins were visualized with either goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse rhodamine- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:200; AP-2 was visualized with a goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antibody diluted 1:100 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted using Slow-Fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and examined by microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope using a Plan Fluor 40× objective. Cells expressing the lowest levels of transfected proteins, but clearly above those of nonexpressing cells, were chosen for view. Images were collected using QED camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop v. 3.0. Arrestin-3 constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, arrestin-3 minigenes cloned into pcDNA3 were added to a reaction mix containing TnT buffer, 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 mm amino acid mixture (−Leu), 1 μl RNasin, 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and 5 μl of [3H]leucine (179 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C, and incorporated radioactivity was calculated by counting 1 μl of total reaction and spotting 1 μl onto Whatman 3MM paper followed by successive incubation for 10 min in cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 10 min in boiling 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and 2 min in 100% ethanol. Precipitated radioactivity was solubilized in 1% SDS, 50 mm NaOH, scintillant was added, and the filters were counted in a scintillation counter. Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes were prepared, phosphorylated with rhodopsin kinase to a stochiometry of 1 mol/mol and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal as described (20Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess receptor binding, 2 nm translated arrestins were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C under constant illumination with 200 nmphosphorylated rhodopsin in a total volume of 50 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm magnesium chloride, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 1.5 mmdithiothreitol. Samples were quenched on ice, and receptor-bound arrestins were separated by Sepharose-2B column chromatography as described previously (22Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis of arrestin-1, coupled with the recent solution of its crystal structure, has revealed several distinct domains involved in arrestin function (20Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the functional organization of the nonvisual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. We have previously mapped the clathrin binding domain of arrestin-3 (14Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and have shown that expression of the corresponding domain of arrestin-2 dominantly inhibited wild-type arrestin function (24Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that expression of the arrestin-3 clathrin binding domain, which has been shown to have a higher affinity for clathrin (12Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar), may act as a more potent inhibitor of arrestin function. Similarly, we wanted to determine whether expression of the receptor binding domain of arrestin-3 would also inhibit receptor internalization. To test these ideas, we constructed a panel of arrestin-3 minigenes containing either putative receptor or clathrin binding domains. These constructs, shown schematically in Fig.1, were designed partially on the basis of homology of arrestin-3 domains to those in arrestin-1 (19Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Initially, we tested the ability of each of the constructs to be expressed in COS-1 cells to determine which were most suitable for further study. As shown in Fig.2 A, all of the arrestin-3 amino-terminal minigenes were detectably expressed in COS-1 cells. Compared with wild-type arrestin-3, arrestin-3(1–184) was less efficiently expressed, and arrestin-3(1–340) consisted of 3–4 discrete bands, most likely as a result of proteolytic degradation. The carboxyl-terminal minigenes were also efficiently expressed, except for arrestin-3(320–409), which was detected only after overexposure of the immunoblot (data not shown). Arrestin-3(297–409) migrated anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, appearing to migrate more slowly than its larger counterparts, arrestin-3(284–409) and (290–409). For these reasons, the 1–184, 1–340, 297–409, and 320–409 arrestin-3 constructs were not studied in detail. We next evaluated the function of each arrestin-3 protein by assessing its ability to promote the internalization of the β2AR in COS-1 cells. It has previously been shown that internalization of the β2AR in COS cells is inefficient but can be promoted to significant levels by overexpression of nonvisual arrestins (15Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 24Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two different assays were used to assess receptor internalization, an ELISA to measure the surface levels of the Flag-tagged β2AR and a ligand binding assay to measure the binding of the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP-12177, which should bind exclusively to cell surface receptors. The results of the ELISA assay are depicted in Fig.3 A. Of the amino-terminal minigenes, which contained progressive deletions of the carboxyl terminus, arrestin-3(1–320) and arrestin-3(1–340) were unable to promote β2AR internalization above basal levels. In contrast, the 1–350, 1–360, and 1–370 arrestin-3 proteins each promoted β2AR internalization to an extent comparable with that of wild-type arrestin-3. Because mutation or deletion of the major clathrin binding domain between residues 371–379 of arrestin-3 did not completely abolish clathrin binding or promotion of internalization (12Goodman Jr., O.B.

Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), this data suggests that additional clathrin binding determinants exist that lie between amino acids 340–370. Arrestin-3(1–393) lacks the acidic carboxyl terminus, which has been proposed to mediate an intramolecular interaction with the basic amino terminus to maintain arrestin-3 in an inactive conformation (21Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, perturbation of this interaction in arrestin-3 might result in a constitutively active arrestin. Indeed, arrestin-3(1–393) appears to more effectively promote high affinity agonist binding to the β2AR and M2 muscarinic receptor compared with wild-type arrestin-3 (33Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.L. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, arrestin-3(1–393) promoted receptor internalization as efficiently as wild-type arrestin-3, but receptor internalization remained dependent upon the presence of agonist. In the absence of agonist, the number of surface receptors present in cells cotransfected with arrestin-3(1–393) was similar to that present in cells cotransfected with wild-type arrestin-3 (data not shown). Progressive deletion of the amino terminus of arrestin-3, in which both receptor binding and phosphorylation recognition domains were deleted, resulted in the proteins arrestin-3(201–409), arrestin-3(284–409), arrestin-3(290–409), arrestin-3(297–409), and arrestin-3(309–409). These arrestins were unable to promote internalization of the β2AR (Fig. 3 A). To verify that β2AR internalization was accurately measured by the"

The trimeric complex is believed to recruit additional regulatory proteins to the HTLV-I long terminal repeat, but there has been no direct evidence that CBP is required for Tax-mediated transactivation. We present evidence that Tax and CBP activate transcription from the HTLV-I 21 base pair repeats on naked DNA templates. Transcriptional activation of the HTLV-I sequences required both Tax and CBP and could be mediated by either the N-terminal activation domain of CBP or the full-length protein. Fluorescence polarization binding assays indicated that CBP does not markedly enhance the affinity of Tax for the trimeric complex. Transcription analyses suggest that CBP activates Tax-dependent transcription by promoting transcriptional initiation and reinitiation. The ability of CBP to activate the HTLV-I promoter does not involve the stabilization of Tax binding, but rather depends upon gene activation properties of the co-activator that function in the context of a naked DNA template.

It has been proposed that the cooperative binding of CREB and Tax to the promoter positions the latter protein to interact with basal transcription factors. In support of this model, Tax has been shown to interact with the basal transcription factors TFIIA and TFIID (22Clemens K.E. Piras G. Radonovich M.F. Choi K.S. Duvall J.F. DeJong J. Roeder R.

The role of CREB in this model is to allow the binding of Tax to DNA rather than to provide a direct transcriptional activation function because nonphosphorylated (inactive) CREB can substitute for the phosphorylated (active) form of the transcription factor. In contrast, the activation of cellular promoters is believed to require phosphorylated CREB, and CREB mutants that cannot be phosphorylated function as dominant negatives.Recent studies have suggested that the transcriptional co-activator CBP also contributes to Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR (25Kwok R.P.

Subsequently, CBP was shown to interact with Tax, leading to the hypothesis that Tax, CREB, and CBP form a trimeric complex on the CRE-like sequences in the HTLV-I LTR (25Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E.

Presumably, CBP is recruited through Tax and not through the activation domain of CREB.The presence of CBP in the HTLV-I transcription complex provides several additional possible mechanisms for gene activation. CBP has been reported to interact with the basal transcription factors TFIIB and TBP (32Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Bisotto S. Minorgan S. Rehfuss R.P. J. Biol.

Moreover, the N-terminal half of CBP, which contains the TBP binding site, has been shown to be important for CBP-mediated transcription (32Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CBP interacts with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (holo pol II) (35Kee B.L. Arias J. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and several histone acetyltransferases, in addition to containing an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase domain (36Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). The fact that mutations in the acetyltransferase domain block transcriptional activation in vivo suggests that this enzymatic activity is important for CBP function on some promoters (38Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Given the atypical mode of CBP recruitment utilized by the HTLV-I LTR, it is unknown which, if any, of these functions contribute to HTLV-I gene activation. It is possible, for example, that CBP could serve to stabilize Tax binding to the HTLV-I promoter and that the transcriptional activation properties of Tax, rather than CBP, are responsible for gene induction. Given the importance of CBP in CREB, NF-κB, AP1, Stat-1/-2, c-Fos, MyoD, MAPK, and nuclear hormone receptor signaling, elucidating the mechanism of action of this coactivator has important implications for gene regulation (29Kwok R.P.

We found that CBP activates both transcriptional initiation and reinitiation. This ability of CBP to activate transcription does not occur simply through the stabilization of Tax binding, but rather through activation properties of CBP itself. These studies also demonstrate that the ability of CBP to activate transcription does not depend entirely on its intrinsic or associated histone acetyltransferase functions.DISCUSSIONThe Tax protein of HTLV-I utilizes a novel mechanism for activating gene expression, facilitating the formation of a multimeric CBP·Tax·CREB complex on the Tax-responsive DNA element. Tax facilitates the binding of the cellular transcription factor CREB to the atypical CRE-like sequences within the viral LTR. Recent data indicate Tax and CREB both contact DNA, Tax interacting with GC sequences in the minor groove, and CREB associating with the CRE-like sequences in the major groove (13Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Lenzmeier B.A. Gieber H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this configuration, only the B/ZIP domain of CREB is required for formation of the ternary Tax·CREB·DNA complex. Consequently, nonphosphorylated CREB, as well as the negative modulator CREMα, are competent to mediate Tax binding. This model differs significantly from an earlier one which suggested that Tax functioned primarily by promoting CREB dimerization (15Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The exact role of CBP in the process of Tax-mediated gene activation has been puzzling. Despite the fact that CBP was originally identified through its ability to interact specifically with phosphorylated CREB, the CREB activation domain appears to be dispensable for Tax-mediated induction of the HTLV-I LTR. The synergistic interaction of Tax and CREB is believed to recruit the co-activator CBP in a manner that does not require CREB phosphorylation probably because, in this context, CBP interacts with Tax rather than CREB. The mechanism of gene activation could depend upon Tax, which has been shown to interact with TFIIA and TFIID (22Clemens K.E. Piras G. Radonovich M.F. Choi K.S. Duvall J.F. DeJong J. Roeder R.

Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35Kee B.L. Arias J. Montminy M.R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), or both.Our anisotropy studies show that CBP-(1–682) probably does not function simply by stabilizing Tax binding to the TRE sequences. Rather, a more direct role of CBP in gene activation is likely. While the histone acetyltransferase function of CBP and associated proteins could participate in the activation of the HTLV-I LTR in vivo, our studies show that CBP can also strongly activate transcription in the absence of chromatin. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that the N-terminal activation domain of CBP, in the presence of Tax, stimulates transcription of a Tax-responsive transcriptional template. Deletion of the TBP binding domain (32Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) abolishes the activity of CBP-(1–682) in vitro, suggesting that transcriptional activation is due, in part, to interaction with the basal transcription factors.Our results do not imply that CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity is not important for the transcription of some genes (36Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). For example, steroid receptor induction of gene transcription has been proposed to involve two independent functions of coactivators, chromatin remodeling and enhanced stabilization of the preinitiation complex (67Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 7879-7884Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Moreover, Kraus and Kadonaga (68Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) have reported that the CBP homologue p300 mediates estrogen receptor-activated gene inductionin vitro only in the context of a chromatin template. Acetylated histones are a characteristic feature of transcriptionally active chromatin. Because CBP acetylates histones (HAT activity), it is likely that the coactivator increases transcription of some genes through remodeling of chromatin structure. In addition, the acetyltransferase domain may contribute to transcriptional activation through other mechanisms. For example, Gu and Roeder (69Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that CBP increases p53 DNA binding through acetylation of the p53 C-terminal regulatory domain. In addition, Imhof et al.(70) recently demonstrated that p300 acetylates TFIIE p56 and TFIIF (FAT activity). The effect of acetylation on the function of these basal transcription factors remains to be determined.Our data further suggest that Tax and CBP-(1–682) facilitate both transcriptional initiation and reinitiation. The CREB-Tax-CBP complex may facilitate the recruitment of basal transcription factors into the initiation complex and, subsequently, stabilize the promoter complex from dissociation, thereby facilitating entry of pol II into the reinitiation complex. Zawel et al. (71Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have analyzed the recycling of general transcription factors during RNA polymerase II transcription. All of the basal factors are found in the mature initiation complex, but following nucleotide addition, the complex becomes disrupted. TFIID remains bound to the promoter, and following release, TFIIB reassociates with TFIID (DB complex), forming the RNA pol II docking site for reinitiation. In agreement with Giebleret al. (26Geibler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we have found that the CREB·Tax·CBP-(1–682) initiation complex is quite stable, remaining associated with the transcription template for 2 h (data not shown). It will be of interest to analyze the DB complex dissociation and reassociation kinetics in the presence of Tax and CBP. Finally, it will be of interest to analyze the contribution of transcriptional reinitiation in the CBP/p300-dependent NF-κB, AP1, MAPK, PKA, and nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways.

It has been proposed that the cooperative binding of CREB and Tax to the promoter positions the latter protein to interact with basal transcription factors. In support of this model, Tax has been shown to interact with the basal transcription factors TFIIA and TFIID (22Clemens K.E. Piras G. Radonovich M.F. Choi K.S. Duvall J.F. DeJong J. Roeder R.

The role of CREB in this model is to allow the binding of Tax to DNA rather than to provide a direct transcriptional activation function because nonphosphorylated (inactive) CREB can substitute for the phosphorylated (active) form of the transcription factor. In contrast, the activation of cellular promoters is believed to require phosphorylated CREB, and CREB mutants that cannot be phosphorylated function as dominant negatives. Recent studies have suggested that the transcriptional co-activator CBP also contributes to Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR (25Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H.

Subsequently, CBP was shown to interact with Tax, leading to the hypothesis that Tax, CREB, and CBP form a trimeric complex on the CRE-like sequences in the HTLV-I LTR (25Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E.

Presumably, CBP is recruited through Tax and not through the activation domain of CREB. The presence of CBP in the HTLV-I transcription complex provides several additional possible mechanisms for gene activation. CBP has been reported to interact with the basal transcription factors TFIIB and TBP (32Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Bisotto S. Minorgan S. Rehfuss R.P. J. Biol.

Moreover, the N-terminal half of CBP, which contains the TBP binding site, has been shown to be important for CBP-mediated transcription (32Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CBP interacts with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (holo pol II) (35Kee B.L. Arias J. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2373-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and several histone acetyltransferases, in addition to containing an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase domain (36Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). The fact that mutations in the acetyltransferase domain block transcriptional activation in vivo suggests that this enzymatic activity is important for CBP function on some promoters (38Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Given the atypical mode of CBP recruitment utilized by the HTLV-I LTR, it is unknown which, if any, of these functions contribute to HTLV-I gene activation. It is possible, for example, that CBP could serve to stabilize Tax binding to the HTLV-I promoter and that the transcriptional activation properties of Tax, rather than CBP, are responsible for gene induction. Given the importance of CBP in CREB, NF-κB, AP1, Stat-1/-2, c-Fos, MyoD, MAPK, and nuclear hormone receptor signaling, elucidating the mechanism of action of this coactivator has important implications for gene regulation (29Kwok R.P.

In this report, we utilized in vitro transcription assays to determine the requirement for CBP in Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR. We found that CBP activates both transcriptional initiation and reinitiation. This ability of CBP to activate transcription does not occur simply through the stabilization of Tax binding, but rather through activation properties of CBP itself. These studies also demonstrate that the ability of CBP to activate transcription does not depend entirely on its intrinsic or associated histone acetyltransferase functions. DISCUSSIONThe Tax protein of HTLV-I utilizes a novel mechanism for activating gene expression, facilitating the formation of a multimeric CBP·Tax·CREB complex on the Tax-responsive DNA element. Tax facilitates the binding of the cellular transcription factor CREB to the atypical CRE-like sequences within the viral LTR. Recent data indicate Tax and CREB both contact DNA, Tax interacting with GC sequences in the minor groove, and CREB associating with the CRE-like sequences in the major groove (13Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Lenzmeier B.A. Gieber H.A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 721-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this configuration, only the B/ZIP domain of CREB is required for formation of the ternary Tax·CREB·DNA complex. Consequently, nonphosphorylated CREB, as well as the negative modulator CREMα, are competent to mediate Tax binding. This model differs significantly from an earlier one which suggested that Tax functioned primarily by promoting CREB dimerization (15Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The exact role of CBP in the process of Tax-mediated gene activation has been puzzling. Despite the fact that CBP was originally identified through its ability to interact specifically with phosphorylated CREB, the CREB activation domain appears to be dispensable for Tax-mediated induction of the HTLV-I LTR. The synergistic interaction of Tax and CREB is believed to recruit the co-activator CBP in a manner that does not require CREB phosphorylation probably because, in this context, CBP interacts with Tax rather than CREB. The mechanism of gene activation could depend upon Tax, which has been shown to interact with TFIIA and TFIID (22Clemens K.E. Piras G. Radonovich M.F. Choi K.S. Duvall J.F. DeJong J. Roeder R.

Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), or both.Our anisotropy studies show that CBP-(1–682) probably does not function simply by stabilizing Tax binding to the TRE sequences. Rather, a more direct role of CBP in gene activation is likely. While the histone acetyltransferase function of CBP and associated proteins could participate in the activation of the HTLV-I LTR in vivo, our studies show that CBP can also strongly activate transcription in the absence of chromatin. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that the N-terminal activation domain of CBP, in the presence of Tax, stimulates transcription of a Tax-responsive transcriptional template. Deletion of the TBP binding domain (32Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) abolishes the activity of CBP-(1–682) in vitro, suggesting that transcriptional activation is due, in part, to interaction with the basal transcription factors.Our results do not imply that CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity is not important for the transcription of some genes (36Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). For example, steroid receptor induction of gene transcription has been proposed to involve two independent functions of coactivators, chromatin remodeling and enhanced stabilization of the preinitiation complex (67Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 7879-7884Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Moreover, Kraus and Kadonaga (68Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) have reported that the CBP homologue p300 mediates estrogen receptor-activated gene inductionin vitro only in the context of a chromatin template. Acetylated histones are a characteristic feature of transcriptionally active chromatin. Because CBP acetylates histones (HAT activity), it is likely that the coactivator increases transcription of some genes through remodeling of chromatin structure. In addition, the acetyltransferase domain may contribute to transcriptional activation through other mechanisms. For example, Gu and Roeder (69Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that CBP increases p53 DNA binding through acetylation of the p53 C-terminal regulatory domain. In addition, Imhof et al.(70) recently demonstrated that p300 acetylates TFIIE p56 and TFIIF (FAT activity). The effect of acetylation on the function of these basal transcription factors remains to be determined.Our data further suggest that Tax and CBP-(1–682) facilitate both transcriptional initiation and reinitiation. The CREB-Tax-CBP complex may facilitate the recruitment of basal transcription factors into the initiation complex and, subsequently, stabilize the promoter complex from dissociation, thereby facilitating entry of pol II into the reinitiation complex. Zawel et al. (71Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have analyzed the recycling of general transcription factors during RNA polymerase II transcription. All of the basal factors are found in the mature initiation complex, but following nucleotide addition, the complex becomes disrupted. TFIID remains bound to the promoter, and following release, TFIIB reassociates with TFIID (DB complex), forming the RNA pol II docking site for reinitiation. In agreement with Giebleret al. (26Geibler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we have found that the CREB·Tax·CBP-(1–682) initiation complex is quite stable, remaining associated with the transcription template for 2 h (data not shown). It will be of interest to analyze the DB complex dissociation and reassociation kinetics in the presence of Tax and CBP. Finally, it will be of interest to analyze the contribution of transcriptional reinitiation in the CBP/p300-dependent NF-κB, AP1, MAPK, PKA, and nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways. The Tax protein of HTLV-I utilizes a novel mechanism for activating gene expression, facilitating the formation of a multimeric CBP·Tax·CREB complex on the Tax-responsive DNA element.

Because CBP acetylates histones (HAT activity), it is likely that the coactivator increases transcription of some genes through remodeling of chromatin structure. In addition, the acetyltransferase domain may contribute to transcriptional activation through other mechanisms. For example, Gu and Roeder (69Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that CBP increases p53 DNA binding through acetylation of the p53 C-terminal regulatory domain. In addition, Imhof et al.(70) recently demonstrated that p300 acetylates TFIIE p56 and TFIIF (FAT activity). The effect of acetylation on the function of these basal transcription factors remains to be determined. Our data further suggest that Tax and CBP-(1–682) facilitate both transcriptional initiation and reinitiation. The CREB-Tax-CBP complex may facilitate the recruitment of basal transcription factors into the initiation complex and, subsequently, stabilize the promoter complex from dissociation, thereby facilitating entry of pol II into the reinitiation complex. Zawel et al. (71Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have analyzed the recycling of general transcription factors during RNA polymerase II transcription. All of the basal factors are found in the mature initiation complex, but following nucleotide addition, the complex becomes disrupted. TFIID remains bound to the promoter, and following release, TFIIB reassociates with TFIID (DB complex), forming the RNA pol II docking site for reinitiation. In agreement with Giebleret al. (26Geibler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we have found that the CREB·Tax·CBP-(1–682) initiation complex is quite stable, remaining associated with the transcription template for 2 h (data not shown). It will be of interest to analyze the DB complex dissociation and reassociation kinetics in the presence of Tax and CBP. Finally, it will be of interest to analyze the contribution of transcriptional reinitiation in the CBP/p300-dependent NF-κB, AP1, MAPK, PKA, and nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways.

Here, we show that the stimulatory effects of target tissues are mediated by an isoform of TGFbeta. Exposure of cultured CG neurons to TGFbeta1, but not TGFbeta2 or TGFbeta3, caused robust stimulation of KCa. The KCa stimulatory effects of target tissue extracts were blocked by a neutralizing pan-TGFbeta antiserum but not by specific TGFbeta2 or TGFbeta3 antisera. Intraocular injection of TGFbeta1 caused robust stimulation of KCa, whereas intraocular injection of pan-TGFbeta antiserum inhibited expression of KCa in CG neurons developing in vivo. The effects of TGFbeta1 were potentiated by beta-neuregulin-1, a differentiation factor expressed in preganglionic neurons."

We find that in the absence of NT-3, sensory precursor cells fail to arrest the cell cycle, override the G1 phase restriction point, and die by apoptosis in S phase, which can be prevented in vivo by a cell cycle blocker. Uncoordinated cell cycle reentry is preceded by a failure of nuclear N-myc downregulation and is paralleled by the activation of the full repertoire of G1 and S phase cell cycle proteins required for cell cycle entry. Our results provide evidence for novel activity of neurotrophins in cell cycle control and point toward an N-myc sensitization to cell death in the nervous system that is under the control of NT-3."

Paclitaxel (taxol) shares many properties of lipopolysaccharide.

Additional anticancer drugs, vinblastine and vincristine, also induced MnSOD gene expression. We have shown previously (Das, K. C., and White, C. W. (1997)J. Biol. Chem.272, 14914–14920) that these drugs can activate protein kinase C (PKC). The PKC agonists thymeleatoxin (0.5 μm) and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate (dPPA; 10 nm) potently induced MnSOD gene expression. Calphostin C and GF109203X, both specific inhibitors of PKC, each inhibited MnSOD gene expression by anticancer agents. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also inhibited induction of MnSOD by anticancer drugs, indicating an important role of PKC in MnSOD signaling by these agents.

Coggon P. McPhail A.T. J. Am. Chem. Sci. 1971; 93: 2325-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). These effects relate to the ability of taxol to bind tubulin, promote microtubule assembly, and stabilize microtubules by bundle formation (2Kumar N. J. Biol.

In addition, taxol exhibits cell cycle-independent, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1-like effects, including macrophage activation (5Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. Science. 1990; 248: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors (5Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 2459-2465PubMed Google Scholar). Taxol also can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein kinases (6Manthey C.L. Branses M.B. Perra P.Y. Vogel S.N. J.

Biophys. 1987; 254: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), MnSOD is induced by oxidative stress. In addition, cytokines, such as TNF or interleukin 1 (IL-1), as well as LPS, can induce MnSOD gene expression (15Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 16Masuda A. Longo D.L. Kobayashi Y. Appelia E. Oppenheim J.J.

Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Because LPS can induce MnSOD gene expression (17Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether taxol shares this property of LPS in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. Because TNF and IL-1 are both potent activators of MnSOD gene expression, taxol also could induce secretion of TNF or IL-1, which could, in turn, activate MnSOD gene expression. Such effects also could result from the actions of taxol on the cytoskeleton. To evaluate these possibilities, we assessed the effect of an additional class of antitumor drugs, vinca alkaloids, which do not induce TNF or IL-1 secretion. The mechanism of action of vinca alkaloids relates to their inhibition of microtubule formation in the mitotic spindle, resulting in an arrest of the cell division at metaphase (19Watanabe K. West W.L. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 2292-2299PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mode of action, structure, and function of taxol is different than that of vinca alkaloids, although they do share the property of exerting their action on the microtubule system of the cells. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase that is important in signal transduction pathways regulating cell growth (20Martelly I. Castagna M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In humans, the PKC superfamily consists of at least 11 isoenzymes, which differ in intracellular location, tissue distribution, and activating cofactors (21Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 22Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Members of the “classical” group of isoenzymes (cPKCα, cPKCβI, cPKCβII, and cPKCγ) contain conserved amino acid sequences within their regulatory domains, which confer responsiveness to calcium, diacylglycerols, and phorbol esters. In contrast, “novel” group members (nPKCδ, nPKCε, nPKCη, nPKCθ, and nPKCμ) are structurally similar to the cPKCs but lack the functional groups that appear to mediate Ca2+ binding. The least understood are the atypical PKCs ζ and ι. These isotypes differ significantly in structure from the other two classes (21Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 22Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these isoenzymes have been reported not to respond to phorbol esters in vivo or in vitro. Protein kinase activators such as the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate) can induce MnSOD gene expression in a variety of cell lines (23Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23142-23146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whitsett J.A. Clark J.C. Wispé J.R. Pryhuber G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L688-L693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect occurs at the level of transcription (24Whitsett J.A. Clark J.C. Wispé J.R. Pryhuber G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L688-L693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMA activates PKC nonspecifically, including multiple classical PKCs, as well as nPKCδ and nPKCε. Hence, the precise signaling mechanism by PKC isoenzymes in MnSOD gene expression by PMA is not known. We recently reported the activation of PKC in response to antitumor drugs in the pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line A549 (25Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified specific activation and membrane translocation of PKCδ in these cells in response to antitumor drugs. We also investigated the effect of specific inhibitors of protein kinase C, such as calphostin C and GF109203X, on MnSOD gene expression by these antitumor agents. Calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, which binds to its regulatory region (26Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar), and GF109203X, which specifically inhibits by binding to the catalytic region of PKC (27Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakanes M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both prevented the induction of MnSOD gene expression by antitumor drugs. The human MnSOD gene was obtained from ATCC in a PHMNSOD4 plasmid in Escherichia Coli HB101. Plasmids were amplified in E. Coli and were purified with a Qiagen plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The cDNAs were isolated from the vectors by treatment with EcoRI and gel-purified. cDNAs were labeled with a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated from cells by guanidine isothiocyanate lysis and cesium chloride centrifugation of the lysate (147,000 ×g, 20–25 °C) in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) by a modification of the methods of Maniatis et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically. Twenty micrograms of RNA was resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose, 2.5 mformaldehyde gel in buffer containing 20 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were prehybridized for 2–12 h in 50% formamide, 0.75 m sodium chloride, 0.075m sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. Blots were hybridized with cDNA for MnSOD labeled to a specific activity of 2–7 × 107 cpm using [γ-32P]CTP (ICN) in hybridization solution at 42 °C overnight, and then were washed in 0.3 m sodium chloride, 0.03 m sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. Autoradiographs were made by exposing blots to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Some of the blots were exposed to phosphor screens (Molecular Dynamics), and densitometry was performed on phosphor screens by Macintosh computer using Molecular Dynamics Image Quant version 3.3 software. Culture dishes (100 mm) of A549 cells were placed on ice, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped into homogenization buffer (1 ml; 20 mm HEPES, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized in a precooled Dounce homogenizer (B-type pestle). The lysate was centrifuged (3 min, 50 × g) to remove intact cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged again (1 h, 100,000 ×g). The resulting supernatant was designated cytosolic fraction and stored at −70 °C for further analysis. The membrane pellet was washed in homogenization buffer and then suspended in the same buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min with intermittent vortexing. The suspended pellet fraction also was centrifuged (30 min, 14,000 × g). The supernatant was stored at -70 °C as the membrane fraction. Protein was measured by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membrane proteins were fractionated in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose in a Mini Trans-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was air-dried and blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered (50 mm, pH 7.5) saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk or 5% bovine serum album and 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was immunoblotted with isoenzyme-specific, protein G-purified rabbit anti-PKCα (Life Technologies), βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, ι, μ, and θ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PKC isoenzyme-specific bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Confluent A549 cells were incubated with vinblastine (15 μm), vincristine (15 μm), or taxol (56 μm) for 30 min. After incubation, cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Cells were disrupted using a precooled Dounce homogenizer with a B-type pestle (15 strokes). An aliquot of homogenate was kept for later protein determination. The homogenate (0.5 ml) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to DE52 ion exchange columns. Columns were prepared by loading DE52 resin (Whatman; 0.125 g/ml in buffer A) into Polyprep columns (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Cytosolic PKC was eluted in 1 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 m NaCl). The post-100,000 × gpellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min. After incubation, the membrane fraction was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a DE52 column, and the membrane fraction of PKC was eluted as described for cytosolic fractions. PKC activity was determined using the PKC assay kit of Life Technologies based on the measurement of the phosphorylation of acetylated myelin basic protein as described by Yasuda et al. (30Yasuda I. Kishimoto A. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Sakurai A. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The DEAE eluate (25 μl) was assayed for PKC activity using 50 μm acetylated myelin basic protein as substrate. Activity of PKC was expressed as pmol/min/mg total protein. Statistical analysis was done in a microcomputer with JMP statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Means were compared by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test for multiple comparisons, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. To evaluate the effect of anticancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine on expression of MnSOD mRNA, we incubated confluent A549 cells with vinblastine (50 μm) or vincristine (50 μm) for various intervals (1–8 h). After exposure to either agent, steady state levels of MnSOD mRNA increased in a time-dependent manner. These increases began after 4 h and became significant after 4–8 h (Fig. 1 A). The level of B-actin mRNA remained unchanged for each of the compounds examined. Vinblastine was more potent in induction of MnSOD mRNA after 6 and 8 h relative to vincristine. To determine the effect of more prolonged incubation (6–24 h), A549 cells were incubated with less toxic, lesser concentrations of vinblastine (15 μm) or vincristine (15 μm). As shown (Fig. 1, B andC), MnSOD mRNA increased maximally after 6–12 h, declining thereafter. Throughout these time courses, cells remained viable as determined by exclusion of trypan blue. However, changes in cell shape (rounding up and lifting off plate surface) became apparent after 18 h as visualized by phase contrast microscopy. To evaluate the dose response of vinblastine and vincristine on steady state levels of MnSOD mRNA, A549 cells were incubated with various concentrations of each agent for 4 h. As demonstrated (Fig.2 A), cells treated with only 10 μm vinblastine demonstrated maximal elevation of MnSOD mRNA, whereas higher concentrations caused lesser elevation of MnSOD mRNA. By contrast, exposure to vincristine resulted in dose-dependent elevation of MnSOD mRNA at concentrations of 10–100 μm (Fig. 2 B). Exposure to taxol increased steady-state levels of MnSOD mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). During relatively brief incubation (6 h), taxol caused elevation of steady state levels of MnSOD mRNA in a dose-dependent manner up to 56 μm. Exposure to higher taxol concentrations (147 μm) caused little or no increase beyond that with 56 μm. During more prolonged incubation, taxol (56 μm) increased steady state levels of MnSOD mRNA within 4 h, with maximal elevation occurring after 12 h. After 18 h, mRNA levels began to decline, and significant cytotoxicity, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and phase contrast microscopy, was apparent. Expression of β-actin mRNA remained unchanged until after 18 h of incubation, when it began to decline. The transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (1 μg/ml, 1 h preincubation) prevented the increase in MnSOD gene expression induced by anticancer drugs (Fig.4 A). This finding suggests that induction of MnSOD gene expression by anticancer drugs is transcriptional rather than attributable to an increased stability of mRNA. By contrast, the translational inhibitor cycloheximide did not inhibit taxol-induced elevation of MnSOD mRNA, suggesting no requirement for new protein synthesis for the response (Fig.4 B). Rather, cycloheximide, by itself, caused induction of MnSOD in A549 cells. This induction has been described previously (17Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cycloheximide potentiated the increases in MnSOD mRNA caused by each anticancer drug. Based on these results, it does not appear that taxol-induced cytokine synthesis is involved in MnSOD expression caused by this agent. Protein kinase C-dependent signal transduction pathways can be activated by anticancer drugs. Previously, we reported increased PKC activity in A549 cells after exposure to anticancer agents (25Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of protein kinase C inhibitors on elevation of MnSOD gene expression by anticancer drugs. Calphostin C is a polycyclic hydrocarbon product of bacteria that binds to the regulatory domain of PKC causing its inactivation (26Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). This inhibition is highly specific for PKC. Incubation of A549 cells with calphostin C (1 h) before exposure to anticancer drugs inhibited elevation of MnSOD mRNA expression (Fig.5). To further verify the role of PKC, we incubated A549 cells with another inhibitor of PKC, the bisindoylmaleimide GF109203X, which binds to the catalytic region of the enzyme (27Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakanes M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5, GF109203X (25 μm) completely inhibited elevation of MnSOD mRNA. Thus, both of the PKC inhibitors prevented anticancer drug-induced elevation of MnSOD gene expression, indicating a role for PKC in this process. To further evaluate the role of PKC, we examined the effects of various activators of PKC on anticancer drug-induced MnSOD gene expression. Among the more nonspecific PKC activators such as PMA (21Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar), N-(6-phenylhexyl)-5-chloro-1-napthalenesulfonamide (SC-9) (31Ito M. Tanaka T. Inagaki M. Naharishe K. Hidaka H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4179-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and N-heptyl-5-chloro-1-napthalenesulfonamide (SC-10) (31Ito M. Tanaka T. Inagaki M. Naharishe K. Hidaka H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4179-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), only PMA strongly induced MnSOD gene expression (Fig.6 A). The effects of more specific PKC isoenzme activators such as thymeleatoxin (Thy), which is known to activate classical PKC isoforms α-γ (32Kazanietz M.G. Arecea L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodright J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), and deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20 acetate (dPPA), a purported cPKCβI isoenzyme-specific activator (33Ryves W.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), also were examined. Both of these agents caused potent elevation of MnSOD gene expression (severalfold greater than the effects of vinblastine, vincristine, or taxol; Fig.6 A). Prolonged incubation of cells with PKC activators such as PMA is known to deplete cells of cytosolic PKC (23Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23142-23146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PMA, unlike diacylglycerol, does not readily decompose and thereby stimulates PKC translocation continuously. To further confirm the role of PKC in anticancer drug-induced MnSOD gene expression, A549 cells were depleted of cytosolic PKC by incubating with PMA (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. After exposure to PMA, A549 cells were incubated with anticancer drugs, cPKC activators, or generalized activators of PKC. As shown in Fig.6 A, previous treatment of cells with PMA inhibited the increase in MnSOD mRNA by anticancer drugs or PKC activators. In a similar experiment, when PKC was depleted by PMA (20 ng/ml) for 24 h and then taxol was added and cells were incubated for 6 h, the induction of MnSOD mRNA by taxol was inhibited in comparison with the effect of taxol exposure alone (Fig. 6 B). These findings indicate that PKC activation is required to increase MnSOD gene expression by anticancer drugs. In general, PKC is located in the cytosol of unstimulated cells. After stimulation, PKC isoenzymes are translocated to the membrane region (20Martelly I. Castagna M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hence, translocation of a particular PKC isoenzyme to the membrane fraction provides one indicator of its activation. To determine the specific PKC isotype(s) involved in signaling for anticancer drug-induced MnSOD gene expression, we incubated A549 cells with anticancer agents and prepared the cytosolic and membrane fractions. The resulting distribution of PKC isoenzymes is shown in Fig. 7. The PKC isotype distribution in unstimulated A549 was found to be as follows: cytosol, cPKCα, cPKCβI, nPKCδ, aPKCζ, and nPKCμ; membrane, cPKCβII, nPKCε, aPKCζ, nPKCη, nPKCμ, and nPKCδ; and absent, cPKCγ, aPKCι, and nPKCθ. Each anticancer drug stimulated a specific translocation of PKCδ to the membrane fraction, with concomitant loss of this isotype in the cytosolic fraction. Other cPKC isotypes or nPKC isotypes were not translocated to the membrane after stimulation with these agents. Phorbol esters such as PMA, Thy, and dPPA caused almost complete translocation of PKCδ to the membrane. These agents also caused translocation of cPKCα, cPKCβI, and nPKCμ isotypes. PMA, Thy, and dPPA did not have any effect on PKCζ, confirming previous reports of a lack of activation of PKCζ by phorbol esters (22Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). In addition, our results show that PKCθ is not activated in response to PMA, Thy, or dPPA in these cells. As shown in Fig. 7, there is already some membrane-associated PKCδ in the control cells. Thus, to conclusively establish the translocation of PKCδ to the membrane by anticancer drugs, we treated A549 cells with various doses of anticancer drugs and detected PKCδ by Western blot. As shown in Fig.8, PKCδ is translocated to the membrane in a concentration-dependent manner. As in Fig. 7, translocation of PKCδ was more pronounced with taxol than with vinblastine or vincristine. Because we had found that PKCδ was translocated to the membrane fraction, we also sought to determine whether the total PKC activity was increased in the membrane fraction in response to anticancer drugs. PKC translocation after stimulation with natural agonists is both transient and tenuous. By contrast, translocation attributable to phorbol ester treatment is much more persistent. This is because diacylglycerol is rapidly metabolized, whereas phorbol esters are very slowly degraded (21Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). A moderate increase in PKC activity did occur in the membrane fraction after treatment with vinblastine, vincristine, or taxol (TableI). dPPA also caused a modest increase in PKC activity in the membrane fraction. Treatment with PMA or Thy caused a 5- to 6-fold increase in membrane PKC activity with concomitant loss of cytosolic activity (Table I). Thus, because PMA and Thy activate most isoforms of PKC, their potent membrane translocation of PKCs was not surprising. In comparison with anticancer agents, phorbol ester PKC activators caused more pronounced elevation of PKC activity in the membrane fraction.Table IEffect of microtubule-active anticancer compounds and various agonists on total PKC activity in membrane and cytosolic fractions of A549 cellsTreatmentCytosolMembranepmol/min/mg total proteinNone29.7 ± 8.55.5 ± 0.5Vinblastine57.7 ± 13.9aSignificantly different at p < 0.05 (n = 3 per condition).35 ± 13.0aSignificantly different at p < 0.05 (n = 3 per condition).Vincristine100 ± 8.4aSignificantly different at p < 0.05 (n = 3 per condition).11.5 ± 0.5Taxol62.3 ± 7.6aSignificantly different at p < 0.05 (n = 3 per condition).6.5 ± 2.5Thymeleatoxin10.0 ± 2.527.7 ± 2.7aSignificantly different at p < 0.05 (n = 3 per condition).dPPA51.0 ± 9.3aSignificantly different at p < 0.05 (n = 3 per condition).11.7 ± 5.7PMA8.3 ± 1.233.0 ± 3.0aSignificantly different at p < 0.05 (n = 3 per condition).A549 cells were incubated with vinblastine (15 μm), vincristine (15 μm), taxol (40 μm), Thy (0.5 μm), dPPA (10 nm), or PMA (200 ng/ml) for 30 min and then rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution.

Open table in a new tab A549 cells were incubated with vinblastine (15 μm), vincristine (15 μm), taxol (40 μm), Thy (0.5 μm), dPPA (10 nm), or PMA (200 ng/ml) for 30 min and then rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Membrane and cytosolic fractions of cell lysates were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Both fractions were subjected to DE52 ion exchange. PKC activities are expressed as pmol/min/mg of total cellular protein. In the present investigation, we demonstrate that microtubule-active anticancer drugs, including taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, induce MnSOD gene expression in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Previously, taxol was shown to induce TNF-α and IL-1 gene expression (5Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. Science. 1990; 248: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that taxol induced one or both of these cytokines, which subsequently caused MnSOD gene expression. To evaluate this possibility, cells were pretreated with the inhibitor of translation cycloheximide. Cycloheximide did not prevent elevation of MnSOD mRNA by taxol. Therefore, elevation of MnSOD mRNA by taxol was not dependent on new synthesis of protein(s) such as TNF or IL-1. We also evaluated the effect of additional antitumor drugs that do not induce cytokine gene expression and that, although acting on microtubules, differ in structure and mode of action from taxol. These included vinblastine and vincristine. Both of these agents also increased MnSOD mRNA. Therefore, anticancer drugs caused MnSOD gene expression by a mechanism other than cytokine up-regulation. In contrast to the effects of cycloheximide, actinomycin D inhibited MnSOD gene expression caused by each of the drugs, suggesting that the effect occurs at the level of transcription. Protein kinase C activation can induce MnSOD mRNA in endothelial and other cell types (23Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23142-23146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whitsett J.A. Clark J.C. Wispé J.R. Pryhuber G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L688-L693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because PKC activity could be increased by anticancer drugs (25Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of various PKC inhibitors on MnSOD gene expression caused by these agents. As shown, elevated MnSOD gene expression could be inhibited by specific PKC inhibitors calphostin C and GF109203X. Calphostin C binds to the regulatory domain of all PKC isoforms with equal potency (26Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar) and, thereby, causes inhibition. GF109203X is a highly selective inhibitor of PKC that binds to the catalytic domain of PKCα, βI, βII, γ, δ, and ε isoenzymes (27Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakanes M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further evaluate a potential role for specific isoenzymes of PKC, we treated cells with the cPKC specific activator Thy (32Kazanietz M.G. Arecea L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodright J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar) and the purported cPKCβI-specific activator dPPA (33Ryves W.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thymeleatoxin, an analog of mezerein isolated from Thymelea hirsuta L., is known to activate PKCα-γ with an ED50 of 100 nm, but it does not activate PKCδ and εin vivo at concentrations as high as 1 μm(32Kazanietz M.G. Arecea L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodright J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). dPPA is a phorbol ester that is very unstable and undergoes hydrolysis of its position 20 acetate group to produce 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenyl acetate (33Ryves W.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). dPPA in its native form is a specific agonist of the PKCβI isotype, but its hydrolysis product is a potent agonist of PKCα, β, γ, δ, and ε isotypes (34Kifey S.C. Olivier A.R. Gordge P.C. Ryves W.J. Evans F.J. Ways D.K. Parker P.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In our experiments, only freshly prepared dPPA and thymeleatoxin were used. As demonstrated, dPPA and thymeleatoxin potently induced MnSOD mRNA increases severalfold greater than those resulting from exposure to anticancer drugs. Previously, PMA, an activator of PKC, also was shown to induce MnSOD potently (23Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23142-23146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whitsett J.A. Clark J.C. Wispé J.R. Pryhuber G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L688-L693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our experiments confirmed this effect. However, the specific PKC isoform involved in PMA-induced MnSOD gene expression is not known. In contrast to PMA, SC-9 and SC-10, which are less extensively characterized activators of PKC (32Kazanietz M.G. Arecea L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodright J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), both failed to cause MnSOD expression in A549 cells. Prolonged exposure to relatively high concentrations of PMA can deplete cytosolic PKC. When A549 cells were continuously stimulated with PMA (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, followed by exposure to the anticancer drugs thymeleatoxin, dPPA, and PMA, there was inhibition of elevation of MnSOD gene expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKC activation is crucial in signaling of MnSOD gene expression both by phorbol esters and anticancer drugs. To conclusively establish the specific isoenzyme responsible for signaling the elevation in MnSOD gene expression caused by anticancer drugs and phorbol esters, we prepared membrane and cytosolic extracts from treated A549 cells and identified membrane translocation of isoenzymes using specific antibodies. As demonstrated (Fig. 7), A549 cells constitutively express five PKC isoforms in the cytosol and five isoforms in the membrane, with two isoforms being expressed at both sites. Three additional PKC isoforms were not present in these cells. Anticancer drugs induced translocation of PKCδ to the membrane with concomitant loss of this isoform from the cytosol indicating its activation. On the other hand, PMA, dPPA, and Thy each caused translocation of cPKCα, cPKCβI, and nPKCμ isotypes in addition to that of PKCδ. Thus, dPPA was not a specific activator of PKCβI in A549 cells. These findings are in agreement with those of others, which indicate that dPPA is not a selective activator of PKCβI in whole cell assays (34Kifey S.C. Olivier A.R. Gordge P.C. Ryves W.J. Evans F.J. Ways D.K. Parker P.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results likely relate to the fact that dPPA metabolism to its product, the nonselective PKC agonist dPP, occurs efficiently in intact cells. Hence, the effects of dPPA are nonspecific, resulting in stimulation of many isotypes, including PKCδ (34Kifey S.C. Olivier A.R. Gordge P.C. Ryves W.J. Evans F.J. Ways D.K. Parker P.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, Thy, a purported specific activator of cPKCs (32Kazanietz M.G. Arecea L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodright J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), caused translocation of PKCδ and PKCμ in addition to that of PKCβI and PKCα. Although thymeleatoxin was originally reported to be 200–1000-fold more potent on α-γ isotypes than on the δ, ε, or η isotypes (33Ryves W.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), recent reports have indicated that there is only a 5-fold difference in the K i for PKCα-ε and η (range, of 2.5–12.5 nm). Therefore, this agent cannot be regarded as a specific activator of cPKCs. As we have shown, translocation of PKCδ alone to the membrane was associated with MnSOD expression by anticancer drugs, and this MnSOD expression could be prevented by PKC inhibitors. Although PMA, dPPA, and Thy each caused membrane translocation of multiple PKC isoforms, including PKCδ, it seems likely that PKCδ alone was responsible for induction of MnSOD signaling by these compounds. This was concluded because PKCδ was the only isoform activated both by anticancer drugs and by each of the PKC activators (PMA, dPPA, and Thy), which effected MnSOD expression. The finding that PKC depletion by PMA pretreatment diminished MnSOD expression by all these agents added further support. This part of the investigation provided another example among the variety of signaling responses that can be evoked because of the multiple PKC isoforms activated by phorbol esters. Low concentrations of those agents caused almost complete translocation of PKCδ, as well as potent induction of MnSOD, in comparison with the anticancer compounds. To conclude, this investigation demonstrates that 1) microtubule-active anticancer drugs cause MnSOD gene expression in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells, and 2) this effect is mediated by the PKCδ isoform. The study also suggests that other, less specific PKC-activating agents such as PMA, dPPA, and Thy also cause MnSOD expression by translocation of PKCδ. Recent reports continue to indicate that superoxide and MnSOD are potentially important in modulating cell signaling, survival, and proliferation in cancer (35Manna S.M. Zhang H.J. Yan T.

Three RIIα isoforms of 51, 54, and 57 kDa were identified by RIIα immunodetection and labeling with 8-azido[32P]cAMP in different cell cycle phases. These isoforms were characterized as different phosphorylation states by the use of selective PKA and cyclin-directed kinase inhibitors. Whereas RIIα autophosphorylation by PKA caused RIIα to shift from 51 to 54 kDa, phosphorylation of RIIα by one other or a combination of several kinases activated during mitosis caused RIIα to shift from 51 to 57 kDa. In vivo incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into mitotic cells and RIIα immunoprecipitation demonstrated that RIIα was hyperphosphorylated on a different site than the one phosphorylated by PKA. Deletion and mutation analysis demonstrated that the cyclin B-p34cdc2 kinase (CDK1) phosphorylated human recombinant RIIα in vitro on Thr54.

Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits results in dissociation of the catalytic subunits, which are then catalytically active and can also be translocated to the nucleus. Four different regulatory subunits (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, RIIβ) and three different catalytic subunits (Cα, Cβ, Cγ) have been identified as separate gene products. The regulatory subunits RIα and RIIα are present in almost all cell types, whereas the expression of RIβ and RIIβ is tissue-specific. RII isoforms are associated with A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (3Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The activities and subcellular localization of protein kinases and phosphatases are known to be regulated by phosphorylation (for a review, see Ref. 9Woodgett J.R. Hames B.D. Glover D.M. Protein Kinases. IRL Press, New York1994Google Scholar). A major difference between RI and RII is the ability of RII to be autophosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA (10Erlichman J. Rangel-Aldao R. Rosen O.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II, glycogen synthase kinases 3 and 5, and proline-directed protein kinase have been identified in vitro on bovine RIIα as well (11Carmichael D.F. Geahlen R.L. Allen S.M. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10440-10445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Braun R.K. Vulliet P.R. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Hall F.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1982; 127: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that bovine RIIβ can also be phosphorylated at Thr69 in vitro by CDK1, the mitotic kinase p34cdc2 associated with cyclinB (14Keryer G. Luo Z. Cavadore J. Erlichman J. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5418-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The physiological role of these phosphorylations is not fully understood. In vitroautophosphorylation of PKA type II decreases the affinity between RII and the catalytic subunit, and CDK1 phosphorylation of RIIβ decreases its ability to anchor to MAP-2 (a neuronal microtubule-associated protein (14Keryer G. Luo Z. Cavadore J. Erlichman J. Bornens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5418-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). However, RIIβ is expressed primarily in neuro-endocrine cells and is thus present in differentiated cells that divide slowly or not at all. For these reasons, we examined the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of the ubiquitously expressed RIIα. In the present study, we show that in dividing cells, the regulatory subunit RIIα demonstrates different phosphorylation patterns during the cell cycle. In mitotic-arrested cells, RIIα-labeling with 8-azido[32P]cAMP, immunostaining with a specific antibody, and in situ incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate in HeLa cells revealed different states of RIIα phosphorylation compared with that observed during interphase. Inhibition of PKA activity with a selective inhibitor, H89, or inhibition of mitotic kinase activity with olomoucine showed that RIIα is mainly phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit during interphase and by a mitotic kinase on another phosphorylation site(s) during mitosis. Moreover in vivo incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into mitotic and interphase HeLa cells followed by RIIα immunoprecipitation demonstrated that in mitosis RIIα was hyperphosphorylated on at least two sites. Recombinant native human RIIα was phosphorylated in vitroby purified CDK1 on a site located in the N-terminal domain of this protein. Site-specific mutagenesis of the putative Thr54phosphorylation site demonstrated that this site was the target of CDK1. During mitosis, RIIα was dissociated from centrosome at the metaphase-anaphase transition concomitantly with its phosphorylation by PKA and CDK1. HeLa cells were grown as monolayer cultures at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. They were arrested or slowed down in their cell cycle by different techniques previously described (15Fantes P. Brooks R. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. The Cell Cycle.

HeLa cells were synchronized in mitosis by a double thymidine block followed by 1 μm nocodazole treatment for 18 h. The cell cycle state was analyzed by flow cytometry. Human osteosarcoma (SaOS-2) and human skin fibroblast (HS27) cell lines were grown as monolayer cultures on glass slides for immunocytochemistry in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For analysis of RIIα phosphorylation, kinase inhibitors were incorporated into certain experiments. Cells in interphase (essentially in G1/S phases) were treated for 6 h with 20 μm protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (17Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells entering mitosis were accumulated by treatment with 1 μmnocodazole for 18 h with additional 20 μm H89 during the last 6 h of this period. Olomoucine (100 μm), a cyclin-directed kinase inhibitor, was added 2 h before the end of mitotic synchronization to avoid inhibition of entry into mitosis. For 32P-labeling, HeLa cells arrested either in interphase at the G1/S border or in mitosis were incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, then 1 mCi/ml carrier free [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Both interphase (G1, G1/S, and S) and mitotic cells were washed twice in 80 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2 (EBS buffer). They were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in EBS buffer containing 2 mm ATP, protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 20 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin; and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 μm okadaic acid and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to discard unbroken cells and nuclei. The post-nuclear fractions were then centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min in a TL100 Beckman centrifuge to obtain cytosol and particulate fractions. Cell lysates were obtained as described above in the presence of 1% Nonidet-P40 in EBS buffer. After homogenization, lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for determination of cyclin-directed kinase activity as described below. Protein content of each fraction was quantified according to Bradford (18Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). The activity of mitotic cyclin-directed kinase CDK1 was measured in cell lysates with [γ-32P]ATP and the BIOTRAK Cdc2 kinase enzyme assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This system is based on a highly specific substrate (SV40 large T antigen) for the Cdc2 kinase (19Marshak D.R. Vandenberg M.T. Bae Y.S. Yu I.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity incorporation of 8-azido[32P]cAMP was performed as described (20Walter U. Uno I. Liu A.Y.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6494-6500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 6–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels. For all cytosols prepared from synchronized cells, the incorporation of 8-azido[32P]cAMP was linear with regard to the amount of protein used up to 150 μg. A monoclonal antibody (clone 4D7) raised against purified human testis RIα (21Taskén K. Skalhegg B.S. Solberg R. Andersson K.B. Taylor S.S. Lea T. Blomhoff H.K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21276-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as purified IgG2afrom mouse ascites at 1/1000 dilution for Western blotting. Polyclonal antibody against human RIIα was raised against a specific peptide from the N-terminal end of the human RIIα amino acid sequence (21Taskén K. Skalhegg B.S. Solberg R. Andersson K.B. Taylor S.S. Lea T. Blomhoff H.K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21276-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), affinity-purified, and used at 1 μg/ml dilution for Western blots and 10 μg/ml for immunoprecipitation. Antisera raised against rat heart RIIα (7De Camilli P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was used at 1/30 dilution for immunoprecipitation. A monoclonal antibody CTR 453 (IgG2b) obtained from a library of monoclonal antibodies raised against centrosomes isolated from human lymphoblasts was previously characterized as specific for the centrosome(22) and used for immunocytochemistry as purified immunoglobulins at 140 ng/ml dilution. The cytosolic proteins solubilized in sample buffer were separated on 6–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described previously (23Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B. Skahlegg B. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies and then with anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (for hRIIα Ab) or with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (for hRIα Ab). Metabolically labeled HeLa cells in interphase and in mitosis were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (as described above for cell homogenization) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate). Immunoprecipitation of RIIα from metabolically 32P-labeled cells was performed as described previously (23Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B. Skahlegg B. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The radioactive polypeptide bands were cut out from the gel, and limited digestion of RII was carried out using trypsin-EDTA (Boehringer Mannheim) as described by Takio et al. (24Takio K. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Titani K. FEBS Lett. 1980; 114: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped after 5 min at room temperature by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 1-mm-thick slab gel consisting of a 4% staking gel and a 15% resolving gel. Labeled proteolytic products were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel using Kodak BIOMAX films. Heterologous expression, purification, and characterization of the human regulatory subunit RIIα of PKA will be described elsewhere. 2K. Taskén, R. Kopperud, A. E. Christensen, L. H. Dybdahl, B. Fauske, B. T. Gjertsen, R. Solberg, V. Hansson, T. Jahnsen, and S. O. Døskeland, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, a fragment of the human RIIα cDNA sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to generate a full-length open reading frame with convenient cloning sites, subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-KG, expressed as a fusion protein with GST in theEscherichia coli strain BL21/DE3, and purified from bacterial lysates by absorption to glutathione-agarose beads as described elsewhere (21Taskén K. Skalhegg B.S. Solberg R. Andersson K.B. Taylor S.S. Lea T. Blomhoff H.K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21276-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Solberg R.

Subsequently, purified fusion protein was digested with thrombin, and GST was absorbed on glutathione-agarose beads to obtain soluble RIIα protein that contained an extra two-amino acid N-terminal extension from the linker segment/thrombin cleavage site of GST. Mutants RIIα-Thr54-Ala and RIIα-Thr54-Glu were made by polymerase chain reaction of two overlapping amplification products, both with the Thr54-Ala or Thr54-Glu mutation intoduced. This was accomplished using RIIα wild type cDNA (26Oyen O. Myklebust F. Scott J.D. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as a template and primers covering nucleotides 189–208 and 335–350 for the 5′ amplification product and primers covering nucleotides 336–351 and 1523–1542 for the 3′ amplification product. Subsequently, the overlapping products were mixed, denatured to facilitate annealing of the overlapping part with mutations, filled with Klenow, and subjected to a second round of polymerase chain reaction as described above using only the outside primers. Polymerase chain reaction products of the full-length open reading frame were subcloned to pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) and sequenced to identify mutations. RIIα-mutated genes were then subcloned to pGEX-KG, and RIIα mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified as described above. The catalytic subunit C of PKA type II (stock solution 0. 21 mg/ml) was purified from bovine heart as described by Lohmann et al. (27Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9985-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The starfish cyclin B-p34cdc2 kinase was purified from starfish oocytes by a protocol including affinity chromatography on p13suc1-Sepharose beads and consisted of two major polypeptides identified as p34cdc2 catalytic subunit of Cdk1 and cyclin B (28Labbé J.C. Capony J.P. Caput D. Cavadore J.C. Derancourt J. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Picard A. Dorée M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The specific activity of starfish CDK1 preparations varied from 150 to 1000 pmols of phosphate/min/μl incorporated into histone H1 as a substrate. HeLa CDK1 was enriched by affinity chromatography on p13suc1-Sepharose beads from lysates of HeLa cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole. The CDK1·p13suc1·Sepharose beads complex (specific activity: 400 pmol of phosphate/min/mg incorporated into histone H1) was used to phosphorylate the particulate proteins isolated from HeLa cells arrested in G1 phase of their cell cycle. Production and purification of yeast p13suc1 protein were as described by Labbé et al. (29Labbé J.C. Cavadore J.C. Dorée M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human recombinant extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (specific activity of 8.5 nmol of phosphate/min/mg of enzyme incorporated into myelic basic protein) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 purified from sea star Piaster ochraceus (specific activity of 1 nmol of phosphate/min/mg of transferred to myelic basic protein) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant human RIIα subunits were phosphorylated in vitro at 20 °C either in PKA phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm cAMP, 100 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity up to 5000 Ci/mmol (1 Ci = 37 GBq; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) or for CDK1 and microtubule-associated protein kinase in EBS phosphorylation buffer without sucrose containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), 100 μm ATP, and 1 mCi [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. For subsequent 8-azido[32P]cAMP-labeling of the RII subunits, phosphorylation was performed in the absence of radioactive ATP, and the reaction was stopped at 4 °C with the addition of 10 mm EDTA. After affinity-labeling, the samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer. Hela cells were arrested at the G1-S border with a double thymidine block. The cells were washed in 45 mm Pipes, 45 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 6.9, (PHEM buffer (30Schliwa M. Euteneuer U. Bulinski J.C. Izant J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)) containing the protease and phosphatase inhibitors described under “Cell Fractionation and Cdc2 Kinase Assay.” Then they were extracted for 1 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer. The Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 300 × gfor 10 min. The Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (100 μg of protein) was incubated for 30 min at 22 °C in EBS phosphorylation buffer (as described above) containing 100 μm ATP and human CDK1 (specific activity 400 pmol/min/μg of protein for histone H1) that had been enriched 4 times on p13suc1-Sepharose beads from a cytosol of nocodazole-arrested cells (29Labbé J.C. Cavadore J.C. Dorée M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A control with the same amount of Triton X-100-insoluble protein was incubated with p13suc1-Sepharose beads without CDK1. The Sepharose beads and the particulate material were pelleted at 14,000 × gfor 20 min, and the proteins of the pellet and the supernatant were boiled in Laemmli buffer. Both fractions were examined for the amount of RIIα by Western blotting as described above. Cells grown on 35-mm plastic dishes or 22-mm glass coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min, then rinsed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin were added for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 three times to wash away unbound primary antibodies and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mixed Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein or/and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. For negative controls, the primary antibody was either omitted or replaced by a nonspecific IgG used at the same dilution as the primary antibody. Finally, the cells were mounted in Citifluor (Citifluor, UKC, Chemical Laboratories, Canterbury, CT27NH, United Kingdom), examined, and photographed on an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope. 8-Azido[32P]cAMP affinity-labeling of R subunits was used to follow the different regulatory subunit isoforms present in cytosols from cells arrested during the cell cycle. The position of the cells in the cell cycle was monitored by flow cytometry analysis (Fig.1 A). The CDK1 mitotic kinase activity was measured in lysates of synchronized cells. A single thymidine block followed by l-mimosine arrest in late G1 caused 73 ± 12% of HeLa cells to accumulate in G1/S. Although it has been reported that mimosine-arrested cells have high levels of cyclin A-complexed CDK1 (31Maraccino R.L. Firpo E.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we only detected low CDK1 activity in the lysate of these cells (200 ± 58 pmol/mg/min). Serum deprivation followed by an aphidicolin block yielded 73 ± 5.8% of cells in S phase. The CDK1 activity was also low in these cells (349 ± 5.7 pmol/mg/min). HeLa cells were synchronized in G2 phase by a double-thymidine block followed by olomoucine arrest in G2. However olomoucine arrests the cells also in G1, and we obtained a mixed population of cells enriched in G1 (29%) and in G2 (70%). The CDK1 activity was very low (27.9 ± 9.9 pmol/mg/min) in these cell extracts, even lower than that observed in G1-arrested cells. Cells were also arrested in a pseudometaphase state with nocodazole, which produced 94 ± 9% mitotic cells. The CDK1 activity was quite high (2264 ± 4.5 pmol/mg/min). The 8-azido[32P]cAMP-labeling of the PKA regulatory subunits (Fig. 1 B) was performed both in the absence and in the presence of an excess of unlabeled cAMP, the latter used as a check of the specificity of the labeling. In the cytosol of G1, of S-enriched cells, or in the mixed population of G1 and G2 cells, three polypeptides of 49, 51, and 54 kDa specifically bound the 8-azido[32P]cAMP (Fig.1 B, lanes 2–4). In the cytosol of mitotic cells, four polypeptides of 49, 51, 54, and 57 kDa were labeled (Fig. 1B,lane 5). No 8-azido[32P]cAMP-labeling was observed in the presence of excess unlabeled cAMP (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 6). In HeLa cells only two regulatory subunit isoforms have been identified, RIα and RIIα. This was observed with antibodies directed against nonhuman R isoforms by Weber et al. (32Weber W. Schwoch G. Hiltz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and Nigg et al. (6Nigg E.A. Schäfer G. Hiltz H. Eppenberger H.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and more recently with specific antibodies directed against the known human isoforms of R subunits, RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ (data not shown). To identify the 8-azido[32P]cAMP-labeled R isoforms in synchronized cell cytosols, RIIα and RIα were immunodetected in different HeLa cytosols with an affinity-purified antibody directed specifically against the N-terminal domain of human RIIα and a monoclonal antibody directed against human RIα. RIIα was always immunochemically detected in interphase HeLa cells as a polypeptide doublet of 51 and 54 kDa (Fig. 1 C, right panel), corresponding to the well known unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated forms of this regulatory subunit (6Nigg E.A. Schäfer G. Hiltz H. Eppenberger H.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 32Weber W. Schwoch G. Hiltz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However in cells arrested in mitosis, an additional slower migrating polypeptide (57 kDa), which cross-reacted with anti-hRIIα antibody, was always detected. Western blot analysis revealed no difference in the total amount of RIIα detected during the cell cycle. In HeLa cytosols, the human RIα monoclonal antibody detected only one polypeptide at 49 kDa, which also did not vary in amount during the cell cycle (Fig. 1 C, left panel). In interphase cells, H89, a cell permeant inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, led to the disappearance of the 54-kDa R-subunit (Fig. 2, lanes 1 versus 5). In mitotic cells treated with H89 (PKA activity in these cells was completely inhibited as verified using Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) as a substrate), we detected no 57-kDa RII isoform. Although PKA activity was abolished, we still observed a faint 8-azido[32P]cAMP-labeled R-subunit at 53–54 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). To distinguish between noncomplete H89 inhibition of RII autophosphorylation and another nonautophosphorylation event on RII in mitosis, we made use of olomoucine. Treatment of mitotic cells with 100 μmolomoucine led to an inhibition of CDK1 (as previously measured in synchronized cell lysates) and to a disappearance of the 57-kDa R-subunit in mitotic cytosol (Fig. 2, lane 3). In contrast, olomoucine treatment of G1-arrested cells did not modify the 8-azido[32P]cAMP binding pattern (not shown, see also Fig. 1 B, lane 4 for a mixed population of G1- and G2-arrested cells with olomoucine). Unfortunately the addition of both H89 and olomoucine on nocodazole-arrested cells led to cell death. Whereas phosphatase treatment of cytosols isolated from either the mitotic or the interphase cells abolished the 54- and 57-kDa RII-phosphorylated isoforms, only the 57-kDa RII isoform disappeared when the homogenization of mitotic cells was performed in the absence of okadaic acid (data not shown). To confirm the phosphorylation states of RII during mitosis, HeLa cells in interphase or arrested in mitosis were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were analyzed for the presence of labeled RIIα by immunoprecipitation with anti-RIIα antibodies raised either against rat RIIα (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–4) or against a specific sequence of the N-terminal domain of human RIIα (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–6). This last antibody was affinity-purified against the appropriate RIIα peptide (33Skalhegg B.S. Taskén K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The anti-rat RIIα antibody has been shown to cross-react with human RIIα (23Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B. Skahlegg B.

Several short sequence elements in pre-mRNA contribute to intron recognition and splice site selection. The 5′ss and 3′ss represent the most universally conserved and functionally important elements. The 5′ss, containing the nearly invariant GU dinucleotide, is recognized through base pairing by the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) early in spliceosome assembly and by other snRNPs and factors at later stages of the reaction. The precise function of the conserved AG at the 3′ intron border is less well understood (reviewed in Refs. 1Moore M.J. Query C.Q. Sharp P. Gesteland R. Atkins J. The RNA World.

Although the role of splice sites appears to be similar in different eukaryotes, the relative contribution of other signals differs significantly between different organisms. In vertebrates and insects, the characteristic and functionally important feature of introns is a polypyrimidine tract, which is located between the branch point and the 3′ss. The pyrimidine tract is recognized by the heterodimeric protein U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) early in spliceosome assembly, and this interaction is essential for positioning the U2 snRNP at the branch site, the sequence of which is highly degenerate in metazoa (5Zamore P.D.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Most introns in S. cerevisiae lack 3′ss-proximal polypyrimidine tracts, and specific sequences positioned 3′ of the branch site do not contribute to the first step of splicing despite the fact that a factor, Mud2p, sharing some structural and functional similarity with the large subunit of the metazoan U2AF, is present in yeast (8Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12Abovich N. Liao X.C. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Some yeast introns contain uridine stretches upstream of the 3′ss, but these sequences function during the second step of splicing (13Patterson B. Guthrie C. Cell. 1991; 64: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Requirements for intron recognition in higher plants differ from those in yeast and vertebrates. Plant introns contain neither conserved branch point sequences nor distinct 3′ss-proximal polypyrimidine tracts similar to those present in yeast and vertebrate introns, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 4Simpson G.G. Filipowicz W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 15Schuler M.A. Bailey-Serres J. Gallie D.R.

Taha S. Walbot V. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 149-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With respect to both consensus and a position relative to the 3′ss, the branch sites in plant introns resemble those found in metazoa (17Liu H.-X. Filipowicz W. Plant J. 1996; 9: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Simpson C.G. Clark G. Davidson D. Smith P. Brown J.W.S. Plant J. 1996; 9: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of plant introns is their UA or U richness, a property essential for splicing (19Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. Cell. 1989; 58: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 20Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2635-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Lou H.

Biol. 1998; 36: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The requirement for UA richness is particularly strong in dicotyledonous plants, which have been studied in the most detail. It is not known how, at the molecular level, the UA-rich elements, usually distributed throughout the whole length of introns, contribute to splicing. Experiments performed with UA-deficient synthetic introns have shown that stimulation of splicing by U-rich sequences does not depend on their position in the intron (19Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. Cell. 1989; 58: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 26Gniadkowski M. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Liu H.-X. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Short U-rich elements such as UUUUUAU or its multimers activated splicing whether inserted near the 5′ss or in the middle of the intron (hence upstream of the branch site) or in the vicinity of the 3′ss. Other studies have shown that UA-rich elements play an important role in the definition of intron borders; the 3′ and 5′ splice sites preferentially selected for splicing were those present at the transition regions from the UA-rich to GC-rich sequences (Refs. 21Lou H. McCullough A.J. Schuler M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4485-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22McCullough A.J. Lou H. Schuler M.A. Mol. Cell.

A Look Beyond Transcription: Mechanisms Determining mRNA Stability and Translation in Plants. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, Maryland1998: 1-19Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the 3′ss-proximal UA-rich elements indicated that, as in the case of splicing activation discussed above (26Gniadkowski M. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Liu H.-X. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), U rather than A residues play a key role in intron border definition (21Lou H. McCullough A.J. Schuler M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4485-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); preference for U residues, although less pronounced, was also seen upon mutagenesis of the 5′ss-proximal and internal UA elements (28Egoavil C. Marton H.A. Baynton C.E. McCullough A.J. Schuler M.A. Plant J. 1997; 12: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Merritt H. McCullough A.J. Schuler M.A. Plant J. 1997; 12: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). U-richness was also found to be an essential feature for splicing in maize (Ref. 25Ko C.H. Brendel V. Taylor R.D. Walbot V. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and references therein). Stimulation of splicing by UA-rich elements from upstream locations in the intron and their importance for selection of both 5′ and 3′ splice sites make it unlikely that these elements simply act as plant counterparts to the metazoan polypyrimidine tracts. The latter are always located between the branch point and the 3′ss and usually function only in the definition of the 3′ intron border (reviewed in Refs. 1Moore M.J. Query C.Q. Sharp P. Gesteland R. Atkins J. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar and 3Krämer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). To obtain more insight into the function of UA-rich elements in plant splicing, we are characterizing proteins likely to be involved in intron recognition in plants. A group of ∼50-kDa proteins that interact with plant introns and show specificity for oligouridylates has been previously identified in nuclear extracts of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (26Gniadkowski M. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Liu H.-X. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); their role in splicing in vivoremains to be established. In this work we characterize two isoforms of the large subunit of the splicing factor U2AF in N. plumbaginifolia and find that the small subunit of this factor is also expressed in different isoforms in plants. Structural and functional similarity between the plant and human U2AF subunits suggests that plant U2AF, like its metazoan counterpart, interacts with and defines the 3′ss-proximal region of the intron. Identification of the U2AF-like factor in plants raises the interesting question as to how the plant splicing machinery distinguishes between the 3′-proximal and upstream U-rich elements during intron definition. The PCR-derived cDNA clones encoding different RBD-type RNA binding domains found in proteins of N. plumbaginifolia are described by Mieszczak et al. (30Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Levy J.H. Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert encoding the domain number 8 was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the random priming method and used as a probe for screening of theN. plumbaginifolia cDNA λ-ZAP II library (4.5 × 105 plaque-forming units) as described by Mieszczaket al. (30Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Levy J.H. Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The isolated 1,379-bp-long cDNA, present in pBluescript SK(−) and named pNpU2AF65b/3′, was sequenced on both strands. The missing 5′-end region of the cDNA was isolated following the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol using the Marathon kit (CLONTECH) and two nested oligonucleotide primers, GGCATTACTAGCTTCCTCTACT and TATGATGCCATCCAATGCCATGGCA, complementary to the regions located at positions 1,044–1,023 and 1,066–1,041 of the complete NpU2AF65b cDNA. A 1,044-bp isolated fragment containing the 5′ portion of the cDNA was cloned into the HincII site of pBluescript KS and sequenced. The full-length NpU2AF65b cDNA clone was reconstructed by ligating the two cDNA halves using the SphI site present at position 850 of the complete cDNA. The final construct contains 2,204 bp of cDNA cloned in the BspD I site of pBluescript SK(−). To isolate NpU2AF65a cDNA, the same cDNA library (4 × 105 plaque-forming units) was screened using the 3′-terminal 1,379-bp fragment of NpU2AF65b cDNA as a probe. The phagemid DNA of the four purified clones was excised using the ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene), and their inserts were sequenced. The longest 2,108-bp cDNA, present in pBluescript SK(−), is called pNpU2AF65a. The five rice Expressed Sequence Tag cDNA clones (accession numbers D46624, D48800, C19537,C19669, and C28752) encoding U2AF small subunits were obtained from MAFF DNA Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of N. plumbaginifolia U2AF65a and b cDNAs are deposited in the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Libraries under accession numbers Y18351 and Y18350, respectively. Sequences of rice U2AF35a and b cDNAs are deposited under accession numbers Y18349 and Y18348, respectively. Constructs for overexpression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were prepared as follows. The coding region of NpU2AF65a was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides AGGAGGGAACCATGGGGGACTATGA and GTGGTTAAAGGGATCCCTCATAGT and cloned into the HincII-digested pBluescript KS vector. The NpU2AF65a cDNA fragment was excised from the plasmid by digestion with XhoI and EcoRV, the ends were filled in using the Klenow DNA polymerase, and the purified DNA fragment was ligated into the SmaI-digested pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To restore the coding frame, the plasmid was cut with ClaI, treated with the Klenow enzyme, and religated. This construct, named pGST-U2AF65a, contains an additional 33-bp sequence that encodes the SSLSRYRQEGT peptide positioned between the GST and the NpU2AF65a coding regions. The coding region of NpU2AF65b was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides TGGACTAAGGGATCCAGTCAAGAG and GGGTGGGTAGAATTCACCATCATA, which introduce aBamHI site in front of the ATG codon and an EcoRI site in place of the stop codon, respectively (sequences of introduced restriction sites are printed in bold). The PCR product was cut withBamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pGEX-2T, resulting in pGST-U2AF65b. Plasmid pGST-hU2AF (in pGEX-3X; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), containing human GST-U2AF65 cDNA (5Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Dr. M. Green (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). To prepare plasmids for generation of the RNase mapping probes, the fragment downstream of the SphI site located at position 1,370 of the U2AF65a cDNA in pNpU2AF65a and the fragment downstream of the SacI site located at position 1,589 of the U2AF65b cDNA in pNpU2AF65b/3′ were removed by cutting with appropriate restriction enzymes and religating. The two resulting plasmids are referred to as pU2AF65a/probe and pU2AF65b/probe. Plasmids used for generation of the UV cross-linking substrates are pGS7 (19Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. Cell. 1989; 58: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), encoding syn7 RNA, and pGS/Rca. pGS/Rca was derived by replacing the KpnI-XhoI DNA fragment of pGS7 by a DNA fragment encoding intron 3, flanked by 10 nucleotides of exon 2 and 11 nucleotides of exon 3, of the ArabidopsisRubisco activase (Rca) gene. The Rca gene fragment was amplified by PCR using pRcam (17Liu H.-X. Filipowicz W. Plant J. 1996; 9: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as a template and oligonucleotides TTGACGGTACCTAACATCAA and CATATACTCGAGATAAGTGGAAC, which introduce the KpnI site upstream of the 5′ss and the XhoI site downstream of the 3′ss, respectively. To express the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged protein, the coding region of NpU2AF65a was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides AGGAGGGAACCATGCGGGACTATGA and GTGGTTAAAGGGATCCCTCATAGTC, which introduce theNcoI site upstream of the ATG codon and the BamHI site at the position of the stop codon, respectively. The PCR product was cut with NcoI and BamHI and cloned intoNcoI/BamHI-cleaved pGGS.5 (31Genschik P. Hall J. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13211-13219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pNpU2AF65a/HA from which NpU2AF65a is expressed as a C-terminal fusion with the influenza hemagglutinin nonapeptide tag, YPYDVPDYA. The identity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. RNA from different organs of N. plumbaginifolia plants and from cells grown in suspension (26Gniadkowski M. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Liu H.-X. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was isolated following the guanidinium chloride method described by Arrand (32Arrand J.E. Hames B.D. Higgins S.G. Nucleic Acid Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 17-45Google Scholar). Plasmids pU2AF65a/probe and pU2AF65b/probe were linearized with PvuII and transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase using [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol). Probes were purified by gel electrophoresis, and RNase A/T1 mapping was performed as reported previously (33Goodall G.J. Wiebauer K. Filipowicz W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of RNA per assay. The bacterial host for the expression of the N. plumbaginifoliaand human GST fusion proteins was BL21 (DE3). One liter of LB medium supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with an overnight culture grown at 37 °C to have a starting OD at 600 nm of 0.05–0.1. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an OD at 600 nm of 0.7–0.9, and the expression of transgenes was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1–2 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by a 10-min centrifugation at 3,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and subsequently broken with a French press (800 p.s.i.). After centrifugation (25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was applied onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B and further processed according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were further purified by gel filtration on the Superose 12 column to eliminate contaminating shorter protein fragments retained on the affinity column. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against 2 liters of 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.9, containing 100 mmKCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay. Plasmids pGS7 and pGS/Rca were linearized with PstI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) using [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) as a label. RNAs were purified by gel electrophoresis. RNA (2 fmol; ∼40,000 cpm), with or without a competitor added, was denatured by brief heating at 95 °C and chilling on ice. RNA samples were incubated with 100 ng of GST-U2AF65 fusion proteins for 10 min at 20 °C in 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.9, containing 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol and 5 units of RNasin (Promega) in a total volume of 10 μl. UV cross-linking was performed in Eppendorf tubes placed on ice in the Stratalinker (Stratagene) by 15-min irradiation at 2.3 joules/cm2 (∼10 cm distance from the UV source). Ten μg of RNase A was added and after 45 min at 37 °C, the samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. HeLa cell nuclear extracts prepared as described in Dignam et al. (34Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) were depleted of U2AF by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose exactly as described in Valcárcel et al. (35Valcárcel J. Martinez C. Green M.R. Richter J.D. mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 31-53Crossref Google Scholar). The 9-μl in vitrosplicing reactions contained 15 μg of the nuclear extract protein, the amounts of recombinant proteins indicated in the legend of Fig.4 B, and 20,000 cpm (10 fmol) of the AdML pre-mRNA. Incubations were for 40 min at 30 °C in 13.3 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, containing 3 mm MgCl2, 66.6 mm KCl, 1.1 mm ATP, 22.2 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.9 units/μl of RNasin, 0.13 mmEDTA, 13.3% glycerol, 3.3% polyvinyl alcohol, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, and 0.66 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were stopped by digestion with proteinase K, and the RNAs, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 13% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Protoplasts prepared from N. plumbaginifolia leaves were transfected by the polyethylene glycol method (33Goodall G.J. Wiebauer K. Filipowicz W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) using 20 μg of plasmid DNA/6 × 105protoplasts. Protoplasts were processed for indirect immunofluorescence 18–20 h after transfection as described by Genschik et al.(31Genschik P. Hall J. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13211-13219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar), using the rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody HA11 (Berkley Antibody Co.) at 1:80 dilution and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at 1:100 dilution. The slides were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and a Leica TCS 4D confocal scanning laser microscope. We have previously identified, using a PCR-based approach, 15 cDNA sequences encoding different RBD-type RNA binding domains in N. plumbaginifolia (30Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Levy J.H. Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One of the characterized RBD domains (domain 8; Ref. 30Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Levy J.H. Goodall G.J. Filipowicz W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed strong sequence similarity to one of the RBD domains of the large 65-kDa subunit of the human splicing factor U2AF. The 2,204-bp-long cDNA encoding the full-length protein, named NpU2AF65b, containing this RBD domain was isolated by screening the N. plumbaginifoliacDNA library followed by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (see “Experimental Procedures”). The NpU2AF65b cDNA was used for an additional screen of the cDNA library. Four cDNA clones encoding a protein closely related to NpU2AF65b, referred to as NpU2AF65a, were identified and sequenced. The longest cDNA of class a is 2,108 bp long. Conceptual translation of the NpU2AF65a and b cDNAs yields proteins of 555 and 573 amino acids, respectively. In both clones, the ATG codon is preceded by a stop codon in the same coding frame. The 5′-untranslated regions of the NpU2AF65a and b cDNAs are 62 and 138 bp, respectively. However, the 5′-terminal regions of the cDNAs may be incomplete. Northern analysis has indicated that NpU2AF65b mRNA is approximately 2,600 nucleotides long (data not shown). The 3′-untranslated regions of the NpU2AF65a and b cDNAs are 381 and 347 bp long, respectively. The NpU2AF65a and b proteins are 85% identical and 92% similar and have the same structural organization. In both proteins, the approximately 150–170-amino acid N-terminal domain, rich in RS and RD repeats, is separated by the 50-amino acid-long linker region from the three RBD-type RNA binding domains present at the C-terminal part. Most differences between the two proteins are confined to the N-terminal RS/RD domain. When compared with NpU2AF65a, NpU2AF65b contains a 22-amino acid-long insertion close to the N terminus and is missing four amino acids, DRDG, that follow position 74 in NpU2AF65a (Fig.1 A). Data base searches indicated strong homology of both plant proteins with the large subunits of the splicing factor U2AF from other organisms. BothN. plumbaginifolia proteins are most related to large U2AF subunits from mammals and Drosophila (approximately 41 and 49–50% identity and similarity, respectively). The lowest conservation, 32% identity and 45% similarity, is with the homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This high sequence conservation and similar domain organization indicate that the twoN. plumbaginifolia proteins are U2AF65 homologs (see also below). When this work was completed, sequences encoding likely counterparts of the human U2AF65 appeared as part of theArabidopsis genome-sequencing project. The complete sequence of one Arabidopsis U2AF65 isoform, deduced from the genomic sequence (GenBank accession number Z99708) and referred to as AtU2AF65a, is included in the alignment shown in Fig.1 A. Homology of AtU2AF65a with U2AF large subunits from other species is similar to that of the N. plumbaginifolia proteins. In addition, the partial genomic sequence (GenBank accession number AC002292), which encodes a second AtU2AF65 isoform, has been identified. The deduced protein fragment shows 75% identity and 81% similarity with amino acids 459–568 of AtU2AF65a. The conservation of plant and metazoan proteins is higher in RNA binding domains than in the RS/RD domain, where the only common feature is the presence of RS and RD repeats without any conserved arrangement. A notable characteristic of the plant U2AF65 proteins is the bias in favor of RD over RS repeats in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1 B). The two regions of U2AF65 shown to be responsible for the interaction with the small subunit of U2AF (36Zhang M. Zamore P.D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A.I. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

First, to investigate whether there are synergistic interactions among multiple bound factors, we studied promoter constructions containing one or five Gal4 sites and found that a single recognition site is sufficient for Gal4-VP16 to bind to chromatin, to induce nucleosome rearrangement, and to activate transcription. Notably, we observed that Gal4-VP16 binds to a single site in chromatin with affinity comparable with that which it binds to naked DNA, even in the absence of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity. Second, to explore the relation between translational nucleosome positioning and transcriptional activation, we analyzed a series of promoter constructions in which nucleosomes were positioned by Gal4-VP16 at different locations relative to the RNA start site. These experiments revealed that the positioning of a nucleosome over the RNA start site is not an absolute barrier to transcriptional activation. Third, to determine the contribution of core promoter elements to transcriptional activation with chromatin templates, we tested the ability of Gal4-VP16 to activate transcription with TATA box- versus DPE-driven core promoters and found that the TATA box is not required to achieve transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16 with chromatin templates. These results suggest that a single protomer of a strong activator is able to bind to chromatin, to induce nucleosome remodeling, and to activate transcription in conjunction with a broad range of chromatin structures and core promoter elements.

Third, to determine the contribution of core promoter elements to transcriptional activation with chromatin templates, we tested the ability of Gal4-VP16 to activate transcription with TATA box- versus DPE-driven core promoters and found that the TATA box is not required to achieve transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16 with chromatin templates. These results suggest that a single protomer of a strong activator is able to bind to chromatin, to induce nucleosome remodeling, and to activate transcription in conjunction with a broad range of chromatin structures and core promoter elements. nuclear factor κB cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein downstream promoter element base pair(s). The regulation of gene transcription is often a critical step in cellular responses to developmental and environmental cues. Transcription by RNA polymerase II involves the action of promoter- and enhancer-binding factors, co-activators and co-repressors, and the basal transcriptional machinery (for reviews, see Refs. 1Orphanides G.

The biochemical analysis of chromatin templates has been a useful approach to the study of the role of chromatin structure in the regulation of transcription. In reconstituted biochemical systems, basal transcription by the general transcriptional machinery is strongly repressed (>100-fold) by the packaging of DNA into chromatin, whereas many promoter- and enhancer-binding factors are able to activate transcription with nucleosomal templates. It thus appears that at least one function of sequence-specific activators is to counteract the repression of basal transcription by chromatin. Notably, other treatments that reduce transcriptional activity from non-chromatin templates in vitro, such as template dilution, addition of histone H1, addition of chromatin assembly extract in the absence of histones, or high salt concentrations, do not faithfully reproduce the regulation observed with chromatin (for example, see Ref. 20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that a key and unique feature of chromatin is its specific ability to repress basal, but not activated transcription. Yet, the role of chromatin structure in transcriptional regulation is likely to be more complex than a matter of repression and derepression. For instance, the packaging of DNA into chromatin appears to facilitate transcription by promoting interactions among transcription factors (for example, see Refs. 21Barton M.C. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2453-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T.

Claret F.-X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In particular, the use of chromatin templates prepared with theDrosophila S-190 assembly extract (22Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar) yields an experimental system that appears to recreate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation with a good degree of accuracy, especially when compared with effects seen with non-chromatin DNA templates (for instance, see Refs. 20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 26Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell.

For example, the magnitude of transcriptional activation with such chromatin templates more closely resembles that seen in vivo than that observed with naked DNA templates. In addition, the requirement for a transcriptional activation region in activators (such as Gal4 derivatives (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T.

The available evidence suggests that the presence of ATP-utilizing nucleosome remodeling factors (for recent reviews, see Refs. 8Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). These and other findings have led us to explore, in greater detail, the relation between promoter structure and transcriptional activation by the Gal4-VP16 activator (35Chasman D.I. Leatherwood J. Carey M. Ptashne M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4746-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 36Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) with chromatin templates assembled with the S-190 extract. First, to investigate whether synergistic interactions among multiple DNA-bound activators are essential for high levels of transcriptional activation in chromatin, we tested the ability of a single Gal4-VP16 protomer (i.e. dimer (37Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)) to bind to chromatin, to activate transcription, and to induce nucleosome remodeling. Second, to test the relation between nucleosome positioning and transcriptional activation, we systematically varied the spacing between the Gal4 binding sites and the core promoter and analyzed the transcriptional properties of the corresponding chromatin templates. Third, we examined elements of the core promoter and tested the ability of Gal4-VP16 to activate transcription in conjunction with TATA box-driven versus DPE-driven core promoters. The pGIE-n series of plasmids, which contain the adenovirus E4 core promoter with five tandem Gal4 sites (CGGAGGACAGTACTCCG; derived from pG5E4T (38Lin Y.-S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) located at various distances (n + 21 bp) upstream of the TATA box, were constructed by inserting defined fragments (synthesized by polymerase chain reaction) of Drosophila TFIIB genomic DNA (39Lira-DeVito L.M. Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Gene. 1995; 153: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) between the Gal4 sites and the TATA box. The genomic DNA inserts (of length = n bp) were a nested series of fragments that extended in the 5′ direction relative to the TATA box. For the single binding site plasmids (pG1IE-n series), the five tandem Gal4 sites were excised from the pGIE-n series plasmids and replaced with a single copy of the same Gal4 recognition sequence. The Gal4 site from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MEL1 gene is as follows: CGGCCATATGTCTTCCG (40Vashee S. Xu H. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24699-24706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For comparison of the minimal promoters, five tandem Gal4 sites (also derived from pG5E4T) were placed upstream of the previously described minimal core promoter constructions (41Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 42George C.P. Lira-DeVito L.M. Wampler S.L. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give the G5min series. The G5min plasmids were the gift of Drs. Catherine George and Thomas Burk (University of California, San Diego), and some of the pGIE-n series plasmids were the gift of Dr. Michael Bulger (University of California, San Diego). All plasmids were purified by alkaline lysis methodology followed by two sequential CsCl gradients. Chromatin was assembled with plasmid DNA, Drosophila core histones, Drosophila histone H1, and S-190 assembly extract derived from Drosophilaembryos, as described previously (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar, 43Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). Histone H1 was included, where indicated, at 200 nm concentration in the assembly reactions, which results in approximately 1 molecule of H1 per nucleosome core incorporated into the chromatin (22Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When Gal4-VP16 was added during assembly, the Gal4-VP16 was added to the DNA-core histone-S-190 mix. When Gal4-VP16 was added after assembly, the activator was added 4.5 h after the initiation of the assembly reaction (which was complete within 4 h), and the resulting mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min prior to further analysis. In each experiment, all of the samples were assembled for the same amount of time and analyzed in a parallel fashion. The periodicity of the nucleosome arrays and the efficiency of chromatin assembly were tested by micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis (with the requirement that we observed at least 7, but typically 9 to 12, repeats) and by DNA supercoiling analysis in the presence of 1.6 μm chloroquine, as described previously (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar, 43Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). The chromatin assembly process was consistent in the presence or the absence of an activator as well as with different plasmid constructions. The presence of histone H1 increased the repeat length from approximately 170 to approximately 200 bp and caused a slight reduction in the extent of DNA supercoiling, as expected from the increase in the repeat length. Chromatin was transcribed with aDrosophila nuclear extract (SNF), as described previously (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 43Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). A mixture of buffer, ribonucleoside triphosphates, and extract was added to duplicate aliquots of assembled chromatin (each containing 75 ng of DNA). The transcripts were detected by primer extension analysis, and the data were quantitated with a Fuji BAS1000 phosphoimager and MacBAS software. The transcription reactions for pGIE-n plasmids were analyzed with the E4 primer (5′-CTTCACAGCGGCAGCCTAACAGTCAGCC), whereas the transcription reactions for the G5min plasmids were analyzed with the M13 reverse sequencing primer (5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA), except for those carried out with the jockey promoter, with which the Joc primer (5′-CTCGCGACTTCTGTGAACACGTCCACTC) was used. To ensure reproducibility of the data, all experiments were carried out a minimum of two (but typically, several) independent times. The translational positioning of nucleosomes was determined by subjecting chromatin to indirect end-labeling analysis (44Nedospasov S.A. Georgiev G.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 45Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) in the absence of transcription extract, as described previously (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 43Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). Chromatin or naked DNA was digested with micrococcal nuclease, and the DNA (125 ng for each sample) was deproteinized and then digested with BglII andAlwNI. Southern blot analysis of the resulting DNA fragments with probes that hybridize to either end of the region yielded approximately the same locations of the nucleosomes (data not shown). Although the rearrangement of nucleosome positioning was readily detectable by this indirect end-labeling analysis with either one or five Gal4 sites, the disruption of the regularity of the nucleosome array, as revealed by the micrococcal nuclease ladder disruption assay (which reveals changes in nucleosome periodicity within specific regions of chromatin; for example, see Refs. 20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 46Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), was observed with five Gal4 sites but not with one Gal4 site (data not shown). These results suggest that the periodicity of the array is not significantly disrupted by the binding of a single Gal4-VP16 dimer (see also Ref.47Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The presence of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was detected by primer extension footprinting (48Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3078-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in the absence of transcription extract, as described (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 43Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Chromatin was digested with DNase I and deproteinized, and the DNA fragments (62 ng) were subjected to a single round of primer extension with Vent (exo–) polymerase (New England Biolabs) and AMP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.01% w/v gelatin, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100). Treatment of chromatin with apyrase was carried out as described (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We first examined the extent to which the binding affinity of Gal4-VP16 to chromatin is affected by the packaging of DNA into chromatin that is reconstituted with the S-190 assembly extract. In earlier experiments with either mononucleosome or polynucleosome templates, the packaging of DNA into chromatin has been generally observed to cause a substantial reduction in the affinity of binding of Gal4 derivatives to DNA (reviewed in Refs. 10Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 13Peterson C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, and 49Workman J.L. Buchman A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For instance, in the biochemical analysis of chromatin templates that were prepared by the ATP-independent deposition of histones with a heat-treated Xenopus egg extract (containing nucleoplasmin and N1/N2), it was found that the binding of Gal4-AH (which has the same Gal4 DNA binding region as Gal4-VP16) is strongly inhibited by nucleosomes (∼100-fold inhibition with a single Gal4 site and ∼10-fold inhibition with five Gal4 sites (50Taylor I.C.A. Workman J.L. Scheutz T.J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)). Because we were using nucleosome arrays assembled with ATP-utilizing factors that are likely to be involved in the physiological assembly process (for discussion of ATP-dependent versus ATP-independent histone deposition processes, see Ref. 51Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we felt that we might potentially observe different properties of Gal4-VP16 binding than those seen previously with either mononucleosomes or with polynucleosomes obtained by the ATP-independent deposition of histones. To this end, we carried out a primer extension DNase I footprinting analysis of preassembled chromatin templates containing a single Gal4 binding site. In these experiments, the promoter constructions were assembled into chromatin by using the S-190 extract in conjunction with purified core histones and histone H1 (22Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar). (Chromatin assembled with the S-190 extract has been shown to resemble bulk native chromatin by several criteria, which include micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis and electron microscopy (22Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar).) Then, Gal4-VP16 (at the indicated concentrations) was added to the preassembled chromatin (in the continued presence of the S-190 extract), and the samples were subjected to DNase I footprinting analysis. In parallel, non-chromatin (naked DNA) templates were also tested. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the affinity of Gal4-VP16 to chromatin templates containing a single consensus Gal4 binding site is nearly as high as the affinity of Gal4-VP16 to the corresponding naked DNA templates. These results indicate that the packaging of DNA into nucleosome arrays, under identical conditions that strongly repress (>100-fold) basal transcription (Ref. 20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar; also see later in this work), leads to only a slight (about 2-fold) reduction in the affinity of template binding by Gal4-VP16. To see whether these effects were specific for the synthetic Gal4 site, we additionally tested the binding of Gal4-VP16 to a natural Gal4 site that is located upstream of the S. cerevisiae MEL1 gene (40Vashee S. Xu H. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24699-24706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, we similarly found a slight reduction in the affinity of Gal4-VP16 binding to chromatin relative to naked DNA (Fig. 1 B). These findings suggest that Gal4-VP16 binds with comparable affinity to naked DNA or to chromatin that is assembled with the S-190 extract. It was possible, however, that ATP-dependent nucleosome mobilization factors, which were present in the chromatin assembly extract, might have been able to remodel the chromatin in a manner that facilitates the binding of Gal4-VP16 to the nucleosomal templates. To test this hypothesis, we assembled chromatin with the S-190 extract and then treated the samples with the ATPase, apyrase, prior to the binding of Gal4-VP16 and DNase I footprinting analysis. (In earlier experiments, we had found that Gal4-VP16 at 200 nmconcentration was able to bind to five tandem Gal4 sites in chromatin after apyrase treatment (20Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but those experiments did not address the effect of ATP depletion upon the binding affinity.) As shown in Fig. 1(right panels), we found that the hydrolysis of ATP by apyrase does not affect the affinity of Gal4-VP16 binding either to a single synthetic Gal4 site or to the natural Gal4 site from theMEL1 gene with chromatin templates. Thus, these experiments indicate that Gal4-VP16 can bind to a single site in chromatin in the absence of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities with an affinity comparable with that for its binding to naked DNA. To test whether the presence of multiple binding sites leads to cooperative binding, we examined the binding of Gal4-VP16 to chromatin with one or five Gal4 sites. Consistent with the single site data (Fig.1), the relative DNA binding affinity of Gal4-VP16 to a single Gal4 site is approximately the same whether the factor is added to naked DNA prior to chromatin assembly, to preassembled chromatin, or to preassembled chromatin that had been treated with apyrase (Fig.2 A). With five tandem Gal4 sites, essentially the same results were seen (Fig. 2 B). (Note that the concentration of Gal4-VP16 that is needed for a complete footprint of the template containing five Gal4 sites ishigher than that required for a comparable footprint of the template containing one Gal4 site. Because the concentration of Gal4 binding sites approaches the Gal4 dissociation constant in these experiments, a greater amount of Gal4-VP16 is needed to occupy five Gal sites per template relative to a single site per template (for example, see Ref. 52Limbird L.E. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. Martinus Nijhof Publishing, Boston1986: 73Google Scholar).) Thus, these experiments indicate that the use of five tandem Gal4 sites does not provide any additional advantage, relative to the use of a single Gal4 site, for the binding of Gal4-VP16 to preassembled chromatin in the presence or absence of apyrase. These results thus collectively indicate that Gal4-VP16 can bind readily to transcriptionally repressed chromatin that is reconstituted via an ATP-dependent assembly process, even upon hydrolysis of the ATP by apyrase. Because we observed high affinity binding of Gal4-VP16 to a single Gal4 site in chromatin (Figs.1 and 2), we sought to examine whether a single Gal4-VP16 protomer would be sufficient to achieve transcriptional activation with preassembled chromatin templates. It was possible, for instance, that synergistic interactions between chromatin-bound Gal4-VP16 activation domains are required to achieve strong transcriptional activation.
