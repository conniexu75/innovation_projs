https://openalex.org/W2050998289,"A unique post-translational modification of tubulin has previously been described in which a tyrosine residue is reversibly added to the C terminus of the alpha-tubulin subunit. We have prepared peptide antibodies that specifically react (shown by competitive immunoassay and Western blots) with the tyrosinated (Tyr) and nontyrosinated (Glu) forms of alpha-tubulin. Immunofluorescence with these antibodies demonstrated that the distributions of Tyr and Glu tubulin in fixed cells were markedly different. Tyr tubulin was found throughout the interphase network of microtubules and in the metaphase spindle, whereas Glu tubulin was present in a limited subset of interphase microtubules and was absent from the astral fibers of the metaphase spindle. Double immunofluorescence showed that Glu and Tyr microtubules comprised distinct subsets of the total cellular microtubules. These results suggest that tyrosination is involved in the establishment of separate populations of microtubules that may functionally distinct."

Three efficiency classes were characterized:high (T/G, C/A and G/G); intermediate (A/A); and low (G/A, A/G, T/T, C/C, C/T and T/C). Methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair was lost completely for any type of mismatch in strains carrying either mutL or mutS mutations. Data obtained with a mutH mutant suggest that this locus is involved in methyl-dependent DNA strand discrimination. A functional correlation is suggested between the differential repair efficiencies and the frequencies of the corresponding replication errors."

The interaction between the acidic polypeptide and the anionic carbohydrate suggests a mechanism that is independent of ion exchange. Monoclonal antibodies to purified bovine ECGF inhibited the biological activity of ECGF in crude preparations of bovine brain. These data indicate that ECGF is the principal mitogen for endothelial cells from bovine brain, that heparin affinity chromatography may be used to purify and concentrate ECGF, and that the affinity of ECGF for heparin may have structural and perhaps biological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2007619188,"Nuclei of amphibian oocytes contain large amounts of actin, mostly in unpolymerized or short-polymer form. When antibodies to actin or actin-binding proteins (fragmin and the actin modulator from mammalian smooth muscle) are injected into nuclei of living oocytes of Pleurodeles waltlii, transcription of the lampbrush chromosomes, but not of the rRNA genes, is inhibited. When transcription is repressed by drugs or RNA is digested by microinjection of RNAase into oocyte nuclei, an extensive meshwork of actin filament bundles is seen in association with the isolated lampbrush chromosomes. These observations indicate a close relationship between the state of nuclear actin and transcriptional activity and suggest that nuclear actin may be involved in transcriptional events concerning protein-coding genes."
https://openalex.org/W1506260722,"Heat shock at 45 degrees C virtually abolishes protein synthesis in HeLa cells, but return to 37 degrees C effects a complete recovery and the concomitant synthesis of heat shock-induced proteins. Heat shock induces polysome disaggregation, indicating initiation is principally inhibited. In vitro assays for initiation factor activities reveal heat shock inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), eIF-(3 + 4F), and eIF-4B. Immunoblot analyses show that eIF-2 alpha and eIF-2 beta become modified during heat shock, and eIF-4B variants disappear. Upon return to 37 degrees C, these alterations reverse. The modifications of eIF-2 alpha and eIF-4B are due to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. Enzymatic activities induced by heat shock inhibit protein synthesis and modify initiation factors in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Initiation factor modifications may contribute to, or cause, protein synthesis inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2082205973,"S. cerevisiae contains a family of genes related to the major heat shock induced gene of Drosophila (Hsp70). Two members of this family, YG100 and YG102, are 97% identical to each other in their protein coding regions. RNA transcribed from YG100 increases markedly after a heat shock, while transcripts of YG102 increase minimally. Mutants of the two genes were constructed in vitro and substituted in the yeast genome in place of the wild-type alleles. No phenotypic effect of single mutations of either gene was detected. However, cells containing both the YG100 and YG102 mutations grew slowly at 30 degrees C and could not form colonies at 37 degrees C. The temperature sensitive phenotype can be overcome by inserting either an intact YG100 or YG102 gene into the genome. Pretreatment at 37 degrees C before shift to a normally lethal temperature of 51 degrees C protected the double mutant as well as the wild type, indicating that YG100 and YG102 gene products are not needed for resistance to high temperatures for short periods."

https://openalex.org/W1503984718,"The kinetics of 125I-insulin binding and physiological activity of insulin on glial cells cultured from brains of 1-day-old rats have been studied. Binding of 125I-insulin to cultured glial cells was specific, reversible, and time-dependent. Porcine and chicken insulin competed equally for 125I-insulin binding while other hormones or insulin analogs competed in proportion to their insulin-like biological activity. Incubation of glial cultures with insulin resulted in a time- and dose-dependent stimulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake. Maximal stimulation (190% of control) was observed with 18 nM insulin, and 0.1 nM insulin caused half-maximum effect. The stimulatory effect of insulin on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was due to its effect on Vmax without affecting the Km. These observations suggest that insulin stimulates glucose uptake in glial cells cultured from rat brain, the effect mediated by insulin specific receptors."

The case fatality rate was higher for patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella (4.2 percent) than for those with antimicrobial-sensitive infections (0.2 percent).

https://openalex.org/W1973986115,"The twitcher mouse is an animal model of galactosylceramidase deficiency (Krabbe's disease), a human sphingolipidosis. The effects of hematopoietic cell transplantation as potential enzyme replacement therapy were examined in the twitcher mouse. Survival in twitcher mice with transplants was significantly prolonged and was associated with gradual repair of demyelination in peripheral nerves. In contrast, there was no improvement in the neurodegenerative process in the central nervous system after transplantation. These observations indicate that cellular transplantation may effectively provide in vivo enzyme replacement for the peripheral manifestations of genetic storage diseases. Strategies to perturb the blood-brain barrier may be necessary for enzyme replacement to be therapeutic in diseases with central nervous system manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W1973295477,"When the intracellular transit of 3H-labeled (pro)-insulin polypeptides is perturbed by monensin in the pancreatic B-cell, proinsulin conversion is impaired and the radioactive peptides accumulate in a clathrin-coated membrane compartment related to the Golgi apparatus. Clathrin was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry using the postembedding protein A-gold technique. The coated compartment, which is dilated by monensin, comprises Golgi cisternae with condensing secretory material and newly formed secretory granules; under monensin block, the noncoated (storage) secretory granules do not become significantly labeled. These data suggest that an unperturbed passage through a Golgi-related, clathrin-coated membrane compartment which subsequently matures into noncoated secretory granules is needed for the normal processing of (pro)insulin polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1545247716,"The effect of GTP analogs and Mg on the structure of Ns and Ni, the stimulatory and inhibitory regulatory components of adenylyl cyclase, were studied in a comparative manner. Both N proteins, which are alpha beta gamma heterotrimers that differ in their alpha subunits, when exposed to GTP analogs underwent a Mg-dependent conformational change that was not dependent on subunit dissociation. This was seen both as change in sedimentation behavior at 4 degrees C from 4 S to about 3 S and by a property of the new conformation to retain guanine nucleotide tightly bound to it. Warming to 32 degrees C promoted subunit dissociation, each protein giving a mixture of 2 S alpha G and 2 S beta gamma complexes. For both Ns and Ni, these reactions were reversible: 2 S complexes of Ns and Ni associated to 3 S forms on cooling to 4 degrees C, provided the Mg concentration was at or below 10 mM and detergent concentration was below 1%, and the 3 S complexes of these proteins reverted to 4 S forms and released the nucleotide in the cold on chelation of free Mg with EDTA. Reconstitution assays with Ns-deficient membranes from cyc- S49 lymphoma cells revealed that the 3 S form of Ns is a pre-active form of the protein. The scheme below summarizes these findings, where G represents a guanine nucleotide. (Formula: see text) Ns and Ni differ in that more Mg is necessary to promote the 4 S to 3 S conversion of Ns than of Ni, and in that both the 2 S to 3 S to 4 S conversions proceeded more readily with Ni than with of Ns. Mg could not be shown to promote subunit dissociation. The above scheme is suggested as a plausible description of the reaction sequence leading from an unactivated to an activated N protein."
https://openalex.org/W1605613803,"Monoclonal antibody (Mab) 9.2.27 was utilized in a combination of biosynthetic and biochemical investigations as an immunological probe for the study of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSP) in human melanoma cells. Pulse-chase and long-term intrinsic labeling immunoprecipitation experiments combined with the biosynthetic inhibitors monensin, cycloheximide, and paranitrophenol-beta-D-xyloside all suggest that Mab 9.2.27 recognizes a set of glycoprotein molecules ranging to a 250-kDa glycoprotein which serves as the core glycoprotein for CSP in human melanoma cells. Peptide maps comparing the 250-kDa and CSP molecule verify that the 250-kDa glycoprotein is the CSP core protein in human melanoma cells. Further studies document that the CSP released by melanoma cells and recognized by Mab 9.2.27 contains (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-beta-4-O-sulfo-D-galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-beta-6-O-sulfo-D-galactose saccharides and this CSP can interact with hyaluronic acid-Sepharose. Topographical studies indicate that this CSP has pericellular punctuated distribution on the melanoma cell surface and may play a role in cell-substrate interactions in the biology of metastatic human melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1548648922,"Responses of Escherichia coli to chemical stimuli are mediated by a family of sensory transducer proteins. These transmembrane proteins detect stimuli and convey sensory information to the flagella. Behavioral adaptation to environmental changes is correlated with the reversible methylation of the transducer proteins on several (4 to 6) specific glutamic acid residues to form methyl esters. We have assayed the activity of the chemotaxis-specific methylesterase, the product of the cheB gene, by measuring the product of the demethylation reaction, methanol, using a modification of a previous method (Toews, M.L., Goy, M.F., Springer, M.S., and Adler, J. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 5544-5548; Terwilliger, T.C., Bogonez, E., Wang, E.A., and Koshland, D. E., Jr. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9608-9611). In this study, we establish the use of a sensitive flow apparatus for measuring stimulus-induced changes in methylesterase activity of intact E. coli cells. Responses to positive and negative stimuli consist of transient decrease and increases in methylesterase activity, respectively. In addition, chase experiments demonstrated that all assayable methyl groups are nearly equivalent. The results are not consistent with the view that the methyl groups put on the transducer proteins as a result of a positive stimulus are the first to be removed when that stimulus is withdrawn. It seems more likely that recently added methyl groups become part of a pool of kinetically equivalent members, any of which can be removed when the stimulus is withdrawn. The flow measurements provide a powerful and simple biochemical assay that complements behavioral studies of chemotaxis."

After a variable lag phase during which residual traces of O2 are removed, the reversible activation is exponential. The extent of activation is dependent on pH and the redox potential of the incubation medium. A tentative model based on the existence of a monoelectronic redox center is proposed as shown in the following equation: (formula; see text) The potential of this redox couple was determined to be -310 mV (pH = 7; T = 298 K) versus the normal hydrogen electrode."
https://openalex.org/W1642041575,"The first committed reaction in the biosynthesis of creatine is catalyzed by the enzyme L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase, commonly called transamidinase. Creatine, the end product of the biosynthetic pathway, is known to alter the levels of kidney transamidinase activity. Rats fed a diet containing 0.3% creatine had 26% of the kidney transamidinase activity of the rats fed a creatine-free diet. This reduction in transamidinase activity was correlated with a decrease in transamidinase protein in the creatine-fed rats. The relative synthetic rates and mRNA functional activities of transmidinase were measured in control and creatine-fed rats. The relative synthetic rate of transamidinase in creatine-fed rats was 21% of that found in the control animals. The functional transamidinase mRNA in creatine-fed rats was correspondingly reduced to 37% of the amount in the control animals. Thus, creatine affects transamidinase activity by altering its rate of synthesis at a pretranslational step and represents an example of end-product repression in a higher eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W1643496944,"A monoclonal antibody, 2B6, has been prepared against the embryonic myosin heavy chain of rat skeletal muscle. On solid phase radioimmunoassay, 2B6 shows specificity to myosin isozymes known to contain the embryonic myosin heavy chain and on immunoblots of denatured contractile proteins and on competitive radioimmunoassay, it reacts only with the myosin heavy chain of embryonic myosin and not with the myosin heavy chain of neonatal or adult fast and slow myosin isozymes or with other contractile or noncontractile proteins. This specificity is maintained with cat, dog, guinea pig, and human myosins, but not with chicken myosins. 2B6 was used to define which isozymes in the developing animal contained the embryonic myosin heavy chain and to characterize the changes in embryonic myosin heavy chain in fast versus slow muscles during development. Finally, 2B6 was used to demonstrate that thyroid hormone hastens the disappearance of embryonic myosin heavy chain during development, while hypothyroidism retards its decrease. This confirmed our previous conclusion that thyroid hormones orchestrate changes in isozymes during development."
https://openalex.org/W1633401484,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in Clostridium formicoaceticum has been purified to a specific activity of 140 mumol min-1 mg-1 when assayed at 37 degrees C, pH 7.2, in the direction of oxidation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate with benzyl viologen as electron acceptor. The purified enzyme is judged to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide disc-gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. The enzyme which is an octamer has a molecular weight of about 237,000 and consists of four each of two different subunits having the molecular weights 26,000 and 35,000. The octameric enzyme contains per mol 15.2 +/- 0.3 iron, 2.3 +/- 0.2 zinc, 19.5 +/- 1.3 acid-labile sulfur, and 1.7 FAD. The UV-visible absorbance spectrum has a peak at 385 nm and a shoulder at 430 nm and is that of a flavoprotein containing iron-sulfur centers. The reductase, which is sensitive to oxygen, must be handled anaerobically and is stabilized by 2 mM dithionite. It catalyzes the reduction of methylene blue, menadione, benzyl viologen, rubredoxin, and FAD with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and the oxidation of reduced ferredoxin and FADH2 with 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. No activity was observed with pyridine nucleotides. It is suggested that the physiologically important reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is the reduced ferredoxin-dependent reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate."

The unprocessed precursor and the mature form of the lipoprotein are quantitatively recovered in the precipitate. The signal peptide, from the acetone supernatant utilizing the purified signal peptidase, contains labeled methionine at its NH2 terminus and has Mr = 2200 (S.E. = 69). A specific signal peptidase that processes the modified form of Braun's prolipoprotein to its correct mature form has been purified.

https://openalex.org/W1526102850,"The ssb-1 gene encoding a mutant single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB-1) has been cloned into a vector placing its expression under lambda pL regulation. This construction results in more than 100-fold increased expression of the mutant protein following temperature induction. Tryptic peptide analysis of the mutant protein by high-pressure liquid chromatography and solid-phase protein sequencing has shown that the ssb-1 mutation results in these substitution of tyrosine for histidine at residue 55 of SSB. This change could only occur in one step by a C—-T transition in the DNA sequence which has been confirmed. Physicochemical studies of the homogeneous mutant protein have shown that in contrast to that of the wild-type SSB, the tetrameric structure of SSB-1 is unstable and gradually dissociates to monomer as the protein concentration is decreased from about 10 microM to less than 0.5 microM. The SSB-1 tetramer appears to be stable to elevated temperature (45 degrees C) but the monomer is not. We estimate the normal cellular concentration of SSB-1 (single chromosomal gene) to be 0.5-1 microM. Thus, there is a plausible physical explanation for our previous finding that increased expression of ssb-1 reverses the effects of a single gene (chromosomal) copy amount of SSB-1 (Chase, J.W., Murphy, J.B., Whittier, R.F., Lorensen, E., and Sninsky, J.J. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 164, 193-211). However, even though the in vivo effects of ssb-1 and most of the in vitro defects of SSB-1 protein are reversed simply by increasing SSB-1 protein concentration, the mutant protein is not as effective a helix-destabilizing protein as wild-type SSB as measured by its ability to lower the thermal melting transition of poly[d-(A-T)]."
https://openalex.org/W1563568335,"We have analyzed the kinetics of maturation for certain bacterial envelope proteins in Escherichia coli strains that are also concomitantly producing an export-defective protein. Our data indicate that proteins with defective signal peptides, rendered nonfunctional by either point mutation or deletion, interfere with the normal export of other envelope proteins. Expression of interference requires that the interfering protein: (i) exhibit a major export defect; (ii) be synthesized at a high rate; and (iii) be actively synthesized at the time interference is being measured. The latter data suggest that interference is a cotranslational process. Intragenic or extragenic suppression of the export defect exhibited by the interfering protein relieves interference in a manner that is directly related to strength of suppression. These and additional data suggest that interference occurs at a very early step in the secretory process. We interpret these results to indicate that proteins with defective signal peptides are still recognized as proteins destined for secretion and are, therefore, at least transiently incorporated into the cell's secretory pathway. The incorporation of an export-defective protein into the secretory pathway disrupts the normal protein traffic from the cytoplasm to the various extracellular compartments."

https://openalex.org/W1571312817,"The folded 10 S conformation of turkey gizzard myosin is more resistant to proteolysis by papain than the extended 6 S conformation. These findings confirm those of Onishi and Watanabe (Onishi, H., and Watanabe, S. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 95, 899-902). In addition, we suggest that the effect of phosphorylation on heavy-chain digestion by papain is related to the dependence of conformation on phosphorylation and not to a direct effect of phosphorylation itself. Proteolysis by Staphylococcus aureus protease and trypsin also is slower for 10 S compared to the 6 S conformation. Heavy chain hydrolysis by alpha-chymotrypsin is not dependent on myosin conformation. Filamentous myosin and heavy meromyosin are more resistant to papain proteolysis in the dephosphorylated compared to the phosphorylated states. The different sensitivities to proteolysis probably are caused by changes in the subfragment 1-subfragment 2 region of the molecule rather than at the heavy meromyosin-light meromyosin junction. These changes are induced as part of the 6 S-10 S transition and occur in monomeric and filamentous myosin and in heavy meromyosin. These more subtle alterations in the head-neck junctions of the molecule may be more important in modifying myosin enzymatic activity than the actual interaction of the tail and neck regions of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1594849497,"Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and the two diastereoisomers of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (GTP beta S) were prepared enzymatically, and their interactions with tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonate, 0.5 mM MgCl2 were examined. GTP gamma S did not support microtubule assembly but instead inhibited the reaction. This analog was 1.5-2 times more potent than GDP in inhibiting both tubulin polymerization and GTP hydrolysis under conditions in which these reactions were dependent on MAPs. In contrast to the analog's inhibitory effects on polymerization and hydrolysis, however, radiolabeled GTP gamma S was only feebly bound by purified tubulin at 0 degrees C relative to the binding of GDP and GTP. There was a marked increase in the amount of GTP gamma S bound when the reaction temperature was raised to 37 degrees C or when MAPs were included in the reaction mixture. Only when both MAPs were present and the higher reaction temperature was used did the binding of GTP gamma S exceed that of GDP. Since substitution of sulfur for oxygen in a molecule should decrease its hydrophilic properties, these findings suggest that the exchangeable nucleotide binding site of tubulin becomes more hydrophobic at higher temperatures and in the presence of MAPs. The two isomers of GTP beta S were able to support MAP-dependent polymerization, although a 50-100-fold higher concentration of the analogs as compared to GTP was required. Neither isomer of GTP beta S had a significant inhibitory effect on GTP hydrolysis dependent on tubulin + MAPs."

Histidine increased the initial rate of uptake and the steady level of accumulation of arginine. When the vesicles were preloaded with histidine in the absence of ATP and diluted, transient uptake of arginine took place with concomitant downhill efflux of histidine from the vesicles. Kinetic examination indicated the existence of a unique transport system which catalyzed exchange of 1 mol of arginine outside with 1 mol of histidine inside the vacuolar membrane. The Ktentry for arginine and the Ktexit for histidine were determined to be 0.1 and 1.1 mM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1490102044,"We have previously reported that prolonged incubations of Fao cells, a cell line derived from the well-differentiated Reuber H35 rat hepatoma, with 10(-6) M insulin, induced a decrease in receptor number (down-regulation), an increase in receptor affinity for insulin, and a loss of insulin's biological effect (desensitization). In the present study, we have investigated the relationship between these changes in insulin binding and action and changes in the structure of the insulin receptor. Intact cells were surface labeled with Na125I and lactoperoxidase, and the 125I-labeled insulin receptor was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies and analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography of gels done under reducing conditions demonstrated the alpha (Mr = 135,000) and the beta (Mr = 95,000) subunits of the receptor. In nonreduced gels, free insulin receptor subunits were observed as well as four higher molecular weight bands with Mr = 210,000, 270,000, 350,000, and 520,000. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that these bands correspond to alpha-beta heterodimer, alpha 2 homodimer, and two alpha-beta oligomers of high molecular weights, respectively. Cross-linking of 125I-insulin to intact cells with disuccinimidyl suberate revealed bands of Mr = 125,000, 210,000, 250,000 and 320,000, indicating that most of the forms of the receptor could bind insulin. After incubation with 10(-6) M insulin for 24 h, Fao cells revealed a marked decrease of the four oligomeric forms of the receptor, with little change in the level of the free alpha and beta subunits. A similar decrease of the oligomeric forms of the insulin receptor and an increase in the free subunits was observed when normal Fao cells are treated with 7 mM dithiothreitol. In dithiothreitol-treated cells, 125I-insulin binding was increased and this increase was accounted for by a change in affinity. In contrast to Fao cells, down-regulation of the insulin receptor in IM-9 lymphocytes occurs without a change in receptor affinity. In these cells, surface labeling revealed a decrease in total receptors after down-regulation, but not change in the proportion of the oligomeric forms to the free subunits of the receptor. These data suggest the following in Fao hepatoma cells. In the native state, the insulin receptor consists of free alpha and beta subunits and several kinds of disulfide-linked oligomers of these subunits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1507229452,"Scanning transmission electron microscopy of individual unfixed molecules of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase has been used to determine the molecular mass distribution of the protein. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which has a subunit molecular mass of 77 kilodaltons, was found to exist predominantly as a dimer with an apparent molecular mass of 136 +/- 29 kilodaltons. The mass distribution of the enzyme molecules was unchanged in the presence of the allosteric inhibitor S-adenosylmethionine. Examination of negatively stained protein molecules suggested that each subunit of the dimer consists of two globular domains of approximately equal size. Limited proteolysis of the enzyme by trypsin gave results which were entirely consistent with the presence of two domains per subunit. In the presence of 1% trypsin, the enzyme was cleaved into two fragments. The masses of these fragments were 39 and 36 kilodaltons as assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Tryptic cleavage did not lead to loss of NADPH-menadione or NADPH-methylenetetrahydrofolate oxidoreductase activity, and the flavin prosthetic group remained bound to the protein. However, the cleaved protein was completely desensitized with respect to inhibition by S-adenosylmethionine. These results suggest that each subunit of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase contains two domains and that allosteric inhibition requires specific interactions between these domains. The region between these two domains appears to be very sensitive to proteolysis, while the domains themselves are relatively resistant to further degradation."

Under reducing conditions, the enzyme dissociates into subunits of 15,000 and 12,000-14,000 daltons. The 15,000-dalton subunit contains the enzyme active site as determined by labeling with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate.

The enzyme exhibited a pH optimum of 8.0. The metal ions, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ were reversible inhibitors and diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride irreversible inhibitors of enzymatic activity.

At pH 7.5, the membrane potential (delta psi) in S. typhimurium changed from -162 +/- 13 to -111 +/- 15 mV when cells grown aerobically were made anaerobic, and it returned to the original value when the cells were returned to aerobiosis. The delta pH across the membrane was zero. At pH 5.5, delta psi was -70 mV in aerobiosis and -20 mV in anaerobiosis, and delta pH was -118 and -56 mV for aerobic and anaerobic cells, respectively. A decrease in delta p resulted in increased tumbling, and an increase in delta p resulted in a smooth swimming response at either pH. Inhibition of aerotaxis at pH 7.5 by various concentrations of KCN correlated with a decreased delta p, due to a decreased delta psi in aerobiosis and little change in delta psi in anaerobiosis. At concentrations up to 100 mM, 2,4-dinitrophenol decreased delta psi, but did not inhibit aerotaxis because the difference between delta psi in aerobic and anaerobic cells remained constant.

To perform these functions, the system is stringently regulated, although the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms have not been established. A potential target for this type of regulation is the first protein in the phosphotransfer sequence, Enzyme I, which catalyzes the following reaction: P-enolpyruvate + Enzyme I Mg2+ in equilibrium phospho-I + pyruvate. We reported previously that Enzyme I from Salmonella typhimurium consists of identical subunits which associate in a temperature-dependent manner; the mode of association was found to be either monomer-dimer or isodesmic. The association reaction has now been investigated by analytical gel chromatography at 8, 11, and 23 degrees C. At each temperature, the mode of association was strictly monomer-dimer. The apparent association equilibrium constant, K'a, increased dramatically with temperature, with an enthalpy of 54.8 +/- 6.3 kcal/mol. At 23 degrees C, K'a decreased slightly when the enzyme solution contained either Mg2+ or phosphoenolpyruvate. However, when both ligands were present, i.e. under conditions where Enzyme I is phosphorylated, K'a decreased significantly (25-fold at 11 degrees C and 50-fold at 23 degrees C). These results are in accord with a model for the action of Enzyme I which involves a cycle of association and dissociation. This model has potentially important implications for regulating Enzyme I and the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system."

Fibroblasts isolated from keloid tissue have an unusual glucocorticoid response; they are hyporesponsive with regard to proliferation and collagen production but hyperresponsive with regard to the induction of System A amino acid transport (Russell, J. D., Russell, S. B., and Trupin, K. M. (1978) J. Cell. Physiol. 97, 221-229; Russell, S. B., Russell, J. D., and Trupin, J. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9525-9531). We show here that despite these differences, the glucocorticoid receptors of keloid cells do not differ from those of normal dermal fibroblasts in steroid specificity, dissociation constant (Kd), total number of binding sites (Bmax), or nuclear binding of glucocorticoid-receptor complexes. A single glucocorticoid binding species of molecular weight 93,000 was found in both cell types. A monolayer assay for glucocorticoid receptor binding is described which facilitates analysis of multiple strains of cultured cells. This assay gives the same specificity and dissociation constants as the conventional cytosol assay, but it is more sensitive. The magnitude of induction of System A amino acid transport was found to be directly proportional to glucocorticoid receptor occupancy in both keloid-derived and normal fibroblasts. This induction requires serum, which can be replaced with 1 nM insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1488127556,"Kinetic data for the 6'-aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme, AAC(6')-4, also named kanamycin acetyltransferase, have been collected for six aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin C1a, kanamycin A, neomycin B, sisomicin, and tobramycin) and three coenzymes (acetyl-CoA, n-propionyl-CoA, and n-butyryl-CoA). The initial velocity pattern using acetyl-CoA favors a ping-pong kinetic mechanism (Kia = -0.34 +/- 0.34 microM), but the pattern using n-propionyl-CoA supports a sequential one (Kia = 2.7 +/- 0.8 microM). Kinetic analyses using alternative substrates confirm the sequential mechanism and, moreover, clearly identify a random order of addition of antibiotic and coenzyme because V/K values of antibiotics varied 40-fold as the identity of the coenzyme was changed and V/K values of coenzyme varied 13-fold as the identity of the antibiotic was changed. One or both sets of values would have remained unchanged if the mechanism were either ordered sequential or ping-pong. Combining these results with structure-activity data which argue for a rapid rate of release of substrates and products relative to the rate of enzymatic turnover (Radika, K., and Northrop, D. B. (1984) Biochemistry 25, in press) establishes the kinetic mechanism as rapid equilibrium random sequential."

https://openalex.org/W2059720646,"Although most medical educators believe that education, research, and patient care are inseparable and essential to their academic mission, the educational component of this triad has never been given adequate, earmarked support. To fund educational programs, medical centers first relied on research grants and later on third-party payments intended for patient care. However, research money has long since ceased to be available for other purposes and recent federal cost containment measures have started to reduce payments for patient care. Teaching hospitals are threatened with loss of support not only for education, but for their capital improvements and care of the poor. Many institutions are now hoping to generate new income through business deals with for-profit health care corporations, but this effort probably will also fail and may compromise professional traditions. Teaching hospitals serve the public interest and will have to depend, at least in part, on public subsidy of their unavoidable extra costs."
https://openalex.org/W1584483536,"The kinetic mechanism of Pseudomonas cepacia salicylate hydroxylase has been examined by steady state initial rate measurements, and stopped flow and equilibrium studies. Results indicate that salicylate and NADH bind to the hydroxylase randomly. The enzyme is reduced and NAD+ is released. Oxygen subsequently binds to the reduced enzyme . substrate complex, leading to the production of hydroxylated product, CO2, and water. Based on results of anaerobic rapid mixing experiments, the rate of enzyme reduction by NADH is enhanced 290- and 240-fold when the hydroxylase is complexed with salicylate and benzoate (a nonsubstrate effector), respectively. Salicylate enhances, whereas benzoate slightly weakens, the NADH binding to the enzyme. Primary isotope effects were observed with (4R)-[4-2H]- and (4R)-[4-3H]NADH but not with the (4S)-[4-2H]NADH. Using varying concentrations of benzoate, the pattern of tritium isotope effect on Vm/Km, T(V/K), also indicates that benzoate and NADH bind to the enzyme randomly. The intrinsic isotope effects, Dk, of (4R)-[4-2H]NADH on the reduction of enzyme . salicylate and enzyme . benzoate complexes were found to be 5.57 and 5.96, respectively. The former is much repressed but the latter is only slightly so in the expression of their corresponding deuterium isotope effects on Vm, DV. Furthermore, values of DV (1.69 to 5.07) show a rough correlation with the extents of uncoupling of substrate hydroxylation and H2O2 formation activities for a series of benzenoid effectors. These results indicate that relative to the step of enzyme reduction, the subsequent reaction(s) leading to H2O2 formation must be fast whereas that for substrate hydroxylation contains at least one slow step."

The elevated concentrations of these substances in blood are accompanied by a decrease in blood glucose concentration and release of growth hormone, which is followed by increased tumor growth.

https://openalex.org/W1501956236,"Escherichia coli K1 synthesizes a polysialic acid capsule when grown at 37 but not 15 degrees C. The derangement in sialyl polymer synthesis appears to result from the inability of 15 degrees C membranes to synthesize or assemble a functional endogenous acceptor (Troy, F.A., and McCloskey, M.A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7377-7387). Membranes from cells grown at 15 degrees C spontaneously gained the ability to synthesize sialyl polymer after incubation at 33 degrees C for 2-4 h. The incubation-dependent activation of the endogenous synthesis of sialyl polymer in 15 degrees C membranes possessed two unusual features. First, the sialyltransferase was localized in a low density vesicle fraction (LDV; rho = 1.11 g/cm3). Second, this fraction catalyzed protein synthesis, and protein synthesis was required for activation. A study of the LDV fraction showed: 1) their light density resulted from a 5- to 8-fold enrichment in lipid phosphate to protein ratio and their sialyltransferase activity was enriched 40-fold compared with unfractionated total membranes; 2) they contained proteins characteristic of inner and outer membranes including leader peptidase and lipoprotein; 3) they constituted 8% of the mass of unfractionated total membranes yet contained all of the endogenous sialyltransferase activity in 15 degrees C membranes. In contrast, LDV from 37 degrees C grown cells accounted for 4.8% of the membrane mass and only 12.5% of the endogenous sialyltransferase activity; 4) they were multilamellar and averaged 0.7 mu in diameter. Based on these results, we believe the LDV fraction is of physiological importance in sialyl polymer synthesis. Growth at 15 degrees C allowed identification and study of the LDV fraction possibly because of the altered thermotropic properties of the membrane phospholipids that occur when E. coli is grown at low temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1986081021,"The human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum can produce surface protrusions (knobs) on infected erythrocytes; however, long-term culturing of the parasite results in the appearance of knobless cells. In this study it was found that a knob-producing clone lost the ability to produce knobs in vitro. Furthermore, a clone not producing knobs derived from the knob-producing clone regained the capacity to produce knobby cells in vitro. Certain parasite proteins were associated with the knobby phenotype but not with the knobless type. These results indicate that the parasites change in vitro in a spontaneous and reversible manner independent of immunological selection."
https://openalex.org/W1544251830,"Chloride binding to alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli has been monitored by 35Cl NMR for the native zinc enzyme and by 113Cd NMR for two Cd(II)-substituted species, phosphorylated Cd(II)6 alkaline phosphatase and unphosphorylated Cd(II)2 alkaline phosphatase. Of the three metal binding sites per enzyme monomer, A, B, and C, only the NMR signal of 113Cd(II) at the A sites shows sensitivity to the presence of Cl-, suggesting that Cl- coordination occurs at the A site metal ion. From the differences in the chemical shift changes produced in the A site 113Cd resonance for the covalent (E-P) form of the enzyme versus the noncovalent (E . P) form of the enzyme, it is concluded that the A site metal ion can assume a five-coordinate form. The E-P form of the enzyme has three histidyl nitrogens as ligands from the protein to the A site metal ion plus either two water molecules or two Cl- ions as additional monodentate ligands. In the E . P form, there is a phosphate oxygen as a monodentate ligand and either a water molecule or a Cl- ion as the additional monodentate ligand. The shifts of the 113Cd NMR signals of the unphosphorylated Cd(II)2 enzyme induced by Cl- are very similar to those induced in the E-P derivative of the same enzyme, supporting the conclusion that the phosphoseryl residue is not directly coordinated to any of the metal ions. Specific broadening of the 35Cl resonance from bulk Cl- is induced by Zn(II)4 alkaline phosphatase, while Zn(II)2 alkaline phosphatase is even more effective, suggesting an influence by occupancy of the B site on the interaction of monodentate ligands at the A site. A reduction in this quadrupolar broadening is observed upon phosphate binding at pH values where E . P is formed, but not at pH values where E-P is the major species, confirming a specific interaction of Cl- at the A site, the site to which phosphate is bound in E . P, but not in E-P. For the zinc enzyme, a significant decrease in phosphate binding affinity can be shown to occur at pH 8 where one monomer has a higher affinity than the other."
https://openalex.org/W1588416061,"The aspartate transcarbamoylases (ATCase) from Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli exhibit unique regulatory and kinetic properties and were dissociated into their constituent regulatory and catalytic subunits. A hybrid ATCase holoenzyme was formed with catalytic subunits from S. marcescens and regulatory subunits from E. coli as demonstrated by the molecular weight, the recovery of cooperative, homotropic response to the substrate aspartate, and the re-establishment of heterotropic responses to the allosteric effectors ATP and CTP. This hybrid is of interest since ATCase from E. coli is inhibited by CTP and activated by ATP while ATCase from S. marcescens is activated by both nucleotides. The activity of the catalytic subunits was reduced upon formation of the catalytic subunits was reduced upon formation of the hybrid ATCase enzyme which exhibited an exaggerated requirement for aspartate; the [S]0.5 was 100-125 mM aspartate compared to 5 mM for the E. coli holoenzyme and 20 mM for the native ATCase from S. marcescens. Still, the heterotropic response to effectors was communicated efficiently through the various protein:protein domains of bonding in ATCase as 1 mM ATP activated the hybrid ATCase while 1 mM CTP inhibited the enzyme. ATP did not influence the pH profile of the hybrid enzyme but increasing concentrations of the substrate aspartate shifted the pH optimum from pH 6 to pH 6.8. These data support the view that homotropic and heterotropic responses in ATCase can be altered separately. Since the hybrid ATCase was formed with native, unmodified regulatory and catalytic subunits, the r:r and c:c domains in the hybrid holoenzyme remained fundamentally unaltered. Therefore, it appears that the r:c domains provide the primary communication for changes in quaternary structure that define the allosteric and enzymatic properties of the holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1585883327,"The polysialosyl capsule in Escherichia coli K1 is not synthesized when cells are grown at 15 degrees C. Membranous sialyltransferase complexes isolated from cells grown at 15 degrees C spontaneously gain the ability to synthesize sialyl polymers when incubated at 33 degrees C for 2-4 h. Activation of the endogenous synthesis of polysialic acid is localized in a low-density vesicle fraction (Whitfield, C., Adams, D.A., and Troy, F.A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12769-12775). The low density vesicles catalyzed protein synthesis, and spontaneous activation required protein synthesis. Immune blotting confirmed the presence of protein synthesis initiation factor, IF2, and ribosomal protein S6, in the low-density vesicle fraction. Temperature-upshift experiments identified four membrane proteins whose synthesis was temporally correlated with in vitro activation. These proteins have apparent molecular masses of 40, 21, 17.5, and 16 kDA. Although the function of these proteins is not known, they may relate to a sialyltransferase activity required to initiate sialyl polymer assembly, to an endogenous acceptor, or to a porin that may facilitate channeling of the polysialosyl chains through the outer membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1587278982,"Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a partially purified RNA polymerase II preparation from hen oviduct. Hybridomas were screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and those producing antibodies against the RNA polymerase II preparation were cloned twice. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies for RNA polymerase II was determined by three types of assays: first, by immunoblot assay; second, by removal of enzyme activity using indirect immunoprecipitation; and third, by affinity column chromatography. Several monoclonal antibodies were identified. One of them, 4C3-21 was characterized in detail here. This monoclonal antibody recognized the native form of RNA polymerase II from chicken oviduct, calf thymus, and HeLa cells, but it did not recognize Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. In addition, after interacting with RNA polymerase, this antibody did not inhibit total RNA synthesis nor specific initiation of transcription on cloned ovalbumin fragments in vitro. Finally, since the antibody did not react with polymerase subunits separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we deduced that the antibody interacted with the native form of the enzyme at a site which is not involved in initiation or elongation of RNA synthesis. This allowed us to undertake an unique approach utilizing antibody affinity column chromatography for purification of transcriptional factors. Using this approach, we demonstrated that certain transcription factor(s) were associated with RNA polymerase II and could be absorbed to an affinity column as an RNA polymerase-transcriptional factor complex. Differential elution can be carried out subsequently. Therefore, this antibody column should prove to be very useful for the purification of transcriptional regulatory factor(s) which bind to RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1575032284,"The identity of the volatile mercaptide and the metabolic pathway by which it becomes combined with the zymogen of streptococcal proteinase in the mixed disulfide were investigated. Mass spectrometric analysis identified the oxidized form of the volatile mercaptan as methanesulfonic acid. The mass spectrum of a peptide isolated from tryptic and subsequent chymotryptic digests of the zymogen was shown to be consistent with the previously reported amino acid sequence for a chymotryptic peptide with the sequence Val-Gly-Gln-Ala-Ala-Thr-Gly-His-Cys(SCH3)-Val. Studies using [35S] cystine, [methyl-35S]methionine and [methyl-14C]methionine in a cell suspension system revealed that the biosynthesis of the mixed disulfide in the zymogen may involve the formation of protein-S-SH followed by transmethylation rather than result from a direct transfer of an intact methanethiol to the cysteinyl residue of the zymogen. It is proposed that the attachment of the CH3-SH group to the protein-SH to form protein-S-S-CH3 is a process that is intimately related to the mechanism of secretion of the proteinase into the culture fluid by streptococci."
https://openalex.org/W1530434883,"Two active mutants of aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli have been purified from strains which produce large quantities of enzyme. Each enzyme was isolated from a different spontaneous revertant of a pyrimidine auxotrophic strain produced by mutagenesis with nitrogen mustard. Both enzymes exhibit allosteric properties with one having significantly less and the other more cooperativity than wild-type enzyme. Isolated catalytic subunits had different values of Km and Vmax. Studies on hybrids constructed from mutant catalytic and wild-type regulatory subunits (and vice versa) indicate that catalytic chains encoded by pyrB and not the regulatory chains encoded by pyrI were affected by the mutations. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments support these conclusions. Both mutant enzymes undergo ligand-promoted conformational changes analogous to those exhibited by wild-type enzyme: a 3% decrease in the sedimentation coefficient and a 5-fold increase in the reactivity of the sulfhydryl groups of the regulatory chains. Interactions between catalytic and regulatory chains in the mutants are weaker than those in the wild-type enzyme. The gross conformational changes of the mutants upon adding the bisubstrate ligand, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, in the presence of the substrate, carbamoylphosphate, and the activator, ATP, correlate with differences in cooperativity. The mutant with lower cooperativity is more readily converted from the low-affinity, compact, T-state to the high-affinity, swollen, R-state than is wild-type enzyme; this conversion for the more cooperative enzyme is energetically less favorable."
