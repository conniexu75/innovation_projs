https://openalex.org/W3134236823,"TP53 (tumor protein p53) is the most commonly mutated cancer driver gene, but drugs that target mutant tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, are not yet available. Here, we describe the identification of an antibody highly specific to the most common TP53 mutation (R175H, in which arginine at position 175 is replaced with histidine) in complex with a common human leukocyte antigen-A (HLA-A) allele on the cell surface. We describe the structural basis of this specificity and its conversion into an immunotherapeutic agent: a bispecific single-chain diabody. Despite the extremely low p53 peptide-HLA complex density on the cancer cell surface, the bispecific antibody effectively activated T cells to lyse cancer cells that presented the neoantigen in vitro and in mice. This approach could in theory be used to target cancers containing mutations that are difficult to target in conventional ways."
https://openalex.org/W3134444564,"Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a key challenge in cancer therapy. To elucidate underlying mechanisms, we developed Perturb-CITE-sequencing (Perturb-CITE-seq), enabling pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 perturbations with single-cell transcriptome and protein readouts. In patient-derived melanoma cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) co-cultures, we profiled transcriptomes and 20 proteins in ~218,000 cells under ~750 perturbations associated with cancer cell-intrinsic ICI resistance (ICR). We recover known mechanisms of resistance, including defects in the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-JAK/STAT and antigen-presentation pathways in RNA, protein and perturbation space, and new ones, including loss/downregulation of CD58. Loss of CD58 conferred immune evasion in multiple co-culture models and was downregulated in tumors of melanoma patients with ICR. CD58 protein expression was not induced by IFN-γ signaling, and CD58 loss conferred immune evasion without compromising major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, suggesting that it acts orthogonally to known mechanisms of ICR. This work provides a framework for the deciphering of complex mechanisms by large-scale perturbation screens with multimodal, single-cell readouts, and discovers potentially clinically relevant mechanisms of immune evasion."

https://openalex.org/W3133712085,"The expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1, is frequently observed in human cancers and can lead to the suppression of T cell-mediated immune responses. Here, we apply expanded CRISPR-compatible (EC)CITE-seq, a technology that combines pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell mRNA and surface protein measurements, to explore the molecular networks that regulate PD-L1 expression. We also develop a computational framework, mixscape, that substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio in single-cell perturbation screens by identifying and removing confounding sources of variation. Applying these tools, we identify and validate regulators of PD-L1 and leverage our multimodal data to identify both transcriptional and post-transcriptional modes of regulation. Specifically, we discover that the Kelch-like protein KEAP1 and the transcriptional activator NRF2 mediate the upregulation of PD-L1 after interferon (IFN)-γ stimulation. Our results identify a new mechanism for the regulation of immune checkpoints and present a powerful analytical framework for the analysis of multimodal single-cell perturbation screens."
https://openalex.org/W3135468873,"Degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain underlies the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Supplement of DA via L-DOPA alleviates motor symptoms but does not prevent the progressive loss of DA neurons. A large body of experimental studies, including those in nonhuman primates, demonstrates that transplantation of fetal mesencephalic tissues improves motor symptoms in animals, which culminated in open-label and double-blinded clinical trials of fetal tissue transplantation for PD1. Unfortunately, the outcomes are mixed, primarily due to the undefined and unstandardized donor tissues1,2. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells enables standardized and autologous transplantation therapy for PD. However, its efficacy, especially in primates, remains unclear. Here we show that over a 2-year period without immunosuppression, PD monkeys receiving autologous, but not allogenic, transplantation exhibited recovery from motor and depressive signs. These behavioral improvements were accompanied by robust grafts with extensive DA neuron axon growth as well as strong DA activity in positron emission tomography (PET). Mathematical modeling reveals correlations between the number of surviving DA neurons with PET signal intensity and behavior recovery regardless autologous or allogeneic transplant, suggesting a predictive power of PET and motor behaviors for surviving DA neuron number."
https://openalex.org/W3134706093,"In ecosystems, the efficiency of energy transfer from resources to consumers determines the biomass structure of food webs. As a general rule, about 10% of the energy produced in one trophic level makes it up to the next1–3. Recent theory suggests that this energy transfer could be further constrained if rising temperatures increase metabolic growth costs4, although experimental confirmation in whole ecosystems is lacking. Here we quantify nitrogen transfer efficiency—a proxy for overall energy transfer—in freshwater plankton in artificial ponds that have been exposed to seven years of experimental warming. We provide direct experimental evidence that, relative to ambient conditions, 4 °C of warming can decrease trophic transfer efficiency by up to 56%. In addition, the biomass of both phytoplankton and zooplankton was lower in the warmed ponds, which indicates major shifts in energy uptake, transformation and transfer5,6. These findings reconcile observed warming-driven changes in individual-level growth costs and in carbon-use efficiency across diverse taxa4,7–10 with increases in the ratio of total respiration to gross primary production at the ecosystem level11–13. Our results imply that an increasing proportion of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis will be lost to the atmosphere as the planet warms, impairing energy flux through food chains, which will have negative implications for larger consumers and for the functioning of entire ecosystems. In artificial ponds exposed to seven years of experimental warming, energy transfer between two trophic levels of freshwater plankton decreased by 56% and the biomass of both levels was reduced."
https://openalex.org/W3133570715,"Whole-genome sequencing data mining efforts have revealed numerous histone mutations in a wide range of cancer types. These occur in all four core histones in both the tail and globular domains and remain largely uncharacterized. Here we used two high-throughput approaches, a DNA-barcoded mononucleosome library and a humanized yeast library, to profile the biochemical and cellular effects of these mutations. We identified cancer-associated mutations in the histone globular domains that enhance fundamental chromatin remodeling processes, histone exchange and nucleosome sliding, and are lethal in yeast. In mammalian cells, these mutations upregulate cancer-associated gene pathways and inhibit cellular differentiation by altering expression of lineage-specific transcription factors. This work represents a comprehensive functional analysis of the histone mutational landscape in human cancers and leads to a model in which histone mutations that perturb nucleosome remodeling may contribute to disease development and/or progression."
https://openalex.org/W3134260994,"BCL11A, the major regulator of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) level, represses γ-globin expression through direct promoter binding in adult erythroid cells in a switch to adult hemoglobin (HbA, α2β2). To uncover how BCL11A initiates repression, we used CRISPR-Cas9, dCas9, dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VP64 screens to dissect the γ-globin promoters and identified an activator element near the BCL11A-binding site. Using CUT&RUN and base editing, we demonstrate that a proximal CCAAT box is occupied by the activator NF-Y. BCL11A competes with NF-Y binding through steric hindrance to initiate repression. Occupancy of NF-Y is rapidly established following BCL11A depletion, and precedes γ-globin derepression and locus control region (LCR)-globin loop formation. Our findings reveal that the switch from fetal to adult globin gene expression within the >50-kb β-globin gene cluster is initiated by competition between a stage-selective repressor and a ubiquitous activating factor within a remarkably discrete region of the γ-globin promoters."
https://openalex.org/W3134334661,"G-protein-coupled receptor-regulated cAMP production from endosomes can specify signaling to the nucleus by moving the source of cAMP without changing its overall amount. How this is possible remains unknown because cAMP gradients dissipate over the nanoscale, whereas endosomes typically localize micrometers from the nucleus. We show that the key location-dependent step for endosome-encoded transcriptional control is nuclear entry of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunits. These are sourced from punctate accumulations of PKA holoenzyme that are densely distributed in the cytoplasm and titrated by global cAMP into a discrete metastable state, in which catalytic subunits are bound but dynamically exchange. Mobile endosomes containing activated receptors collide with the metastable PKA puncta and pause in close contact. We propose that these properties enable cytoplasmic PKA to act collectively like a semiconductor, converting nanoscale cAMP gradients generated from endosomes into microscale elevations of free catalytic subunits to direct downstream signaling. High mobility and nuclear translocation of the PKA catalytic subunit, PKAcat, relays signals induced by endosomal cAMP generated through endocytosis and signaling from the G-protein-coupled receptor β2-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3135313491,"Abstract Despite the well-established role of CMTM6 in the stabilization of cell surface PD-L1 in cancer cells, the mechanisms underlying CMTM6 expression and regulation are still largely unknown. Here we unexpectedly find a strikingly positive correlation between CMTM6 and Hu-Antigen R (HuR) expression in most types of cancer. Mechanistically, we elucidate HuR stabilizes CMTM6 mRNA via direct association with AU-rich elements (AREs) in its 3′UTR and predominantly up-regulates CMTM6, which is readily abolished by HuR-specific inhibitor, MS-444. Phenotypically, we notice abundant cell surface PD-L1 in HuR-high cancer cells, which significantly inhibits immune activation of co-cultured T cells as indicated by IL-2 production. Treatment with MS-444 completely relieves immune suppression imposed by HuR-overexpression and further stimulates immune responses. Ectopic HuR accelerates allograft tumor progression in vivo, which is greatly compromised by simultaneous administration with MS-444. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism in control of CMTM6 and therefore PD-L1 expression, and suggests the potential of combining HuR inhibitor with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3135663906,"As SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly throughout the world, the scientific community has spent major efforts on better understanding the characteristics of the virus and possible means to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19. A valid approach presented in the literature is to develop an image-based method to support COVID-19 diagnosis using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Because the availability of radiological data is rather limited due to the novelty of COVID-19, several methodologies consider reduced datasets, which may be inadequate, biasing the model. Here, we performed an analysis combining six different databases using chest X-ray images from open datasets to distinguish images of infected patients while differentiating COVID-19 and pneumonia from ‘no-findings’ images. In addition, the performance of models created from fewer databases, which may imperceptibly overestimate their results, is discussed. Two CNN-based architectures were created to process images of different sizes (512 × 512, 768 × 768, 1024 × 1024, and 1536 × 1536). Our best model achieved a balanced accuracy (BA) of 87.7% in predicting one of the three classes (‘no-findings’, ‘COVID-19’, and ‘pneumonia’) and a specific balanced precision of 97.0% for ‘COVID-19’ class. We also provided binary classification with a precision of 91.0% for detection of sick patients (i.e., with COVID-19 or pneumonia) and 98.4% for COVID-19 detection (i.e., differentiating from ‘no-findings’ or ‘pneumonia’). Indeed, despite we achieved an unrealistic 97.2% BA performance for one specific case, the proposed methodology of using multiple databases achieved better and less inflated results than from models with specific image datasets for training. Thus, this framework is promising for a low-cost, fast, and noninvasive means to support the diagnosis of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3133662922,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and poses a significant physical barrier to in vivo cell migration. Accordingly, as a means of enhancing tissue invasion, tumor cells use matrix metalloproteinases to degrade ECM proteins. However, the in vivo ECM is comprised not only of proteins but also of a variety of nonprotein components. Hyaluronan (HA), one of the most abundant nonprotein components of the interstitial ECM, forms a gel-like antiadhesive barrier that is impenetrable to particulate matter and cells. Mechanisms by which tumor cells penetrate the HA barrier have not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2), the only known transmembrane hyaluronidase, is the predominant mediator of contact-dependent HA degradation and subsequent integrin-mediated cell-substrate adhesion. We show that a variety of tumor cells are able to eliminate substrate-bound HA in a tightly localized pattern corresponding to the distribution of focal adhesions (FAs) and stress fibers. This FA-targeted HA degradation is mediated by TMEM2, which itself is localized at site of FAs. TMEM2 depletion inhibits the ability of tumor cells to attach and migrate in an HA-rich environment. Importantly, TMEM2 directly binds at least two integrins via interaction between extracellular domains. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for TMEM2-mediated HA degradation in the adhesion and migration of cells on HA-rich ECM substrates and provide novel insight into the early phase of FA formation."
https://openalex.org/W3134733017,"Vascular calcification is the ectopic deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite minerals in arterial wall, which involves the transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) toward an osteogenic phenotype. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating the VSMC osteogenic switch remain incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in vascular calcification. miRNA-seq transcriptome analysis identified miR-223-3p as a candidate miRNA in calcified mouse aortas. MiR-223-3p knockout aggravated calcification in both medial and atherosclerotic vascular calcification models. Further, RNA-seq transcriptome analysis verified JAK-STAT and PPAR signaling pathways were upregulated in both medial and atherosclerotic calcified aortas. Overlapping genes in these signaling pathways with predicted target genes of miR-223-3p derived from miRNA databases, we identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a potential target gene of miR-223-3p in vascular calcification. <i>In vitro</i> experiments showed that miR-223-3p blocked interleukin-6 (IL-6)/STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing the osteogenic switch and calcification of VSMCs. In contrast, overexpression of STAT3 diminished the effect of miR-223-3p. Taken together, the results indicate a protective role of miR-223-3p that inhibits both medial and atherosclerotic vascular calcification by regulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling-mediated VSMC transdifferentiation."

https://openalex.org/W3134183600,"Early childhood asthma diagnosis is common; however, many children diagnosed before age 5 experience symptom resolution and it remains difficult to identify individuals whose symptoms will persist. Our objective was to develop machine learning models to identify which individuals diagnosed with asthma before age 5 continue to experience asthma-related visits. We curated a retrospective dataset for 9,934 children derived from electronic health record (EHR) data. We trained five machine learning models to differentiate individuals without subsequent asthma-related visits (transient diagnosis) from those with asthma-related visits between ages 5 and 10 (persistent diagnosis) given clinical information up to age 5 years. Based on average NPV-Specificity area (ANSA), all models performed significantly better than random chance, with XGBoost obtaining the best performance (0.43 mean ANSA). Feature importance analysis indicated age of last asthma diagnosis under 5 years, total number of asthma related visits, self-identified black race, allergic rhinitis, and eczema as important features. Although our models appear to perform well, a lack of prior models utilizing a large number of features to predict individual persistence makes direct comparison infeasible. However, feature importance analysis indicates our models are consistent with prior research indicating diagnosis age and prior health service utilization as important predictors of persistent asthma. We therefore find that machine learning models can predict which individuals will experience persistent asthma with good performance and may be useful to guide clinician and parental decisions regarding asthma counselling in early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W3134292889,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are characterized by robust self-renewal and tumorigenesis and are responsible for metastasis, drug resistance, and angiogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms for the regulation of CSC homeostasis are incompletely understood. This study demonstrated that the interleukin-17 (IL-17)B/IL-17RB signaling cascade promotes the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of CSCs by inducing Beclin-1 ubiquitination. We found that IL-17RB expression was significantly upregulated in spheroid cells and Lgr5-positive cells from the same tumor tissues of patients with gastric cancer (GC), which was closely correlated with the degree of cancer cell differentiation. Recombinant IL-17B (rIL-17B) promoted the sphere-formation ability of CSCs in vitro and enhanced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, IL-17B induced autophagosome formation and cleavage-mediated transformation of LC3 in CSCs and 293T cells. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy activation by ATG7 knockdown reversed rIL-17B-induced self-renewal of GC cells. In addition, we showed that IL-17B also promoted K63-mediated ubiquitination of Beclin-1 by mediating the binding of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 to Beclin-1. Silencing IL-17RB expression abrogated the effects of IL-17B on Beclin-1 ubiquitination and autophagy activation in GC cells. Finally, we showed that IL-17B level in the serum of GC patients was positively correlated with IL-17RB expression in GC tissues, and IL-17B could induce IL-17RB expression in GC cells. Overall, the results elucidate the novel functions of IL-17B for CSCs and suggest that the intervention of the IL-17B/IL-17RB signaling pathway may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3133989176,"Melanoma is the most aggressive skin malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide. Pannexin1 (PANX1), a member of the pannexin family of channel-forming glycoproteins, regulates cellular processes in melanoma cells including proliferation, migration, and invasion/metastasis. However, the mechanisms responsible for coordinating and regulating PANX1 function remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated a direct interaction between the C-terminal region of PANX1 and the N-terminal portion of β-catenin, a key transcription factor in the Wnt pathway. At the protein level, β-catenin was significantly decreased when PANX1 was either knocked down or inhibited by two PANX1 blockers, Probenecid and Spironolactone. Immunofluorescence imaging showed a disrupted pattern of β-catenin localization at the cell membrane in PANX1-deficient cells, and transcription of several Wnt target genes, including MITF, was suppressed. In addition, a mitochondrial stress test revealed that the metabolism of PANX1-deficient cells was impaired, indicating a role for PANX1 in the regulation of the melanoma cell metabolic profile. Taken together, our data show that PANX1 directly interacts with β-catenin to modulate growth and metabolism in melanoma cells.

Additionally, immune evasion is a hallmark of melanoma progression (17Tucci M. Passarelli A. Mannavola F. Felici C. Stucci L.S. Cives M. Silvestris F.

Of note, β-catenin modulates aerobic glycolysis and regulates cancer cell metabolism (19Sherwood V. WNT signaling: An emerging mediator of cancer cell metabolism?.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which may be an additional role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in melanoma tumorigenesis. We postulated that PANX1 regulates melanoma cell metabolic profile, proliferation, and migration in part through cross talk with the Wnt signaling pathway. Here we showed that, PANX1 binds directly via its C-terminal region to β-catenin. Blocking or reducing PANX1 in melanoma cells decreases the levels of β-catenin and suppresses β-catenin transcriptional activity. Moreover, depletion of PANX1 attenuated the mitochondrial respiratory activity of melanoma cells. Our findings underline the molecular mechanisms through which PANX1 regulates melanoma tumorigenesis and suggests that PANX1 may be a new interactor in the Wnt signaling pathway and can potentially be a target for the treatment of malignant melanoma. To determine whether there is an interaction between PANX1 and β-catenin in melanoma cells, we first analyzed a panel of melanoma biopsies from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found a modest, yet significant, correlation between PANX1 and β-catenin mRNA (CTNNB1) in 471 patients with malignant melanoma (Fig. 1A, left panel). To investigate whether this correlation is restricted to melanoma or applies to other types of cancers, we analyzed TCGA data of 1108 biopsies taken from patients with breast cancer. We observed that, similar to melanoma, mRNA expression of PANX1 significantly correlates with that of β-catenin (Fig. 1A, right panel). Of note, both PANX1 and β-catenin have been implicated in survival of metastatic breast cancer cells and poor patient outcome (20Furlow P.W. Zhang S. Soong T.D. Halberg N. Goodarzi H. Mangrum C.

We assessed several human melanoma cell lines with transcriptional profiles similar to melanoma tumors (22Vincent K.M. Postovit L.M. Investigating the utility of human melanoma cell lines as tumour models.Oncotarget. 2017; 8: 10498-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for their PANX1 expression (Fig. 1B). We observed that PANX1 is expressed in all cell lines tested but most abundant in 131/4-5B1 cells at both the protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 1, B and C). A375-P cells with PANX1 knockdown were used to validate the specificity of the antibody. We chose 131/4-5B1 cells to conduct immunoprecipitation studies, incubating protein lysates with specific antibodies against the carboxyl terminal region of PANX1. Endogenous PANX1 co-immunoprecipitated (co-IP) with β-catenin in 131/4-5B1 human melanoma cells (Fig. 1D, left panel). In contrast, no β-catenin precipitated with rabbit IgG, validating the specificity of the interaction (Fig. 1D, left panel). Reciprocal analysis revealed that endogenous PANX1 specifically co-IP with endogenous β-catenin from 131/4-5B1 human melanoma cells (Fig. 1D, middle panel). PANX1 has been shown to act as a Ca2+-permeable channel at the endoplasmic reticulum (6D'Hondt C. Ponsaerts R. De Smedt H. Vinken M. De Vuyst E. De Bock M. Wang N. Rogiers V. Leybaert L. Himpens B.

Locovei S. Dahl G. Pannexin membrane channels are mechanosensitive conduits for ATP.FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The molecular nature and mechanism of this particular function of PANX1 are poorly understood. Many signaling pathways initiated by the rise in intracellular Ca2+ are mainly mediated by calmodulin, the master regulator of Ca2+ signaling in all eukaryotic cells (23Berchtold M.W. Villalobo A. The many faces of calmodulin in cell proliferation, programmed cell death, autophagy, and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 398-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Calmodulin binds to several connexin forming gap junctions and modulates their functions in cell-to-cell transfer of metabolites (24Chen Y. Zhou Y. Lin X. Wong H.C. Xu Q. Jiang J. Wang S. Lurtz M.M.

Veenstra R. Louis C.F. Yang J.J. Gap junction regulation by calmodulin.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the similarity of connexin and pannexin structure, we investigated whether calmodulin interacts with PANX1 in melanoma cells. We immunoprecipitated PANX1 from A375-P and A375-MA2 cells in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1E, Fig. S1A). Calmodulin co-IP with PANX1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 1E, left panel, Fig. S1A). The interaction between calmodulin and PANX1 in melanoma cells represents an additional layer of complexity in the modulation of Ca2+ signaling through PANX1. It is not possible to establish from the data shown in Figure 1D, whether PANX1 and β-catenin bind directly or through a protein complex. To address this question, we performed an in vitro analysis using a transcription and translation (TNT) system and purified recombinant proteins. Selected regions of PANX1 (Fig. 2A, schematic) were expressed using the TNT and labeled with [35S]methionine. The PANX1 constructs were incubated with Maltose-Binding Protein (MBP)-tagged β-catenin. After washing, complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and processed by autoradiography. Analogous to findings with co-IPs (Fig. 1D), full-length PANX1 binds directly to purified β-catenin in vitro (Fig. 2B, left blot). Analysis of two fragments of PANX1 revealed minimal binding of the middle segment (M) of PANX1 (amino acids 128–203) to β-catenin (Fig. 2B, middle blot and Fig. 2C). In contrast, amino acids 288 to 426, which constitute the C-terminal segment (C) of PANX1, exhibit robust binding to β-catenin (Fig. 2B, right blot, and Fig. 2C). Binding specificity was confirmed by the absence of bands from samples incubated with MBP alone (Fig. 2, B and C). The expression levels of TNT products were comparable among samples (Fig. 2B). We investigated whether the C-terminal region of PANX1 (aa 288–426) is homologous to any other proteins. The results using NCBI blast analysis revealed that the 138 aa in the C-terminus region of PANX1, where β-catenin binds, is specific to PANX1 among different species (Fig. S2). In addition, we conducted in vitro assays to identify the region of β-catenin where PANX1 binds. We conducted pull-down assays using selected β-catenin fragments, namely the N-terminal (amino acids 1–137), middle and C-terminal (amino acids 138–781, termed R1) and the C-terminal (amino acids 666–781) regions of β-catenin. His-tagged purified fragments of β-catenin were incubated with lysates of HEK293 cells expressing myc-PANX1-C. Complexes were isolated using Talon Metal Affinity Resin. PANX1 binds exclusively to the N-terminal region of β-catenin (amino acids 1–137) (Fig. 2, D and E). No binding is detected to the R1 or C constructs of β-catenin or to Talon beads alone. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the C-terminal region of PANX1 binds to the N-terminal portion of β-catenin. To investigate the effect of PANX1 on β-catenin function in melanoma cells, we generated PANX1 knockout (PANX1 KO) A375-P and A375-MA2 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A double nicking strategy was employed to reduce the likelihood of off-target effects. In this method, paired guide RNAs with the ability to cleave single strands were used, which resulted in specific double-strand breaks within the PANX1 gene. Western blotting confirmed the loss of PANX1 expression (Fig. 3A). Deletion of the PANX1 gene from A375-P and A375-MA2 cells caused a substantial reduction in the abundance of β-catenin and its downstream effector Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor (MITF, Fig. 3A). Since the growth rate of PANX1 knockout cells in culture was severely reduced and cells were difficult to maintain for experimental procedures, we knocked down PANX1 in A375-P cells using shRNA. The levels of PANX1 mRNA in cells transfected with control shRNA were comparable with those in nontransfected A375-P cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, PANX1 mRNA in cells that were transfected with either of two different shRNA constructs against PANX1 (PANX1shRNA-B and D) was 3.2 ± 0.04-fold lower than control cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the amount of PANX1 protein was decreased by 4.2 ± 0.02-fold compared with control samples (Fig. 3, C and D, left panel). Analogous to our observations with PANX1 KO cells, the abundance of β-catenin was significantly reduced in PANX1 knockdown melanoma cells (Fig. 3, C and D, right panel). To evaluate whether loss of PANX1 affects the β-catenin mRNA, we performed quantitative RT-qPCR. A375-P cells transfected with shRNA against β-catenin were used as control (Fig. 3E). Levels of β-catenin mRNA among nontransfected, control shRNA and PANX1 shRNA transfected A375-P cells were comparable (Fig. 3E). These data indicate that PANX1 likely contributes to the posttranscriptional modification and/or stability of β-catenin protein in melanoma cells and does not have a significant impact on β-catenin mRNA levels. Next, we validated our findings by immunofluorescence analysis in PANX1-deficient melanoma cells. In cells transfected with control shRNA, β-catenin is abundant at the cell membranes where it partially colocalizes with membrane-bound PANX1 (Fig. 3F). In contrast, in PANX1-deficient cells, PANX1 is decreased and less abundant at the cell surface and areas of cell–cell contact. In addition, the pattern of β-catenin staining at cell borders is also irregular and disrupted when PANX1 is reduced in melanoma cells (Fig. 3F). MITF is a melanocyte lineage-specific transcription factor that is linked to plasticity of melanoma cells and has key roles in proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of melanoma cells (27Carreira S. Goodall J. Denat L. Rodriguez M. Nuciforo P. Hoek K.S. Testori A. Larue L. Goding C.R.

Pathways from senescence to melanoma: Focus on MITF sumoylation.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 6659-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The promoter of human and mouse Mitf-M, a specific isotype in melanocytes, contains β-catenin-binding sites (29Larue L. Delmas V. The WNT/beta-catenin pathway in melanoma.Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of reduced β-catenin on MITF expression in PANX1-deficient and knockout cells, we performed western blotting (Fig. 3, A and C). MITF protein was significantly reduced in PANX1-deficient melanoma cells (Fig. 3, C and G). Similarly, qPCR analysis revealed a significant reduction in the mRNA of MITF when PANX1 is knocked down in A375-P cells (Fig. 3G). MITF expression is modulated through β-catenin and another key effector in the Wnt pathway called lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) in melanoma cells (30Hartman M.L. Czyz M.

In addition, mRNA levels of Axin2, which is a common β-catenin target gene, were substantially reduced upon PANX1knockdown but did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3G). Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a major regulator of melanoma proliferation (16Fan G. Ye D. Zhu S. Xi J. Guo X. Qiao J. Wu Y. Jia W. Wang G. Fan G. Kang J.

Cancer. 2016; 115: 1273-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, PANX1-deficient A375-P cells showed significantly decreased growth rate compared with control cells starting 2 days after seeding (Fig. 3H). These results demonstrate that expression of several key effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway, including β-catenin, is reduced in PANX1-deficent melanoma cells. The effect of shRNA knockdown (KD) of β-catenin on the expression of PANX1 in melanoma cells was evaluated in A375-P cells. Western blotting and qPCR confirmed reduced β-catenin protein (Fig. 4A) and mRNA levels (Fig. 4B) after β-catenin shRNA KD, as expected. Interestingly, the levels of both PANX1 protein and mRNA were substantially reduced in β-catenin-deficient melanoma cells (Fig. 4, A and C). The 1.9-fold decrease in PANX1 mRNA when β-catenin was knocked down was the same as knocking down PANX1 using PANX1 shRNA (Fig. 4C). Knocking down β-catenin in melanoma cells also reduced MITF mRNA by 2.8-fold (Fig. 4D). The role of Wnt/β-catenin/MITF pathway in melanoma cell proliferation is well established (27Carreira S. Goodall J. Denat L. Rodriguez M. Nuciforo P. Hoek K.S. Testori A. Larue L. Goding C.R.

MITF in melanoma: Mechanisms behind its expression and activity.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In agreement with this fact, there was a significant reduction in the growth rate of A375-P cells with β-catenin knockdown (Fig. 3E). The effect of β-catenin reduction on PANX1 subcellular localization was investigated using immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4F). Our findings suggest that in β-catenin knocked down A375-P cells, PANX1 is reduced, particularly in its localization at the cell surface and areas of cell–cell contact, and shows a diffuse intracellular distribution (Fig. 4F). We previously reported that long-term exposure to PANX1 channel blockers, namely Carbenoxolone (CBX) and Probenecid (PBN), reduces the growth rate of melanoma cells evident after 3 days in culture (11Freeman T.J.

Inhibition of pannexin 1 reduces the tumorigenic properties of human melanoma cells.Cancers (Basel). 2019; 11: 102Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a phenotype that is also observed in cells with depleted PANX1 protein (Fig. 3H). To assess the effect of long-term exposure to PANX1 blockers, we incubated A375-MA2 cells with PBN for 72 h. Quantification revealed that PBN decreases protein levels of both PANX1 (by 20%) and β-catenin (by 30%) (Fig. 5, A and B). Spironolactone (SPL) was recently shown to specifically block PANX1 (41Good M.E. Chiu Y.H. Poon I.K.H. Medina C.B. Butcher J.T. Mendu S.K. DeLalio L.J. Lohman A.W. Leitinger N. Barrett E. Lorenz U.M.

Res. 2018; 122: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Incubation of highly invasive 131/4-5B1 melanoma cells with either PBN or SPL markedly reduced cytoplasmic levels of both PANX1 and β-catenin (Fig. 5, C and D). SPL caused about 37% ± 11 reduction in PANX1 and 47% ± 8 reduction in β-catenin levels (Fig. 5, C and D). qPCR showed that neither PBN nor SPL significantly altered PANX1 mRNA (Fig. 5E, left panel), which suggests that long-term exposure to blockers likely affects PANX1 at the protein level. Treatment with PBN but not SPL reduced the β-catenin mRNA levels (Fig. 5E, right panel), suggesting that PBN likely suppresses β-catenin not only through reduction of PANX1 but also through inhibition of β-catenin mRNA transcription.

Data from 193 eyes of 165 patients (76.4 ± 8.3 years old) with preoperative corneal astigmatism exceeding 0.75 diopters who had undergone phacoemulsification and toric IOL implantation were collected and analyzed. Corneal astigmatism, refractive astigmatism, and uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were evaluated before and 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery. The degree of IOL decentration, IOL tilt, and toric axis misalignment was assessed at 1 day and 1 month postoperatively. Fifty eyes received AcrySof toric IOL, 51 eyes TECNIS toric IOL, 46 eyes HOYA 355 toric IOL, and 46 eyes HOYA XY-1 toric IOL. The amount of axis misalignment from the intended axis was significantly different among IOLs (p = 0.004, one-way ANOVA), and HOYA XY-1 showed significantly less amount of axis misalignment than TECNIS (p = 0.020, Tukey’s multiple comparison) and HOYA 355 (p = 0.010). The proportion of eyes that showed axis misalignment &lt;10° at 1 month postoperatively was significantly higher with HOYA XY-1 toric IOL than with other toric IOLs (χ 2 test, p = 0.020).

https://openalex.org/W3134597451,"Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) represent powerful tools for controlling malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. The success of these interventions relies on their capability to inhibit indoor feeding and resting of malaria mosquitoes. This study sought to understand the interaction of insecticide resistance with indoor and outdoor resting behavioral responses of malaria vectors from Western Kenya.The status of insecticide resistance among indoor and outdoor resting anopheline mosquitoes was compared in Anopheles mosquitoes collected from Kisumu and Bungoma counties in Western Kenya. The level and intensity of resistance were measured using WHO-tube and CDC-bottle bioassays, respectively. The synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was used to determine if metabolic activity (monooxygenase enzymes) explained the resistance observed. The mutations at the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene and Ace 1 gene were characterized using PCR methods. Microplate assays were used to measure levels of detoxification enzymes if present.A total of 1094 samples were discriminated within Anopheles gambiae s.l. and 289 within An. funestus s.l. In Kisian (Kisumu county), the dominant species was Anopheles arabiensis 75.2% (391/520) while in Kimaeti (Bungoma county) collections the dominant sibling species was Anopheles gambiae s.s 96.5% (554/574). The An. funestus s.l samples analysed were all An. funestus s.s from both sites. Pyrethroid resistance of An.gambiae s.l F1 progeny was observed in all sites. Lower mortality was observed against deltamethrin for the progeny of indoor resting mosquitoes compared to outdoor resting mosquitoes (Mortality rate: 37% vs 51%, P = 0.044). The intensity assays showed moderate-intensity resistance to deltamethrin in the progeny of mosquitoes collected from indoors and outdoors in both study sites. In Kisian, the frequency of vgsc-L1014S and vgsc-L1014F mutation was 0.14 and 0.19 respectively in indoor resting malaria mosquitoes while those of the outdoor resting mosquitoes were 0.12 and 0.12 respectively. The ace 1 mutation was present in higher frequency in the F1 of mosquitoes resting indoors (0.23) compared to those of mosquitoes resting outdoors (0.12). In Kimaeti, the frequencies of vgsc-L1014S and vgsc-L1014F were 0.75 and 0.05 respectively for the F1 of mosquitoes collected indoors whereas those of outdoor resting ones were 0.67 and 0.03 respectively. The ace 1 G119S mutation was present in progeny of mosquitoes from Kimaeti resting indoors (0.05) whereas it was absent in those resting outdoors. Monooxygenase activity was elevated by 1.83 folds in Kisian and by 1.33 folds in Kimaeti for mosquitoes resting indoors than those resting outdoors respectively.The study recorded high phenotypic, metabolic and genotypic insecticide resistance in indoor resting populations of malaria vectors compared to their outdoor resting counterparts. The indication of moderate resistance intensity for the indoor resting mosquitoes is alarming as it could have an operational impact on the efficacy of the existing pyrethroid based vector control tools. The use of synergist (PBO) in LLINs may be a better alternative for widespread use in these regions recording high insecticide resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3135392879,"Mdm2 antagonizes the tumor suppressor p53. Targeting the Mdm2-p53 interaction represents an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers with functional p53. Investigating mechanisms underlying Mdm2-p53 regulation is therefore important. The scaffold protein β-arrestin2 (β-arr2) regulates tumor suppressor p53 by counteracting Mdm2. β-arr2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling displaces Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in enhanced p53 signaling. β-arr2 is constitutively exported from the nucleus, via a nuclear export signal, but mechanisms regulating its nuclear entry are not completely elucidated. β-arr2 can be SUMOylated, but no information is available on how SUMO may regulate β-arr2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. While we found β-arr2 SUMOylation to be dispensable for nuclear import, we identified a non-covalent interaction between SUMO and β-arr2, via a SUMO interaction motif (SIM), that is required for β-arr2 cytonuclear trafficking. This SIM promotes association of β-arr2 with the multimolecular RanBP2/RanGAP1-SUMO nucleocytoplasmic transport hub that resides on the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex. Depletion of RanBP2/RanGAP1-SUMO levels result in defective β-arr2 nuclear entry. Mutation of the SIM inhibits β-arr2 nuclear import, its ability to delocalize Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and enhanced p53 signaling in lung and breast tumor cell lines. Thus, a β-arr2 SIM nuclear entry checkpoint, coupled with active β-arr2 nuclear export, regulates its cytonuclear trafficking function to control the Mdm2-p53 signaling axis."

Recent estimates suggest that Influenza infection is responsible for 300,000–650,000 deaths annually (2Iuliano A.D. Roguski K.M. Chang H.H. Muscatello D.J. Palekar R. Tempia S. Cohen C. Gran J.M.

Hence, there is a concern that the cocirculation of influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and other respiratory viruses could exceed health-care capacity in several settings (3Belongia E.A. Osterholm M.T. COVID-19 and flu, a perfect storm.Science. 2020; 368: 1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the utility of anti-influenza therapies is often diminished due to the emergence of resistant strains (4Paules C. Subbarao K. Influenza.Lancet. 2017; 390: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). For example, amantadine, which antagonizes the influenza A proton channel, is no longer recommended as a treatment due to widespread resistance (4Paules C. Subbarao K. Influenza.Lancet. 2017; 390: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Alternatively, neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir can be used for the treatment of influenza A and B (4Paules C. Subbarao K. Influenza.Lancet. 2017; 390: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar); however, the potential clinical benefits are still debated (4Paules C. Subbarao K. Influenza.Lancet. 2017; 390: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Recently, baloxavir marboxil (BXM), a first-in-class antiviral targeting the viral polymerase gained FDA approval (5Noshi T. Kitano M. Taniguchi K. Yamamoto A. Omoto S. Baba K. Hashimoto T. Ishida K. Kushima Y. Hattori K. Kawai M. Yoshida R. Kobayashi M. Yoshinaga T.

Intracellular hydrolysis of the prodrug yields baloxavir acid (BXA), which is the active form. BXM treatment, much like oseltamivir, results in a ∼20–25% reduction in time until symptom resolution and the clinical utility of both drugs is compromised by the emergence of resistant viruses (6Hayden F.G.

A recent study also demonstrated that a single-dose of BXM showed postexposure prophylactic efficacy in reducing household transmissions from 13.6% in the placebo group to 1.9% in the BXM group (9Ikematsu H.

Med. 2020; 383: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on this data, the FDA expanded the approval to postexposure prevention. Progress has also been made in elucidating the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication by BXA. The viral replication complex is a heterotrimer (ht), possessing a 7-methylguanylate (m7G) cap binding domain (PB2) that allows binding of cellular mRNAs (10Guilligay D. Tarendeau F. Resa-Infante P.

A similar approach was utilized for the development of inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (20Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C.

Parniak M.A. Inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-associated ribonuclease H activity.Biology (Basel). 2012; 1: 521-541PubMed Google Scholar). While several HIV-1 integrase inhibitors are approved for clinical use, HIV-1 RNase H inhibitors remain investigational. A common motif for these metal binders is three strategically positioned heteroatoms that form an “anchor domain” (24Powdrill M.H. Bernatchez J.A. Götte M. Inhibitors of the Hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B.Viruses. 2010; 2: 2169-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the truncated PA subunit with and without BXA have shown that the inhibitor binds to the two metal ions with three oxygen atoms and a hydrophobic area contributing to this binding (19Omoto S.

This area is generally referred to as “specificity domain,” which provides selectivity for a specific target (Fig. 1).

In a recent trial, I38T/M/F substitutions appeared in 9.7% of patients receiving BXM (6Hayden F.G. Sugaya N. Hirotsu N. Lee N. de Jong M.D. Hurt A.C. Ishida T. Sekino H. Yamada K. Portsmouth S.

Med. 2018; 379: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The impact of these substitutions on BXM susceptibility has been explored using cell culture systems. Mutant viruses are associated with up to 50-fold increases in EC50 values with I38T showing the most significant effect (19Omoto S. Speranzini V. Hashimoto T. Noshi T. Yamaguchi H. Kawai M.

Here we studied BXA-mediated inhibition of recombinant influenza B (FluB) heterotrimeric PA/PB1/PB2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), referred to hereafter as FluB-ht. The biochemical data demonstrate that BXA can be classified as a tight binding inhibitor and that the I38T mutation diminishes these properties. The baculovirus expression system has been successfully used to express the RdRp complex of several segmented negative sense RNA viruses including human influenza B (15Reich S. Guilligay D. Pflug A.

Here we used this approach to generate WT FluB-ht, a variant associated with BXM resistance (FluB-ht PA I38T), and a variant containing a catalytically inactive endonuclease (FluB-ht PA QNQ) where metal coordinating residues were mutated (E81Q, D109 N, E120Q) (19Omoto S.

Chem. 2018; 26: 4544-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The three complexes were purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2A). Due to the similar molecular weight of the three domains comprising FluB-ht (PA, PB1, and PB2), the complex is seen as a single band on SDS PAGE (Fig. 2A). Diluting the sample helps to visualize three individual bands (26Tchesnokov E.P. Raeisimakiani P. Ngure M. Marchant D. Götte M. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of Ebola virus.Sci.

To evaluate the PA-mediated endonuclease activity of FluB-ht, we used an experimental design similar to that which has been previously described (15Reich S. Guilligay D. Pflug A. Malet H. Berger I.

Time-course experiments with each of the three enzymes are shown in Figure 2C. The cap-snatching reaction is initiated in the presence of Mg2+, which yields a 12-nt major product with cleavage after 5’G. Minor products represent a shorter 11-nt and a longer 14-nt RNA both with cleavage after 5’A. The three products are distinct from RNA background hydrolysis seen in the absence of enzyme. These control reactions show a faint hydrolysis product that migrates slightly faster than the major 12-nt product of the nuclease reaction. Differences in migration patterns are expected as nuclease products contain a 3’-hydroxyl group, while hydrolysis yields a negatively charged 3’-phosphate group. The FluB-ht PA I38T shows a very similar pattern as seen with the WT FluB-ht (Fig. 2C); however, a quantitative comparison of WT and PA I38T FluB-ht reveals a reduction of the overall activity of the PA I38T FluB-ht as has been noted by others (Fig. 2D) (19Omoto S. Speranzini V. Hashimoto T. Noshi T. Yamaguchi H. Kawai M. Kawaguchi K. Uehara T. Shishido T. Naito A. Cusack S. Characterization of influenza virus variants induced by treatment with the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 9633Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Finally, the active site mutant, FluB-ht PA QNQ, shows a complete loss of endonuclease activity (Fig. 2, C and D). This data rules out the presence of contaminating endonucleases, while the hot spots for hydrolysis are seen with all three enzyme preparations and controls in the absence of enzyme. To quantify inhibition of WT and PA I38T FluB-ht by BXA, we initially determined IC50 values of 112 nM and 374 nM for the WT and I38T variants, respectively (Fig. 3A). This represents an approximately threefold decrease in inhibition with the mutant enzyme. However, this IC50 value for WT FluB-ht is an order of magnitude higher than previously reported (5Noshi T. Kitano M. Taniguchi K. Yamamoto A. Omoto S. Baba K. Hashimoto T. Ishida K. Kushima Y. Hattori K. Kawai M. Yoshida R. Kobayashi M. Yoshinaga T. Sato A. et al.In vitro characterization of baloxavir acid, a first-in-class cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor of the influenza virus polymerase PA subunit.Antiviral Res. 2018; 160: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The concentrations of enzyme used in this earlier study were not indicated, which makes it difficult to compare the data (5Noshi T. Kitano M. Taniguchi K. Yamamoto A. Omoto S. Baba K. Hashimoto T. Ishida K. Kushima Y. Hattori K. Kawai M. Yoshida R. Kobayashi M. Yoshinaga T. Sato A. et al.In vitro characterization of baloxavir acid, a first-in-class cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor of the influenza virus polymerase PA subunit.Antiviral Res. 2018; 160: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The IC50 value of 112 nM measured in our experiments is similar to the enzyme concentration of 165 nM used in our assay. IC50 values for tight binding inhibitors are expected to increase with enzyme concentration (34Copeland R.A. A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. Enzymes.2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY2000: 104Google Scholar). Specifically, plots of IC50 as a function of enzyme concentration correspond to the linear function IC50 = ½ [E] + Kiapp (34Copeland R.A. A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. Enzymes.2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY2000: 104Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, IC50 values were determined for both WT and PA I38T FluB-ht at various concentrations of enzyme (Fig. 3B). Plots of IC50 as a function of enzyme concentration for both WT and PA I38T FluB-ht yielded linear plots with slopes of ∼0.5 (Fig. 3B), suggesting tight binding in both cases. However, the Kiapp of BXA for PA I38T of 217 nM is ∼18-fold increased with respect to WT FluB-ht (12 nM) (Fig. 3C). The lower this value, the higher the probability that tight binding is occurring. The ideal tight binding inhibitor would have an extrapolated Kiapp of zero resulting in the IC50 being equal to exactly half the enzyme concentration. Furthermore, this 18-fold difference in Kiapp is significantly larger than the initially observed threefold difference in IC50 that we obtained utilizing a single FluB-ht concentration (165 nM) illustrating the utility of this approach for the biochemical characterization of BXA and tight binding inhibitors in general. The observed IC50 values were independent within a narrow range of substrate concentrations (Fig. S1), which shows that the enzyme concentration is the only relevant variable that affects determination of IC50 values. Previous structural studies have shown that BXA binds to the active site of the isolated PA endonuclease domain (19Omoto S. Speranzini V. Hashimoto T. Noshi T. Yamaguchi H. Kawai M. Kawaguchi K. Uehara T. Shishido T. Naito A. Cusack S. Characterization of influenza virus variants induced by treatment with the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 9633Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, these complexes lack the RNA substrate. Structures of FluB-ht with bound inhibitor and RNA are also not available. For cleavage to occur, the RNA must traverse the active site in close proximity to bound metal ions. Hence, RNA binding can prevent or reduce inhibitor binding. To test this hypothesis, we performed time-course assays where the order of addition of inhibitor and substrate was varied.

https://openalex.org/W3134920837,"Background Patients with restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (RCM/HCM) and congenital heart disease (CHD) do not derive clinical benefit from inotropes and mechanical circulatory support. Concerns were expressed that the new heart allocation system implemented in October 2018 would disadvantage these patients. This paper aimed to examine the impact of the new adult heart allocation system on transplantation and outcomes among patients with RCM/HCM/CHD. Methods We identified adult patients with RCM/HCM/CHD in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database who were listed for or received a cardiac transplant from April 2017-June 2020. The cohort was separated into those listed before and after allocation system changes. Demographics and recipient characteristics, donor characteristics, waitlist survival, and post-transplantation outcomes were analyzed. Results The number of patients listed for RCM/HCM/CHD increased after the allocation system change from 429 to 517. Prior to the change, the majority RCM/HCM/CHD patients were Status 1A at time of transplantation; afterwards, most were Status 2. Wait times decreased significantly for all: RCM (41 days vs 27 days; P&lt;0.05), HCM (55 days vs 38 days; P&lt;0.05), CHD (81 days vs 49 days; P&lt;0.05). Distance traveled increased for all: RCM (76 mi. vs 261 mi, P&lt;0.001), HCM (88 mi. vs 231 mi. P&lt;0.001), CHD (114 mi vs 199 mi, P&lt;0.05). Rates of transplantation were higher for RCM and CHD (P&lt;0.01), whereas post-transplant survival remained unchanged. Conclusions The new allocation system has had a positive impact on time to transplantation of patients with RCM, HCM, and CHD without negatively influencing survival."

This study aimed to identify protein markers indicating the quality of beef during postmortem storage at 4°C. Beef longissimus dorsi samples were stored at 4°C. The meat water holding capacity (WHC), pH value and moisture content were determined at different time points during the storage period. The iTRAQ MS/MS approach was used to determine the proteomics profiling at 0, 3.5 and 7 d during storage at 4°C. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate the potential correlated proteins associated with meat quality. Storage at 4°C gradually decreased the pH value, WHC, and hence the moisture content. The iTRAQ proteomic analysis revealed that a cluster of glycolytic enzymes including malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic, L-lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase and pyruvate kinase, and another cluster of proteins involved in oxygen transport and binding (myoglobin) and hemoglobin complex (including Globin A1 and hemoglobin subunit alpha) were decreased during the postmortem storage. These results suggest that the decreased glycolysis, oxygen, and heme-binding activities might be associated with the beef muscle low quality and the decline of tenderness during postmortem storage at 4°C."

Sorting nexin 25 (SNX25) is an SNX family member and is reported to negatively regulate TGF-β signaling by enhancing TGF receptor degradation. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between SNX25 and the immune system. We knocked down SNX25 expression in macrophages and examined inflammatory cytokine expression, a hallmark of innate immunity, after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. SNX25 knockdown increased proinflammatory cytokine expression in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, SNX25 knockdown activated the NF-κB signal by promoting ubiquitination of IκBα. These results suggest that SNX25 inhibits the NF-κB signal and thereby regulates proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages."

In recent years, two main diagnostic tools have become available: Eustachian tube score (ETS-7) and computed tomography (CT) combined with Valsalva maneuver. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of ETS-7 and CT in a group of patients affected by middle ear atelectasis with a strong suspicion of ETD. Three males and nine females, affected by middle ear atelectasis with retraction of the TM were enrolled. Each patient underwent to Eustachian tube dysfunction evaluation adopting the ETS-7 score and a temporal bone CT with Valsalva maneuver. The ears analyzed at steady state were divided into 2 groups: ETS&lt;7 group and ETS≥ 7 group. The same division was applied for the ears analyzed after the Valsalva maneuver: ETS&lt;7 group and ETS≥ 7 group. ETs were categorized as “well defined” (WD) and “not defined” (ND). The results of the analysis of the ETS-7 score in all 24 ears showed that 42% presented ETS ≥7, while 58% had ETS &lt;7, indicating a diagnosis of ETD. In the ETS&lt;7 group after Valsalva, ET was visualized in 33% of patients. In the ETS≥7 group it was WD in 29% after the Valsalva manoeuver. In both groups the comparison between the visualization of the ET before and after the Valsalva manoeuver did not present a statistical difference. No correlation emerged between ET evaluation with CT scan during Valsalva maneuver and ETS-7 score. It confirms that there is not a gold standard for the study of ET dysfunction."

A disease-causing Eag1 mutation is linked to decreased protein stability that involves enhanced protein degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin 7 (CUL7). The general mechanisms governing protein homeostasis of plasma membrane- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Eag1 K+ channels, however, remain unclear. By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified another E3 ubiquitin ligase, makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1), as a novel binding partner primarily interacting with the carboxyl-terminal region of Eag1. MKRN1 mainly interacts with ER-localized immature core-glycosylated, as well as nascent nonglycosylated, Eag1 proteins. MKRN1 promotes polyubiquitination and ER-associated proteasomal degradation of immature Eag1 proteins. Although both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to ER quality control of immature core-glycosylated Eag1 proteins, MKRN1, but not CUL7, associates with and promotes degradation of nascent, nonglycosylated Eag1 proteins at the ER. In direct contrast to the role of CUL7 in regulating both ER and peripheral quality controls of Eag1, MKRN1 is exclusively responsible for the early stage of Eag1 maturation at the ER. We further demonstrated that both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to protein quality control of additional disease-causing Eag1 mutants associated with defective protein homeostasis.

The ether-à-go-go family of voltage-gated K+ channels comprises three gene subfamilies: eag (KV10), erg (eag-related gene) (KV11), and elk (eag-like K+ channel) (KV12) (1Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B.

In Drosophila, mutations in the eag gene manifest a hyperexcitable phenotype in which fly legs shake extensively under ether anesthesia (11Ganetzky B. Wu C.F. Neurogenetic analysis of potassium currents in Drosophila: Synergistic effects on neuromuscular transmission in double mutants.J. Neurogenet. 1983; 1: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Knockout of the Eag1 channel function in mice, however, fails to result in any marked phenotype other than a modest synaptic hyperactivity (12Ufartes R. Schneider T. Mortensen L.S. de Juan Romero C.

Genet. 2013; 22: 2247-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, knockdown of Eag1 in zebrafish reveals a severe disruption in the development of the central nervous system (13Stengel R. Rivera-Milla E. Sahoo N. Ebert C. Bollig F. Heinemann S.H.

Consistent with the observation in zebrafish, mutations in the human gene encoding Eag1 (KCNH1) were recently reported in individuals with two congenital neurodevelopmental disorders: Temple–Baraitser syndrome (TMBTS) (14Simons C.

TMBTS is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, dysmorphic facial features, and broad thumbs and great toes with absent/hypoplastic nails; whereas ZLS is characterized by facial dysmorphism including coarsening of the face and a large nose, gingival enlargement, intellectual disability, hypoplasia of terminal phalanges and nails, and hypertrichosis. This correlation between KCNH1 mutations and the clinical presentation of TMBTS/ZLS highlights a potentially important role of Eag1 during the development of the brain. We have previously demonstrated that a ZLS-causing mutant Eag1 channel (G469R) is associated with significant reduction in total protein level (17Hsu P.H. Ma Y.T. Fang Y.C. Huang J.J. Gan Y.L. Chang P.T. Jow G.M. Tang C.Y. Jeng C.J. Cullin 7 mediates proteasomal and lysosomal degradations of rat Eag1 potassium channels.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40825Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of a disrupted Eag1 protein homeostasis. Protein homeostasis (also known as proteostasis) refers to the property of a subcellular system that regulates and maintains a stable balance of protein synthesis and degradation (18Douglas P.M. Dillin A. Protein homeostasis and aging in neurodegeneration.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Protein homeostatic regulation plays a critical role in determining the optimal expression level of endogenous K+ channels in neurons, which in turn may set the network excitability in a wide variety of different neural circuits in the brain (19Misonou H. Homeostatic regulation of neuronal excitability by K(+) channels in normal and diseased brains.Neuroscientist. 2010; 16: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the molecular regulation of Eag1 protein homeostasis. Previously, we reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin 7 (CUL7) promotes proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)- and plasma membrane-localized Eag1 proteins, respectively (17Hsu P.H. Ma Y.T. Fang Y.C. Huang J.J. Gan Y.L. Chang P.T. Jow G.M. Tang C.Y. Jeng C.J. Cullin 7 mediates proteasomal and lysosomal degradations of rat Eag1 potassium channels.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40825Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we present the identification of another novel binding partner of Eag1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1; also known as RNF61). The results from our biochemical and biophysical analyses are consistent with the idea that MKRN1 contributes to protein quality control of Eag1 K+ channels, as well as ER-associated degradation of disease-causing misfolded Eag1 proteins. To search for the protein machinery responsible for homeostatic regulation of the Eag1 K+ channel, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library by using the cytoplasmic carboxyl (C)-terminal region of rat Eag1 as the bait. Two of the positive clones isolated by the screening correspond to MKRN1, which belongs to the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase family and contains both the RING-finger E2-binding domain and the substrate-binding domain in the same protein (20Gray T.A.

In addition to regulating protein homeostasis, MKRN1 may also interact with RNA-binding proteins and contribute to mRNA quality control (21Cassar P.A. Carpenedo R.L. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Olsen J.B.

There are two MKRN1 isoforms, the full-length, long isoform (isoform 1; 482 amino acids in human; 481 amino acids in rat) and the C-terminal truncated, short isoform (MKRN1-S; isoform 2; 329 amino acids in both human and rat), both of which are abundantly expressed in the brain (20Gray T.A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 1322-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Importantly, only the long isoform of MKRN1 contains the complete structural domains required for the E3 ubiquitin ligase function (24Miroci H. Schob C. Kindler S. Olschlager-Schutt J. Fehr S. Jungenitz T. Schwarzacher S.W. Bagni C. Mohr E. Makorin ring zinc finger protein 1 (MKRN1), a novel poly(A)-binding protein-interacting protein, stimulates translation in nerve cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 1322-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The protein sequences of the two rat MKRN1 clones isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening correspond to the partial segments (amino acids 142–481 and 355–481) of the long isoform and are virtually absent in the short isoform, suggesting that Eag1 may mainly interact with the MKRN1 long isoform. To address this possibility, we went on to perform the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Rat Eag1 was coexpressed with either Myc-tagged rat MKRN1 long isoform (Myc-MKRN1) or Myc-tagged rat MKRN1 short isoform (Myc-MKRN1-S) in HEK293T cells. By employing both the anti-Myc and the anti-Eag1 antibodies for immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate in Figure 1A that only the long isoform of MKRN1, but not the short isoform, was co-immunoprecipitated with Eag1. We also generated a GST fusion protein encoding the C-terminal region (amino acids 355–481) of the MKRN1 long isoform (GST-MKRN1-C) and performed GST pull-down assay using rat brain lysates. As shown in Figure 1B, endogenous Eag1 protein in the brain lysates was readily precipitated by GST-MKRN1-C. Additionally, endogenous MKRN1 and Eag1 coexist in the same protein complex in neurons (Fig. S1). The direct interaction between Eag1 and MKRN1 long isoform, but not the short isoform, in HEK293T cells was further validated by the in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Fig. 1C), which detects immunofluorescence signals generated from a pair of oligonucleotide-linked antibodies recognizing two proteins that are in close proximity (<40 nm) (25Fredriksson S. Gullberg M. Jarvius J. Olsson C. Pietras K. Gustafsdottir S.M. Ostman A. Landegren U. Protein detection using proximity-dependent DNA ligation assays.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 26Soderberg O. Leuchowius K.J. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Weibrecht I. Larsson L.G. Landegren U.

Cell Physiol. 2016; 310: C390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Together these observations indicate that Eag1 interacts primarily with the C-terminal region of the long isoform of MKRN1. The bait sequence used for screening the rat brain cDNA library corresponds to the cytoplasmic C-terminal region (amino acids 493–962) of rat Eag1, suggesting that MKRN1 probably interacts with the C-terminal region of Eag1. To test this hypothesis, we generated GST fusion proteins encoding either the amino (N)-terminal (GST-N207) or the C-terminal (GST-C0) region of rat Eag1 (Fig. 1D). Indeed, MKRN1 was effectively pulled down by the GST-Eag1 fusion protein GST-C0, but not by GST-N207. To further locate the MKRN1-interacting domain in Eag1, we generated three additional GST fusion proteins containing different Eag1 C-terminal domains: GST-C1 (amino acids 493–724), GST-C2 (amino acids 723–848), and GST-C3 (amino acids 835–962) (Fig. 1D). MKRN1 was efficiently pulled down by GST-C1, but not by GST-C2 and GST-C3, indicating that the proximal C-terminal region of Eag1 harbors the major MKRN1-interacting domain. The proximal C-terminal region of Eag1 contains a C-linker domain and a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD). We therefore made two additional GST fusion proteins that encode either the C-linker (GST-C1A: amino acid 493–560) or the CNBHD (GST-C1B: amino acids 561–722) region. As depicted in Figure 1D, MKRN1 preferentially binds to GST-C1B, implying that MKRN1 may directly interact with the Eag1 CNBHD. Upon close inspection of the PLA immunofluorescence signals of Eag1 and MKRN1 long isoform (Fig. 1C), which probably reflect the direct interaction of the two macromolecules, we noticed that the majority of the signals was localized at the cytoplasmic perinuclear region. Since properly folded, mature Eag1 proteins are generally considered plasma membrane ion channels, the foregoing PLA images appear to imply that MKRN1 mainly interacts with immature Eag1 proteins that either have yet to or even fail to reach the plasma membrane. To address this interesting possibility, we studied the effect of MKRN1 on Eag1 protein maturation in HEK293T cells. Eag1 harbors two consensus asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites (N388 and N406) (28Napp J. Monje F. Stuhmer W. Pardo L.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29506-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Importantly, the electrophoretic mobility pattern of Eag1 proteins on an immunoblot typically manifests as two major protein bands: i) a slower (high-molecular-weight) band “a” that corresponds to mature, full-glycosylated Eag1 proteins localized at the plasma membrane, and ii) a faster (low-molecular-weight) band “b” that represents immature, core-glycosylated Eag1 proteins at the ER (Fig. 2A) (17Hsu P.H. Ma Y.T. Fang Y.C. Huang J.J. Gan Y.L. Chang P.T. Jow G.M. Tang C.Y. Jeng C.J. Cullin 7 mediates proteasomal and lysosomal degradations of rat Eag1 potassium channels.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40825Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). By coexpressing Eag1 with MKRN1, we noticed the presence of another Eag1-associated low-molecular-weight protein band “c” (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no significant band c was detected when Eag1 was coexpressed with the noninteracting MKRN1-S (Fig. 2A). Since the apparent electrophoretic mobility of the MKRN1-induced Eag1 band c is significantly faster than that of immature, core-glycosylated Eag1 proteins (band b), it is possible that band c may correspond to nascent, nonglycosylated Eag1 proteins. To address this hypothesis, we employed an Eag1 mutant with the two consensus glycosylation asparagine residues mutated into glutamine (N388Q and N406Q; Eag1-QQ). Figure 2B shows that removing all N-linked oligosaccharides of Eag1 (both bands a and b) with the amidase PNGase F generates low-molecular-weight protein that appears to comigrate with the nonglycosylated Eag1-QQ mutant. Furthermore, cleaving high mannose oligosaccharides from immature, core-glycosylated Eag1 (band b) with Endo H also results in the presence of the Eag1-QQ-like, low-molecular-weight protein band (Fig. 2B). Mass spectrometry analyses of bands a, b, and c, as well as the single, deglycosylated band in response to PNGase F treatment, reveal that they indeed represent Eag1 proteins of distinct apparent molecular weights (Fig. S2; Table S1). Most importantly, all the above-mentioned nonglycosylated Eag1 protein bands share virtually identical electrophoretic mobility pattern with the MKRN1-induced Eag1 band c, consistent with the idea that band c represents nascent, nonglycosylated Eag1 proteins. How can MKRN1 enhance the presence of nascent, nonglycosylated Eag1 proteins? One possibility is that MKRN1 may promote the deglycosylation of core-glycosylated Eag1 and/or prevent the glycosylation of nascent Eag1. If this inference is true, MKRN1 would be expected to display a differential binding affinity between immature Eag1 (bands b and c) and mature Eag1 (band a). Indeed, Figure 2C illustrates that, compared with their mature counterpart, immature Eag1 proteins were more efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with MKRN1. In contrast, no discernible difference in the co-immunoprecipitation efficiency with MKRN1 was detected between immature Eag1 proteins (bands b and c) and the nonglycosylated Eag1-QQ mutant (Fig. 2D). Taken together, the foregoing results support the notion that MKRN1 preferentially interacts with immature Eag1 proteins that are probably located at the cytoplasm, such as the ER or the cis-Golgi apparatus. Next we asked whether MKRN1 may regulate protein homeostasis of Eag1 K+ channels. Upon siRNA or shRNA knockdown of endogenous MKRN1 expression in HEK293T cells, we observed a sizeable upregulation of total Eag1 protein level (Fig. 3, A and B; Fig. S3). A similar Eag1 upregulation effect was also detected when we knocked down endogenous MKRN1 expression in cultured cortical neurons (Fig. 3C). Conversely, overexpression of MKRN1, but not the short isoform (MKRN1-S) or a catalytically inactive MKRN1 construct with a point mutation in the E3 ligase domain (MKRN1-H307E) (29Lee E.W. Lee M.S. Camus S. Ghim J. Yang M.R. Oh W. Ha N.C. Lane D.P. Song J. Differential regulation of p53 and p21 by MKRN1 E3 ligase controls cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2100-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), results in a substantial reduction of both immature (bands b and c) and mature (band a) Eag1 proteins in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3D). Similarly, only MKRN1, but not MKRN1-S and MKRN1-H307E, impairs the functional expression of Eag1 K+ currents in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3E). MKRN1 fails to discernibly affect the biophysical property of Eag1 K+ channels, consistent with the idea that the observed reduction in membrane K+ conductance primarily reflects a disruption of Eag1 protein homeostasis by MKRN1. Moreover, in agreement with the aforementioned interaction of MKRN1 with the nonglycosylated Eag1-QQ mutant, coexpression with MKRN1 considerably decreases Eag1-QQ protein level (Fig. S4A). We then address the mechanism underlying the downregulation of Eag1 protein level by MKRN1. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses reveal that MKRN1 does not detectably affect the mRNA level of Eag1 (Fig. S5). This observation appears to rule out a potential transcriptional effect of MKRN1 on Eag1. Given its known role as a member of the RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase superfamily (20Gray T.A. Hernandez L. Carey A.H. Schaldach M.A. Smithwick M.J. Rus K. Marshall Graves J.A. Stewart C.L. Nicholls R.D. The ancient source of a distinct gene family encoding proteins featuring RING and C(3)H zinc-finger motifs with abundant expression in developing brain and nervous system.Genomics. 2000; 66: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we also explored the possibility that MKRN1 may affect Eag1 protein homeostasis by catalyzing the ubiquitination of the K+ channel. Figure 4A illustrates that, in response to coexpression with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub), basal Eag1 ubiquitination signal manifests as a faint, diffuse Eag1 protein smear conjugated with HA-Ub, consistent with the presence of Eag1 polyubiquitination in HEK293T cells. Importantly, overexpression of MKRN1 leads to a prominent enhancement of Eag1 polyubiquitination (Fig. 4A). Moreover, MKRN1 promotes polyubiquitination of the nonglycosylated Eag1-QQ mutant (Fig. S4B), further supporting the notion that glycosylation is not required for Eag1 regulation by MKRN1. In contrast, overexpression of either the short isoform MKRN1-S or the catalytically inactive mutant MKRN1-H307E fails to exert comparable ubiquitination-enhancing effect on Eag1 (Fig. 4B). Together these results suggest that MKRN1 effectively promotes Eag1 polyubiquitination, which leads to substantial downregulation of Eag1 protein level. To ascertain the detailed mechanism of Eag1 downregulation by MKRN1, we went on to study the effect of two distinct types of protein degradation blockers, the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Figure 5A demonstrates that, for both mature (band a) and immature (bands b and c) Eag1, the extent of protein downregulation by MKRN1 remains virtually the same in the absence or presence of CQ, suggesting against a mechanistic role of lysosomal degradation. Application of MG132 does not notably affect the downregulation of mature Eag1 by MKRN1 either (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, MG132 treatment effectively abolishes the suppression effect of MKRN1 on the protein level of immature Eag1 (Fig. 5B). The selective rescue effect of MG132 on immature but not mature Eag1 appears to imply that MKRN1 efficiently promotes proteasomal degradation of immature Eag1. Furthermore, although MG132 markedly rescues MKRN1-promoted degradation of immature Eag1, the majority of the rescued immature Eag1 bands b and c may be substantially misfolded and is thus prevented from protein maturation into the mature Eag1 band a. So far our data are consistent with the idea that MKRN1 preferentially interacts with and promotes degradation of immature Eag1, which suggests that both MKRN1 and immature Eag1 may be localized at the ER membrane. To directly address this hypothesis, we examined the subcellular localization of Eag1 and MKRN1 in HEK293T cells. Differential centrifugation analyses indicate that the ER-resident membrane protein calnexin, the plasma membrane protein cadherin, and Eag1 are exclusively present in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5C). Sucrose density gradient analyses further demonstrate that, in the absence of MKRN1, mature (band a) and immature (band b) Eag1 proteins were preferentially detected in the cadherin-enriched plasma membrane and the calnexin-enriched ER membrane fractions, respectively (Fig. 5C). In HEK293T cells, both endogenous and heterologously expressed MKRN1 display notable membrane association as well; moreover, in the presence of MKRN1, both immature Eag1 proteins (bands b and c) and MKRN1 are present in the calnexin-enriched ER membrane fraction ("

This paper proposes a framework, Blockchain Quality Controller (BCQC), to overcome these limitations while fortifying data security. BCQC utilizes blockchain and Internet-of-Things to form a peer-to-peer supervision network. This paper also proposes a consensus algorithm, Quality Defect Tolerance (QDT), to adopt blockchain for during-production quality control. Simulation results show that BCQC enhances data security and improves defect detections. Although the time taken for the quality control process increases with the number of nodes in blockchain, the application of QDT allows multiple inspections on a workpiece to be consolidated at a faster pace, effectively speeding up the entire quality control process. The BCQC and QDT can improve the quality of parts produced for mass personalization manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W3135019128,"Population assessments of wide-ranging, cryptic, terrestrial mammals rely on camera trap surveys. While camera trapping is a powerful method of detecting presence, it is difficult distinguishing rarity from low detection rate. The margay ( Leopardus wiedii ) is an example of a species considered rare based on its low detection rates across its range. Although margays have a wide distribution, detection rates with camera traps are universally low; consequently, the species is listed as Near Threatened. Our 12-year camera trap study of margays in protected broadleaf forest in Belize suggests that while margays have low detection rate, they do not seem to be rare, rather that they are difficult to detect with camera traps. We detected a maximum of 187 individuals, all with few or no recaptures over the years (mean = 2.0 captures/individual ± SD 2.1), with two-thirds of individuals detected only once. The few individuals that were recaptured across years exhibited long tenures up to 9 years and were at least 10 years old at their final detection. We detected multiple individuals of both sexes at the same locations during the same survey, suggesting overlapping ranges with non-exclusive territories, providing further evidence of a high-density population. By studying the sparse annual datasets across multiple years, we found evidence of an abundant margay population in the forest of the Cockscomb Basin, which might have been deemed low density and rare, if studied in the short term. We encourage more long-term camera trap studies to assess population status of semi-arboreal carnivore species that have hitherto been considered rare based on low detection rates."
https://openalex.org/W3133666507,"Skeletal muscle is responsible for the majority of glucose disposal following meals, and this is achieved by insulin-mediated trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane. The eight-protein exocyst trafficking complex facilitates targeted docking of membrane-bound vesicles, a process underlying the regulated delivery of fuel transporters. We previously demonstrated the role of exocyst subunit EXOC5 in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis and glucose uptake in cultured rat skeletal myoblasts. However, the in vivo role of EXOC5 in skeletal muscle remains unclear. Using mice with inducible, skeletal-muscle-specific knockout of exocyst subunit EXOC5 (Exoc5-SMKO), we examined how muscle-specific disruption of the exocyst would affect glucose homeostasis in vivo. We found that both male and female Exoc5-SMKO mice displayed elevated fasting glucose levels. Additionally, male Exoc5-SMKO mice had impaired glucose tolerance and lower serum insulin levels. Using indirect calorimetry, we observed that male Exoc5-SMKO mice have a reduced respiratory exchange ratio during the light period and lower energy expenditure. Using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method, we further showed that insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake is reduced in Exoc5-SMKO males compared with wild-type controls. Overall, our findings indicate that EXOC5 and the exocyst are necessary for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and regulate glucose homeostasis in vivo."

This study is a cross-sectional one using large-scale national data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey collected between 2010 and 2015 to evaluate 2,592 male wage workers (between the ages of 19 and 60 years). Obesity was defined as 25kg/m 2 or more and working hours per week were categorized into &lt;40, 40–49, 50–59, and ≥60 hours. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the odds ratio for association between working hours and obesity, after controlling for age, education, income, marital status, smoking, drinking, physical activity, daily energy intake, sleep duration, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, work schedule, and job category. Next, to study the mediating effect of sleep duration on the association between working hours and obesity, an analysis was performed using the Baron and Kenny method and the Sobel test. Results showed that workers with 50 to 59 hours had 1.4 times higher odds (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, confidence interval [CI]: 1.11–1.85) of obesity and workers with 60 hours or more had 1.4 times higher odds (OR = 1.4, CI: 1.06–1.90) of obesity than workers with less than 40 hours. Sleep was found to have a mediating effect on the association between working time and body mass index. Therefore, the results of this analysis suggest that practitioners should identify potential factors such as working time and sleeping time when preventing work-related obesity."

Objective The current study investigated characteristics of the midbrain at the anatomical plane for quantification of substantia nigra echogenicity. METHODS: Area of substantia nigra echogenicity, cross-sectional area of the midbrain, and interpeduncular angle were quantified in two groups of adults aged 18–50 years: 47 healthy non-drug-using controls (control group) and 22 individuals with a history of methamphetamine use (methamphetamine group), a cohort with a high prevalence of enlarged substantia nigra echogenicity and thus risk of Parkinson’s disease. Results In the control group, cross-sectional area of the midbrain (4.47±0.44 cm 2 ) and interpeduncular angle were unaffected by age, sex, or image acquisition side. In the methamphetamine group, cross-sectional midbrain area (4.72±0.60 cm 2 ) and area of substantia nigra echogenicity were enlarged compared to the control group, and the enlargement was sex-dependent (larger in males than females). Whole midbrain area and interpeduncular angle were found to be weak predictors of area of substantia nigra echogenicity after accounting for group and sex. Conclusions History of methamphetamine use is associated with an enlarged midbrain and area of substantia nigra echogenicity, and the abnormality is more pronounced in males than females. Thus, males may be more susceptible to methamphetamine-induced changes to the brainstem, and risk of Parkinson’s disease, than females."
https://openalex.org/W3134481555,"Rolling bearing fault diagnosis is one of the challenging tasks and hot research topics in the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. However, in practical engineering applications, the working conditions of rotating machinery are various, and it is difficult to extract the effective features of early fault due to the vibration signal accompanied by high background noise pollution, and there are only a small number of fault samples for fault diagnosis, which leads to the significant decline of diagnostic performance. In order to solve above problems, by combining Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) and Stacked Denoising Auto Encoder (SDAE), a novel method is proposed for fault diagnosis. Among them, during the process of training the ACGAN-SDAE, the generator and discriminator are alternately optimized through the adversarial learning mechanism, which makes the model have significant diagnostic accuracy and generalization ability. The experimental results show that our proposed ACGAN-SDAE can maintain a high diagnosis accuracy under small fault samples, and have the best adaptation performance across different load domains and better anti-noise performance."

However, the effectiveness of IVIM for the differentiation between pilocytic astrocytoma and ependymoma has not been verified. The aim of this study was to determine the potential diagnostic role of IVIM for the distinction between ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma. Methods Between February 2019 and October 2020, 22 children (15 males and 7 females; median age 4 years) with either ependymoma or pilocytic astrocytoma were recruited for this prospective study. IVIM parameters were fitted using 7 b-values (0–1,500 s/mm 2 ), to develop a bi-exponential model. The diffusivity (D), perfusion fraction ( f ), and pseudo diffusivity (D*) were measured in both tumors and the adjacent normal-appearing parenchyma. These IVIM parameters were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to assess diagnostic performance. Results The median D values for ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma were 0.87 and 1.25 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, whereas the f values were 0.11% and 0.15% (p &lt; 0.05). The ratios of the median D values for ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma relative to the median D values for the adjacent, normal-appearing parenchyma were 1.45 and 2.10 (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. ROC curve analysis found that the D value had the best diagnostic performance for the differentiation between pilocytic astrocytoma and ependymoma, with an area under the ROC curve of 1. Conclusion IVIM is a beneficial, effective, non-invasive, and endogenous-contrast imaging technique. The D value derived from IVIM was the most essential factor for differentiating ependymoma from pilocytic astrocytoma."
https://openalex.org/W3134190539,"Neotropic Cormorants ( Phalacrocorax brasilianus ) are common seabirds along the Peruvian coast. They frequently perch on trees, poles and port structures in urban areas, producing guano that builds up in areas of high levels of human activity. Hundreds of Neotropic Cormorants rest on lighting poles and telephone cables along a 12.7 km highway in the coastal strip of the city of Lima, Peru. We hypothesized that the distribution of the cormorants along this highway is clustered and could be associated with physical features of both the coast and the adjacent marine area. Fortnightly or monthly surveys were performed from July 2018 to March 2020 in the Circuito de Playas de la Costa Verde highway. At each survey, cormorants were counted per lighting pole and adjacent telephone cables (collectively, “pole-cable”) at four count hours (0600 h, 1000 h, 1400 h and 1800 h). Our results revealed that daily bird numbers varied from 46 to 457 individuals and that only 17% of the total number of pole-cables (N = 651) was occupied once by at least one individual. The number of cormorants also varied between count hours within the same day (higher numbers at 1000 h and 1400 h). Birds were clustered into a maximum of five hotspots along the highway. According to a model selection criterion, higher numbers of cormorants on pole-cables were associated mainly to a closer distance from these structures to the shoreline and to the surf zone, suggesting that Neotropic Cormorants may select such pole-cables as optimal sites for sighting and receiving cues of prey availability. Based on the results, the use of nonlethal deterrents and the relocation of these birds to other perching structures on nearby groynes could be the most suitable management proposal for the problems caused by their feces."
https://openalex.org/W3135381327,"In this paper, we use choice architecture techniques to activate both social and personal norms, seeking to increase pro-environmental choices and to better understand the effect of such norm types on post-choice emotional responses. In four experiments, we make different social or personal norms salient by aligning choice environments with psychosocial mechanisms that activate different types of norms. We use different choice architecture techniques to change information, alter product sets, and generate the social consequences of choices. The target behavior, purchasing a recycled paper notebook, is captured through direct purchase behaviors or willingness to pay commitments. We find that choice architecture activates personal but not social norms, and that associated positive and negative emotions (guilt, shame, regret and pride) are elicited by choices but not by willingness to pay. Moreover, manipulating choice environment moderates the relationship between choice and norm-related emotions, such that positive emotional responses seem to be stronger than negative ones. The results suggest that choice architecture interventions can activate individual level beliefs about sustainability and help reduce the attitude-behavior gap."

The high list prices for both drugs have led to concern about the budget impact for public drug coverage programs. Therefore, we studied the impact of public prescription drug coverage for both drugs on utilization, adherence, and public and private expenditure in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We used provincial administrative claims data from January 2014 to June 2017 for all individuals historically tested for either hepatitis C and/or human immunodeficiency virus. Using interrupted time series analysis, we examined the impact of public insurance coverage on treatment uptake, adherence (proportion of days covered), and public and private expenditures. Results Over our study period, 4,462 treatment initiations were eligible for analysis (1,131 sofosbuvir and 3,331 ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, which include 19 patients initiated on both treatments). We found the start of public coverage for sofosbuvir and ledipasvir-sofosbuvir increased treatment uptake by 154%. Adherence rates were consistently high and did not change with public coverage. Finally, public expenditure increased after the policy change, and crowded out some private expenditure. Conclusion Public coverage for high-cost drugs for hepatitis C dramatically increased use of these drugs, but did not reduce adherence. From a health policy perspective, public payers should be prepared for increased treatment uptake following the availability of public coverage. However, they should not be concerned that populations without private insurance coverage will be less adherent and not finish their treatment course."

Tissue Phase Mapping (TPM) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables discrete sampling of the myocardium's underlying smooth and continuous velocity field. This paper presents a post-processing framework for constructing a spatially and temporally smooth and continuous representation of the myocardium's velocity field from TPM data. In the proposed scheme, the velocity field is represented through either linear or cubic B-spline basis functions. The framework facilitates both interpolation and noise reducing approximation. As a proof-of-concept, the framework was evaluated using artificially noisy (i.e., synthetic) velocity fields created by adding different levels of noise to an original TPM data. The framework's ability to restore the original velocity field was investigated using Bland-Altman statistics. Moreover, we calculated myocardial material point trajectories through temporal integration of the original and synthetic fields. The effect of noise reduction on the calculated trajectories was investigated by assessing the distance between the start and end position of material points after one complete cardiac cycle (end point error). We found that the Bland-Altman limits of agreement between the original and the synthetic velocity fields were reduced after application of the framework. Furthermore, the integrated trajectories exhibited consistently lower end point error. These results suggest that the proposed method generates a realistic continuous representation of myocardial velocity fields from noisy and discrete TPM data. Linear B-splines resulted in narrower limits of agreement between the original and synthetic fields, compared to Cubic B-splines. The end point errors were also consistently lower for Linear B-splines than for cubic. Linear B-splines therefore appear to be more suitable for TPM data."

Body Mass Index (BMI) at baseline was used to classify women as having normal weight, overweight, obese class I, obese class II or obese class III. Cox proportional hazards was used to estimate the hazard of a 10% or more increase in weight from baseline.In both crude and adjusted models, NHBs were more likely to experience ≥10% weight gain than NHWs within the same category of baseline weight status. Moreover, NHBs who were normal weight at baseline were most likely to experience ≥10% weight gain in both crude and adjusted models. Age-stratified results were consistent with overall findings. In all age categories, NHBs who were normal weight at baseline were most likely to experience ≥10% weight gain. Based on the results of adjusted models, the joint influence of NHB race/ethnicity and weight status on risk of postmenopausal weight gain was both sub-additive and sub-multiplicative.NHBs are more likely to experience postmenopausal weight gain than NHWs, and the disparity in risk is most pronounced among those who are normal weight at baseline.

https://openalex.org/W3134786318,"Host preference of symbionts evolves from fitness trade-offs. However, it is often unclear how interspecific variations in host response traits influence this evolutionary process. Using the association between the polyclad flatworm Paraprostatum echinolittorinae and its intertidal snail hosts on the Pacific Coast of Panama, we assessed how a symbiont’s host preference is associated with varying host defenses and post-infestation performances. We first characterized the prevalence and intensity of worm infestation in five snail hosts ( Tegula pellisserpentis , Nerita scabricosta , N . funiculata , Planaxis planicostatus , and Cerithium stercusmuscarum ). We then used manipulative experiments to test flatworm’s host choice, hosts’ behavioral rejection of flatworms, and hosts’ growth and survival following the infestation. In the field, flatworms were orders of magnitude more prevalent and dense in T . pellisserpentis , N . scabricosta , N . funiculata than P . planicostatus and C . stercusmuscarum , although the three former hosts were not necessarily more abundant. The results from our laboratory host selection trials mirrored these patterns; flatworms were 3 to 14 times more likely to choose T . pellisserpentis , N . scabricosta , N . funiculata over P . planicostatus and C . stercusmuscarum . The less preferred hosts frequently rejected flatworms via mantle contractions and foot withdrawals, which reduced the infestation rate by 39%−67%. These behaviors were less frequent or absent in the preferred hosts. Flatworm infestation variably influenced host performances in the field, negligibly affecting the growth and survival of T . pellisserpentis and N . funiculata but reducing the growth of P . planicostatus . Flatworms thus preferred less defended hosts that can also support higher worm densities without being harmed. Stable isotope analysis further revealed that flatworms are unlikely to feed on snail tissues and may live as a commensal in their preferred hosts. Our study demonstrates that host response traits can modulate a symbiont’s host choice and calls for more explicit considerations of host response variability in host preference research."

Methods This study included 10,692 participants (9,905, 609, and 178, never, ever, and current EC users, respectively). Urinary cotinine and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) levels were used to determine conventional smoking exposure among EC users. The association between EC use and UA level was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between EC and HUA. Subgroup analysis confined to cotinine-verified active smokers was performed to address the association between the dual use of EC and combustible cigarettes and serum UA levels. Results The serum UA level was highest among current EC users, followed by ever and never EC users. The prevalence of HUA was 26.2%, 19.3%, and 10.8% in current, ever, and never EC users, respectively. Although EC exposure was positively associated with HUA in a dose-dependent manner only in men ( P trend = 0.04), a similar tendency was also observed in women with marginal significance ( P trend = 0.102). The positive association of HUA with EC exposure was more apparent among dual users (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29–2.99) than among those who only smoked combustible cigarettes.
