https://openalex.org/W2055383210,"Adenyl cyclase from plasma membrane fractions of rat renal cortex or medulla was assayed by measuring conversion of adenosine triphosphate labeled at the alpha-phosphate with (32)P to cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate labeled with 32P. Parathyroid hormone activated the enzyme primarily in cortex; vasopressin acted primarily in medulla. These experiments support the conclusion that cyclic adenosine monophosphate mediates the action of parathyroid hormone on the kidney and show that parathyroid hormone and vasopressin stimulate adenyl cyclase at anatomically separable areas within the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2090569361,Absorption spectra characteristic of diene conjugation and typical for peroxidized polyenoic fatty acids can be induced in rat lung lipids after the rats have been exposed to a scant amount of nitrogen dioxide (1 part per million) for 4 hours. The peroxidative changes do not occur immediately but appear to reach a maximum between 24 and 48 hours after exposure. The prooxidant effect of this atmospheric pollutant in rat lung lipids may be partially prevented by prior treatment of the animal with large doses of alpha-tocopherol.

https://openalex.org/W1501304658,"Abstract A study of the activation of several long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids by rat liver preparations was undertaken. Investigation of reaction requirements and appropriate modifications revealed that rat liver is extremely active in long chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase or synthetases (acid: CoA ligase (AMP), EC 6.2.1.3) activity. With palmitate as substrate, the cell membrane fraction was found richest in activating enzyme, with the microsomal fraction next. In the microsomal activation of saturated fatty acids, maximal activity was reached with palmitate. The coenzyme A requirements found were very similar with palmitate, stearate, and erucate (Km 3.3 to 3.9 x 10-5 m), but these were markedly different from the coenzyme A requirements with oleate, linoleate, linolenate, and arachidonate (Km 1.56 to 3.3 x 10-4 m); this suggests the possible occurrence of at least two different long chain acyl-CoA synthetases in rat liver microsomes. In experiments with oleate, linoleate, linolenate, and arachidonate, the activating enzyme was found to be markedly susceptible to substrate inhibition, which complicated exact assay. The stimulation of activation of these unsaturated fatty acids by a heated microsomal fraction was traced mainly to their fatty acid-binding ability. Liver phospholipids greatly stimulated oleate activation, and this was thought to be due to the association of oleate with phospholipid. For the palmitate-activating enzyme, it appeared that bound phospholipid was essential for activity."
https://openalex.org/W2010618115,"How do we manage to recognize immediately, and to recall without effort, familiar words, sentences and other behavioural sequences? I suggest that we employ a system which is the temporal analogue of optical holography1–3. The analogy between holography and visual memory has already attracted attention in the literature, but this is not quite the thought that I shall pursue here ; rather I shall consider the time dimension, because any perceptual event must certainly be associated with cerebral happenings which are extended not only in space but in time. If a system of this kind were indeed used by the brain, not only would some familiar phenomena of perception be naturally explained, but the cells or cell clusters responsible for laying down sensory information should have a certain property which might be accessible to experimental test."

The detected x-ray spectrum emitted from an unknown sample can be recorded with a multichannel analyzer in approximately 60 seconds.
https://openalex.org/W1601880438,"Abstract Extracts of a pseudomonad isolated from soil have two halidohydrolases, one induced by chloroacetate, the other by dichloroacetate. Both enzymes have been partially purified and each catalyzes a variety of dehalogenations which conform to the general equation l-RCHXCOO- + OH- → d-RCHOHCOO- + X- where X = Cl or I. Like haloacetate halidohydrolase, these enzymes have a pH optimum of 9.0 to 9.4 and utilize the hydroxyl group from water to replace the halogen in the substrate. The inversion of the configuration which occurs during the dehalogenation of optically active substrates gives additional insight into the mechanism of this type of reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1484091111,"Abstract Parke-Davis bovine thrombin was resolved into three distinct protein peaks on a Sephadex G-200 column. A stepwise chromatographic technique on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose was developed for the complete separation and partial purification of thrombin and activated Factor X. Thrombin was quantitatively eluted in the first protein peak with 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0. A second peak with residual thrombin activity, containing more than 65% of the applied protein, was eluted with 0.14 m NaCl in 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.8. When this fraction was rechromatographed, to remove the residual thrombin, Factors II, VII, IX, and nonactivated X were detected in this peak. Activated Factor X was eluted from the column with 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 5.8. This activated Factor X fraction did not clot a standard fibrinogen solution during 24 hours either at 22° or 37°, with or without added calcium, nor after removal of the citrate by dialysis against 0.14 m NaCl. The DEAE-cellulose-chromatographed thrombin was further purified by Sephadex G-200 chromatography. More than 68% of the resulting thrombin peak had a constant specific activity of approximately 7000 National Institutes of Health units per mg of tyrosine. At high dilutions, when the thrombin activity in the commercial bovine thrombin preparation was negligible, the activated Factor X activity was still detectable in appreciable quantity. The purified thrombin fraction was free of plasminogen and plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1990042563,"Populations of eggs of the moth Pectinophora gossypiella develop a circadian rhythm of hatching activity under certain circumstances. This rhythm derives from circadian oscillations in each egg, which can be initiated or made synchronous by steps or pulses of either light or temperature, but only if these signals are administered after the midpoint of embryogenesis. Correlations between the development of the oscillation, appearance of a pigment, sensitivity to photoperiodic induction, and a possible effect of light on growth rate are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2059794431,Cells of the presumptive forebrain region and axial mesoderm of Triturus neurulae were disaggregated and combined in different ratios. The differentiation of the central nervous systen in these explants was dependent on the relative amount of mesodermal cells present: an increase of mesodermal cells resulted in a corresponding increase in the frequency with which caudal structures of the central nervous system developed and a gradual loss of the forebrain formations.
https://openalex.org/W1608362386,"Abstract Sodium citrate extracts of acetone-ether-defatted rabbit, bovine, and human central nervous system tissue were chromatographed on carboxymethyl cellulose and Sephadex G-50. From each of these three tissues a protein was isolated which produced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in 90% of recipient rabbits. The disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic pattern of the protein was consistent with a high degree of homogeneity. The basic amino acids constituted nearly 25% of the total. There was no half-cystine and only traces of methionine and isoleucine. Phenylalanine accounted for 90% or more of the amino-terminal amino acids, and tryptic digestion of the untreated protein gave 8 to 10 major peptide spots. The sedimentation of the protein in a 10 to 20% sucrose gradient, its elution volume from a Sephadex G-50 column, and calculations based on the results of amino acid analysis and dinitrophenylation were all consistent with a molecular weight of 4000 to 8000."

https://openalex.org/W1585764277,"Abstract The titration of the histidyl and lysyl residues has been investigated in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, in apohemoglobin, and in the isolated polypeptide chains with sulfhydryl groups blocked by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (αpmb and βpmb). The number of titratable histidyl residues was found to be 5 or 6 per chain in hemoglobin and probably 7 in apohemoglobin and in the isolated αpmb and βpmb chains. This indicates that the number of titratable histidines per heme increased by 1 or 2 units per heme when the heme was removed or when the αpmb and βpmb chains were separated. The protonation of these new exposed residues was irrelevant to the helical structure of hemoglobin. The pKint of the lysine residues appeared to vary in the different proteins, being 10.6 in hemoglobin, 10.2 in apohemoglobin, 10.5 in the βpmb chains, and 10.3 in the αpmb chains. The difference shown between hemoglobin and apohemoglobin could indicate that the ionization of some groups in this class is sensitive to conformational changes. The difference in protons bound between apohemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin is consistent with the presence of at least 1 more histidyl residue in apohemoglobin and with a difference in the pK of some e-NH2 group. The difference in protons bound by ferrihemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin proved to be essentially accounted for by the ionization of the water molecule coordinated with the trivalent iron atom."

https://openalex.org/W2006693911,"When a bright light flash is absorbed by a small region in the outer segments of squid photoreceptors fixed in glutaraldehyde, a brief pulse of membrane current flows locally. The passive spreading of this current along the outer segments produces the photochemical component of the ""early receptor potential."" The source of the current lies electrically in parallel with the cell membranes and perhaps is located within them. Fixation with glutaraldehyde apparently does not reduce the resistance of the cell membrane to less than 5 percent of its value in live cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562412793,"Abstract The nuclear magnetic resonance line widths of water sorbed on solid bovine serum albumin have been determined as functions of temperature and water content of the albumin samples. The results indicate that, depending on its amount, the sorbed water may exist in three different states or arrangements. The first of these involves direct binding of water molecules to available polar groups on the protein, with water-water interactions being of relatively little significance. The addition of more water allows interactions among the water molecules and leads to the formation of a hydration shell, the structure of which is markedly different from that of liquid water and is determined by the protein substrate. At any temperature there is a water content past which the influence of the protein becomes of less importance than the interactions of water molecules among themselves, the hydration shell structure is disrupted, and the water structure approaches that of liquid water. The amount of water strongly influenced by the solid protein is apparently less than that for the protein in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1591165246,"The natural quinone, II-dihydromenaquinone-9 (MK9(II-H)), from Mycobacterium phlei has been resolved into two components by adsorption thin layer chromatography. Chemical analysis of the separated products indicated that they were both 1,4-naphthoquinones of the MK9(II-H) type, differing only in the geometry of the double bond in the ring-terminal isoprene unit. By nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy it was possible to show that the major component was all-trans-MK9(II-H), while the minor product was the 3'-methyl-cis-MK9(2H) isomer. This new quinone appeared to be biologically active, since tritium was incorporated into the cis isomer. In contrast, very little incorporation of tritium was found in the trans isomer. Furthermore, the incorporation into the cis isomer was phosphate-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1556274297,"Abstract 1. The inhibition of Pseudomonas tryptophan oxygenase by carbon monoxide is competitive with respect to oxygen and is photodissociable. The photochemical action spectrum, with a maximum at 421 mµ, is identical with the Soret absorption spectrum of the tryptophan-carboxyferroprotoporphyrin-enzyme complex. Thus both carbon monoxide and oxygen bind to the heme moiety of tryptophan oxygenase. 2. Equilibrium studies indicate that the affinity of carbon monoxide for the ferroprotoporphyrin of the enzyme is markedly enhanced by the presence of the substrate, tryptophan. The augmentation in binding of carbon monoxide to the enzyme is a sigmoidal function of the tryptophan concentration. α-Methyltryptophan, a nonmetabolizable noninhibitory substrate analogue, which binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme, also enhances the affinity of the enzyme for carbon monoxide. The facilitation of carbon monoxide binding to the enzyme by the combined action of low levels of tryptophan and α-methyltryptophan is synergistic, suggesting an interaction between the catalytic and allosteric sites. 3. Chemically reduced enzyme is only slowly reoxidized in the absence of tryptophan, without the spectral appearance of an oxygenated intermediary. 4. Freshly generated ferriprotoporphyrin enzyme is as catalytically active as ferroprotoporphyrin enzyme in both the absence and the presence of ascorbic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1572814777,"Abstract The transglutaminase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate is effectively inhibited, in the absence of nucleophilic amine, by another substrate for the enzyme, benzyloxycarbonyl- (Z)-l-glutaminylglycine. Kinetic evaluation of this inhibition, with consideration of the dependence on calcium ion concentration and of previous studies of the amine transfer reaction, indicates that glutamine substrate is reversibly bound to different calcium-activated forms of the enzyme in the presence and in the absence of amine. The Ki value for Z-l-glutaminylglycine as an inhibitor of the esterolysis reaction was estimated to be 1.92 ± 0.5 x 10-3 m at pH 7.0. Examination of the calcium-dependent transglutaminase-catalyzed hydrolysis of Z-l-glutaminylglycine at two pH levels showed that the mechanism of hydrolysis conforms to that suggested by the esterolysis inhibition studies. The calcium ion requirements for hydrolysis were found to be very different from those for the amine transfer reaction. The Ka values of calcium in the hydrolysis reaction, estimated as 0.6 x 10-3 m at pH 7.0 and as 2.5 x 10-3 m at pH 5.4, are significantly lower than the Ka values of calcium reported for the amine transfer reaction and the Kd values derived from calcium-induced conformational changes in the enzyme protein. Agreement of the Km values for Z-l-glutaminylglycine at two pH levels in the hydrolysis reaction (approximately 2 x 10-3 m) with the Ki value for this Z-dipeptide as an inhibitor of esterolysis is consistent with the assumption that the hydrolysis reaction proceeds by an equilibrium mechanism. The effects of glutamine substrate on the rate of reaction between iodoacetamide and an essential sulfhydryl group of calcium-activated transglutaminase were investigated. The second order rate constant for reaction of the inactivator with this essential —SH group was found to be 96 x 103 liters mole-1 min-1, either in the presence or in the absence of hydroxylamine. Studies of the calcium ion requirement for this inactivation indicated that only the form of the enzyme in which metal ion is bound at both metal-binding positions reacts with iodoacetamide under the experimental conditions used. The decrease in reactivity of the essential —SH group resulting from Z-l-glutaminylglycine binding was found to be very different in the absence and in the presence of hydroxylamine. In the absence of amine the rate was decreased to about one-half that observed without substrate, whereas in the presence of amine the essential group appeared to be protected from reaction with iodoacetamide. These manifest differences, which are a function of steric changes induced by substrate binding, are in accord with the kinetic evidence for different mechanisms of substrate binding in the hydrolysis and amine transfer reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1581694468,"Abstract The action of partially purified l-threonine dehydratase of sheep liver on l-serine has been studied. This enzyme acts on l-serine as a substrate but is rapidly inactivated in the process, partially at pH 8.9 and more completely at pH 7.2. However, incubation at pH 8.9, with or without l-threonine, leads to a gradual restoration of up to 90% of the original activity. The addition of pyridoxal phosphate to the inactive enzyme solution has no effect on the activity or rate of reactivation at pH 8.9. However, at pH 7.2, the addition of pyridoxal phosphate leads to a tripling of the small activity toward l-threonine. These observations are discussed in terms of the proposed formation of an oxazolidine ring between serine and bound coenzyme. The enzyme is inactive in an environment of low ionic strength. The immediate addition of potassium phosphate restores the activity to desalted enzyme. The amount of restoration by potassium phosphate depends on the time of its addition, for a slower, irreversible inactivation also occurs."
