https://openalex.org/W3015916968,"Our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology remains incomplete. Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry and coexpression network analysis to conduct the largest proteomic study thus far on AD. A protein network module linked to sugar metabolism emerged as one of the modules most significantly associated with AD pathology and cognitive impairment. This module was enriched in AD genetic risk factors and in microglia and astrocyte protein markers associated with an anti-inflammatory state, suggesting that the biological functions it represents serve a protective role in AD. Proteins from this module were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in early stages of the disease. In this study of >2,000 brains and nearly 400 cerebrospinal fluid samples by quantitative proteomics, we identify proteins and biological processes in AD brains that may serve as therapeutic targets and fluid biomarkers for the disease."

https://openalex.org/W3015621743,"The foundational adenine base editors (for example, ABE7.10) enable programmable A•T to G•C point mutations but editing efficiencies can be low at challenging loci in primary human cells. Here we further evolve ABE7.10 using a library of adenosine deaminase variants to create ABE8s. At NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites, ABE8s result in ~1.5× higher editing at protospacer positions A5-A7 and ~3.2× higher editing at positions A3-A4 and A8-A10 compared with ABE7.10. Non-NGG PAM variants have a ~4.2-fold overall higher on-target editing efficiency than ABE7.10. In human CD34+ cells, ABE8 can recreate a natural allele at the promoter of the γ-globin genes HBG1 and HBG2 with up to 60% efficiency, causing persistence of fetal hemoglobin. In primary human T cells, ABE8s achieve 98-99% target modification, which is maintained when multiplexed across three loci. Delivered as messenger RNA, ABE8s induce no significant levels of single guide RNA (sgRNA)-independent off-target adenine deamination in genomic DNA and very low levels of adenine deamination in cellular mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W3015315508,"Hexanucleotide expansions in C9orf72, which encodes a predicted guanine exchange factor, are the most frequent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although repeat expansion has been established to generate toxic products, mRNAs encoding the C9ORF72 protein are also reduced in affected individuals. In this study, we tested how C9ORF72 protein levels affected repeat-mediated toxicity. In somatic transgenic mice expressing 66 GGGGCC repeats, inactivation of one or both endogenous C9orf72 alleles provoked or accelerated, respectively, early death. In mice expressing a C9orf72 transgene with 450 repeats that did not encode the C9ORF72 protein, inactivation of one or both endogenous C9orf72 alleles exacerbated cognitive deficits, hippocampal neuron loss, glial activation and accumulation of dipeptide-repeat proteins from translation of repeat-containing RNAs. Reduced C9ORF72 was shown to suppress repeat-mediated elevation in autophagy. These efforts support a disease mechanism in ALS/FTD resulting from reduced C9ORF72, which can lead to autophagy deficits, synergizing with repeat-dependent gain of toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3016102542,"While CNS microglia have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about macrophages populating the peripheral nervous system. Here we performed ontogenic, transcriptomic and spatial characterization of sciatic nerve macrophages (snMacs). Using multiple fate-mapping systems, we show that snMacs do not derive from the early embryonic precursors colonizing the CNS, but originate primarily from late embryonic precursors and become replaced by bone-marrow-derived macrophages over time. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identified a tissue-specific core signature of snMacs and two spatially separated snMacs: Relmα+Mgl1+ snMacs in the epineurium and Relmα–Mgl1– snMacs in the endoneurium. Globally, snMacs lack most of the core signature genes of microglia, with only the endoneurial subset expressing a restricted number of these genes. In response to nerve injury, the two resident snMac populations respond differently. Moreover, and unlike in the CNS, monocyte-derived macrophages that develop during injury can engraft efficiently in the pool of resident peripheral nervous system macrophages. The authors identify two subsets of peripheral nerve macrophages residing in the endoneurium and the epineurium and displaying a distinct transcriptome and response to injury. These cells lack the main microglia identity and have a distinct origin."
https://openalex.org/W3015496474,"Among the most urgent public health threats is the worldwide emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae1-4, which are resistant to the antibiotic class of 'last resort'. In the United States and Europe, carbapenem-resistant strains of the Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 (ref. 5) sequence type are dominant, endemic6-8 and associated with high mortality6,9,10. We report the global evolution of pathogenicity in carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, resulting in the repeated convergence of virulence and carbapenem resistance in the United States and Europe, dating back to as early as 2009. We demonstrate that K. pneumoniae can enhance its pathogenicity by adopting two opposing infection programs through easily acquired gain- and loss-of-function mutations. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the capsule biosynthesis gene wzc lead to hypercapsule production, which confers phagocytosis resistance, enhanced dissemination and increased mortality in animal models. In contrast, mutations disrupting capsule biosynthesis genes impair capsule production, which enhances epithelial cell invasion, in vitro biofilm formation and persistence in urinary tract infections. These two types of capsule mutants have emerged repeatedly and independently in Europe and the United States, with hypercapsule mutants associated with bloodstream infections and capsule-deficient mutants associated with urinary tract infections. In the latter case, drug-tolerant K. pneumoniae can persist to yield potentially untreatable, persistent infection."
https://openalex.org/W3015449951,"Heightened aggression is characteristic of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and can have various negative effects on patients, their families and the public. Recent studies in humans and animals have implicated brain reward circuits in aggression and suggest that, in subsets of aggressive individuals, domination of subordinate social targets is reinforcing. In this study, we showed that, in male mice, orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus activated a small population of glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (GAD2)-expressing neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb) via orexin receptor 2 (OxR2) and that activation of these GAD2 neurons promoted male–male aggression and conditioned place preference for aggression-paired contexts. Moreover, LHb GAD2 neurons were inhibitory within the LHb and dampened the activity of the LHb as a whole. These results suggest that the orexin system is important for the regulation of inter-male aggressive behavior and provide the first functional evidence of a local inhibitory circuit within the LHb. Flanigan et al. show that activation of inhibitory neurons in the lateral habenula by the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) promotes both inter-male aggression and conditioned place preference for contexts associated with winning aggressive contests."
https://openalex.org/W3015971553,"Gene expression programs change over time, differentiation and development, and in response to stimuli. However, nearly all techniques for profiling gene expression in single cells do not directly capture transcriptional dynamics. In the present study, we present a method for combined single-cell combinatorial indexing and messenger RNA labeling (sci-fate), which uses combinatorial cell indexing and 4-thiouridine labeling of newly synthesized mRNA to concurrently profile the whole and newly synthesized transcriptome in each of many single cells. We used sci-fate to study the cortisol response in >6,000 single cultured cells. From these data, we quantified the dynamics of the cell cycle and glucocorticoid receptor activation, and explored their intersection. Finally, we developed software to infer and analyze cell-state transitions. We anticipate that sci-fate will be broadly applicable to quantitatively characterize transcriptional dynamics in diverse systems."
https://openalex.org/W3015906309,"Although immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, only a subset of patients demonstrate durable clinical benefit. Definitive predictive biomarkers and targets to overcome resistance remain unidentified, underscoring the urgency to develop reliable immunocompetent models for mechanistic assessment. Here we characterize a panel of syngeneic mouse models, representing a variety of molecular and phenotypic subtypes of human melanomas and exhibiting their diverse range of responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Comparative analysis of genomic, transcriptomic and tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles demonstrated alignment with clinical observations and validated the correlation of T cell dysfunction and exclusion programs with resistance. Notably, genome-wide expression analysis uncovered a melanocytic plasticity signature predictive of patient outcome in response to ICB, suggesting that the multipotency and differentiation status of melanoma can determine ICB benefit. Our comparative preclinical platform recapitulates melanoma clinical behavior and can be employed to identify mechanisms and treatment strategies to improve patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3015450180,"A central challenge in expanding the genetic code of cells to incorporate noncanonical amino acids into proteins is the scalable discovery of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)-tRNA pairs that are orthogonal in their aminoacylation specificity. Here we computationally identify candidate orthogonal tRNAs from millions of sequences and develop a rapid, scalable approach-named tRNA Extension (tREX)-to determine the in vivo aminoacylation status of tRNAs. Using tREX, we test 243 candidate tRNAs in Escherichia coli and identify 71 orthogonal tRNAs, covering 16 isoacceptor classes, and 23 functional orthogonal tRNA-cognate aaRS pairs. We discover five orthogonal pairs, including three highly active amber suppressors, and evolve new amino acid substrate specificities for two pairs. Finally, we use tREX to characterize a matrix of 64 orthogonal synthetase-orthogonal tRNA specificities. This work expands the number of orthogonal pairs available for genetic code expansion and provides a pipeline for the discovery of additional orthogonal pairs and a foundation for encoding the cellular synthesis of noncanonical biopolymers."

https://openalex.org/W3011047626,"The primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reservoir is composed of resting memory CD4+ T cells, which often express the immune checkpoint receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), which limit T cell activation via synergistic mechanisms. Using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated rhesus macaques, we demonstrate that PD-1, CTLA-4 and dual CTLA-4/PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies is well tolerated, with evidence of bioactivity in blood and lymph nodes. Dual blockade was remarkably more effective than PD-1 blockade alone in enhancing T cell cycling and differentiation, expanding effector-memory T cells and inducing robust viral reactivation in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In lymph nodes, dual CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade, but not PD-1 alone, decreased the total and intact SIV-DNA in CD4+ T cells, and SIV-DNA and SIV-RNA in B cell follicles, a major site of viral persistence during ART. None of the tested interventions enhanced SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses during ART or viral control after ART interruption. Thus, despite CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade inducing robust latency reversal and reducing total levels of integrated virus, the degree of reservoir clearance was still insufficient to achieve viral control. These results suggest that immune checkpoint blockade regimens targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, if performed in people living with HIV with sustained aviremia, are unlikely to induce HIV remission in the absence of additional interventions. Immune checkpoint blockade has been proposed as a potentially curative strategy to reduce the HIV reservoir. Studies in monkeys now show that this approach alone is ineffective at enabling viral control after antiretroviral treatment interruption."
https://openalex.org/W3015210063,"Estimating the value of alternative options is a key process in decision-making. Human functional magnetic resonance imaging and monkey electrophysiology studies have identified brain regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), composing a value system. In the present study, in an effort to bridge across species and techniques, we investigated the neural representation of value ratings in 36 people with epilepsy, using intracranial electroencephalography. We found that subjective value was positively reflected in both vmPFC and lOFC high-frequency activity, plus several other brain regions, including the hippocampus. We then demonstrated that subjective value could be decoded (1) in pre-stimulus activity, (2) for various categories of items, (3) even during a distractive task and (4) as both linear and quadratic signals (encoding both value and confidence). Thus, our findings specify key functional properties of neural value signals (anticipation, generality, automaticity, quadraticity), which might provide insights into human irrational choice behaviors. Lopez-Persem et al. used intracranial recordings in people with epilepsy to uncover key functional properties of neural value signals that might explain irrational choice behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3016043885,"Soil temperature has a vital importance in biological, physical and chemical processes of terrestrial ecosystem and its modeling at different depths is very important for land-atmosphere interactions. The study compares four machine learning techniques, extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural networks (ANN), classification and regression trees (CART) and group method of data handling (GMDH) in estimating monthly soil temperatures at four different depths. Various combinations of climatic variables are utilized as input to the developed models. The models' outcomes are also compared with multi-linear regression based on Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination statistics. ELM is found to be generally performs better than the other four alternatives in estimating soil temperatures. A decrease in performance of the models is observed by an increase in soil depth. It is found that soil temperatures at three depths (5, 10 and 50 cm) could be mapped utilizing only air temperature data as input while solar radiation and wind speed information are also required for estimating soil temperature at the depth of 100 cm."
https://openalex.org/W3015340179,"A green synthesis approach was conducted to prepare amine-functionalized bio-graphene (AFBG) as an efficient and low cost adsorbent that can be obtained from agricultural wastes. In this study, bio-graphene was successfully used to remove Ciprofloxacin (CIP) from synthetic solutions. The efficacy of adsorbent as a function of operating variables (i.e. pH, time, AFBG dose and CIP concentration) was described by a polynomial model. A optimal99.3% experimental removal was achieved by adjusting the mixing time, AFBG dose, pH and CIP concentration to 58.16, 0.99, 7.47, and 52.9, respectively. Kinetic model revealed that CIP diffusion into the internal layers of AFBG controls the rate of the process. Furthermore, the sorption process was in monolayer with a maximum monolayer capacity of 172.6 mg/g. Adsorption also found to be favored under higher CIP concentrations. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG°<0, ΔH°>0, and ΔS°>0) demonstrated that the process is endothermic and spontaneous in nature. The regeneration study showed that the AFBG could simply regenerated without significant lost in adsorption capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3015694267,"Salt stress is one of the major environmental constraints for plant growth. Although the ways in which mycorrhizal plants deal with salt stress have been well documented, it still is blank for Euonymus maackii, an important local ecological restoration tree, to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation and salt stress. In this study, we tested the effect of different salt levels (0, 50, 100,150 and 200 mM) and AMF inoculation on E. maackii growth rate, photosynthesis, antioxidant enzymes, nutrient absorption and salt ion distribution. The results indicated negative effect of salt on height, photosynthesis capacity, nutrition accumulation, while salt stimulated the antioxidant defense system and salt ions accumulation. The toxic symptom by excessive accumulation of salt ions worsen with salt level increased gradually (except for the 50 mM NaCl treatment). AMF inoculation alleviated the toxic symptom under moderate salt levels (100 and 150 mM) by increasing photosynthesis capacity, accelerating nutrient absorption and activating antioxidant enzyme activities under salt stress. Meanwhile, effect of AMF was not detected on seedlings under slight (0 and 50 mM) and high (200 mM) NaCl concentration. Our study indicated AMF had positive impact on E. maackii subjected to salt, which suggested potential application of AMF- E. maackii on restoration of salt ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3015420583,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent type of cancer in women in western countries. BC mortality has not declined despite early detection by screening, indicating the need for better informed treatment decisions. Therefore, a novel noninvasive diagnostic tool for BC would give the opportunity of subtype-specific treatment and improved prospects for the patients. Heterogeneity of BC tumor subtypes is reflected in the expression levels of enzymes in lipid metabolism. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the subtype defined by the transcriptome is reflected in the lipidome of BC cell lines. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platform was applied to analyze the lipidome of six cell lines derived from human BC cell lines representing different BC subtypes. We identified an increased abundance of triacylglycerols (TG) ≥ C-48 with moderate or multiple unsaturation in fatty acyl chains and down-regulated ether-phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) (C-34 to C-38) in cell lines representing estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive tumor subtypes. In a cell line representing HER2-overexpressing tumor subtype an elevated expression of TG (≤ C-46), phosphatidylcholines (PC) and PE containing short-chained (≤ C-16) saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids were observed. Increased abundance of PC ≥ C-40 was found in cell lines of triple negative BC subtype. In addition, differences were detected in lipidomes within these previously defined subtypes. We conclude that subtypes defined by the transcriptome are indeed reflected in differences in the lipidome and, furthermore, potentially biologically relevant differences may exist within these defined subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W3015506178,"Background Although studies report that more than 90% of pregnant women utilize digital sources to supplement their maternal healthcare, little is known about the kinds of information that women seek from their peers during pregnancy. To date, most research has used self-report measures to elucidate how and why women to turn to digital sources during pregnancy. However, given that these measures may differ from actual utilization of online health information, it is important to analyze the online content pregnant women generate. Objective To apply machine learning methods to analyze online pregnancy forums, to better understand how women seek information from a community of online peers during pregnancy. Methods Data from seven WhatToExpect.com “birth club” forums (September 2018; January-June 2018) were scraped. Forum posts were collected for a one-year period, which included three trimesters and three months postpartum. Only initial posts from each thread were analyzed (n = 262,238). Automatic natural language processing (NLP) methods captured 50 discussed topics, which were annotated by two independent coders and grouped categorically. Results The largest topic categories were maternal health (45%), baby-related topics (29%), and people/relationships (10%). While pain was a popular topic all throughout pregnancy, individual topics that were dominant by trimester included miscarriage (first trimester), labor (third trimester), and baby sleeping routine (postpartum period). Conclusion More than just emotional or peer support, pregnant women turn to online forums to discuss their health. Dominant topics, such as labor and miscarriage, suggest unmet informational needs in these domains. With misinformation becoming a growing public health concern, more attention must be directed toward peer-exchange outlets."
https://openalex.org/W3015797060,"Background Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of mortality, yet the recommended inpatient treatment options are inaccessible to most families in low-income settings. In 2015, the World Health Organization released a guideline for outpatient treatment of young infants (0–59 days of age) with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) with simplified antibiotic regimens when referral was not feasible. If implemented widely, this guideline could prevent many deaths. Our implementation research evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the WHO guideline through the existing health system in Malawi. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in 12 first-level health facilities in Ntcheu district. Trained health workers identified and treated young infants with PSBI signs with injection gentamicin for 2 days and oral amoxicillin for 7 days, whereas those with only fast breathing were treated with oral amoxicillin for 7 days. Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) were trained to promote care-seeking and to conduct home visits on day 3 and 6 to assess infants under treatment, encourage treatment adherence and remind the caregiver to return for facility follow up. Infants receiving outpatient treatment were followed up at health facility on day 4 and 8. The primary outcome was proportion of outpatient cases completing treatment per protocol. Findings A total of 358 infants received outpatient treatment (202 clinical severe infection, 156 only fast breathing) from February to September 2017. Of these, 92.7% (332/358) met criteria for treatment completion and 88.8% (318/358) completed the day 4 follow-up. Twelve (3.4%) young infants clinically failed treatment with no reported deaths in those treated at outpatient level. This treatment failure rate was lower than those reported for the simplified regimens tested in the SATT (8–10%) and AFRINEST (5–8%) equivalency trials. More than half of infants (58.1%; 208/358) received HSA follow-up visits on days 3 and 6. Conclusion Study results demonstrate the feasibility of outpatient treatment for sick young infants when referral is not feasible in Malawi, which will inform scale-up in other parts of Malawi and countries with similar health system constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3016060377,"The present study aimed to explore the motivations of Brazilian dog owners and their knowledge about the risks related to raw meat-based diets (RMBD) as well as to evaluate important enteropathogens such as Salmonella spp., C. perfringens, and C. difficile, in feces of dogs fed different diets. The majority of the pet owners (69.3%) reported to have chosen this diet for their dogs, considering it to be more “natural”. A large number of owners declared that RMBD do not pose health risks for their animals (87.9%) or humans (98.8%), even though almost one third of the respondents (34.8%) declared having at least one individual at high risk of infection in contact with RMBD-fed dogs. Stool samples from 46 RMBD-fed dogs and 192 dogs fed commercial dry feed were collected. The present study revealed that dogs fed raw meat diets were almost 30 times more likely to be positive for Salmonella spp. than dogs on a conventional diet. Some of the serovars detected were commonly associated with human salmonellosis, such as S. Typhimurium and S. Saintpaul, and were multidrug resistant. RMBD-fed dogs were more likely to be positive for C. perfringens type A (p = 0.008) and one C. perfringens type F was isolated from these animals. Two toxigenic strains (4.3%) of C. difficile were isolated only from raw meat-fed dogs, all of which were under antibiotic therapy. These toxigenic C. difficile isolates were classified as RT106/ST54 and RT600/ST149, previously associated with infection in dogs and humans. The present work revealed that the owners have a tendency to ignore or are unaware of the risks associated with raw meat diets for dogs. Also, the higher fecal shedding of important enteropathogens in dogs fed RMBD suggests that this diet poses a risk for the animals and the people in contact with them."
https://openalex.org/W3015967897,"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is one of the most-characterized cytoplasmic DNA sensors in humans and other mammals. However, knowledge about cGAS homologs in nonmammalian species remains limited. In this study, we report the molecular and functional identification of two cGAS homologs, namely, DrcGASa and DrcGASb, from a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. DrcGASa and DrcGASb share the same overall conservative structural architectures and functional domains/residues to mammalian cGASs. Both homologs synthesized a 2′3′-cGAMP isomer but not a 3′3′-cGAMP isomer via oligomerization in response to DNA stimulation. Overexpression of DrcGASa/b in HEK293T cells and zebrafish embryos significantly activated NF-κB and IFN-I signaling pathways in a STING-dependent manner. Knockdown of DrcGASa or DrSTING impaired such activations, thereby reducing the host innate immunity against bacterial and viral infections. DrcGASa, but not DrcGASb, was involved in immunoglobulin Z-mediated mucosal immunity in gill-associated lymphoid tissue, suggesting differential functions between the two DrcGASs. This reaction was associated with the DrcGAS-DrSTING-IFNφ1 signaling axis in GALT’s γδ T cells. Our findings provide experimental evidence that a modern cGAS-STING pathway that mainly participates in IFN-mediated immunity originated from teleost fish based on the functional constraint of cGAS and STING proteins during vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3015269235,"To facilitate HCV diagnosis, we developed an HCV-RNA testing service, which involved home-sampled dried blood spots (DBS). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of self-sampling at home. Furthermore, to optimise the processing of DBS samples for RNA detection, we evaluated two elution buffers: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and L6-buffer. 27 HCV-RNA and 12 HIV-1 RNA positive patients were included. Laboratory spotted DBS (LabDBS) were made by a technician from blood samples drawn at inclusion. Patients received a DBS home-sampling kit and were requested to return their self-sampled DBS (ssDBS) by mail. We compared the RNA load of PBS and L6-eluted labDBS, and of L6-eluted ssDBS, L6-eluted labDBS and plasma. LabDBS load measurements were repeated after 7-13 and 14-21 days to evaluate RNA stability. All 39 plasma samples provided quantifiable RNA loads. In 1/39 labDBS sample, RNA could not be detected (plasma HCV load: 2.98 log10 IU/ml). L6-eluted samples gave a 0.7 log10 and 0.6 log10 higher viral load for HCV and HIV-1 respectively, compared to PBS-eluted samples. Strong correlations were found between labDBS and ssDBS HCV RNA (r = 0.833; mean difference 0.3 log10 IU/mL) and HIV-1 RNA results (r = 0.857; mean difference 0.1 log10 copies/mL). Correlations between labDBS and plasma values were high for HCV (r = 0.958) and HIV-1 (r = 0.844). RNA loads in DBS remained stable over 21 days. Our study demonstrates that self-sampling dried blood spots at home is a feasible strategy for the detection of HCV and HIV-1 RNA. This could facilitate one-step diagnostics and treatment monitoring in communities with high HCV prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W3015673219,"Introduction Many infants with possible serious bacterial infections (PSBI) do not receive inpatient treatment because hospital care may not be affordable, accessible, or acceptable for families. In 2015, WHO issued guidelines for managing PSBI in young infants (0–59 days) with simpler antibiotic regimens when hospital care is not feasible. Bangladesh adopted WHO’s guidelines for implementation in outpatient primary health centers. We report results of an implementation research study that assessed caregiver acceptability of the guidelines in three rural sub-districts of Bangladesh during early implementation (October 2015-August 2016). Methods We included 19 outpatient primary health centers involved in the initial rollout of the infection management guidelines. We extracted data for all PSBI cases (N = 192) from facility registers to identify gaps in referral feasibility, simplified antibiotic treatment, and follow-up. Focus group discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with both caregivers (6 FGDs; 23 IDIs) and providers (2 FGDs; 28 IDIs) to assess caregiver acceptability of the guidelines. Results Referral to the hospital was not feasible for many families (83.3%; N = 160/192) and acceptance varied by infection severity. Barriers to referral feasibility included economic and household factors, and previous experiences with poor quality of care at the sub-district hospital. Conversely, providers and caregivers indicated high acceptability of simplified antibiotic treatment. 80% (N = 96/120) of infants with clinical severe infection for whom referral was not feasible returned to the facility for the second antibiotic injection. Some providers reported developing local solutions—including engaging informal providers in treatment of the infant—to address organizational barriers and promote treatment compliance. Follow-up of young infants receiving simplified treatment is critical, but only 67.4% (N = 87/129) of infants received fourth day follow-up. Some providers’ reported deviations from the guidelines that shifted responsibility of follow-up to the caregiver, which may have contributed to lapses. Conclusion Caregivers’ perception of trust and communication with providers were influential in caregiver acceptability of care. Few caregivers accepted referral to the sub-district hospital, suggesting low acceptability of this option. When referral was not feasible, many caregivers reported satisfaction with simplified antibiotic treatment. Local solutions described by providers require further examination in this context to assess the safety and potential value of these strategies in outpatient treatment. Our findings suggest strengthening providers’ interpersonal skills could improve caregiver acceptability of the guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3016128762,"As the dominant form of urban agriculture (UA) in Australia, existing home food gardens potentially represent a significant resource in the context of future urban food security and sustainability. However, a severe lack of in-field data has hindered our understanding of the form and function of home food gardens which in turn may hinder innovation and improvement. We investigated the productivity, resource efficiency and potential financial savings of home food gardens in South Australia. A group of 34 citizen science participants measured and recorded inputs and outputs from their gardens. Inputs included time spent on various gardening activities, financial costs, and water use. Outputs included crop yields, from which retail value and nutritional content were then derived. The paper outlines a field-demonstrated, comprehensive methodology for continued and consistent data collection for all forms of UA. We found smaller gardens to be more intensive than larger gardens, requiring higher inputs, but also returning higher outputs per unit area. Both productivity and resource efficiency varied among the gardens, and labour requirements were significantly lower than previously estimated. Water use efficiency of the gardens were calculated and found to have comparable water use efficiency to commercial horticulture. Of the gardens involved, we calculated that 65% should break even in five or less years and save money. After applying a minimum wage almost one in five gardens were financially viable. The results represent the most comprehensive measurements on home food gardens to date, and allow practical, evidence-based recommendations for diversification, time saving and smart irrigation practices to improve garden productivity and enhance the viability of UA."

https://openalex.org/W3015230609,"SESN2 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved sestrin protein family found in most of the Metazoa species. The SESN2 gene is transcriptionally activated by many stress factors, including metabolic derangements, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and DNA-damage. As a result, SESN2 controls ROS accumulation, metabolism, and cell viability. The best-known function of SESN2 is the inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase (mTORC1) that plays a central role in support of cell growth and suppression of autophagy. SESN2 inhibits mTORC1 activity through interaction with the GATOR2 protein complex preventing an inhibitory effect of GATOR2 on the GATOR1 protein complex. GATOR1 stimulates GTPase activity of the RagA/B small GTPase, the component of RagA/B:RagC/D complex, preventing mTORC1 translocation to the lysosomes and its activation by the small GTPase Rheb. Despite the well-established role of SESN2 in mTORC1 inhibition, other SESN2 activities are not well-characterized. We recently showed that SESN2 could control mitochondrial function and cell death via mTORC1-independent mechanisms, and these activities might be explained by direct effects of SESN2 on mitochondria. In this work, we examined mitochondrial localization of SESN2 and demonstrated that SESN2 is located on mitochondria and can be directly involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions."
https://openalex.org/W3015553283,"Handling of laboratory mice is essential for experiments and husbandry, but handling can increase anxiety in mice, compromising their welfare and potentially reducing replicability between studies. The use of non-aversive handling (e.g., tunnel handling or cupping), rather than the standard method of picking mice up by the tail, has been shown to enhance interaction with a handler, reduce anxiety-like behaviours, and increase exploration and performance in standard behavioural tests. Despite this, some labs continue to use tail handling for routine husbandry, and the extent to which non-aversive methods are being used is currently unknown. Here we conducted an international online survey targeting individuals that work with and/or conduct research using laboratory mice. The survey aimed to identify the handling methods currently being used, and to determine common obstacles that may be preventing the wider uptake of non-aversive handling. We also surveyed opinions concerning the current data in support of non-aversive handling for mouse welfare and scientific outcomes. 390 complete responses were received and analysed quantitatively and thematically. We found that 35% report using tail handling only, and 43% use a combination of tail and non-aversive methods. 18% of respondents reported exclusively using non-aversive methods. The vast majority of participants were convinced that non-aversive handling improves animal welfare and scientific outcomes. However, the survey indicated that researchers were significantly less likely to have heard of non-aversive handling and more likely to use tail handling compared with animal care staff. Thematic analysis revealed there were concerns regarding the time required for non-aversive methods compared with tail handling, and that there was a perceived incompatibility of tunnel handling with restraint, health checks and other routine procedures. Respondents also highlighted a need for additional research into the impact of handling method that is representative of experimental protocols and physiological indicators used in the biomedical fields. This survey highlights where targeted research, outreach, training and funding may have the greatest impact on increasing uptake of non-aversive handling methods for laboratory mice."
https://openalex.org/W3015857007,"Job satisfaction is an important construct that is known to be associated with workers’ performance and wellbeing. As such, to properly measure it, one must use adapted measures that show adequate validity evidence for the desired context. Such measures should preferably be short to allow the parsimonious use of various measures/constructs in the same data collection. The aim of this paper is to adapt the Portuguese version for Brazil and Portugal of the Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS). The SIJS is a psychometric instrument that measures job satisfaction through five items. A cross-sectional study was conducted with two multi-occupational workers samples, one from Brazil (n = 599) and one other from Portugal (n = 572). The SIJS presented good validity evidence based on its internal structure, namely dimensionality, reliability, and measurement invariance across countries and sexes. It also revealed to be positively correlated with work engagement, and quality of work life (convergent evidence). It also has shown to be negatively associated with burnout (discriminant evidence). The SIJS showed promising validity evidence. The SIJS can be useful to be used together with other instruments, due to its small number of items, producing data with good psychometric properties."
https://openalex.org/W3015296449,"Clinical studies suggest that pregnant women with elevated iron levels are more vulnerable to develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but the causes and underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia induces cellular stress responses leading to dysregulated placental iron homeostasis. Hence, we compared the expression of genes/proteins involved in iron homeostasis in placentae from GDM and healthy pregnancies (n = 11 each). RT-qPCR and LC-MS/MS analyses revealed differential regulation of iron transporters/receptors (DMT1/FPN1/ZIP8/TfR1), iron sensors (IRP1), iron regulators (HEPC), and iron oxidoreductases (HEPH/Zp). To identify the underlying mechanisms, we adapted BeWo trophoblast cells to normoglycemic (N), hyperglycemic (H), and hyperglycemic-hyperlipidemic (HL) conditions and assessed Fe3+-uptake, expression patterns, and cellular pathways involving oxidative stress (OS), ER-stress, and autophagy. H and HL induced alterations in cellular morphology, differential iron transporter expression, and reduced Fe3+-uptake confirming the impact of hyperglycemia on iron transport observed in GDM patients. Pathway analysis and rescue experiments indicated that dysregulated OS and disturbed autophagy processes contribute to the reduced placental iron transport under hyperglycemic conditions. These adaptations could represent a protective mechanism preventing the oxidative damage for both fetus and placenta caused by highly oxidative iron. In pregnancies with risk for GDM, antioxidant treatment, and controlled iron supplementation could help to balance placental OS levels protecting mother and fetus from impaired iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3015391057,"Our preliminary data showed a slight decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) treatment in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, long-term outcome of renal evolution after DAAs has not been well documented.To assess the renal function under DAAs treatment in CHC patients of an Asian population at 6 months and 1 year after complete treatment.A cohort of 1536 CHC patients who received therapies with DAAs were analyzed. Serial eGFR levels at 24 weeks after treatment (SVR24) and 48 weeks after treatment (SVR48) were evaluated. We compared eGFR at baseline, SVR12, SVR24 and SVR48, and defined renal function deterioration as decrease of eGFR >25% from baseline to SVR24 and SVR48.Overall, there was decline of eGFR from SVR12 to SVR48 in all patients (84.30 ± 27.00 -> 73.20 ± 28.67 mL/min/1.73m2, p<0.001). This trend of decline was similar in all groups. Multivariate analysis for deterioration in renal function from baseline to SVR24 showed liver transplantation, hypertension and baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were independent risk factors. Multivariate analysis for persistent deterioration in renal function from baseline to SVR48 showed liver transplantation, baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 and DCV/ASV use were independent predictive factors.There is a trend of decline in eGFR at 1-year after DAAs treatment regardless of baseline renal function or DAAs. Liver transplantation and baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were independent predictive factors of persistent deterioration in renal function from baseline to SVR48. Close monitoring renal function in these patients was suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3015268452,"Background Young people's health service utilisation (the number accessing a facility) has been the focus of guidelines and health systems strengthening policies. This is due to young people being at an increased health risk because of inequitable access and utilisation of health services, which is more pronounced in rural settings with limited service availability. This is a major concern as globally, youth constitute a considerable and increasing part of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Objective The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive approach for the exploration of health service utilisation by young people in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We examined barriers and facilitators conceptualised by the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, framed within a socio-ecological model. Methods Data were collected in January to June 2017 from two sites using in-depth interviews, spiral transect walks and community mapping with young people (aged 10 to 24 years), primary care health providers, school health professionals, community stakeholders and young people's parents. Results Socio-ecological and behavioural factors influenced young people's intention to use services. Barriers included perceived negative attitudes of health providers and perceived poor staff competencies. Facilitators included an appreciation of receiving health education and assumed improved health. At social and community levels, normative beliefs hindered young people from utilising services as they feared stigmatisation and gossip. At a public policy level, structural elements had a disempowering effect as the physical layout of the clinics hindered utilisation, limited resources influenced staffing, and facility opening times were not convenient for school goers. Conclusion We suggest that to fully appreciate the complexity of health service utilisation, it is necessary to not only consider factors and processes relevant to the individual, but also acknowledge and act upon, the disjuncture between community level cultural values, norms and national policies."
https://openalex.org/W3015271115,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is toxic to the reproductive and nervous system, even carcinogenetic in humans and animals. However, few studies focused on effects of BPA on the intestinal tract. Here, we detected BPA-induced injuries on intestinal mucosa and explored a reliable approach to counteract BPA effects. C57BL/6J mice were gavage BPA or BPA accompanied with ingestion of 4% (w/w) of glutamine for 4-wks. In vitro, IEC-6 cells were treated with 0.4 mmol/L BPA for 6 hours mimicking acute injury and 0.2 mmol/L BPA for 12 hours followed with or without the inclusion of 4 mmol/L glutamine for 12 hours to determine cell renewal, mitochondrial function and ROS-JNK/MAPK pathway upon moderate BPA exposure. As results, BPA exposure caused severe intestinal injury, and disturbed intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, accompanied with mitochondrial malfunction and activated JNK/MAPK pathway as well. Notably, glutathione metabolism was implicated in BPA-induce injury. Glutamine could well rescue cell renewal and mitochondrial function from BPA exposure-induced injuries. In conclusion, we demonstrated impaired effect of BPA exposure on intestinal functions, which could be well counteracted by glutamine partly via restoring mitochondrial function and normalizing ROS-JNK/MAPK pathway. Thereby, we provided a novel application of glutamine to rescue intestinal injury."

https://openalex.org/W3015763092,"Background While treatment for HIV has greatly improved patient outcomes, health care workers, including nurses, remain at high risk of occupational exposure. The risk of exposure is a continuous concern in the South African health system that is overburdened by multiple stressors, including the highest HIV caseload in the world. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of occupational exposure to HIV, reporting and utilization of post-exposure prophylaxis, knowledge, attitudes towards HIV post-exposure prophylaxis and infection control practices amongst nurses at a tertiary hospital in the Western Cape, South Africa. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Tygerberg hospital from the 4th to the 16th February 2019. Participants were front line nurses working in randomly selected wards. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from participants. Results Of the 160 participants who took part in the survey, 17 reported occupational exposure to HIV (prevalence 10.6%, 95% CI 6.7–16.6), and of the 17 exposed, 10(58.8%) reported needlestick injuries. From those who were exposed, only 10 (58.8%) reported the incidents and went on post-exposure prophylaxis. However, only 6 out of the 10 completed their treatment. Half (50%) of the participants had inadequate knowledge on HIV post-exposure prophylaxis, 83.3% had adequate attitudes towards HIV post-exposure prophylaxis and 75% had adequate infection control practices. Conclusion One out of every nine nurses had occupational exposure to HIV at a major tertiary hospital with poor reporting and utilization of post-exposure prophylaxis. The high proportion of needle stick injuries highlights the need for better infection control training. Similarly, the low levels of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis knowledge show the need for structured intervention and in-service training for health care workers."
https://openalex.org/W3015325275,"Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the role of motor control immaturity in the speech production characteristics of 4-year-old children, compared to adults. Specifically, two indices were examined: trial-to-trial variability, which is assumed to be linked to motor control accuracy, and anticipatory extra-syllabic vowel-to-vowel coarticulation, which is assumed to be linked to the comprehensiveness, maturity and efficiency of sensorimotor representations in the central nervous system. Method Acoustic and articulatory (ultrasound) data were recorded for 20 children and 10 adults, all native speakers of Canadian French, during the production of isolated vowels and vowel-consonant-vowel (V1-C-V2) sequences. Trial-to-trial variability was measured in isolated vowels. Extra-syllabic anticipatory coarticulation was assessed in V1-C-V2 sequences by measuring the patterns of variability of V1 associated with variations in V2. Acoustic data were reported for all subjects and articulatory data, for a subset of 6 children and 2 adults. Results Trial-to-trial variability was significantly larger in children. Systematic and significant anticipation of V2 in V1 was always found in adults, but was rare in children. Significant anticipation was observed in children only when V1 was /a/, and only along the antero-posterior dimension, with a much smaller magnitude than in adults. A closer analysis of individual speakers revealed that some children showed adult-like anticipation along this dimension, whereas the majority did not. Conclusion The larger trial-to-trial variability and the lack of anticipatory behavior in most children—two phenomena that have been observed in several non-speech motor tasks—support the hypothesis that motor control immaturity may explain a large part of the differences observed between speech production in adults and 4-year-old children, apart from other causes that may be linked with language development."
https://openalex.org/W3015753420,"T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP), encoded by Ptpn2, has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor during skin carcinogenesis. In the current study, we generated a novel epidermal-specific TC-PTP-overexpressing (K5HA.Ptpn2) mouse model to show that TC-PTP contributes to the attenuation of chemically induced skin carcinogenesis through the synergistic regulation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and PI3K/AKT signaling. We found overexpression of TC-PTP increased epidermal sensitivity to DMBA-induced apoptosis and it decreased TPA-mediated hyperproliferation, coinciding with reduced epidermal thickness. Inhibition of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, or AKT reversed the effects of TC-PTP overexpression on epidermal survival and proliferation. Mice overexpressing TC-PTP in the epidermis developed significantly reduced numbers of tumors during skin carcinogenesis and presented a prolonged latency of tumor initiation. Examination of human papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) revealed that TC-PTP expression was significantly reduced and TC-PTP expression was inversely correlated with the increased grade of SCCs. Our findings demonstrate that TC-PTP is a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of human skin cancer given that it is a major negative regulator of oncogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3015779579,"Following allopolyploidization, nascent polyploid wheat species react with massive genomic rearrangements, including deletion of transposable element-containing sequences. While such massive rearrangements are considered to be a prominent process in wheat genome evolution and speciation, their structure, extent, and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we retrieved ~3500 insertions of a specific variant of Fatima, one of the most dynamic gypsy long-terminal repeat retrotransposons in wheat from the recently available high-quality genome drafts of Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) and Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides or wild emmer, the allotetraploid mother of all modern wheats. The dynamic nature of Fatima facilitated the identification of large (i.e., up to ~ 1 million bases) Fatima-containing insertions/deletions (indels) upon comparison of bread wheat and wild emmer genomes. We characterized 11 such indels using computer-assisted analysis followed by PCR validation, and found that they might have occurred via unequal intra-strand recombination or double-strand break (DSB) events. Additionally, we observed one case of introgression of novel DNA fragments from an unknown source into the wheat genome. Our data thus indicate that massive large-scale DNA rearrangements might play a prominent role in wheat speciation."
https://openalex.org/W3015326257,"Introduction Irradiation can induce multiple inhibitory and stimulatory effects on the immune system. In recent studies, it has been noted that administration of radiation with various doses and fractionation plans may influence on immune responses in microenvironment of tumor. But in radiobiology, the Biologically Effective Dose (BED) formula has been designed for calculating isoeffect doses in different regimens of daily clinical practice. In other words, BED has also been used to predict the effects of fractionation schedules on tumor cells. Methods In our study, three different regimens with BEDs of 40 gray (Gy) were analyzed in BALB/c mice. These included conventional fractionated radiotherapy (RT) (3Gyx10), high-dose hypofractionated RT (10Gyx2), and single ablative high-dose RT (15Gyx1). Results As BED predicts, all three similarly decreased tumor volumes and increased survival times relative to controls, but after high dose exposure in ablative group, the expression of IFNγ was increased following high infiltration of CD8 cells into the tumor microenvironment. When anti-PDL-1 was combined with RT, single ablative high-dose radiation enhanced antitumor activity by increasing IFNγ in tumors and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; as a result, this combining therapy had enhanced antitumor activity and lead to control tumor volume effectively and improve significantly survival rate and finally the recurrence of tumor was not observed. Conclusion Results show distinct radiation doses and fractionation schemes with same BED have different immunogenic response and these findings can provide data helping to design regimens of radiation combined with immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)."
https://openalex.org/W3015423497,"There is limited standardization of acquisition and processing methods in diffusion tractography for pre-surgical planning, leading to a range of approaches. In this study, a number of representative acquisition variants and post processing methods are considered, to assess their importance when implementing a clinical tractography program.Diffusion MRI was undertaken in ten healthy volunteers, using protocols typical of clinical and research scanning: a 32-direction diffusion acquisition with and without peripheral gating, and a non-gated 64 diffusion direction acquisition. All datasets were post-processed using diffusion tensor reconstruction with streamline tractography, and with constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) with both streamline and probabilistic tractography, to delineate the cortico-spinal tract (CST) and optic radiation (OR). The accuracy of tractography results was assessed against a histological atlas using a novel probabilistic Dice overlap technique, together with direct comparison to tract volumes and distance of Meyer's loop to temporal pole (ML-TP) from dissections studies. Three clinical case studies of patients with space occupying lesions were also investigated.Tracts produced by CSD with probabilistic tractography provided the greatest overlap with the histological atlas (overlap scores of 44% and 52% for the CST and OR, respectively) and best matched tract volume and ML-TP distance from dissection studies. The acquisition protocols investigated had limited impact on the accuracy of the tractography. In all patients, the CSD based probabilistic tractography created tracts with greatest anatomical plausibility, although in one case anatomically plausible pathways could not be reconstructed without reducing the probabilistic threshold, leading to an increase in false positive tracts.Advanced post processing techniques such as CSD with probabilistic tractography are vital for pre-surgical planning. However, overall accuracy relative to dissection studies remains limited."
https://openalex.org/W3015815060,"With the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) there is a need to monitor programme performance to maximize ART efficacy and to prevent emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). In keeping with the elements of the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance we carried out a nationally representative assessment of early warning indicators (EWI) at 304 randomly selected ART service outlets in Uganda.Retrospective patient data was extracted for the six EWIs for HIVDR including; on-time antiretroviral (ARV) drug pick-up, patient retention on ART at 12 months, ART dispensing practices, ARV drug stock-outs, viral load suppression (VLS) and viral load (VL) testing completion. Point prevalence for each clinic and national aggregate prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all clinics were estimated and facility performances were computed and association between EWIs and programmatic factors assessed using Fisher's Exact Test.Facilities meeting the EWI targets: on-time pill pick-up was 9.5%, more facilities in the north met this target (p = 0.040). Retention on ART at 12 months was 24.1%, facilities in Kampala region (p<0.001) and Specialized ART clinics (p = 0.01) performed better in this indicator. Pharmacy stock-outs was 33.6%, with more facilities in Kampala (p<0.001), specialized ART clinics (p<0.001) and private-for-profit (p<0.001) meeting this target. Dispensing practices was met by 100% of the facilities. VLS was met by 49.2% and 50.8% of facilities met VL completion target with facilities in central region performing better (p<0.001). National prevalence for the EWIs was: on-time pill pick-up 63.3% (CI: 58.9-67.8); retention on ART at 12 months 69.9% (CI: 63.8-76.0); dispensing practices 100.0%; VLS 85.2% (CI: 81.8-88.5) and VL completion, 60.7% (CI: 56.9-64.6).Dispensing practices in all facilities were in line with the national guidelines however, there still remains a challenge to long-term ART programmatic success in monitoring patient response to treatment, and maintaining patients on ART without interruptions arising due to poor patient adherence and as a consequence of ARV supply interruption. It is therefore of high importance that the national ART program ensures intensified follow-up for patients, ensuring uninterrupted supply of ARV drugs and increasing VL monitoring at treatment centres, in order to improve patient outcomes and avert preventable HIVDR."
https://openalex.org/W3015489415,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has attracted global attention and international awareness. ZIKV infection exhibits mild symptoms including fever and pains; however, ZIKV has recently been shown to be related to increased birth defects, including microcephaly, in infants. In addition, ZIKV is related to the onset of neurological disorders, such as a type of paralysis similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, the mechanisms through which ZIKV affect neuronal cells and myeloid dendritic cells and how ZIKV avoids host immunity are unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from ZIKV-infected neuronal cells and myeloid dendritic cells by comparative network analyses using protein-protein interaction information. Comparative network analysis revealed major genes showing differential changes in the peripheral neurons, neural crest cells, and myeloid dendritic cells after ZIKV infection. The genes were related to DNA repair systems and prolactin signaling as well as the interferon signaling, neuroinflammation, and cell cycle pathways. These pathways were interconnected by the interaction of proteins in the pathway and significantly regulated by ZIKV infection in neuronal cells and myeloid dendritic cells. Our analysis showed that neuronal cell damage occurred through up-regulation of neuroinflammation and down-regulation of the DNA repair system, but not in myeloid dendritic cells. Interestingly, immune escape by ZIKV infection could be caused by downregulation of prolactin signaling including IRS2, PIK3C3, JAK3, STAT3, and IRF1 as well as mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation in myeloid dendritic cells. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of ZIKV infection in the host and the association of ZIKV with neurological and immunological symptoms, which may facilitate the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3015786303,"Background Dermatological services in Laos, South East Asia are limited mainly to the capital and patch testing is currently not available, so no data exists regarding the common cutaneous allergens in this population. Objectives The aim of this study was to document common allergens in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis attending the allergy clinic in the capital, Vientiane. Patients/Materials/Methods Fifty paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis were patch tested using TRUE Test® panels 1 to 3 (35 allergens). Readings were taken at Days 2 and 4. Results Twenty-six positive patch tests were recorded on Day 4 in 15 children (30%). The most common allergens were: gold (18%), nickel (10%), formaldehyde (6%) and p-Phenylenediamine (6%). Other positive allergens were potassium dichromate (2%), cobalt dichloride (2%), Bronopol (2%), paraben mix (2%), fragrance mix 1 (2%) and neomycin (2%). The majority of the patients with positive reactions were female. Conclusions This study represents the first documented patch test results in the Lao population. It is hoped that these findings will help clinicians to advise the families of children with atopic dermatitis on common allergens to avoid and inform future work on contact dermatitis in this population."

This study aimed to investigate the disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD) potential of REG-O3 by analyzing its effect on pain, joint function and structure, upon injection into osteoarthritic rat knee joint.Osteoarthritis was induced in the right knee of mature male Lewis rats (n = 12/group) by surgical transection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT) combined with partial medial meniscectomy (pMMx). Treatments were administered intra-articularly from fourteen days after surgery through three consecutive injections one week apart. The effect of REG-O3, solubilized in a liposomal solution and injected at either 5, 25 or 50 μg/50 μL, was compared to liposomal (LIP), dexamethasone and hyaluronic acid (HA) solutions. The study endpoints were the pain/function measured once a week throughout the entire study, and the joint structure evaluated eight weeks after surgery using OARSI score.ACLT/pMMx surgery induced a significant modification of weight bearing in all groups. When compared to liposomal solution, REG-O3 was able to significantly improve weight bearing as efficiently as dexamethasone and HA. REG-O3 (25 μg) was also able to significantly decrease OARSI histological global score as well as degeneration of both cartilage and matrix while the other treatments did not.This study provides evidence of a remarkable protecting effect of REG-O3 on pain/knee joint function and cartilage/matrix degradation in ACLT/pMMx model of rat osteoarthritis. REG-O3 thus displays an interesting profile as a DMOAD."
https://openalex.org/W3015877419,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a rare genetic disorder, characterised by muscular dystrophy, myotonia, and other symptoms. DM1 is caused by the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of DMPK. Longer CTG expansions are associated with greater symptom severity and earlier age at onset. The primary mechanism of pathogenesis is thought to be mediated by a gain of function of the CUG-containing RNA, that leads to trans-dysregulation of RNA metabolism of many other genes. Specifically, the alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) of many genes is known to be disrupted. In the context of clinical trials of emerging DM1 treatments, it is important to be able to objectively quantify treatment efficacy at the level of molecular biomarkers. We show how previously described candidate mRNA biomarkers can be used to model an effective reduction in CTG length, using modern high-dimensional statistics (machine learning), and a blood and muscle mRNA microarray dataset. We show how this model could be used to detect treatment effects in the context of a clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W3015544181,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic, fatal, viral-induced, immune-mediated disease of cats caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Mefloquine, a human anti-malarial agent, has been shown to inhibit FIPV in vitro. As a first step to evaluate its efficacy and safety profile as a potential FIP treatment for cats, mefloquine underwent incubation in feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase I metabolism cofactors to determine its rate of phase I depletion. Tramadol was used as a phase I positive control as it undergoes this reaction in both dogs and cats. Using the substrate depletion method, the in vitro intrinsic clearance (mean ± S.D.) of mefloquine by pooled feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes was 4.5 ± 0.35 and 18.25 ± 3.18 μL/min/mg protein, respectively. However, phase I intrinsic clearance was too slow to determine with canine microsomes. Liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified carboxymefloquine in samples generated by feline microsomes as well as negative controls, suggesting some mefloquine instability. Mefloquine also underwent incubation with feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase II glucuronidative metabolism cofactors. O-desmethyltramadol (ODMT or M1) was used as a positive control as it undergoes a phase II glucuronidation reaction in these species. The rates of phase II mefloquine depletion by microsomes by all three species were too slow to estimate. Therefore mefloquine likely undergoes phase I hepatic metabolism catalysed by feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes but not phase II glucuronidative metabolism in all three species and mefloquine is not likely to have delayed elimination in cats with clinically normal, hepatic function."
https://openalex.org/W3015900545,"The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are chromatin factors underlying the process of transcriptional memory to preserve developmental decisions and keep cellular identities. However, not only developmental signals need to be memorized and thus maintained during the life of an organism. For host protection against pathogens, also a memory of previous exposures to an immunogenic stimulus is crucial to mount a more protective immune response upon re-exposure. The antigen-specific adaptive immunity in vertebrates is an example of such a memory to previous immunogenic stimulation. Recently, adaptive characteristics were also attributed to innate immunity, which was classically seen to lack memory. However, the mechanistic details of an adaptive innate immune response are yet to be fully understood and chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms seem to play an important role in this phenomenon. Possibly, PcG proteins can contribute to such an epigenetic innate immune memory. In this study, we analyzed whether the PcG system can mediate a transcriptional memory of exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). To this end, various forms of LPS pre-treatment were applied to reporter cells and expression kinetics of PcG target genes were analyzed after a second LPS exposure. Neither single nor multiple LPS pre-treatment affected the induction of endogenous LPS-responsive transcripts upon re-exposure. Altogether, our extensive analyses did not provide any evidence for a PcG system-mediated memory of LPS stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3016017625,"Self-controlled practice schedules have been shown to enhance motor learning in several contexts, but their effectiveness in structural learning tasks, where the goal is to eventually learn an underlying structure or rule, is not well known. Here we examined the use of self-controlled practice in a novel control interface requiring structural learning. In addition, we examined the effect of 'nudging'-i.e., whether altering task difficulty could influence self-selected strategies, and hence facilitate learning. Participants wore four inertial measurement units (IMUs) on their upper body and the goal was to use motions of the upper body to move a screen cursor to different targets presented on the screen. The structure in this task that had to be learned was based on the fact that the signals from the IMUs were linearly mapped to the x- and y- position of the cursor. Participants (N = 62) were split into 3 groups (random, self-selected, nudge) based on whether they had control over the sequence in which they could practice the targets. To test whether participants learned the underlying structure, participants were tested both on the trained targets, as well as novel targets that were not practiced during training. Results showed that during training, the self-selected group showed shorter movement times relative to the random group, and both self-selected and nudge groups adopted a strategy of tending to repeat targets. However, in the test phase, we found no significant differences in task performance between groups, indicating that structural learning was not reliably affected by the type of practice. In addition, nudging participants by adjusting task difficulty did not show any significant benefits to overall learning. These results suggest that although self-controlled practice influenced practice structure and facilitated learning, it did not provide any additional benefits relative to practicing on a random schedule in this task."
