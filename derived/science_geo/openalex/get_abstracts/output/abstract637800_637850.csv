https://openalex.org/W2968918584,"Currently, green nanotechnology-based approaches using waste materials from food have been accepted as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective approach with various biomedical applications. In the current study, AgNPs were synthesized using the outer peel extract of the fruit Ananas comosus (AC), which is a food waste material. Characterization was done using UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses. The formation of AgNPs has confirmed through UV–visible spectroscopy (at 485 nm) by the change of color owing to surface Plasmon resonance. Based on the XRD pattern, the crystalline property of AgNPs was established. The functional group existing in AC outer peel extract accountable for the reduction of Ag+ ion and the stabilization of AC-AgNPs was investigated through FT-IR. The morphological structures and elemental composition was determined by SEM and EDX analysis. With the growing application of AgNPs in biomedical perspectives, the biosynthesized AC-AgNPs were evaluated for their antioxidative, antidiabetic, and cytotoxic potential against HepG2 cells along with their antibacterial potential. The results showed that AC-AgNPs are extremely effective with high antidiabetic potential at a very low concentration as well as it exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against the HepG2 cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also exhibited potential antioxidant activity and moderate antibacterial activity against the four tested foodborne pathogenic bacteria. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness and potential applications of AC-AgNPs in biomedical fields such as in the treatment of acute illnesses as well as in drug formulation for treating various diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Further, it has applications in wound dressing or in treating bacterial related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2968904762,"AMPK is a central regulator of energy homeostasis. AMPK not only elicits acute metabolic responses but also promotes metabolic reprogramming and adaptations in the long-term through regulation of specific transcription factors and coactivators. We performed a whole-genome transcriptome profiling in wild-type (WT) and AMPK-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary hepatocytes that had been treated with 2 distinct classes of small-molecule AMPK activators. We identified unique compound-dependent gene expression signatures and several AMPK-regulated genes, including folliculin (Flcn), which encodes the tumor suppressor FLCN. Bioinformatics analysis highlighted the lysosomal pathway and the associated transcription factor EB (TFEB) as a key transcriptional mediator responsible for AMPK responses. AMPK-induced Flcn expression was abolished in MEFs lacking TFEB and transcription factor E3, 2 transcription factors with partially redundant function; additionally, the promoter activity of Flcn was profoundly reduced when its putative TFEB-binding site was mutated. The AMPK-TFEB-FLCN axis is conserved across species; swimming exercise in WT zebrafish induced Flcn expression in muscle, which was significantly reduced in AMPK-deficient zebrafish. Mechanistically, we have found that AMPK promotes dephosphorylation and nuclear localization of TFEB independently of mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Collectively, we identified the novel AMPK-TFEB-FLCN axis, which may function as a key cascade for cellular and metabolic adaptations.-Collodet, C., Foretz, M., Deak, M., Bultot, L., Metairon, S., Viollet, B., Lefebvre, G., Raymond, F., Parisi, A., Civiletto, G., Gut, P., Descombes, P., Sakamoto, K. AMPK promotes induction of the tumor suppressor FLCN through activation of TFEB independently of mTOR."

https://openalex.org/W2967936164,"It has long been thought that emotional intelligence (EI) involves skillful emotion regulation, but surprisingly little is known about the precise links between EI and emotion regulation. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the relation between EI-operationalised as an ability-and the use of two common emotion regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Seven hundred and twelve participants from a community sample in Spain were assessed on ability EI (using the MSCEIT) and emotion regulation (using the ERQ). Findings revealed that EI ability was positively associated with cognitive reappraisal and negatively associated with expressive suppression. These relationships were moderated by gender and age. The strength of the association between EI and cognitive reappraisal increased with age for men, while this strength decreased with age for women. Conversely, the strength of the association between EI and suppression decreased with age for men, but increased with age for women. These findings confirm the expectation that EI is associated with greater use of generally adaptive forms of emotion regulation (reappraisal), and lesser use of generally maladaptive forms of emotion regulation (suppression), although effect sizes were quite modest. Observed differences in the strength of associations between EI and emotion regulation may be the result of gender differences in the development of emotional skills along with cultural changes in emotional education and social norms."
https://openalex.org/W2968562683,"Tumor mitochondria have heightened protein folding quality control, but the regulators of this process and how they impact cancer traits are not completely understood. Here we show that the ATP-directed mitochondrial protease, LonP1 is upregulated by stress conditions, including hypoxia, in tumor, but not normal cells. In mitochondria, LonP1 is phosphorylated by Akt on Ser173 and Ser181, enhancing its protease activity. Interference with this pathway induces accumulation of misfolded subunits of electron transport chain complex II and complex V, resulting in impaired oxidative bioenergetics and heightened ROS production. Functionally, this suppresses mitochondrial trafficking to the cortical cytoskeleton, shuts off tumor cell migration and invasion, and inhibits primary and metastatic tumor growth, in vivo. These data identify LonP1 as a key effector of mitochondrial reprogramming in cancer and potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2968822253,"Metastatic, antiestrogen resistant estrogen receptor α positive (ER+) breast cancer is the leading cause of breast cancer deaths in USA women. While studies have demonstrated the importance of the stromal tumor microenvironment in cancer progression and therapeutic responses, effects on the responses of ER+ cancers to estrogen and antiestrogens are poorly understood, particularly in the complex in vivo environment. In this study, we used an estrogen responsive syngeneic mouse model to interrogate how a COL1A1-enriched fibrotic ECM modulates integrated hormonal responses in cancer progression. We orthotopically transplanted the ER+ TC11 cell line into wild-type (WT) or collagen-dense (Col1a1tm1Jae/+, mCol1a1) syngeneic FVB/N female mice. Once tumors were established, recipients were supplemented with 17β-estradiol (E2), tamoxifen, or left untreated. Although the dense/stiff environment in mCol1a1 recipients did not alter the rate of E2-induced proliferation of the primary tumor, it fostered the agonist activity of tamoxifen to increase proliferation and AP-1 activity. Manipulation of estrogen activity did not alter the incidence of lung lesions in either WT or mCol1a1 hosts. However, the mCol1a1 environment enabled tamoxifen-stimulated growth of pulmonary metastases and further fueled estrogen-driven growth. Moreover, E2 remodeled peritumoral ECM architecture in WT animals, modifying alignment of collagen fibers and altering synthesis of ECM components associated with increased alignment and stiffness, and increasing FN1 and POSTN expression in the pulmonary metastatic niche. These studies demonstrate dynamic interactions between ECM properties and estrogen activity in progression of ER+ breast cancer, and support the need for therapeutics that target both ER and the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2968998198,"Tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) are cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells with highly tumorigenic and self-renewing abilities, which were selected from tumor cells in soft three-dimensional (3D) fibrin gels with unidentified mechanisms. Here we evaluated the transcriptome alteration during TRCs generation in 3D culture and revealed that a variety of molecules related with integrin/membrane and stemness were continuously altered by mechanical environment. Some key regulators such as MYC/STAT3/hsa-miR-199a-5p, were changed in the TRCs generation. They regulated membrane genes and the downstream mechanotransduction pathways such as Hippo/WNT/TGF-β/PI3K-AKT pathways, thus further affecting the expression of downstream cancer-related genes. By integrating networks for membrane proteins, the WNT pathway and cancer-related genes, we identified key molecules in the selection of TRCs, such as ATF4, SLC3A2, CCT3, and hsa-miR-199a-5p. Silencing ATF4 or CCT3 inhibited the selection and growth of TRCs whereas reduction of SLC3A2 or hsa-miR-199a-5p promoted TRCs growth. Further studies showed that CCT3 promoted cell proliferation and stemness in vitro, while its suppression inhibited TRCs-induced tumor formation. We also contemplated CCT3 as a stemness-related gene. Our findings provide insights in the mechanism of TRCs selection through transcriptome analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2967697038,"Despite multi-modality treatments, prognosis for advanced stage neuroblastoma (NB) remains challenging with residual long-term disabilities in survivors. Advanced stage NB is metastatic, which is a principal cause of cancer-related deaths. We presently document a primary role of MDA-9 in NB progression and define the molecular mechanisms by which MDA-9 promotes transformed phenotypes. NB cell lines and clinical samples display elevated MDA-9 expression and bioinformatic analysis supports an association between elevated MDA-9 and bone metastasis and poor prognosis. Genetic (shmda-9, mda-9 siRNA) or pharmacological (small molecule inhibitor of protein-protein interactions; PDZ1i) blockade of MDA-9 decreases NB migration, invasion, and metastasis. Blocking mda-9 expression or disrupting MDA-9 partner protein interactions downregulates integrin α6 and β4, diminishing Src activity and suppressing Rho-Rac-Cdc42 activity. These signaling changes inhibit cofilin and matrix metalloproteinases reducing in vitro and in vivo NB cell migration. Overexpression of integrin α6 and β4 rescues the invasion phenotype and increases Src activity, supporting integrins as essential regulators of MDA-9-mediated NB migration and invasion. We identify MDA-9 as a key contributor to NB pathogenesis and show that genetic or pharmacological inhibition suppresses NB pathogenesis by an integrin-mediated Src-disruption pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2967266607,"Is global longitudinal strain (GLS) a more accurate non-invasive measure of histological myocardial fibrosis than left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in a hypertensive rodent model.Hypertension results in left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction. Speckle-tracking echocardiography has emerged as a robust technique to evaluate cardiac function in humans compared with standard echocardiography. However, its use in animal studies is less clearly defined.Cyp1a1Ren2 transgenic rats were randomly assigned to three groups; normotensive, untreated hypertensive or hypertensive with daily administration of spironolactone (human equivalent dose of 50 mg/day). Cardiac function and interstitial fibrosis development were monitored for three months.The lower limit of normal LVEF was calculated to be 75%. After three months hypertensive animals (196±21 mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP)) showed increased cardiac fibrosis (8.8±3.2% compared with 2.4±0.7% % in normals), reduced LVEF (from 81±2% to 67±7%) and impaired myocardial GLS (from -17±2% to -11±2) (all p<0.001). Myocardial GLS demonstrated a stronger correlation with cardiac interstitial fibrosis (r2 = 0.58, p<0.0001) than LVEF (r2 = 0.37, p<0.006). Spironolactone significantly blunted SBP elevation (184±15, p<0.01), slowed the progression of cardiac fibrosis (4.9±1.4%, p<0.001), reduced the decline in LVEF (72±4%, p<0.05) and the degree of impaired myocardial GLS (-13±1%, p<0.01) compared to hypertensive animals.This study has demonstrated that, myocardial GLS is a more accurate non-invasive measure of histological myocardial fibrosis compared to standard echocardiography, in an animal model of both treated and untreated hypertension. Spironolactone blunted the progression of cardiac fibrosis and deterioration of myocardial GLS."
https://openalex.org/W2968796036,"Early detection of coronary heart disease (CHD) has the potential to prevent the millions of deaths that this disease causes worldwide every year. However, there exist few automatic methods to detect CHD at an early stage. A challenge in the development of these methods is the absence of relevant datasets for their training and validation. Here, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov 2006 model and the O’Hara-Rudy model for human myocytes were used to create two populations of models that were in concordance with data obtained from healthy individuals (control populations) and included inter-subject variability. The effects of ischemia were subsequently included in the control populations to simulate the effects of mild and severe ischemic events on single cells, full ischemic cables of cells and cables of cells with various sizes of ischemic regions. Action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers were measured to assess how the evolution of ischemia could be quantified. Finally, two neural network classifiers were trained to identify the different degrees of ischemia using the pseudo-ECG biomarkers. The control populations showed action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers within the physiological ranges and the trends in the biomarkers commonly identified in ischemic patients were observed in the ischemic populations. On the one hand, inter-subject variability in the ischemic pseudo-ECGs precluded the detection and classification of early ischemic events using any single biomarker. On the other hand, the neural networks showed sensitivity and positive predictive value above 95%. Additionally, the neural networks revealed that the biomarkers that were relevant for the detection of ischemia were different from those relevant for its classification. This work showed that a computational approach could be used, when data is scarce, to validate proof-of-concept machine learning methods to detect ischemic events."
https://openalex.org/W2967332125,"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a rare but serious adverse event of bone-modifying agents used to prevent bone complications in cancer patients with bone metastasis. Currently, early treatment is the only way to prevent further progression, as the pathogenesis of MRONJ has not yet been elucidated, and a standard treatment has not been established. The aim of this study was to identify a marker for early detection marker of MRONJ by exploring substances in saliva specific to MRONJ at an early stage. We collected salivary samples from 17 patients with MRONJ and conducted metabolomic analyses using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry for non-targeted analysis of hydrophilic metabolites. In the screening cohort, we compared the saliva of patients with stage ≥1 advanced MRONJ (n = 9) with that of controls without MRONJ before chemotherapy (n = 9). The top 5 most elevated salivary metabolites were histamine, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, malonate, carnosine, and hypotaurine. In the validation cohort, we analyzed additional patients with stage ≥1 advanced MRONJ (n = 8) and controls without MRONJ after chemotherapy (n = 9), confirming a significant 2.28-fold elevation in the salivary concentration of hypotaurine. These results revealed elevated salivary hypotaurine concentration as a potential marker for the early detection of MRONJ."
https://openalex.org/W2968532110,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Since surviving patients experience severe neurocognitive disabilities, better and more effective treatments are needed to enhance their quality of life. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is known to regulate cell growth and survival in multiple cancers; however, the role of CK2 in MB is currently being studied. In this study, we verified the importance of CK2 in MB tumorigenesis and discovered that inhibition of CK2 using the small molecule inhibitor, CX-4945, can sensitize MB cells to a well-known and tolerated chemotherapeutic, temozolomide (TMZ). To study the role of CK2 in MB we modulated CK2 expression in multiple MB cells. Exogenous expression of CK2 enhanced cell growth and tumor growth in mice, while depletion or inhibition of CK2 expression decreased MB tumorigenesis. Treatment with CX-4945 reduced MB growth and increased apoptosis. We conducted a high-throughput screen where 4000 small molecule compounds were analyzed to identify compounds that increased the anti-tumorigenic properties of CX-4945. TMZ was found to work synergistically with CX-4945 to decrease cell survival and increase apoptosis in MB cells. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity is directly correlated to TMZ sensitivity. We found that loss of CK2 activity reduced β-catenin expression, a known MGMT regulator, which in turn led to a decrease in MGMT expression and an increased sensitivity to TMZ. Our findings show that CK2 is important for MB maintenance and that treatment with CX-4945 can sensitize MB cells to TMZ treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2967826060,"Chronic neck pain (CNP), a global health problem, involves a large amount of psychological and socioeconomic burdens. Not only physical causes but also behavioral disorders such as a fear-avoidance belief (FAB) can associate with the chronicity of neck pain. However, functional brain mechanisms underlying CNP and its related behavioral disorders remain unknown. The aim of the current resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to explore how the functional brain networks differed between CNP patients and age- and sex-matched healthy, pain-free controls (HCs). We also investigated whether these possible brain network changes in CNP patients were associated with fear avoidance belief (FAB) and the intensity of pain. We analyzed the resting-state fMRI data of 20 CNP patients and 20 HCs. FAB and the intensity of pain were assessed by Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain. The whole brain analysis showed that CNP patients had significant different functional connectivity (FC) compared with HCs, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was a core hub of these altered functional networks. Furthermore, general linear model analyses showed that, in CNP patients, the increased FC between the right DLPFC and the right anterior insular cortex (aIC) significantly associated with increased TSK (p = 0.01, statistical significance after Bonferroni correction: p<0.025), and the FC between the right DLPFC and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex had a trend of inverse association with VAS (p = 0.04). Our findings suggest that aberrant FCs between the right DLPFC and aIC associated with CNP and its related FAB."
https://openalex.org/W2968905007,"Purpose To develop a magneto-nanosensor (MNS) based multiplex assay to measure protein and autoantibody biomarkers from human serum for prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis. Materials and methods A 4-panel MNS autoantibody assay and a MNS protein assay were developed and optimized in our labs. Using these assays, serum concentration of six biomarkers including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein, free/total PSA ratio, as well as four autoantibodies against Parkinson disease 7 (PARK7), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), Talin 1 (TLN1), and Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) and were analyzed. Human serum samples from 99 patients (50 with non-cancer and 49 with clinically localized CaP) were evaluated. Results The MNS assay showed excellent performance characteristics and no cross-reactivity. All autoantibody assays showed a statistically significant difference between CaP and non-cancer samples except for PARK7. The most significant difference was the combination of the four autoantibodies as a panel in addition to the free/total PSA ratio. This combination had the highest area under the curve (AUC)– 0.916 in ROC analysis. Conclusions Our results suggest that this autoantibody panel along with PSA and free PSA have potential to segregate patients without cancer from those with prostate cancer with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone."
https://openalex.org/W2967329846,"Protein kinase D (PKD) is an essential Ser/Thr kinase in animals and controls a variety of diverse cellular functions, including vesicle trafficking and mitogenesis. PKD is activated by recruitment to membranes containing the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and subsequent phosphorylation of its activation loop. Here, we report the crystal structure of the PKD N terminus at 2.2 Å resolution containing a previously unannotated ubiquitin-like domain (ULD), which serves as a dimerization domain. A single point mutation in the dimerization interface of the ULD not only abrogated dimerization in cells but also prevented PKD activation loop phosphorylation upon DAG production. We further show that the kinase domain of PKD dimerizes in a concentration-dependent manner and autophosphorylates on a single residue in its activation loop. We also provide evidence that PKD is expressed at concentrations 2 orders of magnitude below the ULD dissociation constant in mammalian cells. We therefore propose a new model for PKD activation in which the production of DAG leads to the local accumulation of PKD at the membrane, which drives ULD-mediated dimerization and subsequent trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain."
https://openalex.org/W2968352834,"The anatomical structure of wood is complex and contains considerable information about its specific species, physical properties, growth environment, and other factors. While conventional wood anatomy has been established by systematizing the xylem anatomical features, which enables wood identification generally up to genus level, it is difficult to describe all the information comprehensively. This study apply two computer vision approaches to optical micrographs: the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm and connected-component labelling. They extract the shape and pore size information, respectively, statistically from the whole micrographs. Both approaches enable the efficient detection of specific features of 18 species from the family Fagaceae. Although the methods ignore the positional information, which is important for the conventional wood anatomy, the simple information on the shape or size of the elements is enough to describe the species-specificity of wood. In addition, according to the dendrograms calculated from the numerical distances of the features, the closeness of some taxonomic groups is inconsistent with the types of porosity, which is one of the typical classification systems for wood anatomy, but consistent with the evolution based on molecular phylogeny; for example, ring-porous group Cerris and radial-porous group Ilex are nested in the same cluster. We analyse which part of the wood structure gave the taxon-specific information, indicating that the latewood zone of group Cerris is similar to the whole zone of group Ilex. Computer vision approaches provide statistical information that uncovers new aspects of wood anatomy that have been overlooked by conventional visual inspection."
https://openalex.org/W2968582041,"Background Troxerutin (TRX) has a beneficial effect on blood viscosity and platelet aggregation, and is currently used for the treatment of chronic varicosity. Recently, TRX can improve lipid abnormalities, glucose intolerance and oxidative stress in high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders. In this study, we tested the effect of TRX on metabolic syndrome-associated disorders using a non-obese model of metabolic syndrome–the Hereditary Hypertriglyceridaemic rats (HHTg). Methods Adult male HHTg rats were fed standard diet without or with TRX (150 mg/kg bwt/day for 4 weeks). Results Compared to untreated rats, TRX supplementation in HHTg rats decreased serum glucose (p<0.05) and insulin (p<0.05). Although blood lipids were not affected, TRX decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations (p<0.01) and reduced gene expression of HMGCR, SREBP2 and SCD1 (p<0.01), involved in cholesterol synthesis and lipid homeostasis. TRX-treated rats exhibited decreased lipoperoxidation and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPx (p<0.05) in the liver. In addition, TRX supplementation increased insulin sensitivity in muscles and epididymal adipose tissue (p<0.05). Elevated serum adiponectin (p<0.05) and decreased muscle triglyceride (p<0.05) helped improve insulin sensitivity. Among the beneficial effects of TRX were changes to cytochrome P450 family enzymes. Hepatic gene expression of CYP4A1, CYP4A3 and CYP5A1 (p<0.01) decreased, while there was a marked elevation in gene expression of CYP1A1 (p<0.01). Conclusion Our results indicate that TRX improves hepatic lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. As well as ameliorating oxidative stress, TRX can reduce ectopic lipid deposition, affect genes involved in lipid metabolism, and influence the activity of CYP family enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2967272252,"Background Relative blood volume (RBV) changes during hemodialysis (HD) are typically estimated based on online measurements of hematocrit, hemoglobin or total blood protein. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the above parameters during HD in order to compare the potential differences in the RBV changes estimated by individual methods. Methods 25 anuric maintenance HD patients were monitored during a 1-week conventional HD treatment. Blood samples were collected from the arterial dialysis blood line at the beginning and at the end of each HD session. The analysis of blood samples was performed using the hematology analyzer Advia 2120 and clinical chemistry analyzer Advia 1800 (Siemens Healthcare). Results During the analyzed 30 HD sessions with ultrafiltration in the range 0.7–4.0 L (2.5 ± 0.8 L) hematocrit (HCT) increased by 9.1 ± 7.0% (mean ± SD), hemoglobin (HGB) increased by 10.6 ± 6.3%, total plasma protein (TPP) increased by 15.6 ± 9.5%, total blood protein (TBP) increased by 10.4 ± 5.8%, red blood cell count (RBC) increased by 10.8 ± 7.1%, while mean corpuscular red cell volume (MCV) decreased by 1.5 ± 1.1% (all changes statistically significant, p < 0.001). HGB increased on average by 1.5% more than HCT (p < 0.001). The difference between HGB and TBP increase was insignificant (p = 0.16). Conclusions Tracking HGB or TBP can be treated as equivalent for the purpose of estimating RBV changes during HD. Due to the reduction of MCV, the HCT-based estimate of RBV changes may underestimate the actual blood volume changes."
https://openalex.org/W2967320423,"In barley, six-rowed barley is advantageous over two-rowed barley for feed due to the larger number of seeds per spike and the higher seed protein content. The growth of six-rowed barley is potentially important for breeding in agriculturally oriented countries, such as Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, until recently, very little attention was given to six-rowed barley in breeding projects in Kazakhstan, one of the largest countries in the world. In this study, phenotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data were generated from 275 accessions originating from six different breeding organizations in the USA as well as 9 accessions from Kazakhstan in field trials at six breeding institutions. The USA six-rowed barley was tested in comparison to local accessions over three years (2009–2011) based on analyses of key agronomic traits. It was determined that the average yield in the USA accessions in comparison to local lines showed heavier yield in all six tested sites. Principal Coordinate Analysis based on 1618 polymorphic SNP markers separated Kazakh lines from six USA barley origin groups based on PC1 (77.9%), and Montana lines from the remaining five USA groups based on PC2 (15.1%). A genome-wide association study based on eighteen field trials allowed the identification of 47 stable marker-trait associations (MTA) for ten agronomic traits, including key yield related characters such as yield per square meter, thousand grain weight, number of kernels per spike, and productive tillers. The comparison of chromosomal positions of identified MTA with positions of known genes and quantitative trait loci suggests that 25 out of those 47 MTAs are presumably novel. The analysis of 42 SNPs associated with 47 MTAs in the Ensemble genome annotation system (http://ensemblgenomes.org) suggested that 40 SNPs were in genic positions of the genome, as their sequences successfully aligned with corresponding Gen ID."
https://openalex.org/W2966901678,"Hierarchical organisation is a prevalent feature of many complex networks appearing in nature and society. A relating interesting, yet less studied question is how does a hierarchical network evolve over time? Here we take a data driven approach and examine the time evolution of the network between the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, part of the U. S. National Library of Medicine). The network between the MeSH terms is organised into 16 different, yearly updated hierarchies such as ""Anatomy"", ""Diseases"", ""Chemicals and Drugs"", etc. The natural representation of these hierarchies is given by directed acyclic graphs, composed of links pointing from nodes higher in the hierarchy towards nodes in lower levels. Due to the yearly updates, the structure of these networks is subject to constant evolution: new MeSH terms can appear, terms becoming obsolete can be deleted or be merged with other terms, and also already existing parts of the network may be rewired. We examine various statistical properties of the time evolution, with a special focus on the attachment and detachment mechanisms of the links, and find a few general features that are characteristic for all MeSH hierarchies. According to the results, the hierarchies investigated display an interesting interplay between non-uniform preference with respect to multiple different topological and hierarchical properties."

Herein we presented this nationwide, prospective study to examine the impact of working hours restrictions on the QOL among medical interns.The study recruited 295 medical interns (age: 25.3 ± 2.1, male: 68.1%) from all the 8 medical colleges in Taiwan during the 2012-2013 academic years. Subjects were assessed for QOL by brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) before and every 3 months during their internship. We also investigated their demographic data, working hours, workload characteristics, such as specialties of internship rotation, acceptance of new patients after 24-hour, and no 24-hour off within 7 days, and self-reported patient related burnout. We used generalized estimation equation to delineate the change of WHOQOL-BREF and PHQ-9 scores during internship. We used multivariate regression analysis to examine the associated factors of QOL.WHOQOL-BREF score significantly decreased during internship (baseline: 60.0 ± 9.7, 53.7 ± 9.3 at 3 months, then remained at 55 after 9 months). Acceptance of new patients after 24 hours of continuous duty (β = -2.089), no 24-hour off within 7 days (β = -1.748), score of patient related burnout (β = -2.50), and PHQ-9 depression score (β = -1.02) were associated with lower WHOQOL-BREF score. Working hours was not significantly associated with the QOL (p = .6268).Our findings revealed interns' QOL significantly decreased during internship. Acceptance of new patients after 24-hour of continuous duty and patient related burnout predominantly impacted interns' QOL and depression more than working hours did."
https://openalex.org/W2967744196,"Direct conversion from fibroblasts to generate hepatocyte like-cells (iHeps) bypassing the pluripotent state has been described in previous reports as an attractive method acquiring hepatocytes for cell-based therapy. The limited proliferation of iHeps, however, has hampered it uses in cell-based therapy. Since hepatic stem cells (HepSCs) possess self-renewal and bipotency with the capacity to differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, they have therapeutic potential for treating liver disease. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of induced HepSCs (iHepSCs) on a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis model. We demonstrate that Oct4 and Hnf4a are sufficient to convert fibroblasts into expandable iHepSCs. Hepatocyte-like cells derived from iHepSCs (iHepSC-HEPs) exhibit the typical morphology of hepatocytes and hepatic functions, including glycogen storage, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, Indocyanine green (ICG) detoxification, drug metabolism, urea production, and albumin secretion. iHepSCs-derived cholangiocyte-like cells (iHepSC-CLCs) expressed cholangiocyte-specific markers and formed cysts and tubule-like structures with apical-basal polarity and secretory function in three-dimensional culture condition. Furthermore, iHepSCs showed anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. This study demonstrates that Oct4 and Hnf4α-induced HepSCs show typical hepatic and biliary functionality in vitro. It also presents the therapeutic effect of iHepSCs in liver fibrosis. Therefore, directly converting iHepSCs from somatic cells may facilitate the development of patient-specific cell-based therapy for chronic liver damage."
https://openalex.org/W2967861335,"Inflammatory cytokines enhanced the progress of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, however the mechanisms remain unclear. The objective is to determine aquaporins (AQPs) in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.Primary rat articular chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β to mimic the early stage of osteoarthritis in vitro. Early osteoarthritis animal model was established by intra-articular injection of 4% papain. Micro- or ultra-structure histopathologic changes, cell viability, apoptosis cells and cell membrane permeability, locations and expressions of AQP1 and AQP3 and matrix were detected in the cartilage or in the chondrocytes of knee. IL-1β could reduce the chondrocytes viability, increase the apoptosis cells, and also impair the cell membrane and organelles. IL-1β significantly induced the up-regulation of AQP1 and AQP3 in the chondrocytes. In the chondrocytes, AQPs were mainly clustered in both membrane and perinuclear region of cytoplasm, while higher AQPs were detected in the superficial and middle layers of the cartilage. With the up-regulation of AQPs, the cartilage matrix was considerably decreased in both the chondrocytes and in the osteoarthritis cartilage. In the early osteoarthritis rat model, serum and synovial fluid confirmed that higher IL-1β could increase the expressions of AQPs, and decrease the cartilage matrix in both the chondrocytes and the cartilage.Inflammatory cytokine IL-1β via up-regulation of AQPs caused the abnormal metabolism of water transport and loss of the cartilage matrix in the chondrocytes, and ultimately exacerbated the pathogenesis of early osteoarthritis. Therefore, AQPs may be a candidate therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2968648759,"Background High quality dietary intake data is required to support evidence of diet-disease relationships exposed in clinical research. Source data verification may be a useful quality assurance method in this setting. The present pilot study aimed to apply source data verification to evaluate the quality of the data coding process for dietary intake in a clinical trial and to explore potential barriers to data quality in this setting. Methods Using a sample of 20 cases from a clinical trial, source data verification was conducted between three sets of data derived documents: transcripts of audio-recorded diet history interviews, matched paper-based diet history forms and outputs from nutrition analysis software. The number of cases and rates of discrepancies between documents were calculated. A total of five in-depth interviews with dietitians collecting and coding dietary data were thematically analysed. Results Some 2024 discrepancies were identified. The highest discrepancy rate was 57.49%, and occurred between diet history interviews and nutrition analysis software outputs. Sources of the discrepancies included both quantities and frequencies of food intake. The highest discrepancy rate was for the food group “vegetable products and dishes”. In-depth interviews implicated recall bias of trial participants as a cause of discrepancies, but dietitians also acknowledged a possible subconscious influence of having to code reported foods into nutrition analysis software programs. Conclusion The accuracy of dietary intake data appeared to depend on the level of detailed food data required. More support for participants on reporting consumption, and incorporating supportive tools to guide estimates of food quantities may facilitate a more consistent coding process and improve data quality. This pilot study offers a novel method and an overview of dietary intake data coding measurement errors. These findings may warrant further investigation in a larger sample."

Site-level clinical investigators, however, do not have access to results on the adequacy of research biopsies for histological or molecular assays, because samples are sent to central labs and the test results are seldom reported back to site-level investigators unless requested. We evaluated the feasibility, safety, and adequacy of research biopsies performed at an academic medical center.We retrospectively reviewed the data on 122 research biopsy sessions conducted in 99 patients via percutaneous core needle biopsy for 39 clinical trials from January 2017 to February 2018 at a single institute. We asked the sponsors of each clinical trial for the adequacy of the biopsy samples for histological or molecular assays.The biopsy success rate was 93.4% (113/122), with nine samples categorized as inadequate for obtaining pathologic diagnosis. Post-biopsy complications occurred in 9.8% (12/122) of biopsies, all of which were mild and completely recovered by the day after the biopsy. The sponsors of clinical trials provided feedbacks on the adequacy of 76 biopsy samples, and noted that a total of 8 biopsy samples from 7 patients were inadequate for analysis, resulting in an adequacy rate of 89.5% (68/76): the reasons for inadequacy were insufficient tumor content for immunohistochemistry (n = 3) and low RNA yield for sequencing (n = 5).Research biopsies performed at an experienced, multidisciplinary center had acceptable safety for patients as well as practicality in terms of obtaining adequate tissue samples for molecular studies."
https://openalex.org/W2966888192,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a complex, heritable disorder. Genome-wide linkage analyses of families affected by VUR have revealed multiple genomic loci linked to VUR. These loci normally harbor a number of genes whose biologically functional variant is yet to be identified. DNA copy number variations (CNVs) have not been extensively studied at high resolution in VUR patients. In this study, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on a cohort of patients with a history of both VUR and urinary tract infection (UTI) with the objective of identifying genetic variations responsible for VUR and/or UTI susceptibility. UTI/VUR-associated CNVs were identified by aCGH results from the 192 Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) patients compared to 683 controls. Rare, large CNVs that are likely pathogenic and lead to VUR development were identified using stringent analysis criteria. Because UTI is a common affliction with multiple risk factors, we utilized standard analysis to identify potential disease-modifying CNVs that can contribute to UTI risk. Gene ontology analysis identified that CNVs in innate immunity and development genes were enriched in RIVUR patients. CNVs affecting innate immune genes may contribute to UTI susceptibility in VUR patients and may provide the first step in assisting clinical medicine in determining adverse outcome risk in children with VUR."
https://openalex.org/W2967653342,"Cells and organisms have developed homeostatic mechanisms which protect them against a changing environment. How growth and homeostasis interact is still not well understood, but of increasing interest to the molecular and synthetic biology community to recognize and design control circuits which can oppose the diluting effects of cell growth. In this paper we describe the performance of selected negative feedback controllers in response to different applied growth laws and time dependent outflow perturbations of a controlled variable. The approach taken here is based on deterministic mass action kinetics assuming that cell content is instantaneously mixed. All controllers behave ideal in the sense that they for step-wise perturbations in volume and a controlled compound A are able to drive A precisely back to the controllers' theoretical set-points. The applied growth kinetics reflect experimentally observed growth laws, which range from surface to volume ratio growth to linear and exponential growth. Our results show that the kinetic implementation of integral control and the structure of the negative feedback loop are two properties which affect controller performance. Best performance is observed for controllers based on derepression kinetics and controllers with an autocatalytic implementation of integral control. Both are able to defend exponential growth and perturbations, although the autocatalytic controller shows an offset from its theoretical set-point. Controllers with activating signaling using zero-order or bimolecular (antithetic) kinetics for integral control behave very similar but less well. Their performance can be improved by implementing negative feedback structures having repression/derepression steps or by increasing controller aggressiveness. Our results provide a guide what type of feedback structures and integral control kinetics are suitable to oppose the dilution effects by different growth laws and time dependent perturbations on a deterministic level."
https://openalex.org/W2968362182,"There is no cure or beneficial management option for Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy (MD) type 2B (LGMD2B). Losartan, a blood pressure (BP) lowering angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type 1 (ATR1) blocker (ARB) with unique anti-transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) properties, can protect muscles in various types of MD such as Duchenne MD, suggesting a potential benefit for LGMD2B patients. Herein, we show in a mild, dysferlin-null mouse model of LGMD2B that losartan increased quadriceps muscle fibrosis (142%; P<0.0001). In a severe, atherogenic diet-fed model of LGMD2B recently described by our group, losartan further exacerbated dysferlin-null mouse muscle wasting in quadriceps and triceps brachii, two muscles typically affected by LGMD2B, by 40% and 51%, respectively (P<0.05). Lower TGF-β signalling was not observed with losartan, therefore plasma levels of atherogenic lipids known to aggravate LGMD2B severity were investigated. We report that losartan increased both plasma triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations in dysferlin-null mice. Other protective properties of losartan, such as increased nitric oxide release and BP lowering, were also reduced in the absence of dysferlin expression. Our data suggest that LGMD2B patients may show some resistance to the primary BP-lowering effects of losartan along with accelerated muscle wasting and dyslipidemia. Hence, we urge caution on the use of ARBs in this population as their ATR1 pathway may be dysfunctional."
https://openalex.org/W2967990917,"Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) may manifest cognitive and non-cognitive phenotypes including motor impairment, suggesting a shared underlying biology. We tested the hypothesis that five cortical proteins identified from a gene network that drives AD and cognitive phenotypes are also related to motor function in the same individuals. We examined 1208 brains of older adults with motor and cognitive assessments prior to death. Cortical proteins were quantified with SRM proteomics and we collected indices of AD and other related pathologies. A higher level of IGFBP5 was associated with poorer motor function proximate to death but AK4, HSPB2, ITPK1 and PLXNB1 were unrelated to motor function. The association of IGFBP5 with motor function was unrelated to the presence of indices of brain pathologies. In contrast, the addition of a term for cognition attenuated the association of IGFBP5 with motor function by about 90% and they were no longer related. These data lend support for the idea that unidentified cortical proteins like IGFBP5, which may not manifest a known pathologic footprint, may contribute to motor and cognitive function in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2968148090,"Silencing Mediator of Retinoid and Thyroid Hormone Receptors (SMRT) and the nuclear receptor co-repressor1 (NCoR1) are paralogs and regulate nuclear receptor (NR) function through the recruitment of a multiprotein complex that includes histone deacetylase activity. Previous genetic strategies which deleted SMRT in a specific tissue or which altered the interaction between SMRT and NRs have suggested that it may regulate adiposity and insulin sensitivity. However, the full role of SMRT in adult mice has been difficult to establish because its complete deletion during embryogenesis is lethal. To elucidate the specific roles of SMRT in mouse target tissues especially in the context of thyroid hormone (TH) signaling, we used a tamoxifen-inducible post-natal disruption strategy. We found that global SMRT deletion causes dramatic obesity even though mice were fed a standard chow diet and exhibited normal food intake. This weight gain was associated with a decrease in energy expenditure. Interestingly, the deletion of SMRT had no effect on TH action in any tissue but did regulate retinoic acid receptor (RAR) function in the liver. We also demonstrate that the deletion of SMRT leads to profound hepatic steatosis in the setting of obesity. This is unlike NCoR1 deletion, which results in hepatic steatosis due to the upregulation of lipogenic gene expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that SMRT plays a unique and CoR specific role in the regulation of body weight and has no role in TH action. This raises the possibility that additional role of CoRs besides NCoR1 and SMRT may exist to regulate TH action."

Data cleaning was carried out to remove duplicate entries and to exclude pharmaceutical imports for individual uses, promotion purpose, donations, raw material, medical devices, government institutions and veterinary products.A total of 397 different suppliers imported pharmaceutical in Tanzania mainland from 2013 to 2016 fiscal years. In the 2013-2014 fiscal year, the private sector suppliers imported pharmaceutical worth 216 U.S million dollars. India ranked as the first country for exporting highest value of pharmaceutical into the country. It displays a 54% cumulative market share of total imports from 2013-2016, followed by Egypt (11.7%), Switzerland and the USA hold 4.1% of cumulative market share. By 2020-2021 fiscal years, we forecast for imported pharmaceuticals to reach a total value of 906 U.S million dollars for the private sector supply chain. All analysis in this study and the forecasted figures are limited to private sector pharmaceutical supply chain only and does not include data for government pharmaceutical supply chain.Our result shows that the vast majority of pharmaceutical imports in the private sector supply chain are dominated by imports from India. India is competing with other countries such as Egypt, Switzerland, USA and South Africa among the top importing countries. There was almost an equal distribution of pharmaceutical for both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Data presented shows a growing trend for the market segment for medicines required for the management of non-communicable diseases. Generally, the private sector pharmaceutical market is keeping on rising at a rapid pace. By the year 2021, the growth is forecasted to increase by 28% compared to the current market value. The projected growth rate could be good news for foreign pharmaceutical companies seeking new sources of growth in international pharmaceutical trading. It is also good news to the poor patients if the availability of drugs previously unavailable in the country is significantly increased."
https://openalex.org/W2968112414,"Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in patients with kidney disease; but often underdiagnosed as it is infrequently assessed in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to assess the risk factors of SDB in haemodialysis patients, and to identify useful assessment tools to detect SDB in this population.We used nocturnal oximetry, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and STOPBANG questionnaire to screen for SDB in haemodialysis patients. Presence of SDB was defined by Oxygen desaturation index (ODI≥5/h), and further confirmed by apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) from an in-laboratory polysomnography. Blood samples were collected prior to commencing a haemodialysis treatment.SDB was detected in 70% of participants (N = 107, mean age 67 years). STOPBANG revealed that 89% of participants were at risk of SDB; however, only 17% reported daytime sleepiness on the ESS. Of the participants who underwent polysomnography (n = 36), obstructive sleep apnoea was identified in 86%, and median AHI was 34.5/h. Oximetry and AHI results were positively correlated (r = 0.62, P = 0.0001), as were oximetry and STOPBANG (r = 0.48; P<0.0001), but not ESS (r = 0.19; P = 0.08). Multivariate analysis showed that neck circumference (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07-1.34; P = 0.02) and haemoglobin (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88-0.97; P = 0.003) were independently associated with the presence of SDB.Dialysis patients with a large neck circumference and anaemia are at risk of SDB; using nocturnal oximetry is practical and reliable to screen for SDB and should be considered in routine management of dialysis patients, particularly for those who demonstrate risk factors."

Whilst there is limited interest in laws and interventions controlling tobacco use in public places in Bangladesh, no attention has been given to preventing tobacco-use inside homes. This study explores the familial and socio-cultural factors that provide obstacles for ensuring tobacco-free homes in Bangladesh.A mixed-method design was adopted and from among the 1,436 tobacco users identified in a population of 11,853, 400 (tobacco users) were selected for cross-sectional survey. This survey involved a probability proportional sampling procedure, and 24 In-Depth Interviews. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore the association of familial and socio-cultural factors with tobacco-use at home adjusted by other demographic characteristics. Thematic content analysis was done on the qualitative data, and then inferences were drawn out collectively.This study revealed that the prevalence of tobacco-use in the home was 25.7% in urban residential areas in Bangladesh. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that familial and socio-cultural factors were significantly associated with tobacco-use at home: marital status (OR 3.23, 95% CI: 1.37-6.61), education (OR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.15-3.99), smoking habits of older family members (OR 1.81 95% CI: 0.91-2.89), tobacco being offered as hospitality and for entertainment (OR 1.85, 95% CI: .94-2.95) and lack of religiosity practice (OR 2.39, 95% CI: 1.27-4.54). Qualitative findings indicated that social customs, lack of religious practice, tobacco-use of older family members, and lack of family guidance were key obstacles for enabling tobacco-free homes in urban areas.Use of tobacco at home is continuing as part of established familial and socio-cultural traditions. If tobacco-use at home is not addressed seriously by the authorities then the emerging threat of second-hand smoke exposure and harmful consequences of tobacco- use will be exacerbated."
https://openalex.org/W2967928906,"A common feature of preclinical animal experiments is repeated measurement of the outcome, e.g., body weight measured in mice pups weekly for 20 weeks. Separate time point analysis or repeated measures analysis approaches can be used to analyze such data. Each approach requires assumptions about the underlying data and violations of these assumptions have implications for estimation of precision, and type I and type II error rates. Given the ethical responsibilities to maximize valid results obtained from animals used in research, our objective was to evaluate approaches to reporting repeated measures design used by investigators and to assess how assumptions about variation in the outcome over time impact type I and II error rates and precision of estimates. We assessed the reporting of repeated measures designs of 58 studies in preclinical animal experiments. We used simulation modelling to evaluate three approaches to statistical analysis of repeated measurement data. In particular, we assessed the impact of (a) repeated measure analysis assuming that the outcome had non-constant variation at all time points (heterogeneous variance) (b) repeated measure analysis assuming constant variation in the outcome (homogeneous variance), (c) separate ANOVA at individual time point in repeated measures designs. The evaluation of the three model fitting was based on comparing the p-values distributions, the type I and type II error rates and by implication, the shrinkage or inflation of standard error estimates from 1000 simulated dataset. Of 58 studies with repeated measures design, three provided a rationale for repeated measurement and 23 studies reported using a repeated-measures analysis approach. Of the 35 studies that did not use repeated-measures analysis, fourteen studies used only two time points to calculate weight change which potentially means collected data was not fully utilized. Other studies reported only select time points (n = 12) raising the issue of selective reporting. Simulation studies showed that an incorrect assumption about the variance structure resulted in modified error rates and precision estimates. The reporting of the validity of assumptions for repeated measurement data is very poor. The homogeneous variation assumption, which is often invalid for body weight measurements, should be confirmed prior to conducting the repeated-measures analysis using homogeneous covariance structure and adjusting the analysis using corrections or model specifications if this is not met."

The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of HTLV I/II and its associated factors in donors to a blood bank of Medellín Colombia, 2014–2018. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of 52,159 donors with a secondary information source. Seroprevalence of HTLV I/II was determined with its confidence interval and the population characteristics were described by frequency and summary measures. To explore the associated factors, Pearson’s Chi square test, Mann-Whitney U test, crude odds ratios were used and they were adjusted by logistic regression in SPSS 25.0. Results 88% of the population lived in the metropolitan area, 68.5% belonged to the University. 76.2% were altruistic donors (unpaid donors who did not donate to a specific patient). 24.5% were repetitive (paid) donors. 75% of the donors were under 41 years old. The seroprevalence of HTLV I/II was 0.176% (95% CI = 0.139% -0.213%), being statistically lower in repetitive donors and men. Conclusion The seroprevalence of HTLV I/II infection in the studied blood bank is lower than that reported in other blood banks at the departmental and national levels. In Medellín, it was associated with the frequency of donation and gender, which is useful information for the hemovigilance programs of the city."

Methods This study included 113 eyes of 65 patients with POAG followed for an average of 4.81 ± 1.24 years. Evaluation of visual field progression rate was performed using mean deviation of standard automated perimetry. Corneal deflection amplitude was measured using Corvis ST (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Linear mixed models were performed to determine the relationship between corneal deflection amplitude, intraocular pressure (IOP), and visual field progression rate. Results Mean age was 56.36 ± 14.58 years. Baseline average mean deviation was -8.20 ± 9.12 dB and mean treated IOP was 14.38 ± 3.08 mmHg. Average deflection amplitude was 0.90 ± 0.13 mm. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, IOP (P = 0.028 and P < 0.001, respectively) and deflection amplitude (P = 0.034 and P < 0.001, respectively) significantly affected visual field progression rate. Eyes with high IOP and greater deflection amplitude showed faster progression rate. Conclusions Corneal deflection amplitude was significantly related with glaucoma progression. Eyes with greater corneal deflection amplitude showed faster visual field progression rate in patients with POAG."

According to the WHO bulletin report, the H5N1 virus is a zoonotic disease threat that has infected more than 850 humans, causing over 450 deaths. In addition, an outbreak of another new and highly pathogenic influenza virus (H7N9) occurred in 2013 in China. These highly pathogenic influenza viruses could potentially cause a worldwide pandemic. it is crucial to develop a rapid production platform to meet this surge demand against any possible influenza pandemic. A potential solution for this problem is the use of cell-based bioreactors for rapid vaccine production. These novel bioreactors, used for cell-based vaccine production, possess various advantages. For example, they enable a short production time, allow for the handling highly pathogenic influenza in closed environments, and can be easily scaled up. In this study, two novel disposable cell-based bioreactors, BelloCell and TideCell, were used to produce H5N1 clade II and H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were used for the production of these influenza CVVs. A novel bench-scale bioreactor named BelloCell bioreactor was used in the study. All culturing conditions were tested and scaled to 10 L industrial-scale bioreactor known as TideCell002. The performances of between BelloCell and TideCell were similar in cell growth, the average MDCK cell doubling time was slightly decreased to 25 hours. The systems yielded approximately 39.2 and 18.0 μg/ml of HA protein with the 10-liter TideCell002 from the H5N1 clade II and H7N9 CVVs, respectively. The results of this study not only highlight the overall effectiveness of these bioreactors but also illustrate the potential of maintaining the same outcome when scaled up to industrial production, which has many implications for faster vaccine production. Although additional studies are required for process optimization, the results of this study are promising and show that oscillating bioreactors may be a suitable platform for pandemic influenza virus production."

This especially applies to the concept of the fitness landscape, one of the most important abstractions in evolutionary genetics, and one which has benefited from the presence of large empirical data sets only in the last decade or so.

These data can be codified or analogized in terms of a multidimensional empirical fitness landscape towards the examination of advanced concepts-adaptive landscape by environment interactions, clonal competition, higher-order epistasis and countless others.

People with disability (PWD) often rely on others, both for direct support and for the creation of enabling environments to meet their needs. This need makes it crucial for professionals to be willing to work with PWD, and for people to pursue careers that focus on supporting PWD.


Objectives 
To explore self-other overlap as a unique predictor of willingness to work with PWD as part of one’s career, using three studies.


Methods 
Studies 1 and 2 used cross-sectional surveys of college undergraduates to explore: 1. whether an association between self-other overlap and willingness to work with PWD exists, and 2. whether self-other overlap is a unique predictor, controlling for attitudes and empathy. Study 3 investigated whether self-other overlap is associated with the groups with whom the students indicated they want (and do not want) to work as part of their career.


Results 
Across the three studies, self-other overlap was uniquely associated with students’ willingness to work with PWD as part of one’s profession, even when controlling for attitudes and empathy.


Conclusions 
Self-other overlap may be an important additional factor to take into consideration when developing interventions targeted toward promoting working with PWD."
https://openalex.org/W2968542990,"Species of Gasterophilus Leach are obligate parasites in domestic and wild equids and responsible for cosmopolitan gasterophilosis. Although with only eight species known so far, they have received considerable attention because of their significant veterinary and economic importance. Surprisingly, we found that G. flavipes (Olivier) is a valid species based on morphological characters from male, female and the egg, after spending half a century as a synonym of G. haemorrhoidalis (Linnaeus). In the present study, G. flavipes, G. haemorrhoidalis and G. inermis (Brauer), which are the three closely related species possessing a remarkable mixture of shared morphological characters, are diagnosed and comparatively redescribed; the key to separate adults and eggs are provided, together with a series of high-resolution photographs from all the body parts. COI barcodes do not allow for a separation of G. flavipes, G. haemorrhoidalis and G. inermis, but showed a closer relationship between G. flavipes and G. haemorrhoidalis than the other two combinations, which is consistent with the morphological evidence. Geographically, G. flavipes seems to be common and widespread in the warmer parts of the Palaearctic region. Thus, the epidemiology of gasterophilosis where G. flavipes is known or supposed to occur calls for a more careful veterinarian re-assessment. A decline in the populations of Gasterophilus spp. has been noticed in Europe, but all seven Palaearctic species of Gasterophilus appear to maintain stable populations in Xinjiang (China), which may be explained by a higher biodiversity of equids and less use of anti-parasitic treatments in Xinjiang than in Europe. Our study shows that morphological characters still provide the solid backbone in classification of Gasterophilus at species-level, and updated diagnoses and a key is provided to distinguish G. flavipes, G. haemorrhoidalis and G. inermis, and to facilitate studies of epidemiology, phylogeny and host-parasite co-evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2969081035,"We present a discrete mechanical model to study plant development. The method is built up of mass points, springs and hinges mimicking the plant cell wall’s microstructure. To model plastic growth the resting lengths of springs are adjusted; when springs exceed a threshold length, new mass points, springs and hinges, are added. We formulate a stiffness tensor for the springs and hinges as a function of the fourth rank tensor of elasticity and the geometry of the mesh. This allows us to approximate the material law as a generalized orthotropic Hooke’s law, and control material properties during growth. The material properties of the model are illustrated in numerical simulations for finite strain and plastic growth. To solve the equations of motion of mass points we assume elastostatics and use Verlet integration. The method is demonstrated in simulations when anisotropic growth causes emergent residual strain fields in cell walls and a bending of tissue. The method can be used in multilevel models to study plant development, for example by coupling it to models for cytoskeletal, hormonal and gene regulatory processes."

OI is an autosomal dominant disorder, resulting from mutations to COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. Because collagen I is a heterotrimer of α1(I) and α2(I) α-chains, only one or two mutant α-chains will be incorporated into the collagen I triple helix. In the homotrimeric collagen III, vEDS mutations may result in incorporation of up to three mutant α-chains. For OI, clinical phenotypes have been classified based on severity, and larger Gly substitutions more frequently result in lethal OI (43Bodian D.L. Madhan B. Brodsky B. Klein T.E.

This suggests that the structural impact of different amino acids on the collagen III triple helix may be relevant to disease outcome. Three amino acid substitutions at Gly240, in the integrin-binding GROGER motif, have been associated with vEDS: Ala, Arg, and Val (https://eds.gene.le.ac.uk) 5Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

In this work, we employed CMPs incorporating these naturally occurring vEDS substitutions within the GROGER α2I-binding site. We probed how the specific amino acid substitutions impact functional cell spreading and α2I adhesion and elucidated the underlying atomic-level structural and dynamic perturbations to the collagen triple helix and the CMP–α2I interaction interface. We found that although the Ala mutation locally disrupts the canonical triple-helix hydrogen bonding and enhances the backbone dynamics, it is not sufficient to significantly reduce α2I interactions, in the context of recombinant protein or on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). However, larger substitutions, Arg and Val, do impede α2I interactions through different mechanisms involving breakage of side-chain interactions or Mg2+ coordination, as suggested by MD simulations. Novel insight into this sequence–structure/dynamics–function relationship sets the foundation for new drug therapy techniques to combat collagen disorders that lead to compromised collagen interactions.

By plotting the distribution of cases within the collagenous domain of collagen III, it is apparent that mutations are concentrated in four regions of the collagenous domain: 1) the terminus, 2) Gly681–Gly744, 3) Gly924–Gly987, and 4) the C terminus (Fig. 1A).

From the perspective of spatiotemporal evolution, we analyze how port opening promoted China's reform and opening-up process. First, the port development process is divided into four periods. In the start-up period, the pilot open port policy created a platform for foreign cooperation and exchange. During the expansion period, port openings promoted the continuous optimization of the trade structure. In the cooperation period, port openings corresponded with the adjustment of China's overall industrial structure. During the optimization period, port openings provided guarantees for the implementation of a national development strategy. Second, we analyze the distribution of ports and their relationship with cross-border logistics and passenger flow. Based on data of foreign trade and passenger flow, a port openness degree measurement model includes port logistics intensity, passenger flow intensity and port city foreign-trade volume is constructed. There are significant types, geographical differences and grade differences of ports' openness."
https://openalex.org/W2968949390,"People rapidly make first impressions of others, often based on very little information-minimal exposure to faces or voices is sufficient for humans to make up their mind about personality of others. While there has been considerable research on voice personality perception, much less is known about its relevance to hallucination-proneness, despite auditory hallucinations being frequently perceived as personified social agents. The present paper reports two studies investigating the relation between voice personality perception and hallucination-proneness in non-clinical samples. A voice personality perception task was created, in which participants rated short voice recordings on four personality characteristics, relating to dimensions of the voice's perceived Valence and Dominance. Hierarchical regression was used to assess contributions of Valence and Dominance voice personality ratings to hallucination-proneness scores, controlling for paranoia-proneness and vividness of mental imagery. Results from Study 1 suggested that high ratings of voices as dominant might be related to high hallucination-proneness; however, this relation seemed to be dependent on reported levels of paranoid thinking. In Study 2, we show that hallucination-proneness was associated with high ratings of voice dominance, and this was independent of paranoia and imagery abilities scores, both of which were found to be significant predictors of hallucination-proneness. Results from Study 2 suggest an interaction between gender of participants and the gender of the voice actor, where only ratings of own gender voices on Dominance characteristics are related to hallucination-proneness scores. These results are important for understanding the perception of characterful features of voices and its significance for psychopathology."

The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate maternal and infant characteristics associated with injury-related infant deaths in West Virginia. Birth and infant mortality data for 2010-2014 were sourced from the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Charleston. Relative risk was calculated using log-binomial regression utilizing generalized estimating equations. Maternal characteristics associated with injury-related infant mortality in West Virginia were race/ethnicity ([Formula: see text] = 7.48, p = .03), and smoking during pregnancy ([Formula: see text], p < .00). Risk of a Black Non-Hispanic infant suffering an injury-related death was 4.0 (95% CL 1.7, 9.3) times that of infants of other races/ethnicities. Risk of an infant dying from an injury-related cause, if the mother smoked during pregnancy, was 2.9 (95% CL 1.6, 5.0) times the risk of such a death if maternal smoking status during pregnancy is unknown or no smoking, controlling for race/ethnicity. This study provides important information to public health stakeholders at both the state and local levels in designing interventions for partial reduction or prevention of injury-related infant mortality in West Virginia."
