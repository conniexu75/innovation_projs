https://openalex.org/W2567896191,"The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting."

Wounding can leave scars, which are characterized by a lack of hair follicles and cutaneous fat. Plikus et al. now show that hair follicles in both mice and humans can convert myofibroblasts, the predominant dermal cell in a wound, into adipocytes (see the Perspective by Chan and Longaker). The hair follicles activated the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway and adipocyte transcription factors in the myofibroblast. Thus, it may be possible to reduce scar formation after wounding by adding BMP. Science , this issue p. 748 ; see also p. 693"

Tel1 also promotes efficient and timely resection initiation. Resection endpoints display pronounced heterogeneity between genomic loci that reflects a tendency for nucleosomes to block Exo1, yet Exo1 also appears to digest chromatin with high processivity and at rates similar to naked DNA in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2570666210,"Proteasomes and SUMO wrestle chromosomes Meiosis is the double cell division that generates haploid gametes from diploid parental cells. Pairing of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division ensures that each gamete receives a complete set of chromosomes. The proteasome, on the other hand, is a molecular machine that degrades proteins tagged for destruction within the cell (see the Perspective by Zetka). Ahuja et al. show that the proteasome is also involved in ensuring that homologous chromosomes pair with each other during meiosis.

However, a circuit-based mechanism by which KOR modulation of excitation-inhibition balance modifies D1 and D2 MSN activity is lacking. Here, we provide a comprehensive synaptic framework wherein presynaptic KOR inhibition decreases the excitatory drive of D1 MSN activity by the amygdala, but not the hippocampus. Conversely, presynaptic inhibition by KORs of inhibitory synapses on D2 MSNs enhances integration of excitatory drive by the amygdala and hippocampus.

https://openalex.org/W2569397517,"During meiosis, paired homologous chromosomes (homologs) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossovers. Crossovers mediate homolog segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in homolog juxtaposition and crossing over. Without proteasome function, homologs failed to pair and instead remained associated with nonhomologous chromosomes. Although dispensable for noncrossover formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized chromosome axes and stable strand exchange of crossover-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to chromosomes by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic chromosomes are evolutionarily conserved."

The systematic classification of neurons into individual types and subtypes has been a central goal of neuroscience since the days of Ramón y Cajal. In vertebrate nervous systems, neuron type classification schemes are based on anatomical, electrophysiological, and functional features and are currently accumulating more granularity with the advent of more refined molecular classification schemes (Macosko et al., 2015Macosko E.Z.

One core organizational principle has long been evident: neurons can be grouped together based on a number of shared molecular, functional, and developmental traits but can be subdivided into individual subtypes based on subtype-specific traits. For example, serotonergic neurons in the vertebrate central nervous system are a group of neurons in the Raphe nuclei of the brainstem defined by their usage of the same neurotransmitter and their specification by the transcription factor PET1, but they fall into specific subtypes based on anatomical, functional, and molecular features (Gaspar and Lillesaar, 2012Gaspar P.

Similarly, midbrain neurons that utilize dopamine as a neurotransmitter are a group of neurons that are specified by a common set of transcription factors but can also be further subdivided into individual subtypes based on electrophysiological criteria and molecular features (Poulin et al., 2014Poulin J.F. Zou J. Drouin-Ouellet J. Kim K.Y. Cicchetti F. Awatramani R.B.

These examples point to a bipartite scheme of neuron classification and subtype specification: a common factor specifies a group of neurons with shared features, but additional regulatory mechanisms must then operate to diversify neurons into individual subtypes. The mechanistic basis of such diversification processes is not well understood and, more generally, the existence and extent of diversification of neuronal subtypes remains ill defined in complex vertebrate nervous systems. We study this problem in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The 302 neurons of its nervous system are exceptionally well described on an anatomical level (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also on a molecular level (http://www.wormbase.org). Motor neurons (MNs) in the C. elegans ventral nerve cord (VNC) are a paradigm for the neuron subtype diversification problem described above. The VNC is populated by cholinergic and GABAergic MNs that innervate body wall muscles. As illustrated in Figure 1A, cholinergic MNs can be further divided into six classes: the embryonically generated DA and DB and the postembryonically generated AS, VA, VB, and VC classes (Von Stetina et al., 2006Von Stetina S.E. Treinin M. Miller 3rd, D.M. The motor circuit.Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2006; 69: 125-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the ventral nerve cord of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The DA, DB, VA, VB, and AS (but not VC) classes not only share the common trait of being cholinergic (Duerr et al., 2008Duerr J.S. Han H.P. Fields S.D. Rand J.B. Identification of major classes of cholinergic neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but their identities are also specified by the same transcription factor, the COE/EBF-type transcription factor UNC-3 (Kratsios et al., 2011Kratsios P. Stolfi A. Levine M. Hobert O. Coordinated regulation of cholinergic motor neuron traits through a conserved terminal selector gene.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 15: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). DA, VA, and AS can be grouped together based on additional shared anatomical and functional traits, as can DB and VB classes (White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the ventral nerve cord of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). For example, DA and VA are required for backward locomotion, whereas DB and VB classes control forward locomotion (Chalfie et al., 1985Chalfie M. Sulston J.E. White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The neural circuit for touch sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 956-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual MN classes can also be distinguished at the molecular level by their class-specific expression of a specific combination of effector genes that define the unique properties of each individual MN class. These effectors include neurotransmitter receptors, gap junction proteins, signaling molecules, and ion channels (Figures 1B and 1C). Importantly, the terminal selector gene unc-3 is known to be required not only for the expression of shared traits of these cholinergic MNs (e.g., of proteins that synthesize and package acetylcholine [ACh]) but also for the expression of the MN class-specific features (Figure 1C). Such necessity is not only revealed by the loss of expression of class-specific effector genes in unc-3 mutants, but it is also reflected by the presence and requirement of UNC-3 binding sites in these loci (Kratsios et al., 2011Kratsios P. Stolfi A. Levine M. Hobert O. Coordinated regulation of cholinergic motor neuron traits through a conserved terminal selector gene.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 15: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This poses an intriguing conundrum that is analogous to the situation found in many other neuron subtypes with shared traits: how can a transcription factor that activates shared traits in a group of neurons also activate specific traits only in subsets of these neurons? For example, how does PET1 activate serotonin pathway genes in all vertebrate serotonergic neurons but also activate the expression of a host of other genes only in a subtype-specific manner (Okaty et al., 2015Okaty B.W. Freret M.E. Rood B.D. Brust R.D. Hennessy M.L. deBairos D. Kim J.C. Cook M.N. Dymecki S.M.

Pet-1 switches transcriptional targets postnatally to regulate maturation of serotonin neuron excitability.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 1758-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)? Understanding the mechanistic basis of this problem will provide a major step toward understanding how a brain can generate a diverse set of neuron subtypes. Two different scenarios can, in principle, be envisioned for how such diversification processes work: the activator that controls shared traits in several neurons, like UNC-3 in C. elegans VNC MNs, requires class-specific cofactors to activate class-specific features (upper panels in Figure 1D). Alternatively, the shared regulatory factor is capable of activating all features, including class-specific features, but is prevented from doing so via class-specific repressor proteins (lower panel in Figure 1D). These two models make specific genetic predictions: a loss of direct co-activator function would lead to loss of expression of class-specific features, whereas a loss of direct repressor function would lead to ectopic expression of class-specific features. We tested these predictions by performing genetic screens for mutants in which the expression of class-specific features is altered. These screens, as well as the testing of candidate genes, reveal a remarkably homogeneous picture for how cholinergic MN classes diversify: MN class-specific repressor proteins act in distinct classes to prevent UNC-3 from activating subsets of class-specific effector genes. These class-specific repressors include several previously known transcription factors and also a newly identified Zn finger transcription factor, BNC-1. All repressors are phylogenetically conserved. We propose that the mechanism that we define here may constitute a broadly applicable principle of neuron identity diversification across phylogeny. To test the different models for MN identity specification (Figure 1D), we screened for mutants in which MN class-specific effector genes are either misexpressed (supporting the repressor model) or lost in specific MN classes (supporting the co-activator model). We initially chose two different reporter transgenes for our genetic screens: (1) a reporter for unc-129, a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-family member gene that is a direct target of UNC-3 (Kratsios et al., 2015Kratsios P. Pinan-Lucarré B. Kerk S.Y. Weinreb A. Bessereau J.L. Hobert O. Transcriptional coordination of synaptogenesis and neurotransmitter signaling.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 1282-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) expressed in DA and DB classes of cholinergic VNC MNs (but not VA, VB, and AS classes, where unc-3 actively promotes cholinergic identity yet is apparently not sufficient to induce unc-129 expression); and (2) a reporter for unc-53, a novel unc-3-dependent gene encoding a cytoskeletal protein expressed in DA and AS, but not VA, DB, or VB MN classes (Figures 4E and 4F). We mutagenized these reporter strains with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and screened ∼70,760 haploid genomes for expression defects of the unc-129 reporter and ∼4,500 haploid genomes for expression defects of the unc-53 reporter. In the ensuing section, we describe three distinct complementation groups identified from these screens. From the screen for unc-129::gfp expression defects, we isolated a mutant allele, ot721, in which unc-129 is ectopically expressed in VNC MNs other than those of the DA and DB classes (Figures 2A and 2B ). Another mutant allele, ot763, was retrieved in which unc-53::gfp is also ectopically expressed in VNC MNs (Figures 2G and 2H). ot721 and ot763 display similar phenotypes; in both mutant strains, ectopic expression of unc-129 is observed in VA and VB MNs, with similar penetrance and expressivity. ot721 and ot763 fail to complement each other, suggesting that both mutant alleles affect the same gene (Figures 2A and 2B). Through our previously described mapping and whole-genome sequencing pipeline (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we localized the molecular lesions of ot721 and ot763 to a previously uncharacterized C2H2 Zn finger-encoding gene (Figures S2A and S2B). This gene represents the sole ortholog of a Drosophila transcription factor called Disco and two paralogous human genes called Basonuclin 1 and 2 (BNC1 and BNC2; Figures 2C and 2D) (Vanhoutteghem et al., 2011Vanhoutteghem A. Bouche C. Maciejewski-Duval A. Hervé F. Djian P. Basonuclins and disco: orthologous zinc finger proteins essential for development in vertebrates and arthropods.Biochimie. 2011; 93: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and we therefore named the C. elegans locus bnc-1. Disco and C. elegans BNC-1 are likely repressor proteins based on the presence of a binding site for the corepressor protein CtBP and the ability of the fly Disco protein to physically interact with CtBP (Patel, 2007Patel, M.K. (2007). Disconnected, a C2H2 zinc finger protein has a role in appendage formation and gene regulation in Drosophila. PhD thesis (North Carolina State University).Google Scholar). The ot721 allele is defined by a mutation of a critical Zn coordinating cysteine in the second of the two C2H2 Zn fingers of BNC-1, whereas ot763 is defined by a premature stop codon before the Zn finger domains, thus constituting a likely null allele. The unc-129 expression defect of the bnc-1(ot763) mutant can be rescued by (1) a genomic sequence that exclusively encompasses the bnc-1 locus (1.8 kb upstream of the start codon to the stop codon) or (2) a construct in which the bnc-1 locus cDNA is specifically driven in cholinergic MNs under control of the unc-3 promoter (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2F; Figure S1A). We analyzed the expression of several different class-specific MN genes in bnc-1 mutants and found a coherent theme: all MN class-specific genes that are normally not expressed in VA and VB become ectopically expressed in VA and VB MNs of bnc-1 mutants. Apart from the DA/DB-specific unc-129 gene, this ectopic VA and VB expression applies to the gene reporters of unc-53 (DA/AS-specific), the DEG/ENaC channel unc-8 (DA/DB/AS-specific), and the nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) acr-16 (DB-specific) (Figures 2G and 2H). VA/VB-specific (del-1 and inx-12) or DB/VB-specific (acr-5) genes are not affected in bnc-1 mutants, and neither is the overall morphology of VA and VB MNs. Moreover, expression of genes shared by all cholinergic MNs (e.g., ACh pathway genes) is unaffected in bnc-1 mutants (Figures S1B–S1F). Taken together, bnc-1 appears to repress genes that are expressed in neither VA nor VB classes, and these MNs adopt a “mixed” identity in bnc-1 mutants due to derepression of these genes in VA and VB MNs (summarized in Figures 2I and 8A). By tagging the bnc-1 locus with mNeonGreen (mNG) using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome engineering, we find that bnc-1 displays a remarkably specific expression pattern. In both males and hermaphrodites, bnc-1 is almost exclusively expressed in VA and VB MNs (Figure 2E), indicating that it functions cell autonomously. Weaker expression is also observed in the SABV neuron pair (Figure S4A). The protein localizes exclusively to nuclei. bnc-1 expression is initiated around the postembryonic birth of VA and VB MNs at the late first larval (L1) stage and is maintained throughout the life of the animals. A similar expression pattern is observed with successively smaller reporter gene constructs: (1) a fosmid reporter in which bnc-1 is tagged at the C terminus, (2) the aforementioned rescue construct that contains sequences 1.8 kb upstream of the start codon all the way to the stop codon, or (3) a promoter fusion construct that only contains the sequence 1.8 kb upstream of the start codon (Figures 3D and 3E ; Figures S1G and S1H). The ectopic gene expression in VA and VB MNs of bnc-1 mutants depends on unc-3, since the ectopic as well as wild-type (DA and DB) expression of the unc-3 target unc-129 is lost in bnc-1; unc-3 double mutants (Figures 2A and 2B). We conclude that bnc-1 acts genetically to prevent unc-3 from activating target genes in VA and VB, and henceforth that bnc-1 loss results in VA and VB MNs acquiring a “mixed” identity where unc-3 can now activate target genes that are normally expressed in a more restricted, class-specific manner. Another allele retrieved from our screens, ot720, displayed a fundamentally distinct phenotype from bnc-1 mutants: unc-129 expression in DA and DB MNs is lost in these animals (Figures 3A and 3B). By whole-genome sequencing, we identified the molecular lesion of ot720 as a missense mutation in the previously identified T-box gene mab-9, the C. elegans ortholog of vertebrate TBX20 (Figure S2C) (Woollard and Hodgkin, 2000Woollard A.

From our screen for defects in unc-53 expression, we identified yet another mab-9 allele, ot788, in which animals lose unc-53 expression in DA MNs (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure S2D). mab-9 was previously described to be expressed in DA and DB MNs (Fox et al., 2005Fox R.M. Von Stetina S.E. Barlow S.J. Shaffer C. Olszewski K.L. Moore J.H. Dupuy D. Vidal M. Miller 3rd, D.M. A gene expression fingerprint of C. elegans embryonic motor neurons.BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Loss of expression of class-specific effector genes is consistent with the UNC-3 co-activator model (Figure 1D). However, we considered the alternative possibility that mab-9 acts as a repressor of bnc-1 expression in DA and DB MNs, based on the following: (1) the repressor function of mab-9 orthologs in other species (Formaz-Preston et al., 2012Formaz-Preston A. Ryu J.R. Svendsen P.C. Brook W.J. The Tbx20 homolog Midline represses wingless in conjunction with Groucho during the maintenance of segment polarity.Dev.

A Gro/TLE-NuRD corepressor complex facilitates Tbx20-dependent transcriptional repression.J. Proteome Res. 2013; 12: 5395-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), (2) the presence of an Engrailed homology motif in MAB-9 (Copley, 2005Copley R.R. The EH1 motif in metazoan transcription factors.BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and (3) the above-described repressive effect of bnc-1 on unc-129 and unc-53 expression. As a consequence, derepression of bnc-1 in mab-9 mutants may then result in loss of unc-129 and unc-53 expression. In support of this notion, genetically, we indeed find that in mab-9; bnc-1 double mutants, the loss of unc-129 expression in mab-9 mutants depends on bnc-1 (Figures 3A and 3B). Moreover, expression of bnc-1 is derepressed in DA and DB MNs in mab-9 mutants. This repressive effect of mab-9 appears direct, since deletion of predicted MAB-9 binding sites upstream of the bnc-1 locus results in ectopic expression of bnc-1 in DA and DB MNs (Figures 3D and 3E; Figure S1H). However, mab-9 not only represses the regulatory factor bnc-1, but it also represses three unc-3-dependent VA/VB-specific effector genes in DA and DB MNs, namely the DEG/ENaC channel del-1, the innexin inx-12, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor lgc-36 (Figures 3F and 3G; Figure S1I; summarized in Figures 3H and 8A). Hence, in analogy to our observations in bnc-1 mutants, we considered the possibility that the ectopic expression of VA and VB genes in DA and DB MNs of mab-9 mutants is a reflection of these genes now being available for activation by unc-3. We indeed find that ectopic del-1 expression is abolished in mab-9; unc-3 double mutants (Figures 3F and 3G). Since expression of DB/VB-specific acr-5 is unaffected in mab-9 mutants (Figure S1J), we conclude that mab-9 targets only genes that are expressed in neither DA nor DB MNs. Lastly, we asked whether mab-9 is not only required but also sufficient to block VA and VB gene expression. To this end, we ectopically expressed mab-9 cDNA in VA and VB MNs using the unc-3 promoter and find that VA/VB-specific del-1 is indeed turned off in these transgenic animals. Moreover, DA/DB-specific unc-129 becomes ectopically expressed in VA and VB MNs, apparently because ectopic mab-9 expression represses bnc-1, the VA/VB-specific repressor of unc-129 (Figures 3A and 3F; Figure S1K). The third complementation group isolated from our screens is defined by a single allele, ot718 (Figures 4A and 4F ). ot718 animals display an uncoordinated locomotory “coiler” phenotype that resembles a number of different unc mutants, including unc-55 mutants (Shan et al., 2005Shan G. Kim K. Li C. Walthall W.W. Convergent genetic programs regulate similarities and differences between related motor neuron classes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev.

UNC-55, an orphan nuclear hormone receptor, orchestrates synaptic specificity among two classes of motor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans.J.

Kim K. Li C. Walthall W.W. Convergent genetic programs regulate similarities and differences between related motor neuron classes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev.

Genetic transformation of the synaptic pattern of a motoneuron class in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1035-1043PubMed Google Scholar). We find that the expression of four unc-3-dependent effector genes, all expressed in DA and DB but not AS MNs (TGF-β family members unc-129 and dbl-1, nAChR acr-2, and potassium channel slo-2), becomes derepressed in AS MNs of unc-55 mutants (Figures 4A, 4C, and 4F; Figure S3A; summarized in Figures 4G and 8A). This ectopic expression depends on unc-3, as unc-55; unc-3 double mutants display no derepression (Figures 4A and 4F). VA/VB-specific del-1 is not derepressed in AS MNs of unc-55 mutants. Since mab-9, which represses del-1 in DA and DB, is also expressed in AS MNs (Fox et al., 2005Fox R.M. Von Stetina S.E. Barlow S.J. Shaffer C. Olszewski K.L. Moore J.H. Dupuy D. Vidal M. Miller 3rd, D.M. A gene expression fingerprint of C. elegans embryonic motor neurons.BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we tested whether unc-55 and mab-9 may work redundantly to repress del-1 in AS MNs. Indeed, del-1 is derepressed in AS MNs in unc-55; mab-9 double mutants (Figures 4A and 4F). We note that the expression of both DB-specific acr-16 and DB/VB-specific acr-5 is unaffected in unc-55 mutants (Figure S3B). Altogether, it appears that genes that are derepressed in AS in unc-55 mutants normally need to be expressed in the DA class (which is morphologically most similar to AS; White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the ventral nerve cord of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). bnc-1, mab-9, and unc-55 represent repressors that counteract unc-3 in a subset of MN classes. We set out to test whether other previously described repressors may operate in a similar manner. Specifically, the Prd-type homeobox gene unc-4 (UNCX in vertebrates) was previously shown to repress DB/VB features in DA/VA MNs; these features include synaptic connectivity patterns (White et al., 1992White J.G.

Both acr-5 and acr-16 are unc-3-dependent genes, and unc-4 also appears to counteract the activity of unc-3 in DA and VA MNs (Figures 4D and 4F). We note that the expression of DA/DB-specific unc-129 is unaffected in unc-4 mutants (Figure S3D) and conclude that unc-4 targets only genes that are normally expressed in neither DA nor VA classes. The homeobox gene vab-7, the ortholog of Drosophila Eve and vertebrate EVX, was previously shown to be expressed in DB MNs and to repress unc-4 expression in this class (Esmaeili et al., 2002Esmaeili B.

Although a number of subunits of the T9SS have been identified, we lack details on the architecture of this secretion apparatus. Here we provide evidence that five of the genes encoding the core complex of the T9SS are co-transcribed and that the gene products are distributed in the cell envelope.

https://openalex.org/W2569872650,"The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity."

Here we show that the Escherichia coli UbiD enzyme, which is implicated in ubiquinone biosynthesis, cannot be isolated in an active holoenzyme form despite the fact active holoFdc1 is readily obtained. Formation of holoUbiD requires reconstitution in vitro of the apoUbiD with reduced prFMN. Furthermore, although the Fdc1 apoenzyme can be readily reconstituted and activated, in vitro oxidation to the mature prFMN cofactor stalls at formation of a radical prFMN species in holoUbiD. Further oxidative maturation in vitro occurs only at alkaline pH, suggesting a proton-coupled electron transfer precedes formation of the fully oxidized prFMN. Crystal structures of holoUbiD reveal a relatively open active site potentially occluded from solvent through domain motion. The presence of a prFMN sulfite-adduct in one of the UbiD crystal structures confirms oxidative maturation does occur at ambient pH on a slow time scale.

The quality of the articles was assessed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Program.We included 32 articles from seven different countries. Two central themes were inductively developed from the analysis: (1) the treatment targets (i.e., symptoms and patients in context), and (2) a therapeutic tool-a relationship, specifically the core concept of the therapeutic relationship.Our results underline the difficulty in establishing a therapeutic alliance, the barriers to it, especially the risk that professionals, adolescents, and parents will not converse about treatment; although such a dialogue appears to be an essential component in the construction of a therapeutic alliance."

https://openalex.org/W2571385021,"In eukaryotic cells, two conserved protein kinases, Gcn2 and TOR complex 1 (TORC1), couple amino acid conditions to protein translation.

Because amino acids are the building blocks for protein translation, their intracellular availability is tightly coupled to translation rate. Limitation in amino acids triggers prompt responses that lead to reduction in general protein synthesis and selective expression of proteins required for adaptation of the stress condition (1Kimball S.R.

Activated Gcn2 phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) at serine 51 and converts it into an inhibitor of eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of eIF2.

Sch9 controls ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation and is the major effector of TORC1 in yeast translational control. It is phosphorylated directly by TORC1 at multiple sites at its C terminus, which is required for its activity. This TORC1-dependent phosphorylation has been used as a surrogate marker for TORC1 signaling activity in yeast cells (29Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V.

Recent studies in both yeast and mammalian cells suggest that amino acids signal TORC1/mTORC1 activation through leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS). 2The abbreviations used are: LeuRSleucyl-tRNA synthetaseaaamino acidsMEFmouse embryo fibroblast. It has been shown that the synthetase, upon loading with leucine, interacts with a GTPase complex formed by two Rag GTPases, RagA/B and RagC/D (Gtr1 and Gtr2 in yeast), and stimulates the formation of a RagA/B GTP-RagC/D GDP conformation. This unique GTPase complex then binds and recruits mTORC1 for activation on the cytoplasmic surface of the lysosome. Under leucine deprivation conditions, the switch from the RagA/B GTP-RagC/D GDP conformation to the RagA/B GDP-RagC/D GTP conformation inactivates the GTPase complex and, consequently, mTORC1 (22Bonfils G. Jaquenoud M. Bontron S. Ostrowicz C. Ungermann C. De Virgilio C. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase controls TORC1 via the EGO complex.Mol.

Although this model accounts for the role of leucine in stimulating TORC1/mTORC1 activation, it is unclear whether other amino acids utilize the same mechanism for TORC1/mTORC1 regulation. In the present study, we show that Gcn2, the effector kinase of uncharged tRNAs, is the major sensor of TORC1 for amino acid starvation in yeast. In the absence of Gcn2, TORC1 becomes unresponsive to amino acid deprivation. Our findings also suggest that the Gcn2-mediated TORC1 regulation is conserved in mammalian cells. leucyl-tRNA synthetase amino acids mouse embryo fibroblast. The establishment of Sch9 as a direct target of TORC1 in yeast S. cerevisiae allows the use of the TORC1-dependent phosphorylation at its C terminus as a surrogate marker for TORC1 signaling activity (29Urban J.

De Virgilio C. Amino acid deprivation inhibits TORC1 through a GTPase-activating protein complex for the Rag family GTPase Gtr1.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra42Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Utilizing this feature, we examined several nutrient-mediated kinases for their potential role in regulating TORC1 activity. The results revealed that the absence of several kinases, including Yck1, Yck2, and Vps34, reduced TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of Sch9 (data not shown). Interestingly, in cells deleted for GCN2, we found that TORC1-mediated phosphorylation of Sch9 was increased (Fig. 1A). This observation indicates that Gcn2 may be a negative regulator of TORC1 in yeast cells. Because Gcn2 is a key factor for mediating amino acid starvation response, we further examined whether Gcn2 mediates the down-regulation of TORC1 under amino acid starvation conditions. As shown in Fig. 1B, we found that when wild type cells were deprived of leucine or histidine, two metabolically distinct amino acids, the TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of Sch9 was rapidly reduced. In contrast, the phosphorylation was not affected by the starvation in gcn2 deletion cells, suggesting that Gcn2 is required for amino acid starvation-induced TORC1 down-regulation. Despite being unresponsive to amino acid starvation, TORC1 in gcn2 cells remained sensitive to rapamycin treatment and nitrogen deprivation (Fig. 1B). This finding indicates that Gcn2 is involved in sensing amino acid conditions for TORC1 regulation. To further confirm the role of Gcn2, we examined whether Gcn2 was required for amino acid starvation-induced autophagy, another TORC1-dependent process, which was assayed based on autophagic flux that leads to breakdown of the GFP-Atg8 fusion protein and release of GFP (39Cheong H. Klionsky D.J. Biochemical methods to monitor autophagy-related processes in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 451: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In wild type cells, we found that starvation of leucine or histidine induced the cleavage of GFP-Atg8, as did rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation. However, in gcn2 cells, the starvation failed to trigger the cleavage (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Gcn2 acts as the sensor of TORC1 for amino acid starvation. Previous studies have shown that, in response to amino acid starvation, Gcn2 functions in a complex that contains Gcn1 and Gcn20 to phosphorylate eIF2α (11Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. Association of GCN1-GCN20 regulatory complex with the N-terminus of eIF2α kinase GCN2 is required for GCN2 activation.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Gcn2 acts through the same mechanism for controlling TORC1, we examined the role of Gcn1 and Gcn20 in amino acid starvation-induced down-regulation of TORC1. We found that in gcn1 deletion cells, as in gcn2 deletion cells, TORC1-dependent Sch9 phosphorylation became insensitive to leucine or histidine starvation, whereas it remained sensitive to nitrogen deprivation and rapamycin treatment. In gcn20 deletion cells, the absence of Gcn20 partially blocked the effect of amino acid starvation on the Sch9 phosphorylation, resulting in delayed dephosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when the effect of gcn1 on TORC1 activity was assayed using autophagic flux-mediated breakdown of GFP-Atg8. However, in gcn20 deletion cells, amino acid starvation-induced breakdown of GFP-Atg8 was largely unaffected (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that Gcn1 is required for amino acid starvation-induced TORC1 down-regulation, whereas Gcn20 is partially involved. The effects of gcn1 and gcn20 deletions on TORC1 activity mirror those on eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). The partial effect of Gcn20 on TORC1 activity is consistent with its non-essential role for Gcn2 activity (14Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. GCN20, a novel ATP binding cassette protein, and GCN1 reside in a complex that mediates activation of the eIF-2 α kinase GCN2 in amino acid-starved cells.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of Gcn2 alone is sufficient to down-regulate TORC1, we examined TORC1-dependent Sch9 phosphorylation and autophagic cleavage of GFP-Atg8 in cells overexpressing an active Gcn2 mutant protein, Gcn2(E803V). The E803V mutation relieves the autoinhibition of Gcn2 kinase, rendering its activation independent of uncharged tRNAs (7Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G.

The tRNA-binding moiety in GCN2 contains a dimerization domain that interacts with the kinase domain and is required for tRNA binding and kinase activation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1425-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We found that the basal expression of Gcn2(E803V) from a galactose-inducible promoter was sufficient to block the Sch9 phosphorylation in cells grown under non-starving conditions (Fig. 3A). Under the same growth conditions, the autophagic cleavage of GFP-Atg8 was less sensitive to the basal expression of Gcn2(E803V). However, when the expression was increased by galactose induction, the cleavage was enhanced (Fig. 3B). The down-regulation in TORC1 activity was not observed in cells expressing a control vector or a kinase-dead version of Gcn2 (K628R) grown under the same conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). These results demonstrate that activation of Gcn2 alone is able to inhibit TORC1 signaling activity, indicating a direct role for Gcn2 in regulation of TORC1. Previous studies in yeast have shown that amino acids activate TORC1 through two Rag GTPases, Gtr1 and Gtr2. When amino acids are available, the two GTPases form a unique complex with Gtr1 in the GTP-bound state and Gtr2 in the GDP-bound state, which binds and activates TORC1 (22Bonfils G. Jaquenoud M. Bontron S. Ostrowicz C. Ungermann C. De Virgilio C. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase controls TORC1 via the EGO complex.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 105-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the Rag GTPase complex in sensing amino acid starvation, we examined whether expressing the active form of the GTPase complex is able to block starvation-induced TORC1 down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 4A, we found that expression of the active Gtr1-Gtr2 complex partially blocked histidine starvation-induced Sch9 dephosphorylation, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study (22Bonfils G. Jaquenoud M. Bontron S. Ostrowicz C. Ungermann C. De Virgilio C. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase controls TORC1 via the EGO complex.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 105-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, the active complex failed to prevent the autophagy cleavage of GFP-Atg8 in response to histidine starvation (Fig. 4B). This finding indicates that Gcn2, but not the Gtr1-Gtr2 complex, plays a major role in sensing amino acid starvation for TORC1 regulation. To determine the mechanism by which Gcn2 inhibits TORC1, we examined whether Gcn2 is able to affect the intrinsic kinase activity of TORC1. Accordingly, we assayed TORC1 kinase activity in vitro from wild type and gcn2 deletion cells after the cells were exposed to various starvation conditions. We found that TORC1 immunopurified from wild type cells after leucine or histidine starvation exhibited a reduced activity, as did the TORC1 kinase from cells treated with rapamycin (Fig. 5A). However, the reduction in kinase activity was not observed when TORC1 was immunopurified from gcn2 deletion cells after exposure to leucine or histidine starvation (Fig. 5B). These observations suggest that amino acid starvation inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TORC1 and that the inhibitory effect is mediated by Gcn2. Interestingly, although TORC1 signaling activity, as assayed by phosphorylation of Sch9 and autophagic cleavage of GFP-Atg8, was greatly reduced by nitrogen starvation (Fig. 1), its intrinsic kinase activity was unaffected by the starvation (Fig. 5A). This finding indicates that nitrogen and amino acid starvations affect TORC1 function through distinct mechanisms. The down-regulation of the intrinsic kinase activity indicates that Gcn2 may act through a direct modification of TORC1. As the first step to test this notion, we examined whether Gcn2 is able to interact with TORC1 using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Under normal growth conditions, we found that Gcn2 exhibited a weak interaction with Kog1, the unique component of TORC1. Upon starvation for histidine, there was a transient increase in the interaction, which occurred within 5 min after the onset of starvation but became barely detectable after 10 min (Fig. 6A). Similar results were obtained when the association of Gcn2 with Tor1 was assayed, which exists only in TORC1 (Fig. 6B). However, we did not detect any interaction between Gcn2 and Avo1 (Fig. 6C), the unique component of TORC2. These findings demonstrate that amino acid starvation is able to induce a transient interaction of Gcn2 with TORC1 but not TORC2. The physical association between Gcn2 and TORC1 raised a possibility that Gcn2, a serine/threonine kinase, is able to phosphorylate a component of TORC1 and regulates its activity. Because Gcn2 interacts with TORC1 but not TORC2 (Fig. 6), we surmised that the regulatory subunit of TORC1, Kog1, might serve as the target. To test this notion, we used an in vitro kinase assay to analyze the ability of Gcn2 to phosphorylate Kog1. Epitope-tagged wild type, active, and kinase-dead forms of Gcn2 were expressed in yeast cells, immunopurified, and used for phosphorylation of bacterially expressed recombinant Kog1. Due to the large size of Kog1, expressing the full-length protein in bacterial cells proved to be difficult. We thus expressed three fragments of the protein separately in bacterial cells corresponding to N-terminal (aa 1–637), middle (aa 638–1157), and C-terminal (aa 1158–1537) regions. The expressed proteins were purified and used as the substrates for the Gcn2 kinase. When incubated with lysates from cells expressing Gcn2-FLAG, the purified N-terminal region of Kog1 was found to bind with Gcn2-FLAG, indicating that Kog1 of TORC1 is the target of Gcn2 (Fig. 7B). When the kinase activity of Gcn2 was assayed, we found that the immunopurified wild type and active mutant Gcn2 were able to phosphorylate the N-terminal region but not other regions of Kog1 (Fig. 7C). In comparison with wild type Gcn2, the active form of Gcn2 exhibited a higher phosphorylation activity. In contrast, the kinase-dead mutant was incapable of phosphorylating any Kog1 fragments (Fig. 7C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Gcn2 is capable of binding and phosphorylating Kog1 in vitro, which supports the notion that Kog1 is the direct target of Gcn2. Because TORC1 and Gcn2 are highly conserved from yeast to humans, we examined the possibility that mammalian Gcn2 is also involved in mTORC1 regulation in response to amino acid starvation. Accordingly, we assayed mTORC1 signaling activity under leucine or histidine starvation condition in wild type and gcn2 null MEF cells. We found that leucine and histidine starvation induced a rapid decrease in mTORC1 activity in wild type MEF cells. However, in gcn2 null MEF cells, the leucine starvation-induced down-regulation in mTORC1 activity was partially prevented, and the effect of histidine starvation on mTORC1 was completely blocked (Fig. 8). As an energy-consuming process, translation is tightly regulated by amino acid availability. A key mechanism for sensing amino acid starvation involves uncharged tRNA-activated Gcn2. In this Gcn2-mediated mechanism, the only target of Gcn2 identified currently in both yeast and mammalian cells is eIF2α, which is phosphorylated directly by Gcn2 at serine 51 (41Pain V.M.

This article examines the functional involvement of ZO-1 in CXCL8/IL-8 chemokine expression in lung and breast tumor cells. ZO-1 small interfering RNA and cDNA transfection experiments emphasized regulation of CXCL8/IL-8 expression via a cytonuclear pool of ZO-1. Luciferase reporter assays highlighted a 173-bp region of CXCL8/IL-8 promoter that responded to ZO-1. Moreover, by using mutated promoter constructs, we identified a NF-κB site as critical in this activation. Furthermore, NF-κB pathway signaling analysis revealed both IκBα and p65 phosphorylation in ZO-1-overexpressing cells, and subsequent p65 silencing validated its requirement for CXCL8/IL-8 induction. Investigation of the functional implication of this regulatory axis next showed the proangiogenic activity of ZO-1 in both ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis assays. Finally, we found that non–small-cell lung carcinoma that presented a cytonuclear ZO-1 pattern was significantly more angiogenic that that without detectable cytonuclear ZO-1 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ZO-1 regulates CXCL8/IL-8 expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway and its p65 subunit, which subsequently modulates the transcription of IL-8. We also provide evidence of a newly identified regulatory pathway that could promote angiogenesis. Thus, our results support the concept that the ZO-1 shuttle from the cell junction to the cytonuclear compartment may affect both the intrinsic invasive properties of tumor cells and the establishment of the protumoral microenvironment. —Lesage, J., Suarez-Carmona, M., Neyrinck-Leglantier, D., Grelet, S., Blacher, S., Hunziker, W., Birembaut, P., Noël, A., Nawrocki-Raby, B., Gilles, C., Polette, M.

This study differentiates the impact of acute (procedural) and post-acute cerebrovascular embolic events (CVEs) on cognitive performance.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before, early and late after TAVI was performed to quantify embolic burden. Quantification of diffusion- and T1-weighted lesions, as well as white-matter and total brain volumes, as well as cognitive function testing (MMSE) were assessed in 28 patients with a medium follow-up period of 34 months.Procedural diffusion-weighted lesions were observed in 17 patients (61%), but demonstrated locoregional remnants only in a minority of patients in long-term follow-up (6.5%). Acute CVEs did not impact the trajectory of late silent brain infarctions (SBI), white-matter hyperintensities, and cerebral atrophy. Functionally, early CVEs did not affect cognitive function. In contrast, patients with ""new"" SBIs after TAVI had a trend to cognitive deterioration in long-term follow-up (""new""SBI: MMSE -1.4 / no ""new""SBI: MMSE +1.5, p = 0.067). Interestingly, only a fraction of these ""new"" SBIs evolved from procedural CVEs (22.2%).Aquired SBIs after TAVI, but not DW-CVE per se are associated with functional impairment long-term after TAVI. In the context of subacute thrombosis seen in TAVI prostheses, these findings set the stage for tailored stroke prevention and comprehensive surrogate endpoint definitions in neuroprotective trials."

Here we show that pancreatic depletion of SMAD7 resulted in age-dependent increases in β cell dysfunction with accelerated glucose intolerance, followed by overt diabetes. The accelerated β cell dysfunction and loss of proliferation capacity, two features of β cell aging, appeared to be non-cell-autonomous, secondary to the adjacent exocrine failure as a “bystander effect.” Increased Forkhead box protein 1 (FoxO1) acetylation and nuclear retention was followed by progressive FoxO1 loss in β cells that marked the onset of diabetes. Moreover, forced FoxO1 expression in β cells prevented β cell dysfunction and loss in this model. Thus, we present a model of accelerated β cell aging that may be useful for studying the mechanisms underlying β cell failure in diabetes. Moreover, we provide evidence highlighting a critical role of FoxO1 in maintaining β cell identity in the context of SMAD7 failure.

https://openalex.org/W2568023412,"Objective Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting joints. Elevated plasma levels of microRNA-223-3p (miR-223-3p) in patients with RA are implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. This study aimed to analyze the functional role of miR-223-3p in the pathogenesis of RA by overexpressing miR-223-3p in synovial cell lines. Methods Arthritis was induced in the RA model of SKG mice by injection of ß-glucan. The histopathologic features of joints were examined using hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. Plasma levels of miRNA were determined by panel real-time PCR analysis. Target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs in SKG mice were analyzed using miRNA target prediction algorithms. The dual-luciferase reporter system was used to evaluate the relationship between miR-223-3p and IL-17 receptor D (IL-17RD). The activity of miR-223-3p was analyzed by transfection of plasmid vectors overexpressing miR-223-3p into IL-17RD-expressing NIH3T3 and MH7A cell lines. Il6 and Il17rd mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. IL-17RD protein expression was analyzed by western blot analysis. Results We identified 17 upregulated miRNAs (fold change > 2.0) in plasma of SKG mice injected with ß-glucan relative to untreated SKG mice. Il17rd was identified as the candidate target gene of miR-223-3p using five miRNA target prediction algorithms. The transfection of plasmid vectors overexpressing miR-223-3p into NIH3T3 and MH7A cells resulted in the downregulation of Il17rd expression and upregulation of Il6 expression. Expression of miR-223-3p and Il6 mRNA in MH7A cells was upregulated; however, that of Il17rd mRNA was downregulated following TNF-α stimulation. IL-17RD expression in synovial tissues from SKG mice and RA patients was inversely correlated with the severity of arthritis. Conclusion This study is the first to demonstrate that miR-223-3p downregulates IL-17RD in both mouse and human cells; miR-223-3p may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA by downregulating the expression of IL-17RD and upregulating that of IL-6 in synovial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2569070325,"Background The cerebellum integrates proprioceptive, vestibular and visual signals for postural control. Cerebellar patients with downbeat nystagmus (DBN) complain of unsteadiness of stance and gait as well as blurred vision and oscillopsia. Objectives The aim of this study was to elucidate the differential role of visual input, gaze eccentricity, vestibular and proprioceptive input on the postural stability in a large cohort of cerebellar patients with DBN, in comparison to healthy age-matched control subjects. Methods Oculomotor (nystagmus, smooth pursuit eye movements) and postural (postural sway speed) parameters were recorded and related to each other and volumetric changes of the cerebellum (voxel-based morphometry, SPM). Results Twenty-seven patients showed larger postural instability in all experimental conditions. Postural sway increased with nystagmus in the eyes closed condition but not with the eyes open. Romberg’s ratio remained stable and was not different from healthy controls. Postural sway did not change with gaze position or graviceptive input. It increased with attenuated proprioceptive input and on tandem stance in both groups but Romberg’s ratio also did not differ. Cerebellar atrophy (vermal lobule VI, VIII) correlated with the severity of impaired smooth pursuit eye movements of DBN patients. Conclusions Postural ataxia of cerebellar patients with DBN cannot be explained by impaired visual feedback. Despite oscillopsia visual feedback control on cerebellar postural control seems to be preserved as postural sway was strongest on visual deprivation. The increase in postural ataxia is neither related to modulations of single components characterizing nystagmus nor to deprivation of single sensory (visual, proprioceptive) inputs usually stabilizing stance. Re-weighting of multisensory signals and/or inappropriate cerebellar motor commands might account for this postural ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2569285461,"Stipa grandis P. Smirn. is a dominant plant species in the typical steppe of the Xilingole Plateau of Inner Mongolia. Selection of suitable reference genes for the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is important for gene expression analysis and research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress responses of S. grandis. In the present study, 15 candidate reference genes (EF1 beta, ACT, GAPDH, SamDC, CUL4, CAP, SNF2, SKIP1, SKIP5, SKIP11, UBC2, UBC15, UBC17, UCH, and HERC2) were evaluated for their stability as potential reference genes for qRT-PCR under different stresses. Four algorithms were used: GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The results showed that the most stable reference genes were different under different stress conditions: EF1beta and UBC15 during drought and salt stresses; ACT and GAPDH under heat stress; SKIP5 and UBC17 under cold stress; UBC15 and HERC2 under high pH stress; UBC2 and UBC15 under wounding stress; EF1beta and UBC17 under jasmonic acid treatment; UBC15 and CUL4 under abscisic acid treatment; and HERC2 and UBC17 under salicylic acid treatment. EF1beta and HERC2 were the most suitable genes for the global analysis of all samples. Furthermore, six target genes, SgPOD, SgPAL, SgLEA, SgLOX, SgHSP90 and SgPR1, were selected to validate the most and least stable reference genes under different treatments. Our results provide guidelines for reference gene selection for more accurate qRT-PCR quantification and will promote studies of gene expression in S. grandis subjected to environmental stress."

Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar reveal a number of important new insights into the neural mechanisms that are responsible for attentional selection. We live in a cluttered world. It is hard to overestimate the sheer number of visual items that surround us, while typically only a few of them are relevant for guiding our actions. This is why we need attention, the key process by which the brain selects one or a few objects for processing in depth. The mental representations of the attended items become enhanced and elaborate in the cortex, while distracting stimuli are filtered out. In this issue of Neuron, Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar reveal a number of important new insights into the neural mechanisms that are responsible for attentional selection. Many of the insights about the neuronal processing underlying attention shifts have come from studies in the visual cortex of monkeys that were trained to direct their attention to some visual items while ignoring others. These studies revealed that neurons in the visual cortex are not only influenced by the stimulus in their receptive field but that there are also strong top-down influences associated with attention shifts. Researchers have proposed several candidate neuronal mechanisms for these attention shifts. First, studies have consistently shown that attention increases the spike rates of neurons encoding attended stimuli compared to non-attended stimuli (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar). The effect on firing rates has been observed in many, if not all, areas of the cerebral cortex, ranging from primary visual cortex to areas of the frontal cortex (Pooresmaeili et al., 2014Pooresmaeili A. Poort J. Roelfsema P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 6467-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Second, attention makes neural responses more reliable. The exact number of spikes fired to different repetitions of a visual stimulus is quite variable. This variability can be quantified using the Fano factor, the variance of the spike rate across trials divided by the mean. Attention reduces the Fano factor (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Third, attention reduces low-frequency correlations between neurons. The activity of groups of neurons tends to be positively correlated across trials. These slow correlations, termed “noise correlations,” impair visual discrimination performance under some circumstances, because shared noise cannot be removed by pooling information across neurons. Some studies suggested that a reduction of noise correlations is the primary source of improvements in attentional performance (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Lastly, researchers have suggested a critical role for attention-based increases in correlations at higher gamma frequencies (Fries et al., 2001Fries P. Reynolds J.H. Rorie A.E. Desimone R. Science. 2001; 291: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar), because they might enhance the impact of visual cortical neurons on downstream target areas. These proposed mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and the question of how much each of them contributes to attentional selection has not been fully resolved. Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar addressed these questions by investigating neuronal activity in the different cortical layers, which have distinct roles in visual analysis and attentional processing (Figure 1A). The bottom-up driving visual input from lower brain regions arrives in layer 4, whereas the top-down inputs associated with attention shifts tend to avoid layer 4. The superficial layers project to downstream cortical areas, whereas the deep layers project backward to upstream cortical areas as well as subcortically. The authors took advantage of this division of labor between the layers in area V4, a mid-tier visual area where activity is strongly modulated by attention. Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar also examined the contribution of two functionally defined subclasses of cells: broad-spiking (putative excitatory) and narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) cells as previous studies suggested that inhibitory neurons contribute strongly to attention shifts (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar had to overcome a number of technical challenges to identify the different layers in V4. They used laminar electrodes with multiple contacts along a single shaft that needed to be positioned perpendicular to the cortical layers, which is challenging in area V4 because it has a complex shape. They implanted a transparent artificial dura so that they could see the cortical surface and they obtained high quality laminar recordings of a part of V4 that sits on a narrow gyrus. Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar trained the monkeys to perform a task in which the animals monitored a stream of oriented visual stimuli (Gabor patches) presented at one location to detect a stimulus with a deviant orientation appearing with a high likelihood (Figure 1B). They tended to ignore another, distractor stream presented elsewhere because the deviant stimulus was much more unlikely to appear at that position. Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar observed a number of surprising findings that are of crucial importance for our understanding of the mechanisms of visual attention (Figure 1C). First, attention increased spike rates in all layers. Interestingly, the effect of attention was stronger on the firing rate of neurons in the input layers (layer 4) than in the superficial and deep layers. This contrasts with the laminar profile of top-down influences in lower-level area V1, which tend to be strongest outside layer 4 (Self et al., 2013Self M.W. van Kerkoerle T. Supèr H. Roelfsema P.R. Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 2121-2129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the study confirmed that the dominant effect of attention is an increase of firing rates of neurons that represent the attended location. Second, Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar found that the effects of attention on firing rates are largest in broad-spiking, putative excitatory cells, and weaker in narrow-spiking cells, which are putative inhibitory neurons. This finding represents another surprise, because some previous studies revealed strongest effects of attention in narrow-spiking neurons. Third, the influence of attention on the variability of neuronal responses, as measured with the Fano factor, were relatively modest and confined to broad-spiking cells in the superficial layers. Fourthly, Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar replicated previous findings that attention reduces noise correlations (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, Mitchell et al., 2009Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2009; 63: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), but in the present study this reduction was largely confined to the input layers of cortex and did not occur in the deep layers. This finding is problematic for theories that emphasize that attention works by reducing noise correlations, because a reduction in the output layers of cortex would be essential if downstream areas are to benefit from this effect. Finally, Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar observed no evidence for previously reported increases in high-frequency spike synchrony in the superficial layers of V4 if a stimulus is attended (Buffalo et al., 2011Buffalo E.A. Fries P. Landman R. Buschman T.J. Desimone R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Instead, attention caused a modest enhancement of beta- and gamma-band spike synchrony in the deeper layers. If the present results are combined with previous studies, it appears that the main effect of attention is an increase in firing rates across the different layers of area V4, which nicely dovetails with the generality of firing rate increases that occur across the entire cerebral cortex. The influence of attention on the correlations between neurons appears to depend on the exact task that the animal performs, which casts some doubt on the general importance of these effects for the ability to preferentially process important stimuli over less important ones. It is also of interest to compare the laminar profile of noise correlations in V4, with the strongest correlations in the input layers, to the laminar profile previously found in V1, where correlations in the input layers are close to zero (Hansen et al., 2012Hansen B.J. Chelaru M.I. Dragoi V. Neuron. 2012; 76: 590-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Apparently, spike-count correlations do not form canonical laminar patterns throughout the visual system but vary from area to area instead. Nandy et al., 2017Nandy A.S. Nassi J.J. Reynolds J.H. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar construct a simulation suggesting that neurons in the input layers are strongly correlated because of strong recurrent interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cells in these layers. They hypothesize that excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the superficial and deep layers have weaker interactions and, hence, weaker correlations. Although this model would explain the observed laminar profile of spike-count correlations, it remains to be tested whether the laminar correlation profile might also arise through differences in the correlation structure of bottom-up and top-down inputs into the different layers. The results of this study emphasize the benefits of simultaneously examining neuronal activity in the different layers of a visual area. Studies using implanted electrodes or single-electrodes may sample in a biased way from the layers and produce an incomplete view of the processing carried out by a particular area. Information about how attention modulates activity in different layers is also critical for the development of biologically plausible computational models of attentional processing. The laminar approach highlights the consistency of attention related spike rate increases and brings into question whether attention-related changes in spiking reliability or spike-count decorrelations are robust enough to mediate the enhanced visual processing that attended stimuli enjoy.

Real-time activity measurements of genetically identified neuroendocrine vasopressin neurons show they can anticipate osmotic challenges. In this issue of Neuron, Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017Mandelblat-Cerf Y. Kim A. Burgess C.R. Subramanian S. Tannous B.A. Lowell B.B. Andermann M.L. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar show that correlating these results with ongoing behavior and plasma osmolality points to the existence of brain networks that integrate exterosensory cues with interosensory signals to drive neuroendocrine output. Oxytocin and vasopressin hold historically prominent positions in neuroendocrinology, and they remain a major focus for investigation (Watts, 2011Watts A.G. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2011; 66: 174-204Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both are synthesized by magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons in the paraventricular (PVH) and the supraoptic (SO) nuclei and are released directly into the general circulation from terminals in the neural lobe of the pituitary gland. They target smooth muscle either in the vascular system (vasopressin) or in the uterus and myoepithelial cells in mammary glands (oxytocin). Vasopressin also acts on the kidney to retain water, and its increased secretion is a key component for counteracting the cellular dehydration that can follow increased ingestion of osmolytes (primarily sodium) in food and drink. A remarkable property of vasopressin neurons in dehydrated animals that subsequently drink water is that they decrease their activity before there are measureable changes in osmolality. This rapid fall in vasopressin release is conceptually similar to anticipatory cephalic phase autonomic responses. As opposed to reflex (or reactive) processes that follow changes in the target event, anticipatory endocrine responses precede the target event for the hormone. A particularly well-known example is the cephalic phase insulin secretion that occurs after eating a sweet-tasting food but before there is any increase in blood glucose resulting from nutrient absorption (Teff, 2011Teff K.L. Physiol. Behav. 2011; 103: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms that drive these anticipatory or reactive events are distinct and involve efferent networks which then engage the appropriate motor neurons. Determining the principal components of these anticipatory or reactive mechanisms requires carefully monitoring the temporal relationship between the kinetics of the stimulus and the firing patterns of the motor neurons that control the response. For neuroendocrine neurons, this means measuring changes in their activity with the same temporal resolution as the changes in stimulus kinetics, whether that is an appropriate physiological variable or an external sensory cue. Up until now this has been very difficult to achieve. Electrophysiological recording techniques are the gold standard for tracking neuronal responses and have many advantages for obtaining real-time measures of neuronal activity. But their value is constrained by the ability to identify the precise nature and location of the targeted neurons. This can be reasonably straightforward for neurons in the cerebral cortex or hippocampus, each of which have highly ordered and layered organizations. But it is a much greater problem for many hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons because of their location in small heterogeneously structured cell groups deep inside the brain. This has made it very difficult to record from pre-identified neuroendocrine neurons in awake-behaving animals. The fact that magnocellular neurons project directly to the neural lobe of the pituitary made their identification somewhat easier than other neuroendocrine neurons because they can be identified anti-dromically by electrically stimulating the infundibular stalk or the neural lobe. This technique was introduced almost 50 years ago and made magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons both accessible and identifiable. It enabled a cluster of pioneering neuroendocrine electrophysiological experiments (e.g., Dyball and Koizumi, 1969Dyball R.E. Koizumi K. J. Physiol. 1969; 201: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Lincoln and Wakerley, 1974Lincoln D.W. Wakerley J.B. J. Physiol. 1974; 242: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the nature of these preparations still limited experiments to those investigating end points that survived anesthesia (Lincoln and Wakerley, 1974Lincoln D.W. Wakerley J.B. J. Physiol. 1974; 242: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In a paper published in this issue of Neuron, Yael Mandelblat-Cerf and her colleagues at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School have now overcome the identity problem for neuroendocrine vasopressin neurons in awake-behaving mice (Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017Mandelblat-Cerf Y. Kim A. Burgess C.R. Subramanian S. Tannous B.A. Lowell B.B. Andermann M.L. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To do this, they use Cre recombinase under the control of the vasopressin gene to express either channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or the calcium sensor GCaMP6s specifically in SO or PVH vasopressin neurons (VPpp). This has permitted two types of measurements specifically from these neurons. First, they use light to control the firing rate of the vasopressin neurons, thereby identifying them on demand. Because the optic fiber use to deliver the light into the SO and PVH is physically attached to a recording tetrode (an “optetrode”), extracellular recordings can be made from identified vasopressin neurons in conscious animals. This technique might be considered the optogenetic equivalent of the original antidromic stimulation identification method. Second, using vasopressin gene-dependent expression of GCaMP6s, the authors were able to measure real-time calcium fluxes using fiber photometry exclusively in vasopressin neurons following a variety of different stimuli. The authors first show that the firing rate of VPpp neurons in water-restricted mice decreased significantly from pre-stimulus levels after a water delivery spout was presented (i.e., the extero-sensory water-predicting cue), but before the onset of drinking. Further reductions occurred as drinking progressed. Importantly, no such changes occurred in local neurons not identified by optogenic stimulation as being VPpp. Furthermore, decreases in plasma osmolality (the principal interosensory stimulus for VPpp neurons during dehydration) did not occur until well after the reductions in VPpp firing rates and, consistent with previous reports in rats (Watts, 2000Watts A.G. Horm. Behav. 2000; 37: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the onset of drinking. In another experiment, the authors trained freely moving water-deprived mice to drink from a water bowl. They then used fiber photometry to track changes in calcium fluxes in VPpp neurons as the animals approached and then drank from the bowl. Consistent with the optetrode experiments, presentation of the water bowl was followed by reductions in calcium fluxes in VPpp neurons. Impressively, these changes were not maintained if mice found an empty bowl or if they were not previously water deprived. Furthermore, there was no reduction in activity if the bowl had been previously associated with food presentation. Taking water with food (prandial drinking) is an integral part of the meal structure for many animals. Dry food presents a hydration challenge because significant amounts of water are required to facilitate digestion in the gut. And the food itself obviously contains osmoactive molecules, particularly salt. Prandial drinking can help alleviate these challenges. But the ability to anticipate hyper-osmolality by increasing vasopressin secretion to reduce water excretion at the time of eating or even before eating begins will also help, particularly if prandial drinking is not possible, as happens with some desert-dwelling mammals. To see if this occurred, food-restricted mice previously trained to take food from a bowl were offered chow in a variety of formats: small or large single pellets, or unrestricted access to the chow in a bowl. Non-food items of similar sizes acted as controls. When animals started to eat, VPpp neurons showed increased activity within seconds and notably before increases in plasma osmolality. Furthermore, the activity of VPpp neurons in animals offered single chow pellets quickly reduced once eating stopped. This did not happen in the bowl-fed animals when they stopped eating, presumably because of the greater osmotic challenge of the larger meal. The non-food items had none of these effects. Finally, the authors showed that the water-driven fall in VPpp neuronal activity in water-restricted mice could be classically conditioned to a neutral stimulus. In this experiment, a light was used as the conditioned stimulus to predict the arrival of the water 5 s later. These experiments show the rapidity with which VPpp neurons can both increase and decrease their activity in response to appropriate extrasensory cues that predict changes in osmotic state. The high degree of flexibility of these responses demonstrates that the rapid processing of exterosensory information has a major impact on the activity of VPpp neurons in a manner that is somewhat similar to conditioned autonomic or stress responses (e.g., Berretta, 2005Berretta S. Stress. 2005; 8: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of these experiments show the existence of integrative mechanisms in the brain that can rapidly modify the drive to VPpp motor neurons and other motor systems involved with these adaptive responses (Watts, 2001Watts A.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 357-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Presumably the outcome of this integration is based on the nature and magnitude of both exterosensory cues (e.g., the absence or presence of water or food in a bowl, or light cue as a CS) and the interosensory signals that reflect hydration state (plasma osmolality). The next step will be to figure out the nature of these integrative mechanisms, which brain networks are involved, and how this information is delivered to VPpp neurons. With this is mind, it is important to remember that the pioneering experiments in the 1960s and 1970s for the most part only showed that the activity of VPpp neurons is directly and tightly controlled by interosensory stimuli: blood osmolality, pressure, and volume. While clearly important, these techniques lacked the ability to track VPpp neurons in real time in behaving animals, and so they could not easily assess how extero-sensory information from the outside world impacted these processes. Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017Mandelblat-Cerf Y. Kim A. Burgess C.R. Subramanian S. Tannous B.A. Lowell B.B. Andermann M.L. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar have now used neuron-specific reporting technologies to demonstrate the impressive analytical power of recording techniques that permit the direct correlation of neural activity with stimulus kinetics. These results now open a window for us to begin understanding these complex underlying integrative processes. However, clarifying the distinct integration processes that link both anticipatory and reactive neuroendocrine/autonomic motor events with motivated behaviors will need more than measuring the activity of the key motor neurons. Perhaps the most important advances will come when the results from these types of neuron-specific recording experiments are coupled with those now being produced by the dramatic revolutions in neuroanatomical tracing, neuroinfomatics, and connectomics (e.g., Nassi et al., 2015Nassi J.J.

Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 39: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Only then will we be able to comprehend how animals connect changes in their internal state with their interactions with their environments in ways that enable adaptation, survival, and well-being (Watts, 2001Watts A.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 357-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

Anaerobic microbial processes in oxygen minimum zones cause a disproportionately large fraction of the loss of fixed nitrogen in the open ocean. Interestingly, though, there has been no indication of such nitrogen loss in the oxygen minimum zone of the Bay of Bengal. Bristow et al. quantify the abundance of microbial genes associated with N2 production to help resolve this enigma, finding that the Bay of Bengal supports denitrifier and anammox microbial populations that mediate low but significant N loss while at the same time allowing the trace levels of oxygen to support nitrite oxidation. If this oxygen were removed, nitrogen loss in the Bay of Bengal oxygen minimum zone could accelerate greatly.

Unnatural amino acids can be incorporated into target proteins by using a transfer RNA (tRNA)—aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair that adds an unnatural amino acid at an amber stop codon. The strategy has been used in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and for generating transgenic invertebrates. Chen et al. have succeeded in integrating a construct coding for the unnatural amino acid p -azido-phenylalanine (AzF) into the mouse genome. The artificial gene was transmitted to subsequent generations and caused no obvious physiological defects. Primary cells from adult transgenic mice incorporated AzF into a fluorescent reporter protein containing an amber codon. Similarly, the genetic code of zebrafish was expanded, and in vivo incorporation of AzF into reporter protein was achieved. This opens the potential to investigate the function of target proteins in living animals.

Short bunches of electrons are used extensively to yield information about the structure of materials and the dynamics of phase transitions. Traditionally associated, perhaps, with “big science,” the availability of accelerator beam time and the timing resolution of the pulses can be limiting factors for experimental studies. Huang et al. have developed a matchbox-sized all-optical electron gun in which a single terahertz pulse is injected into a copper waveguide. Synchronized with a photogenerated pulse of electrons, the terahertz pulse accelerates the electron bunch over high fields and with low energy spread so that they can be used for low-energy electron diffraction studies. Further developments could lead to the generation of ultrashort relativistic electron bunches and the prospect of miniaturized accelerators.

Many male beetles exhibit enlarged ornaments and weapons, which are believed to function in sexual selection. However, the size and degree to which these structures can develop in an individual is variable and dependent on nutrition. Ozawa et al. found that the nutritional effect on the size of the mouthparts of the broadhorned flour beetle is mediated by epigenetic modifying factors, such as histone deactylases and Polycomb group proteins. Silencing of one histone deacetylase (HDAC1) in the beetle larvae shrank the mandibles of the ensuing adults, whereas silencing of another (HDAC3) led to exaggerated mouthparts without much affecting other body parts. The results indicate that ornamentation in these beetles is under modular epigenetic control.

But it may soon be getting some unwanted attention as a symbol of many things that President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans don't like about government. For starters, the agency needs a hefty budget increase to continue preparations for the next constitutionally mandated decennial census in 2020. But that request goes against the Republican mantra of curbing government spending. More broadly, some social scientists worry that Trump's penchant for disregarding data and making up his own may clash with the agency's mission as a federal statistical agency. In addition, some of the questions it asks people have also irritated Republican legislators, who cite them as a prime example of government overreach into the private lives of their constituents. In particular, Congress seems likely to revive attempts to eliminate or make voluntary the American Community Survey, a 70-item questionnaire the bureau sends to 3.5 million homes each year."
