https://openalex.org/W2011450946,"SCHUELER1 has designated as the “hemicholiniums” a series of quaternary bases2 which exhibit an unusual kind of toxicity. Chemically they are characterized by the incorporation of a choline (or choline-like) moiety into a six-membered ring through hemiacetal formation. Their most striking pharmacological action is respiratory paralysis: this is central in origin and late in onset, and when the dose is not too large can be prevented by the administration of either eserine or choline. Schueler noted that hemi-cholinium intoxication presents several features reminiscent of poisoning by botulinus or tetanus toxin, and suggested that it might be due to interference with some cholinergic mechanism. We thought that a substance having such effects might be a specific poison of acetylcholine synthesis, and through Dr. Schueler's kindness we have been able to verify this notion with compound No. 3 of his series, here called HC3."

By using a thermal conductivity detector it has been possible to estimate amounts of product of the order of 10−8 mole; but this was the lowest limit which could be reached. In certain cases, however, it became necessary to detect 10−12 mole of a substance. The detector described below has been developed to meet this requirement. It is of wide applicability and is easily constructed."

https://openalex.org/W2069390113,"DEEP hypothermia of warm-blooded animals favours the survival of their organs. For example, in the rat at normal body-temperature the heart ceases to beat several minutes after opening the chest, whereas in the rat cooled to 15°C. by the closed-vessel technique cardiac contractions can be seen approximately 1 hr. after respiratory arrest1. The intestine removed from a hypothermic dog contracts spontaneously when re-warmed and retains this property longer than an intestine isolated from a normothermic dog2. We have shown that the heart continues to beat for a much longer period after opening the thorax in rats which have been severely chilled and then re-warmed to normal body-temperature than in rats at the same temperature which had not been previously chilled3."

https://openalex.org/W2031827331,"A MAJOR problem in toxicological analysis is the separation of the poison from metabolites and body constituents that are co-extracted. This problem is especially acute in cases of poisoning by alkaloids. One technique that is of great use in solving this problem is paper chromatography1–3. The next step in the analysis is the identification of the alkaloid by such techniques as ultra-violet spectrophotometry, micro-colour tests and observations of the form of crystals obtained with various reagents. Recently, Clarke and Williams4 have described a technique whereby 0.05 ml. of a solution containing 50 µgm. of alkaloid provides sufficient material for five hundred separate micro-colour and crystal tests. This quantity of alkaloid (50 µgm.) is about the amount most suited for initial purification by paper chromatography. We have, however, found difficulty in eluting the alkaloid from the chromatogram and concentrating the eluate into 0.05 ml. of solution without loss of alkaloid. A simple and highly efficient apparatus for accomplishing this operation is shown in Fig. 1."
https://openalex.org/W2081870434,"GRAFTS derived from ovarian tissue which has been treated with glycerol and frozen to, and stored at, − 79° C. are endocrinologically active but contain comparatively few oocytes1. The oocytes which survive freezing and thawing can mature and undergo ovulation even in subcutaneous grafts2; but it is not yet known whether they are capable of normal fertilization and development. An approach to this problem involves orthotopic grafting at the ovarian site of the ovariectomized or sterilized recipient and, ideally, the use of a graft from a genetically distinguishable donor so that the source of any offspring produced is not in doubt. With the animals at present available at this Institute the latter requirement implies interstrain ovarian homografting and has led us to consider possible methods of attenuating or suspending the immunological reaction evoked by such grafts."

https://openalex.org/W1552330781,"As part of an investigation at this Station into the reproductive physiology of sheep, a suitable light source was required for detecting traces of œstrogens on paper chromatograms of blood extracts. (Œstrogens have an absorption maximum near 280 mµ, and light near this wave-length gives maximum contrast when used for photographing them on filter paper. The mercury-vapour lamp is commonly used for this purpose, but its emission in this region is weak and a train of filters is required."

https://openalex.org/W2082379080,"IT is well known that many diseases produce a marked alteration in the level of the total serum protein. Furthermore, it has been shown by electrophoretic analysis that certain diseases bring about distinctive changes in the relative concentrations of the different serum proteins. In early active tuberculosis1 there is a rise in the γ-globulin fraction of the serum protein and a corresponding fall in the albuminlevel. As the disease progresses the α2-globulin concentration also increases and in advanced tuberculosis all the globulin concentrations are raised. In contrast, patients with nephrosis2 show an increase in the α2-globulin concentration which is usually associated with a decrease in the γ-globulin fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2027083775,"WE wish to report some preliminary findings obtained in the course of a rather extensive investigation into the nature of precursors of embryonic chick proteins (for some recent reviews, see refs. 1 and 2). In these experiments, amino-acids, chicken serum globulin and ovalbumin, labelled in their sulphur amino-acids with sulphur-35, were prepared. Torulopsis utilis was grown on sulphur-35 sulphate (obtained from Oak Ridge National Laboratory), according to Wood and Perkinson3; after extracting the yeast protein with organic solvents4 it was hydrolysed with a 1 : 1 mixture of 6 N hydrochloric acid and 90 per cent formic acid. The humin was removed by centrifugation, and a portion of the neutralized hydrolysate corresponding to 50 mc. of the original sulphur-35 sulphate was injected intraperitoneally into a laying White Leghorn hen in two doses, about five hours apart. Eight hours after the second injection the blood was withdrawn by heart puncture, allowed to clot and serum globulin prepared5. The oviduct was removed from the hen and ovalbumin prepared essentially as described by Steinberg and Anfinsen6. Both proteins were treated with cysteine at a pH of 8.0–8.5 to assure removal of all exchangeable sulphur-35, and were afterwards dialysed. Peptides were prepared by peptic hydrolysis of the ovalbumin and of the serum globulin. Aliquots of the radioactive amino-acids, ovalbumin, ovalbumin peptides, serum globulin or serum globulin peptides were counted as described for proteins, peptides and amino-acids7. Others were injected into the yolks of unincubated, embryonated White Rock eggs. The eggs were first swabbed with 70 per cent ethanol at the place to be injected; a small hole was made in the side of the egg, and 0.05–0.1 ml. of the radioactive solution containing 0.3–1.8 mgm. and 6,000–25,000 counts per min. was injected into the yolk. The hole was immediately sealed with paraffin, and the eggs were incubated at 38° C. under conditions of controlled humidity. Two to three dozen eggs were normally injected with one of the protein precursors. Starting with the fifth and ending on the ninth day after the injection, embryos were harvested and a number pooled. The mixture was homogenized for about 3 min. in a Potter–Elvehjem homogenizer in Ringer's or isotonic saline solution, made up to either 10 ml. (fifth and sixth days) or 20 ml. (seventh–ninth days) and precipitated by the addition of 40 per cent trichloroacetic acid, to a final concentration of 8 per cent. Dry protein powders were then prepared and counted to within 5 per cent of standard deviation, corrections for self-absorption and decay being made in each case7."

https://openalex.org/W2087062500,"IT is well known that protein deficiency causes considerable interference with endochondral calcification in growing rats, the growth of the epiphyseal plate and the formation of calcified trabeculae ceasing, the face of the plate being finally sealed off with bone1,2. Similar changes are seen after hypophysectomy3. In the case of the continually erupting incisor tooth of the rat, protein or amino-acid deficiency causes very slight changes, chiefly an interference with the calcification of the dentin4–6. Hypophysectomy induces very marked changes in the incisor, the chief defect being caused by the processes of eruption and incremental growth being differently affected. As a result, there is a relative overgrowth of dentin, the pulp cavity becomes smaller and later the formative end of the tooth is thrown into folds. Other degenerative changes also occur7,8."

1 report that the growth of drug-resistant pathogen micro-organisms grown on culture media irradiated with ultra-violet rays increased strikingly without the micro-organisms themselves being exposed to the action of irradiation. The experiments demonstrated that mainly in cultures containing protein, under the action of ultra-violet rays the oxidation-reduction potential showed an average decrease of 300 mV., whereas under that of X-rays the decrease was 100–110 mV.; at the same time the value of the redox capacity increased too. In order also to find an energetic explanation for the change of the metabolism of the micro-organisms cultured on irradiated medium the following tests were carried out on aerobic cultures of Serracia marcesens strains. The strains examined were inoculated into the medium irradiated with ultra-violet rays of a quartz mercury lamp for 3 hr., and simultaneously the increase of the cell count, the oxidation-reduction potential and prodigiosin production were measured."

https://openalex.org/W2066376770,"WHILE investigating the renal excretion of water and sodium by rats in response to intravenous infusion of isotonic saline1,2, it became desirable to consider some aspects of the renal tubular re-absorption of these substances3. We have attempted to do this by considering a model of the tubules based upon properties of a membrane the characteristics of which have already been studied. Some properties of frog skin have been described by Using and Zerahn4, and it seems that this membrane can act as a ‘sodium pump’, actively transferring sodium ions; the activity of the ‘sodium pump’ appearing as an e.m.f. of about 100 mV. across the membrane. The rate of water transfer may be regarded as dependent upon hydrostatic and osmotic pressure differences across the membrane and upon its permeability towater."
